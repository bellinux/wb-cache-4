Therefore, {{the potential for}} interference only existed when Galaxy 15 drifted into the line of sight of a ground uplink segment intended for another communications satellite operating on the same uplink frequency range {{in the path of}} Galaxy 15. The magnitude of the interference risk depended on a large number of variables, including the size of the uplink antenna used (the larger the antenna, the lower the risk to hit Galaxy 15), the location of the uplink and whether inside the Galaxy 15 footprint, and the onboard gain capabilities of the satellite proximate to Galaxy 15. Satellite operators devised a variety of strategies to mitigate the potential interference to their birds' downlink transmissions including, temporarily transferring uplinks to larger uplink antenna, deliberately off-pointing uplink antennas to put Galaxy 15 into the null, maneuvering the satellite being passed to maintain a minimum angular separation, increasing the satellite's gain sensitivity settings allowing a lowering of the uplink power needed and latterly moving the uplink to a location where Galaxy 15 had no <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> (i.e. Hawaii). These techniques were successfully able to reduce, mitigate and minimize for commercial satellite operations most interference potential during a Galaxy 15 fly by. Smaller sized stationary receive only sites, like those used by amateurs or SMATV which have a wider beam width reception potential, may have experienced interference, while for the most part commercial operators experienced no adverse effects from Galaxy 15 during its failure period thanks to the execution of the mitigation practices devised {{in the wake of the}} crisis.|$|E

40|$|Using a drone as {{an aerial}} base station (ABS) to provide {{coverage}} to users {{on the ground}} is envisaged as a promising solution for beyond fifth generation (beyond- 5 G) wireless networks. While the literature to date has examined downlink cellular networks with ABSs, we consider an uplink cellular network with an ABS. Specifically, we analyze the use of an underlay ABS to provide coverage for a temporary event, such as a sporting event or a concert in a stadium. Using stochastic geometry, we derive the analytical expressions for the <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> probability of the terrestrial base station (TBS) and the ABS. The results are expressed in terms of (i) the Laplace transforms of the interference power distribution at the TBS and the ABS and (ii) the distance distribution between the ABS and an independently and uniformly distributed (i. u. d.) ABS-supported user equipment and between the ABS and an i. u. d. TBS-supported user equipment. The accuracy of the analytical results is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that varying the ABS height leads to a trade-off between the <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> probability of the TBS and the ABS. In addition, assuming a quality of service of 90 % at the TBS, an <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> probability of the ABS of over 85 % can be achieved, with the ABS deployed at or below its optimal height of typically between 250 - 500 m for the considered setup.

40|$|The {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} uplink of all CDMA cellular systems is the relation between uplink noise rise and intended coverage. In link budgets, noise rise is usually simply handled as a constant contribution to the background noise in logarithmic scale, {{often referred to as}} interference margin. In practice, however, it is not constant. We model the uplink noise rise as a lognormal distribution, and investigate the impact to link budgets. Simulations and numerical calculations show that the uplink noise rise variance does not critically affect the <b>uplink</b> capacity and <b>coverage.</b> System feasibility and its relation to the uplink load is also discussed.

40|$|Recent {{regulatory}} changes {{proposed by}} the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitting unlicensed use of television white space (TVWS) channels present new opportunities for designing wireless networks that make efficient use of this spectrum. The favorable propagation characteristics of these channels and their widespread availability, especially in rural areas, make them well-suited for providing broadband services in sparsely populated regions where economic factors hinder deployment of such services on licensed spectrum. In this context, this paper explores the deployment of an outdoor Wi-Fi-like network operating in TVWS channels, referred to commonly as a Super Wi-Fi network. Since regulations governing unlicensed use of these channels allow (a) mounting fixed devices up to a height of 30 m and operation at transmit powers of up to 4 W EIRP, and (b) operation at transmit powers of up to 100 mW EIRP for portable devices, such networks can provide extended coverage and higher rates than traditional Wi-Fi networks. However, these gains {{are subject to the}} viability of the uplink from the portable devices (clients) to the fixed devices (access points (AP)) because of tighter restrictions on transmit power of clients compared to APs. This paper leverages concepts from stochastic geometry to study the performance of such networks with specific focus on the effect of (a) transmit power asymmetry between APs and clients and its impact on <b>uplink</b> viability and <b>coverage,</b> and (b) the interplay between height and transmit power of APs in determining the network throughput. Such an analysis reveals that (a) maximum coverage of no more than 700 m is obtained even when APs are deployed at 30 m height, and (b) operating APs at transmit power of more than 1 W is beneficial only at sparse deployment densities when rate is prioritized over coverage.

To realize this potential, advanced spacecraft technologies are required, such as <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> through high gain directive beams, onboard signal processing, and downlink beam hopping. Simultaneous worldwide <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> could be obtained via many narrow uplink antenna beams which collectively cover the earth field-of-view. When worldwide communications traffic is low volume, a reduction in space segment impact can be achieved by using a few narrow uplink antenna beams to provide the required service. To minimize delays, these beams must be able to rapidly point anywhere within the field-ofview to cover individual users who require a channel for brief communications. The agile antenna beams can be shared through demand assignment techniques. A multimode common transmission format can provide both data and control channels. The data channels are available at several rates to allow either full duty cycle data transmission or burst data transmission. With burst transmissions, a single beam can support multiple calls in a time division multiplexed fashion. The control channels are utilized in coordinating the use of satellite resources to efficiently meet the communications needs of the users.

40|$|Base station {{switching}} (BSS) during low {{traffic load}} can ensure {{significant reduction in}} energy consumption of a cellular network. However, {{it has been shown}} that BSS can result in loss of coverage, specially in the uplink. Hence, in this paper, we consider coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission and reception to compensate for the loss in coverage due to BSS. We formulate the BSS with CoMP as an optimization problem. We numerically compute the optimization problem and present simulation results that show significant improvement in <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> for BSS with CoMP. The improved coverage ensures more base stations can be switched off in BSS with CoMP in comparison to BSS without CoMP. Further, with suitable scheduling schemes, we show that BSS with CoMP does not result in significant loss in overall network throughput performance. Hence, BSS with CoMP can ensure in more energy savings without compromising on the network throughput performance...|$|E
30|$|Our {{main goal}} is to study and {{characterize}} the impact of power control and shadowing on the uplink performance. The effectiveness of shadowing compensation by power control {{is also in the}} focus. Shadowing may degrade the performance of modern HCNs that include both macro and low-power, small form-factor small cells, which have low antennas. In such environments, a significant impact of shadowing is to be expected. Shadowing specifically refers to variations in the signal strength over distances proportional to the length of an obstructing object (10 â€“ 100 meters) in outdoor environments and less in indoor environments [29]. Experiments have confirmed that typical shadowing effects can be modeled as log-normal [2, 29] and that distribution has thus been widely used to study the effects of shadowing [2, 29 â€“ 31]. Overall, power control schemes that alleviate shadowing in addition to path loss (i.e., PLSI) will undoubtedly have a beneficial effect on the <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage,</b> data rates, and power efficiency.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that in the downlink, the sources of {{interference}} are eNBs which are fixed in cellular networks, thus the scheduling scheme almost has no impact on the ICI once the frequency reuse scheme is determined. However, the uplink interfering sources are UEs which may be located anywhere in a cell. Moreover, in different scheduling periods, an uplink frequency band may be allocated to different UEs. As a result, the uplink interference will show great fluctuation, and the analysis of the downlink interference cannot be applied to analyze the uplink interference directly. In [13], the PDF of SINR in ad hoc networks is derived. Only one interferer is considered in this scenario, and the derived results may not be applied to cellular networks. The uplink ICI is investigated in [14] by generating amounts of samples and then drawing a histogram without deriving a closed-form expression. The <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> probability in cellular networks is derived in [15] when the power control scheme is involved, and all the nodes are assumed to be randomly placed.|$|E

40|$|In {{wireless}} systems, {{coverage and}} capacity {{is a major}} challenge especially in high buildings. The need to reuse the limited available spectrum results in cochannel interference. Cochannel interference is a very critical factor affecting system performance. It limits the <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> and capacity of wireless networks such as femtocells. Joint processing of the received signal among cochannel receivers has recently {{been shown to be}} very beneficial from an interference cancellation point of view. This paper proposes a femtocell based distributed antenna system (DAS) for uplink transmission in high buildings where distributed antenna units deployed on each floor of the building are connected to femto base stations (BS). The femto BSs can cooperate through joint signal processing for all cells in order to estimate the received signal, reduce cochannel interference introduced by frequency reuse among the femtocells and maintain high spectral efficiency. Analysis and numerical results show remarkable gains especially when interference cancellation is employed at each cooperative femto BS, leading to many more simultaneous users being supported on the same frequency and resulting in large capacity increase when compared with the traditional system with no interference cancellation technique...|$|E
40|$|The <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> and {{capacity}} of CDMA cellular systems are intracell and intercell interference limited. In this work, we propose a practical multihop based cellular network design {{to enhance the}} uplink performance.

Each of the two regions is allocated a separate frequency channel to enable practical implementation and reduce interference. Analytic results show that intercell interference in CDMA cellular systems can be reduced by more than 75 %. Moreover, a link budget analysis is performed to obtain coverage [...] capacity results with different receiver structures at the BS. Results show that with the single user detector (SUD) receiver, gains up to 100 % in area coverage are achieved with moderate to low user loads. Furthermore, deploying multiuser detection to combat intracell interference, the proposed multihop based design achieves very high gains exceeding 100 % in pole capacity and 300 % in area coverage per cell...|$|E
40|$|Cell Switch-Off (CSO) is {{recognized}} as a promising approach to reduce the energy consumption in next-generation cellular networks. However, CSO poses serious challenges {{not only from the}} resource allocation perspective but also from the implementation point of view. Indeed, CSO represents a difficult optimization problem due to its NP-complete nature. Moreover, {{there are a number of}} important practical limitations in the implementation of CSO schemes, such as the need for minimizing the real-time complexity and the number of on-off/off-on transitions and CSO-induced handovers. This article introduces a novel approach to CSO based on multiobjective optimization that makes use of the statistical description of the service demand (known by operators). In addition, downlink and <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> criteria are included and a comparative analysis between different models to characterize intercell interference is also presented to shed light on their impact on CSO. The framework distinguishes itself from other proposals in two ways: 1) The number of on-off/off-on transitions as well as handovers are minimized, and 2) the computationally-heavy part of the algorithm is executed offline, which makes its implementation feasible. The results show that the proposed scheme achieves substantial energy savings in small cell deployments where service demand is not uniformly distributed, without compromising the Quality-of-Service (QoS) or requiring heavy real-time processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequencies}} {{that are}} suitable for radio communication are a scarce resource {{and some of the}} licensed frequency bands are considered to be underexploited. The future visions comprehend using the spectrum more efficiently, but avoiding the interferences by the means of cognitive radios. A cognitive radio is a device that can observe the radio conditions of its surrounding environment, learn from this and use this information for adjusting its operation to {{the current state of the}} environment. One of the licensed frequency bands that have been opened for cognitive radio testing is the terrestrial TV band. The regionally or temporally free channels in the TV band are called the white space. This thesis discusses the white space network planning and the co-channel interference estimation. The co-channel interference is due to the Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) network. Especially this thesis has an emphasis on the rural wireless broadband application. The main focus is on a pilot case providing a fixed wireless broadband to a few locations in Kirkkonummi using the Espoo TV and radio mast. The starting point for the network planning is determining a free channel so that no interference is caused to the primary user of the frequency band, that is, the DTT network. After selecting the free channel, the downlink coverage and capacity is estimated with the network planning tool Atoll. Some of the white space studies made so far have indicated that the uplink connection limits the coverage of the network due to the co-channel interference in the base station antenna from the DTT transmitters. In order to investigate this issue, a Matlab estimation function to estimate the co-channel interference power will be introduced in this thesis. The estimation function is based on the ITU-R P. 1546 propagation model. The estimation function will be evaluated with the interference power measurements from three different locations, from Jokela, Pasila and Espoo. The co-channel interference will be used to estimate the <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> in the Espoo pilot and also to calculate the amount of usable channels based on the interference level. The network planning, added with the <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> estimation, will be evaluated with field tests. The most important conclusion in this thesis is that estimating the uplink limitation is an essential part of the white space network planning even with point-to-point connections. The estimation has its own challenges, but rather good results can be achieved with the existing propagation models with small changes. Furthermore it was found that using such devices in the white space band that are not designed for such purposes is challenging. In addition to the required cognitive capabilities, the white space devices demand a wide operation region to be able to use the best channels in the area. Also a good selectivity and strict emission mask are required to overcome the different interference scenarios in the white space band...|$|E
40|$|Ambient radio {{frequency}} (RF) energy harvesting {{has emerged as}} a promising solution for powering small devices and sensors in massive Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem due to its ubiquity and cost efficiency. In this paper, we study joint uplink and downlink coverage of cellular-based ambient RF energy harvesting IoT where the cellular network is assumed to be the only source of RF energy. We consider a time division-based approach for power and information transmission where each time-slot is partitioned into three sub-slots: (i) charging sub-slot during which the cellular base stations (BSs) act as RF chargers for the IoT devices, which then use the energy harvested in this sub-slot for information transmission and/or reception during the remaining two sub-slots, (ii) downlink sub-slot during which the IoT device receives information from the associated BS, and (iii) uplink sub-slot during which the IoT device transmits information to the associated BS. For this setup, we characterize the joint coverage probability, which is the joint probability of the events that the typical device harvests sufficient energy in the given time slot and is under both uplink and downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage with respect to its associated BS. This metric significantly generalizes the prior art on energy harvesting communications, which usually focused on downlink or <b>uplink</b> <b>coverage</b> separately. The key technical challenge is in handling the correlation between the amount of energy harvested in the charging sub-slot and the information signal quality (SINR) in the downlink and uplink sub-slots. Dominant BS-based approach is developed to derive tight approximation for this joint coverage probability. Several system design insights including comparison with regularly powered IoT network and throughput-optimal slot partitioning are also provided...|$|E
