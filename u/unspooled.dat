25|$|In {{producing}} the special, the only existing master 16mm prints {{of the original}} series kinescope films were removed from storage and brought to a Manhattan editing facility that Goodson-Todman Productions rented. There, company employees Gil Fates, Bob Bach, Pamela Usdan and Bill Egan worked round-the-clock for three days to compile the 90-minute special under deadline pressure from ABC network official Bob Shanks. In the process of viewing and editing the films for the special, they accidentally damaged or destroyed several kinescope films which spanned the entire run of the original series, including a few that {{did not make the}} final cut of the retrospective. In addition, some <b>unspooled</b> film remained on the floor after the group's rented time at the facility ran out. An April 1967 episode featuring Candice Bergen as the mystery guest was lost in its entirety, as was a June 1967 episode featuring both Betty Grable and F. Lee Bailey. Other episodes sustained only partial damage, such as a 1965 episode that is mainly damaged during the mystery guest appearance of Marian Anderson.|$|E
500|$|Tom Shone, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, praised the novel for its {{atypical}} qualities for Ellis, [...] "known for his orgies of violence". Shone asks [...] "Why {{is a new}} sequel to Less Than Zero... so moving?", noting the presence of [...] "feelings" [...] in the novel to be starkly different from Ellis' usual style. Touching on its personal qualities, Shone notes [...] "If Lunar Park <b>unspooled</b> the atrocities of American Psycho back to their source, Imperial Bedrooms pulls the thread further and reaches Less Than Zero". The emotive energy {{in the new book}} is traced back to the last pages of Lunar Park as well; fellow writer Jay McInerney observes that [...] "The last few pages of [...] are among the most moving passages I know in recent American fiction ... Bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book." [...] Vice observes that the [...] "final passages in both Imperial Bedrooms and Lunar Park pack a lot of emotional impact." [...] San Francisco Chronicle hails Imperial Bedrooms as [...] "the very definition of authorly meta: Ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can't write his way out of it, or else he is such a genius that he's created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself like some kind of Escher print." ...|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also {{praised the}} {{direction}} of the King's Landing story, and Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei, saying in his review [...] "Ms. Headey's performance was but one element in a sequence that, technically, ranks among the show's best. Miguel Sapochnik, who directed last week's battle-heavy episode, brought a different kind of precision and urgency to Sunday's installment. Cersei's scheme <b>unspooled</b> amid insistent strings and a series of shots — those vicious little birds taking out Pycelle, Lancel and the dwindling candle-fuse, Margaery's growing concern and rising tension in the Sept — that built inexorably to the High Sparrow's realization that he wasn't as smart as he thought." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly stated he felt the episode introduced new conflicts to look forward to in the next season, saying [...] "Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7." [...] Sarah Larson of The New Yorker wrote in her review, [...] "It's a beautiful image. Boats, clouds, sun, dragons, and two female ship captains, pointing their armada toward a Westeros ruled by a queen." [...] James Hunt of WhatCulture wrote in his review, [...] "What a way to go out. Season 6 has already proved to be a great season of TV, but it saved its best for last." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com called the episode, [...] "the best episode ever." [...] Brian Lowry of CNN wrote in his review for the episode, [...] "At this point it's hard to second-guess producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who, working with Martin, have created a series for the ages."

40|$|Notch signaling, {{involved}} in development and tissue homeostasis, is activated at the cell-cell interface through ligand-receptor interactions. Previous studies have implicated mechanical {{forces in the}} activation of Notch receptor upon binding to its ligand. Here we aimed to determine the single molecular force required for Notch activation by developing a novel low tension gauge tether (LTGT). LTGT utilizes the low unbinding force between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and E. coli ssDNA binding protein (SSB) (~ 4 pN dissociation force at 500 nm/s pulling rate). The ssDNA wraps around SSB and, upon application of force, <b>unspools</b> from SSB, much like the <b>unspooling</b> of a yoyo. One end of this nano yoyo {{is attached to the}} surface though SSB while the other end presents a ligand. A Notch receptor, upon binding to its ligand, is believed to undergo force-induced conformational changes required for activating downstream signaling. If the required force for such activation is larger than 4 pN, ssDNA will <b>unspool</b> from SSB and downstream signaling will not be activated. Using these LTGTs, in combination with the previously reported TGTs that rupture double stranded DNA at defined forces, we demonstrate that Notch activation requires forces between 4 - 12 pN, assuming an in vivo loading rate of 60 pN/s. Taken together, our study provides a direct link between single-molecular forces and Notch activation...|$|R

40|$|The {{author was}} {{commissioned}} to contribute a performative work and drawings to <b>Unspooling,</b> Artists and Cinema, a group exhibition at Cornerhouse, Manchester. Celebrating 25 years of Cornerhouse and produced {{as part of}} AND (Abandon Normal Devices) Festival, curators Andrew Bracey and Dave Griffiths presented an international group exhibition that straddled two bodies of reference – art and cinema. The author retold Val Guest's classic Manchester movie, Hell is a City on the opening night of the exhibition. In recent projects Lloyd has replaced films with his own stage presence and painted diagrams - with Last Tango in Paris, The Seventh Seal and Alexander Nevsky subjected to his remembered and imaginary re-description. Video documentation and drawings from this opening event, and from the book Wayne Winner's Arthouse Cinema, were installed in the gallery as part of <b>UnSpooling</b> - Artists & Cinema. Artists include: Cartune Xprez, David Claerbout, Elizabeth McAlpine, Harald Smykla, Juhana Moisander, Mario Rossi, Michaël Borremans, Ming Wong, Roman Kirschner, Sheena Macrae, Stefan Zeyen, Wayne Lloyd. A catalogue accompanies the exhibition, with essays by Dr Janet Harbord (Queen Mary, University of London), Professor Steve Hawley (Manchester Metropolitan University), and the curators Andrew Bracey and David Griffiths. The exhibition was previewed in AN (Oct 2010) and Flux Magazine (Autumn 2010), The Guardian (2 nd Oct. 2010) and The Times (2 nd Oct. 2010) and was reviewed in Art Monthly (no 341). <b>UnSpooling</b> – Artists & Cinema is a co-commission between Cornerhouse and Abandon Normal Devices, a regional festival of New Cinema & Digital Culture and forms part of WE PLAY– the Northwest's cultural legacy programme for the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympic Games...|$|R
