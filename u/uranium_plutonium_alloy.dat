40|$|The first {{fast breeder}} reactors, {{constructed}} in the 1945 - 1960 time period, used metallic fuels composed of <b>uranium,</b> <b>plutonium,</b> or their <b>alloys.</b> They were chosen because most existing reactor operating experience had been obtained on metallic fuels and because they provided the highest breeding ratios. Difficulties in obtaining adequate dimensional stability in metallic fuel elements under conditions of high fuel burnup led in the 1960 s to the virtual worldwide choice of ceramic fuels. Although ceramic fuels provide lower breeding performance, this objective {{is no longer an}} important consideration in most national programs. Mixed <b>uranium</b> and <b>plutonium</b> dioxide became the ceramic fuel that has received the widest use. The more advanced ceramic fuels, mixed <b>uranium</b> and <b>plutonium</b> carbides and nitrides, continue under development. More recently, metal fuel elements of improved design have joined ceramic fuels in achieving goal burnups of 15 to 20 percent.

40|$|After {{upgrading}} IRMM's {{mass spectrometric}} capabilities for certification measurements for <b>uranium</b> and <b>plutonium</b> using large sample sizes {{during the previous}} years, in 2006 - 2007 we focused on necessary improvements {{in the area of}} low-level isotopic analyses for <b>uranium</b> and <b>plutonium.</b> Improving low-level isotope mass spectrometry for <b>uranium</b> and <b>plutonium</b> at IRMM consisted of three steps. First a new thermal ionization mass spectrometer was acquired in order to have an instrument which can be upgraded with a "Multiple Ion Counting" (MIC) system. The second step of improvement was to implement the principle of "multi-dynamic" measurements for both <b>uranium</b> and <b>plutonium</b> measurements. This "multi-dynamic" measurement procedure provides an internal calibration of the MIC system and therefore circumvents the need for complicated inter-calibration routines. As a third step, a filament carburization procedure was implemented by which the ionization efficiencies for <b>uranium</b> and <b>plutonium</b> were improved by a factor of 3 and 10, respectively. Results for measurements performed on samples of previous NUSIMEP campaigns will be shown in comparison to results from various techniques employed by participating laboratories. JRC. DG.
