30|$|Distributed small {{hydropower}} (DSH) generation systems {{connect to}} the grid through a synchronous generator, similar to the conventional hydropower plant. The main differences are more flexible construction and less impact on the ecological system. In addition, DSH’s capacity is much smaller, and normally lower than 1  MW. Practically, synchronous generators in DSH rarely operate in an <b>under-excitation</b> mode, but mostly in an over-excitation mode with a high-power factor. Therefore, the excitation control is generally in a constant power factor control mode [32], which means the DSH will simultaneously inject active and reactive power into the system. It is therefore recommended to be Type P-IQ.|$|E
40|$|In a {{magnetic}} amplifier {{operating on the}} condition of the <b>under-excitation</b> voltage, the phenomenon called (”triggering” happens occasionally at the minimum load point of the magnetic amplifier, and this phenomenon is harmful to the normal performance of magnetic amplifier operation in a system. This paper presents the circuitry for {{a magnetic}} amplifier freed from ”triggering” and describes the experimental results. 　No triggering happens, if the magnetic cores are prevnted from the excessive resetting in the over-controlled condition. And, as an effective means for this pereventation, zener-diodes are used in the circuitry and the varisters are interconnected to support the desirable performances of the zener-diodes whenever the supply voltage is changed. The control characteristics are compared with those of the bared magnetic amplifier; and the calculated optimum characteristics are examined with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} possible {{sources of}} quantification errors in global {{cerebral blood flow}} (CBF) measurements by comparing pseudo continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) and phase contrast (PC) MRI in anemic, hyperemic subjects. All studies were performed on a Philips 3 T Achieva MRI scanner. PC and PCASL CBF examinations were performed in 10 healthy, young adult subjects and 18 young adults with chronic anemia syndromes including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. CBF estimates from single and two compartment ASL kinetic models were compared. Numerical simulation and flow phantom experiments were used to explore the effects of blood velocity and B 1 + on CBF quantification and labeling efficiency. PCASL CBF underestimated PC in both populations using a single compartment model (30. 1 ± 9. 2 % control, 45. 2 ± 17. 2 % anemia). Agreement substantially improved using a two-compartment model (- 8. 0 ± 6. 0 % control, 11. 7 ± 12. 3 % anemia). Four of the anemic subjects exhibited venous outflow of ASL signal, suggestive of cerebrovascular shunt, possibly confounding PC-PCASL comparisons. Additionally, sub-study experiments demonstrated that B 1 + was diminished at the labeling plane (82. 9 ± 5. 1 %), resulting in suboptimal labeling efficiency. Correcting labeling efficiency for diminished B 1 +, PCASL slightly overestimated PC CBF in controls (- 15. 4 ± 6. 8 %) and resulted in better matching of CBF estimates in anemic subjects (0. 7 ± 10. 0 % without outflow, 10. 5 ± 9. 4 % with outflow). This work demonstrates that a two-compartment model is critical for PCASL quantification in hyperemic subjects. Venous outflow and B 1 + <b>under-excitation</b> may also contribute to flow underestimation, but further study of these effects is require...|$|E
