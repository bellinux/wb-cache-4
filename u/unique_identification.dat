A registration process was initiated in 2009, {{when it was announced}} that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government-authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which <b>unique</b> <b>identification</b> marks and physical dimensions are recorded. After the evaluation, the horse is cold branded with its registration number and photographed. In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, {{when the}} Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) came to power, its {{chairperson}} Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the premiership to Manmohan Singh.

In 2008, {{opposition to a}} historic civil nuclear agreement with the United States nearly caused Singh's government to fall after Left Front parties withdrew their support.

Kent Police, for instance, refers to its numbers as force numbers and officers wear them on a velcro tab on their stab vest or on a badge attached to their shirt or tunic. Officers in all forces of the rank of inspector or above do not usually wear their numbers.|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, N. rajah is a {{relatively}} well known plant in Malaysia, especially its native Sabah. The species {{is often used to}} promote Sabah, and specifically Kinabalu National Park, as a tourist destination, and features prominently on postcards from the region. Nepenthes rajah has appeared on the covers of several popular Nepenthes publications, including Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (Kurata, 1976) and Nepenthes of Borneo (Clarke, 1997), both published in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. On April 6, 1996, Malaysia issued a series of four postage stamps depicting some of its more famous Nepenthes species. [...] Two 30¢ stamps, featuring N. macfarlanei and N. sanguinea, as well as two 50¢ stamps, [...] depicting N. lowii and N. rajah, were released. The N. rajah stamp has been assigned a <b>unique</b> <b>identification</b> number in two popular stamp numbering systems: Scott #580 and Yvert #600.

The FEIF was founded on May 25, 1969, with six countries as original members: Austria, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. France and Norway joined in 1971, and Belgium and Sweden in 1975. Later, Finland, Canada, Great Britain, USA, Faroe Islands, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia and Ireland became members, but Ireland subsequently left {{because of a lack}} of members. New Zealand has been given the status of [...] "associate member" [...] as its membership base is small. In 2000, WorldFengur was established as the official FEIF registry for Icelandic horses. The registry is a web database program that is used as a studbook to track the history and bloodlines of the Icelandic breed. [...] The registry contains information on the pedigree, breeder, owner, offspring, photo, breeding evaluations and assessments, and <b>unique</b> <b>identification</b> of each horse registered. The database was established by the Icelandic government in cooperation with the FEIF. Since its inception, around 300,000 Icelandic horses, living and dead, have been registered worldwide.

On the subject of federal spending and elections, previous empirical studies were not able to establish that members of Congress are rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district because of omitted variables bias. [...] Levitt and Snyder (1997) employ an instrument which circumvents this problem and finds evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents; they find that an additional $100 per capita spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote.|$|E
