40|$|Purpose A {{possible}} complication after total disc replacement (TDR) is subsidence, presumably {{caused by}} asymmetric implantation, implant <b>undersizing</b> or reduced bone quality. This study aims {{to quantify the}} degree of subsidence of an SB Charité TDR, and investigate whether <b>undersizing</b> is related to subsidence. Methods A custom developed software package (Mathworks) reconstructed 3 D bone-implant geometry. A threshold for subsidence was determined by comparing penetrated bone volume (PBV) and rotation angles. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibilities were calculated. Subsidence was correlated to <b>undersizing.</b> Results High inter- and intra-observer correlation coefficients were found for the method (R 2 ̆ 6 gt; 0. 92).

40|$|Recreational anglers {{fishing for}} tailor (Pomatomus saltatrix) around Perth, Western Australia, have {{expressed}} concern over declining catches during the early 1990 s. A total of 3949 <b>undersize</b> (below the legal minimum length of 250 mm), 1015 sub-adult and 143 adult tailor were tagged between November 1994 and August 1996 at 24 sites along 1200 km of Western Australian coastline. <b>Undersize</b> tailor were recaptured at lower rates than sub-adult tailor, and were, on average, at liberty for longer periods. Modelling indicates that fishers under-report <b>undersize</b> fish, probably because of the legal minimum length requirement, and that the natural loss rate is higher for <b>undersize</b> than sub-adult fish. The majority of recaptured <b>undersize</b> and sub-adult fish had moved < 25 kin, remaining in sheltered estuarine and marine areas. In contrast, recaptured <b>undersize</b> and sub-adult tailor that had become adults while tagged displayed behaviour consistent with a northward or offshore winter movement. Comparisons between tag returns and the annual commercial catch of tailor suggests that recreational fishers take {{the majority of the}} total catch of tailor in Western Australia.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of a research on the processing of <b>undersize</b> fraction, extracted from a stream of mixed municipal solid waste (MSW), into alternative fuel, in the process of bio-drying. The analysis was conducted with the use of an innovative EWA (Ecological Waste Ap-paratus) bioreactor adapted to carrying out aerobic treatment of waste in such processes as: composting, aerobic digestion/stabilization and bio-dry-ing of waste. EWA bioreactors have been designed and manufactured by AGRO-EKO spol. s r. o. from the Czech Republic. The subject matter of the analysis was <b>undersize</b> fraction, with par-ticle dimensions ranging from 0 to 50 mm, manufactured in the process of sorting (mechanical processing) of MSW. The main aim of the research was to assess suitability of the use of EWA bioreactor in the process of alternative fuel production from <b>undersize</b> fraction developed from mu-nicipal waste (in the process of accelerated bio-drying). Samples were collected between 2011 and 2012.

40|$|Stent sizing and {{apposition}} {{have been}} shown to be important determinants of clinical outcome. This study evaluates the mechanical effects of <b>undersizing</b> and oversizing of stents on endothelial wall shear stress (WSS) and vessel wall stress to determine a possible biomechanical mechanism of in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Three-dimensional computational models of stents, artery, and internal fluid were created in a computer-assisted design package, meshed, and solved in finite element and computational fluid dynamic packages. The simulation results show that the effects of various degrees of <b>undersizing</b> on WSS, WSS gradient, and oscillatory shear index were highly nonlinear. As the degree of <b>undersizing</b> increased, the heterogeneity of WSS became smaller. The WSS distribution for the 20 % <b>undersizing</b> was smooth and uniform, whereas the 5 % case was very heterogeneous. The combination of lower WSS and higher WSS gradient and oscillatory shear index in the 5 % undersized case may induce neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. Additionally, the oversizing simulation results show that the maximum intramural wall stress of the 20 % oversizing case is significantly larger than the maximum stress for the 10 % and zero oversizing cases. Edge stress concentration was observed, consistent with the restenosis typically observed in this region. This study demonstrates that proper sizing of stent is important for reducing the hemodynamic and mechanical disturbances to the vessel wall. Furthermore, the present findings may be used to improve stent design to reduce endothelial flow disturbances and intramural wall stress concentrations...|$|E

Prior to the development of this program, the design task was performed by use of a difficult-to-use spreadsheet program that required manual addition of rows and columns depending on the numbers of strap rows and columns of a given design. In contrast, this program is completely parametric and includes logic that automatically adds or deletes rows and columns as needed.

This study is applicable to ground-based adaptive optics coronagraphs operating at 90 % and higher Strehl ratios, {{as well as}} to some space-based coronagraphs with intrinsically higher Strehl ratio imaging. We utilize a second order expansion of the monochromatic point-spread function (written as a power spectrum of a power series in the phase aberration over clear aperture) to derive analytical expressions for the response of a `band-limited' Lyot coronagraph (BLC) to small, low order, phase aberrations. The BLC possesses a focal plane mask with an occulting spot whose opacity profile is a spatially band-limited function rather than a hard-edged, opaque disk. The BLC is, to first order, insensitive to tilt and astigmatism. <b>Undersizing</b> the stop in the re-imaged pupil plane (the Lyot plane) following the focal plane mask can alleviate second order effects of astigmatism, at the expense of system throughput and angular resolution. The optimal degree of such <b>undersizing</b> depends on individual instrument designs and goals. Our analytical work engenders physical insight, and complements existing numerical work on this subject. Our methods can be extended to treat the passage of higher order aberrations through band-limited Lyot coronagraphs, by using our polynomial decomposition or an analogous Fourier approach.

40|$|In-stent {{restenosis}} and stent thrombosis remain {{clinically significant}} problems for bifurcation lesions. The {{objective of this}} study is to determine the haemodynamic effect of the side branch (SB) on main branch (MB) stenting. We hypothesize that the presence of a SB has a negative effect on MB wall shear stress (WSS), wall shear stress gradient (WSSG) and oscillatory shear index (OSI); and that the bifurcation diameter ratio (SB diameter/MB diameter) and angle are important contributors. We further hypothesized that stent <b>undersizing</b> exaggerates the negative effects on WSS, WSSG and OSI. To test these hypotheses, we developed computational models of stents and non-Newtonian blood. The models were then interfaced, meshed and solved in a validated finite-element package. Stents at bifurcation models were created with 30 ° and 70 ° bifurcation angles and bifurcations with diameter ratios of SB/MB = 1 / 2 and 3 / 4. It was found that stents placed in the MB at a bifurcation lowered WSS dramatically, while elevating WSSG and OSI. <b>Undersizing</b> the stent exaggerated the decrease in WSS, increase in WSSG and OSI, and disturbed the flow between the struts and the vessel wall. Stenting the MB at bifurcations with larger SB/MB ratios or smaller SB angles (30 °) resulted in lower WSS, higher WSSG and OSI. Stenosis at the SB lowered WSS and elevated WSSG and OSI. These findings highlight the effects of major biomechanical factors in MB stenting on endothelial WSS, WSSG, OSI and suggests potential mechanisms for the potentially higher adverse clinical events associated with bifurcation stenting...|$|E
