40|$|The {{laboratory}} and full-scale experiments have been performed. The block diagrams {{of the river}} turbulence have been constructed. The mechanism of interaction bed and <b>underbed</b> flows has been revealed, the criteria characterizing the interaction and equality types of the mechanism for interaction {{of the bed and}} <b>underbed</b> flows have been constructed. The relations for design of the spatial-time and kinematic characteristics of the turbulence have been determined. The investigation results have been used in the domestic and foreign monographies and textbooks for students of the higher schools, in the educational-methodical film and in the lection course on the turbulence theory and hydraulic modelling.

40|$|The {{phenomenology}} of fuel particles segregation at {{the surface}} of fluidized beds during devolatilization is modeled. The beds {{are assumed to be}} at incipient fluidization in order to focus the attention on the segregation mechanism caused by the formation of endogenous bubbles of volatiles. These are generated during fuel particle devolatilization immediately after its <b>underbed</b> feeding to a fluidized-bed reactor, and are distinct from exogenous bubbles, which are always present in the bed under aggregative fluidization conditions. Submodels describing the volatile flow pattern, the volatile bubble formation, the vertical motion of the volatile bubble and of the fuel particle are developed and combined in a coherent framework. Results of extensive model computations are presented and discussed. Qualitative and quantitative features of the fuel particle and of the volatile matter segregation processes are assessed by looking at the time required for the fuel particle to become segregated, at the frequency of volatile bubble formation, at the amount of volatiles emitted in the bed prior to particle segregation on the top of it. The proposed framework should complement previous studies on the segregation of fuel particles in freely bubbling fluidized beds based on the effects of exogenous bubbles only...|$|E

40|$|To {{provide an}} {{empirical}} base for bed reallocation {{within a hospital}} planning jurisdiction in Canada, this article proposes a population-based method to measure the distribution of acute care beds for each district and the service load for each hospital. The measure for the bed distribution (BDI) {{is the number of}} beds per 1, 000 age-sex-adjusted number of residents in a district, while the service load of a hospital is measured by the number of persons being served per bed (SPI). The number of beds allocated to each district, or the number of persons served by each hospital, was estimated by applying the hospital service population model, which employs both relevance- and commitment-index methods. The method thus proposed was applied to Alberta data. It appears that both BDI and SPI measures are stable across the variation of methods or data sources, yet sensitive enough to detect changes over the years. Using these indexes, potentially over- or <b>underbedded</b> districts and over- or underloaded hospitals can be identified for further investigation so that possible reallocation of acute care beds among the hospitals may take place...|$|R
40|$|The for-profit nursing home's {{incentive}} to minimize costs has been maligned {{as a major}} cause of the quality problems that have traditionally plagued the nursing home care industry. Yet, profit-maximizing firms in other industries are able to produce products of adequate quality. In most other industries, however, firms are constrained from reducing costs to the point where quality suffers by the threat of losing business to competing firms. In the nursing home industry, competition for patients often does not exist because of the shortage of nursing home beds. As a result, one would expect that nursing homes located in areas where there is excess demand would spend less on patient care than homes located where the bed supply is relatively abundant. This hypothesis is tested using Wisconsin data from 1983. It is found that, in counties with relatively tight bed supplies, an additional empty bed in all the homes in the county will force each home to increase expenditures by $. 62 per day for each patient in the home. Overall, the average nursing home located in <b>underbedded</b> markets would spend $ 5. 12 more per patient day or about $ 240, 000 more annually (in 1983 dollars) if it were located in a market where it was forced to compete for patients. The implications for public policy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to demonstrate and promote the commercialization of coal-fired atmospheric fluidized bed combustion (AFBC) systems, with limestone addition for SO{sub 2 } emissions control and a baghouse for particulate emissions control. This AFBC system was targeted for small scale industrial-commercial-institutional space and process heat applications. A cost effective and environmentally acceptable AFBC technology in this size range would displace {{a considerable amount of}} gas/oil with coal while resulting in significant total cost savings to the owner/operators. In the Proof-of-Concept Phase, a 2. 2 x 10 {sup 6 } Btu/hr unit was installed and successfully operated at Cedar Lane Farms (CLF), a commercial nursery in Ohio. The heat from the fluidized bed was used to heat hot water which was recirculated through greenhouses for cool weather heating. The system was designed to be fully automated with minimal operator attention required. The AFBC system installed at CLF was an improved design that incorporated flyash/sorbent reinjection and an <b>underbed</b> feed system to improve limestone utilization. With these additions it was possible to lower the Ca/S ratio from {approximately} 3. 0 to 2. 0, and still maintain an SO{sub 2 } emissions level of 1. 2 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu when burning the same high sulfur Ohio coal tested at OARDC...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{involving}} the tubular furnace {{are in the}} process of identifying the ideal experimental coal-to-refuse derived fuel(RDF) ratio for use in the AFBC system. A series of experiments with this furnace has been performed to determine the possible chemical pathway for formation of chlorinated organic compounds during the combustion of various RDF sources. Phenol and chlorine appear to be likely reactants necessary for the formation of these compounds. The main goal of these experiment is to determine the exact experimental conditions for the formation of chlorinated organic compounds, as well as methods to inhibit their development. Work on the fluidized bed combustor has involved five combustion runs, in which a combustion efficiency of greater than 96 % and with a consistent CO{sub 2 } concentration of approximately 13 % was obtained. Modifications responsible for these improvements include the addition of the <b>underbed</b> fuel feed system and revision of the flue gas sampling system. New methods of determining combustion efficiency and percentage of SO{sub 2 } capture using TG techniques to analyze combustion products are being developed. The current outlook using this TGA/FTIR method is very promising, since previously obscured reactions are being studied. the analysis of combustion products is revealing a more complete picture of the combustion process within the AFBC system...|$|E
40|$|A 2. 2 million Btu/hr unit {{prototype}} AFBC {{system was}} installed in 1995 at Cedar Lane Farms, a commercial nursery in Ohio. The AFBC is in operation and is heating hot water for greenhouse temperature control. A team consisting of the Energy and Environmental Research Corporation, the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center of Ohio State University and the Will-Burt Company developed this technology with funding support from the Ohio Coal Development Office and the U. S. Department of Energy. The system is fully automated with little operator attention being required. Operating experience at Cedar Lane Farms has shown that only 2 hours per day of operation attention {{is required for the}} system. The system includes flyash/sorbent reinjection and <b>underbed</b> coal/limestone feed. These features provide for good limestone utilization; a Ca/S (in coal) ratio of 2. 5 will maintain an SO{sub 2 } emissions level of 1. 2 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu when burning high sulfur (3. 2 %) Ohio coal. A baghouse is used to control particulate emissions. Based on the success of the prototype unit, a design has been recently completed for a commercial size 10 x 10 {sup 6 } Btu/hr capacity range. Multiple AFBC units can be used to provide larger heat outputs. Potential coal-fired AFBC users include institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons, government), light industry (agricultural, food processing), commercial users (shopping centers), and large residential users (apartment complexes). 6 figs., 1 tab...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a model for}} the description of the homogeneous combustion of various fuels in fluidized bed combustors (FBC) at temperatures lower than the classical value for solid fuels, i. e., 850 °C. The model construction is based on a key bubbling fluidized bed feature: A fuel-rich (endogenous) bubble is generated at the fuel injection point, travels inside the bed at constant pressure, and undergoes chemical conversion in the presence of mass transfer with the emulsion phase and of coalescence with air (exogenous) bubbles formed at the distributor and, possibly, with other endogenous bubbles. The model couples a fluid-dynamic submodel based on two-phase fluidization theory with a submodel of gas phase oxidation. To this end, the model development takes full advantage of a detailed chemical kinetic scheme, which includes both the low and high temperature mechanisms of hydrocarbon oxidation, and accounts for about 200 molecular and radical species involved in more than 5000 reactions. Simple hypotheses are made to set up and close mass balances for the various species as well as enthalpy balances in the bed. First, the conversion and oxidation of gaseous fuels (e. g., methane) were calculated as a test case for the model; then, n-dodecane was taken into consideration to give a simple representation of diesel fuel using a pure hydrocarbon. The model predictions qualitatively agree with some of the evidence from the experimental data reported in the literature. The fate of hydrocarbon species is extremely sensitive to temperature change and oxygen availability in the rising bubble. A preliminary model validation was attempted with results of experiments carried out on a prepilot, bubbling combustor fired by <b>underbed</b> injection of a diesel fuel. Specifically, the model results confirm that heat release both in the bed and in the freeboard is a function of bed temperature. At lower emulsion phase temperatures many combustible species leave the bed unburned, while post-combustion occurs after the bed and freeboard temperature considerably increases. This is a well-recognized undesirable feature from the viewpoint of practical application and emission control...|$|E
40|$|The Manchester edrioasteroid {{pavement}} is a {{shell layer}} in mudrock from the Corryville Formation (U. Ordovician, Maysvillain). No {{previous studies have}} examined sediments that buried Cincinnatian edrioasteroid pavements. To address this problem, a 16 cm thick stratigraphic sample measuring 90 cm by 30 cm was collected with a plaster jacket, dried for 2 years, then encased in fiberglass for dry cutting into slabs 2 - 4 cm thick. These were hardened with epoxy and polished dry with sandpaper. A prepared slab was sent to Bruker AXS for analysis using the M 4 Tornado µ-XRF. Delicate colonies of bryozoans, embedded in mudrock were found below the block and collected separately. The sample contains three sedimentary units. The lowest unit (Unit 1) is based by a packstone with fragmental bryozoans, trilobites, and brachiopods (Zygospira and Rafinesquina). Gradationally overlying the packstone is a concretionary mudrock containing fossil fragments which grades upward into gray shale. This shale is laminated, bioturbated by pyrite-lined Chondrites, and contains silt-sized fossil fragments. The upper portion is a concretionary <b>underbed.</b> Unit 2 begins with a thin, discontinuous, calcisiltite disrupted by burrows. Next is a laminated shale with burrows similar to unit 1. This unit also contains silt-sized fossil fragments and pyrite-lined burrows. Unit 3 has a basal limestone containing bits of trilobite, columnals of Iocrinus, phosphatic brachiopod fragments, ostracods, and Rafinesquina. This horizon also preserves delicate fossils and associations, such as Ambonychia, Schizocrania, and edrioasteroids Streptaster and Carneyella attached to articulated, spar-filled Rafinesquina associated with concretionary zones. Evidence that the shelly limestone sub-units represent periods of low siliciclastic input followed by rapid burial include: 1) Development of underbeds and concretionary zones which require extended time near the sediment-water interface to form; 2) phosphate enrichment from the accumulation of broken and corroded phosphatic brachiopod shells; 3) mixed taphonomy suggesting periods of exposure beyond the lifespan of a single cohort; 4) spar-filled, edrioasteroid encrusted, Rafinesquina shells and intact delicate bryozoan colonies indicating repeated rapid burial of live communities...|$|E
