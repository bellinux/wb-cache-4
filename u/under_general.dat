5|$|Further to the south, near Rakowiec, lay a {{group of}} forts of the outer line. All had already been {{abandoned}} by the Poles in early September, and were captured by Russian infantry <b>under</b> <b>General</b> Muraviev without a fight. Forces <b>under</b> <b>General</b> von Strandmann captured Szopy and started attacking Forts 44, 45 and the fortifications around Królikarnia. Although von Strandmann's unit {{did not have a}} clear numerical superiority (2,900 Russians with six guns against 1,700 Poles with six guns), they quickly pushed back the Polish defenders. Soon dense black powder smoke covered the battlefield. Unable to determine the direction of Russian attacks, the Polish commanders believed that the aim of the main thrust would be delivered against the positions at Królikarnia.|$|E

The main forces of the Western Front were concentrated forward along the frontier, organized in three armies. To defend the Białystok salient, the front fielded the 10th Army, <b>under</b> Lieutenant <b>General</b> Konstantin Dmitrievich Golubev, supported by the 6th Mechanized Corps and 13th Mechanised Corps, <b>under</b> Major <b>Generals</b> Mikhail Georgievich Khatskilevich and Petr Nikolaevich Akhliustin.

5|$|In {{the last}} months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, <b>under</b> <b>General</b> Karol Świerczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin. Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles {{operated}} in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the 7th Mechanized Corps.

5|$|In the {{southeast}} corner of the country – the Ukrainian lands – the Polish forces were initially concentrated separately in three regions of the expected front, under Tadeusz Kościuszko, Michał Wielhorski and Prince Poniatowski himself. The Polish Crown army in Ukraine, led by Prince Poniatowski, and supported by Kościuszko, was about 17,000, 21,000 or 24,000 strong (Derdej distinguishes between the primary force of 17,000 and Prince Michał Lubomirski's reserve division, of 4,500). They were faced on this southeastern war theater with a nearly four times larger enemy army <b>under</b> <b>General</b> Mikhail Kakhovsky, who had about 64,000 men under his command.

The Targowica Confederates did not represent any real strength; and their attempts to gather popular support in Poland upon crossing borders failed miserably, with only few dozens joining at first; later the number would grow but not significantly, and even the Russians saw them as not having any military value, keeping them from frontlines.|$|E

They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often <b>under</b> <b>general</b> parks administrations.|$|E
