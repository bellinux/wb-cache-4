The Selbstfahrer′s roof can store up to ¾ - 1 tonne of grain (15-20 sacks, 50 kg each). An <b>unloading</b> <b>pipe</b> was also {{available}} for the Selbstfahrer, grain can be unloaded with it while harvesting. A grain tank was offered by Claas too. Per hour, the Selbstfahrer can harvest up to 4 t of grain. The Selbstfahrer was offered with or without a straw baler.|$|E

50|$|In S v Russell, Russell was an {{employee}} of the Department of Water Affairs. Together with his supervisor and co-workers, he was <b>unloading</b> <b>pipes</b> onto a lorry at a railway station. The workers were using an overhead crane, parked under the railway’s electric power lines. Because of the danger, the power had been switched off. While Russell’s supervisor and co-workers were away having lunch, the power was turned on again. A railway employee told Russell to warn the crane operator about this—that is, about the danger of operating a crane under a live electric wire—when the workers returned. Russell accepted this instruction without pointing out that he was not the supervisor, and failed to pass on the warning when loading resumed. This omission, constituting negligence, led to one death, as the crane touched the power line and the operator was electrocuted. Russell was convicted of culpable homicide and appealed to the High Court (then the Supreme Court), which held that the way in which Russell had apparently accepted the warning had created a potentially dangerous situation. That being the case, he had attracted a legal duty to pass on the warning. By failing culpably in this duty, he was clearly negligent. His conviction of culpable homicide was confirmed.|$|R
500|$|The {{second trial}} began in October 1768, when {{charges were filed}} against Hancock and five others for {{allegedly}} <b>unloading</b> 100 <b>pipes</b> of wine from the Liberty without paying the duties. If convicted, the defendants {{would have had to}} pay a penalty of triple the value of the wine, which came to £9,000. With John Adams serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a vice admiralty court, which had no jury and did not always allow the defense to cross-examine the witnesses. After dragging out for nearly five months, the proceedings against Hancock were dropped without explanation.|$|R
40|$|Summary- Worker piping, {{previously}} reported only {{in association with}} colony disturbance or queen lessness, was seen in undisturbed, queenright colonies. Workers piped by pressing the thorax to the comb, spreading the wings slightly and lifting the abdomen towards the wings, which vibrated notice ably as the bee emitted an audible wail. Pipers wandered throughout the hive for up to 2. 5 h, stopping every few seconds to emit a pipe, which lasted about 1 s. The sound showed little frequency modulation, and a fundamental frequency of 330 - 430 Hz. It appeared to be produced by wing muscle vibrations and to be loaded into the comb by pressing down the thorax. Of three workers whose experiences prior to piping were known, two had been foraging and one had been <b>unloading</b> water collectors. <b>Piping</b> in this context {{may serve as a}} foraging-related signal, although its receivers and the information it transmits remain unknown. worker bee I acoustic communication I foraging I pipin...|$|R
50|$|The Peace Pipe Line had {{two major}} {{supplies}} to Fox Creek, Alberta. A 12-inch line, coined the Deep Basin line, which originated from the Brassey field in BC {{and ran to}} LaGlace via Gordondale. From LaGlace, the Deep Basin ran straight south, (west of Grande Prairie), with gathering points and stations at Wapiti, Bald Mountain, Kakwa, then turned eastward across the Smoky River to gathering points and stations at Lator, Simonette and Tony Creek before terminating at Fox Creek. The second major route to Fox Creek originated in Red Earth and ran to Valleyview with gathering points and pump stations at Cranberry, Foster and Gilwood and consisted of two loop segments. The Valleyview to Fox Creek portion of the Peace was a 16-inch line. From Fox Creek, the Peace system went south to Edson Terminal via 12-inch line to connect to the TransMountain system and also delivered eastward to Edmonton on a loop system of a 12-inch and 20-inch lines with gathering points and stations at Windfall Jct, Whitecourt, and Glenevis. By the end of 1990, Peace Pipe Line’s system was directly serving 27 crude oil fields between Alberta and British Columbia and over 20 gas processing plants with seven truck <b>unloading</b> terminals. Peace <b>Pipe</b> Line was sold to Pembina Corporation on October 31, 1991.|$|R
