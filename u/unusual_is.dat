5|$|Sounds {{right fielder}} Caleb Gindl became the third player in team history to hit for the cycle when he {{accomplished}} the feat on July 10, 2011. Center fielder Logan Schafer garnered national media attention when he initiated a triple play on August 20, 2011, against the Omaha Storm Chasers. What made the rare occurrence even more <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> {{that the ball}} first bounced off Schafer's glove and head before landing in his glove for the first out. He then returned {{the ball to the}} infield where second baseman Eric Farris and first baseman Mat Gamel completed the triple play by stepping on their respective bases. With Money at the helm, Nashville ended the year with a 71–73 record, placing third in their division.|$|E
5|$|Three more eggs {{containing}} embryos {{from the}} same formation were described in 2016 by Wang et al. Though they noted that these eggs strongly resemble M. yaotunensis, they declined to refer them to any ootaxon lower than Elongatoolithidae because Macroolithus is not clearly defined and {{is in need of}} revision. The embryos within these eggs {{are some of the most}} well-preserved of any oviraptorids, providing new information on oviraptorid ontogeny. The specimens show a relatively shallow head which indicates that as oviraptorids matured, their skulls grew dorsoventrally (top-to-bottom) faster than anteroposteriorly (front-to-back). This growth pattern is unusual among theropods, but is also seen in derived ("advanced") tyrannosaurids. Also <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> that, even at this early stage of development, the nasal bones are fused. Coincidentally, tyrannosaurids also show fusion of the nasals early in development.|$|E
25|$|The Great Synagogue (1764–74) {{was built}} to replace a wooden synagogue of 1684. It is a Baroque structure, with a ground floor {{entrance}} and a high-ceilinged, second-story sanctuary. The flanking wings give the building a general configuration similar to the palaces and great manor houses of the Polish nobility of the era. The wings held women's prayer rooms. Also <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> the three-tiered copper roof that takes the general form of the unique wooden synagogues of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. The first official inventory of important buildings in Poland, A General View of the Nature of Ancient Monuments in the Kingdom of Poland, led by Kazimierz Stronczynski in 1844–55, describes the Great Synagogue of Włodawa as one of Poland's architecturally notable buildings.|$|E

25|$|The {{recollection}} of dreams is extremely unreliable, {{though it is}} a skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming. Women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men. Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall. Often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus. The salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, or <b>unusual,</b> <b>is</b> more easily remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled. A dream journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to outstanding artwork, Number 10 contains many exceptional {{pieces of furniture}} either owned by the house or on loan. One {{of the most striking}} and <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> the Chippendale hooded guard's chair already mentioned that sits {{in a corner of the}} entrance hall. To its left is a long case clock by Benson of Whitehaven. A similar clock by Samuel Whichcote of London stands in the Cabinet anteroom. The White State Drawing Room contains elegant Adams furniture. The Green State Drawing Room contains mostly Chippendale furniture including a card table that belonged to Clive of India and a mahogany desk that is thought to have belonged to William Pitt the Younger and used by him during the Napoleonic Wars. In {{addition to}} the large carpet previously described, the Pillared State Drawing Room also contains a marble-topped table by Kent. The State Dining Room contains an elegant mahogany sideboard by Adam.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Caritoux's {{victory in the}} 1984 Vuelta a España is quite {{extraordinary}} in that he won a Grand Tour as a second year professional which is quite unusual. However, even more <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> that, one week before the start, neither Caritoux or his team had any intention of actually riding the race. At that time the Vuelta started {{in the second half}} of April and the Skil manager Jean de Gribaldy had made a promise at the start of the year to the Vuelta organisers that his team would be on the start line. A promise he had forgotten about but the organisers had not, de Gribaldy was threatened with a £50,000 fine if the team did not ride, he had to scrape together a squad for the Vuelta at the last minute, this included the holidaying Caritoux, who was told to get to Geneva and then fly to Jerez de la Frontera in the south of Spain where the Vuelta was starting.|$|E

500|$|In the {{painting}} Virgin and Child with St. Anne the composition again {{picks up the}} theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as [...] "breathtakingly beautiful" [...] and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> {{that there are two}} obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.|$|E
500|$|Since her introduction, Ayane has {{remained}} a popular face of the series alongside her older half-sister. Ayane {{was described as a}} fan-favourite by GMR in 2003, and was called [...] "everyone's favorite purple haired ninja" [...] by GameAxis in 2006. [...] In 2012, Angelo M. D'Argenio of Cheat Code Central, listing Ayane among the top ten hidden characters in fighting games, noted that she [...] "is now one of the poster characters for both series, and it seems she becomes more popular by the day." [...] Regarding the preferences of Dead or Alive online multiplayer players, Official Xbox Magazine wrote in 2005: [...] "Of all the stats and figures, one of the most <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> a rating for the most popular characters in America, Asia {{and the rest of the}} world. At the moment, Ayane is the most popular character to use by a long way." [...] In QMI Agency's 2012 poll for the title of the Ultimate Fighting Game Champion, Ayane was the only DOA character to make the second round, as she defeated Morrigan Aensland before losing to Scorpion, the winner of the title. She was voted the DOA series' third most popular female character in Japan in the publisher Koei Tecmo's own poll in 2014, also placing fourth in another popular vote in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|More <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> {{the modern}} W engine (also {{known as a}} 'VV' engine to {{distinguish}} itself from the pre-war W engines) that has four cylinder banks arranged in a [...] "W" [...] pattern with two pairs narrowly arranged with a 15-degree separation. Even when there are four cylinder banks (that would normally require a total of eight individual camshafts), the narrow-angle design allows the use of just four camshafts in total. For the Bugatti Veyron, which has a 16-cylinder W engine configuration, the four camshafts are driving a total of 64 valves.|$|E

2500|$|Still Life with Quinces and Lemons (F383) is a {{study in}} yellow. [...] The {{painting}}, and even the frame, are in shades of yellow, ocher and brown. [...] The painting also has highlights in pink, red, green and blue. [...] A fine example of an Impressionist painting, Van Gogh dedicated the painting to his brother Theo for his guidance and introduction to modern art. Over the , Van Gogh painted criss-cross marks, evocative of Japanese calligraphy. [...] Adding a painted frame to a work of art was not unusual for painters of this time; Georges Seurat and Paul Signac also painted their frames. [...] What is <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> that the painted frame remained with the painting. [...] In most cases the original frames were replaced over the years to suit its owner's taste.|$|E
2500|$|Benton Fraser is {{the archetypal}} Mountie: dogged, polite, and compulsively truthful. The series often {{featured}} his rigid moral code being {{tested by the}} cynical realities of Chicago life. Being overly polite, Fraser's best known short quotes were [...] "thank you kindly"; when {{he found himself in}} trouble, an understated [...] "oh dear"; and, when faced with contradictory circumstances from other characters, an all-knowing and eloquently stated [...] "understood". More <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> his encyclopedic knowledge of trivia (attributed to his grandparents having been librarians) and a range of uncanny abilities. These include his ability to sniff and lick refuse from the streets to gain clues about crimes, the way he can fall into a dumpster or other waste heap and emerge completely spotless and unwrinkled, and the way many women he encounters fall madly in love with him, including his boss Margaret (Meg) Thatcher and Ray's sister Francesca. The fact that he rarely pursues any of the offers the ladies extend to him is part of his charm.|$|E
2500|$|His motets are {{varied in}} style. [...] Many are chorale motets, an {{exclusively}} Protestant {{variation of the}} motet, and these are written in German. [...] Almost all use the late Renaissance idiom of Lassus, with carefully controlled dissonance and smoothly flowing polyphony. [...] Some are simple and homophonic, and pay unusually close attention to text setting (interestingly, this was also a trend in {{the music of the}} concurrent Catholic Counter-Reformation, and represented a reaction against the music of the previous generations). [...] Others are written in the polychoral style related to the Venetian practice, with the important difference that there is no spatial separation of the choirs: the antiphonal parts are all within the group. [...] However the most <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> a collection from 1602 called Contrapuncti, which are early examples of fugues. [...] They are strictly contrapuntal, and include real answers; occasionally the points of imitation use stretto. [...] Each successive point of imitation uses as its text the successive verse of the chorale being set.|$|E

2500|$|The author {{states that}} [...] "As unusual {{as it is}} for a {{theological}} professor to have such charges preferred against him, what is even more <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> the fact that the two competing denominations were making overtures toward closer cooperation with hopes of their eventual merger." [...] According to A History of Wittenberg College, [...] "the 'trial' of Professor L. A. Gotwald at Wittenberg, in 1893, arose from fear that the liberal traditions of the college were threatened by a rising 'exclusive and conservative spirit' symbolized by Gotwald." [...] As the Gotwald heresy trial book put it, [...] "The 1890s were times when Lutheran were choosing between two identities—Lutherans who were adapting their teachings and practices to Protestant America following the lead of Dr. Samuel Simon Schmucker; and those who sought their role as maintaining the understandings of the Lutheranism of the Sixteenth Century Reformer Martin Luther. Both sides maintained they were true." [...] Professor Gotwald was defended at this trial by Judge Joseph W. Adair of Noble County, Indiana. At the conclusion of the trial, even the prosecutors joined in the unanimous vote for his acquittal.|$|E
2500|$|Da Vinci's Inquest {{is notable}} for its {{unconventional}} story formats. Unlike most crime dramas, many cases on Da Vinci's Inquest aren't fully explained, and some aren't even solved; often the episodes {{end with the}} resolution implied or even withheld entirely. Many of the show's fans hail this characteristic {{as one of its}} finest qualities. Also <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> its handling of story arcs. Some arcs span the length of one or more seasons, but aren't touched on at all for several episodes at a time, similar to the Mythology / Monster of the Week format of The X-Files (which was also a Vancouver production, though not {{at the same time as}} Da Vinci's Inquest); several main and many guest actors appeared on both shows. An exception to this is Season 7, which features at least three main plots that are addressed in every episode. Two episodes, Season 3's [...] "It's Backwards Day" [...] and Season 5's [...] "Pretend You Didn't See Me," [...] are notable for their extended opening takes, which follow Da Vinci as he walks around a location and speaks with multiple characters in one continuous, ten-minute shot; the former is also noted for playing out largely in real time.|$|E
2500|$|The critic Michael Watchel has {{suggested}} that Pushkin intended to produce a national epic in this poem, arguing that the Peter sections have many of the typical features of epic poetry. He points to Pushkin's extensive use of Old Testament language and allusions when describing both the founding of St Petersburg and the flood and argues that they draw heavily on the Book of Genesis. Further evidence for the categorization of Pushkin’s poem as an epic {{can be seen in}} its rhyme scheme and stanza structure which [...] allow the work to convey its meaning in a very concise yet artistic manner. Another parallel to the classical epic tradition can be drawn in the final scenes of Evgenii’s burial described as “for God’s sake.” In Russian, this phrase is not one of “chafing impatience, but of the kind of appeal to Christian sentiment which a beggar might make” according to Newman. Therefore, it is a lack of empathy and charity in Petersburg that ultimately causes Evgenii’s death. The requirement that civilization must have a moral order is a theme also found in the writings of Virgil. However, he adds that the Evgenii plot runs counter to the epic mode, and praises Pushkin for his [...] "remarkable ability to synthesize diverse materials, styles and genres". What is particularly <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> that Pushkin focuses on a protagonist that is humble as well as one that is ostensibly great. There are more questions than answers in this new type of epic, where “an agnostic irony can easily find a place” while “the unbiased reader would be forced to recognize as concerned with the profoundest issues which confront humanity”. He concludes that if the poem is to be labeled a national epic, it is a [...] "highly idiosyncratic" [...] one.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the second day, 10 December 1878, leaving Byrne in charge of the hostages, the other three started out to work. First they cut the telegraph wires, chopping the posts down to make sure, and were careful to destroy more wire than an ordinary repairer would carry with him. Three or four railway men endeavoured to interfere, but they too joined the other hostages in Younghusband's storeroom. Carrying a cheque drawn by McCauley on the National Bank for a few pounds, the three bushrangers, all heavily armed, went to the bank. (Kenneally relates that Hart who approached from the back ran into the bank's housemaid, Maggie Shaw, with whom he had been at school in Wangaratta.) In the meantime Byrne had unlawfully kidnapped a telegraph-line repairer, who had begun to make trouble. The others reached the bank after closing time, travelling in the hawker's cart. Kelly knocked at the door and forced the clerk to open and cash the cheque he had. They held up the unwise clerk and his manager, a Mr Scott. The robbers took £700 in notes, gold, and silver. Ned Kelly insisted to the manager that there was more money there, and eventually forced him to open the safe, from which the outlaws got £1,500 in paper, £300 in gold, about £300 worth of gold dust and nearly £100 worth of silver. The reported total amount stolen was 68 £10 notes, 67 £5 notes, 418 £1 notes, £500 in sovereigns, about £90 in silver; and a 30oz ingot of gold. The outlaws were polite and considerate to Scott's wife. Scott himself invited the outlaws to drink whisky with him, which they did. The whole party went to Younghusband's where the rest of the hostages were. The evening seems to have passed quite pleasantly. McCauley remarked to Kelly that the police might come along, which would mean a fight. Kelly replied, [...] "I wish they would, for there is plenty of cover here." [...] In the evening, tea was prepared, and at half-past 8, the outlaws warned the hostages not to move for three hours, informing them that they were going. Just before they left, Kelly noticed that a Mr. McDougall was wearing a watch, and asked for it. McDougall replied that it was a gift from his dead mother. Kelly declared that he wouldn't take it under any consideration, and very soon afterwards the four of the outlaws left. What is <b>unusual</b> <b>is</b> that these stirring events happened without the people in the town knowing of anything. The hostages left the station after five hours.|$|E

All became sensible that something <b>unusual</b> <b>was</b> going forward; and the unwonted distance which Charles maintained from his guests, while it added greatly to the dulness that began to predominate in the presence-chamber, gave intimation that something <b>unusual</b> <b>was</b> labouring in the King's mind.|$|R
