50|$|George W. Quinn, {{a runner}} with the battalion, was killed while {{attempting}} to reach Major Whittlesey on September 29, 1918 with a message from Whittlesey's adjutant, Lieutenant Arthur McKeogh, during operations by a detachment commanded by McKeogh. Whittlesey {{earlier in the day}} had sent McKeogh back about 150 yd with 15 men with light machine guns to silence German machine gunners who had cut communications between Whittlesey's battalion and the American rear during the night. The Germans were taking ground from which they could surround Whittlesey's men. McKeogh's <b>undelivered</b> <b>message</b> asked for a mortar to use against the strong German position. Quinn was found four months later to have killed three German soldiers who had mortally wounded him before he could reach Whittlesey.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) has been {{utilized}} for wireless sensor networks, mobile ad hoc networks, interplanetary networks, pocket switched networks and suburb networks for developing region. Because of these application prospects, DTNs have received attention from academic community. Whereas {{only a few}} {{state of the art}} routing algorithms in DTNs address the problem of aborted messages due to the insufficient encounter duration. In order to reduce these aborted messages, we propose a routing framework which consists of two optional routing functions. Specifically, only one of them is activated according to the encounter angle between pairwise nodes. Besides, the copies of the <b>undelivered</b> <b>message</b> carried by most of the nodes in the network {{are more likely to be}} cleared out after successful transfer, which reduces the number of unnecessary transmissions for message delivery. By means of the priority for message transmission and deletion in case of the limited network resource, the proposed algorithm achieves the high delivery ratio with low overhead as well as less number of aborted messages due to the insufficient encounter duration, thus is more energy efficient...|$|E

50|$|On January 13, 2017, The Guardian {{newspaper}} reported that security researcher Tobias Boelter {{had found that}} WhatsApp's policy of forcing re-encryption of initially <b>undelivered</b> <b>messages,</b> without informing the recipient, constituted a serious loophole whereby WhatsApp could disclose, or be compelled to disclose, the content of these messages. WhatsApp and Open Whisper Systems officials disagreed with this assessment. A follow-up article by Boelter himself explains in greater detail what he considers to be the specific vulnerability.|$|R

40|$|Consider a {{radio access}} network wherein a basestation is {{required}} to deliver a set of order-constrained messages {{to a set of}} users over independent erasure channels. This paper studies the delivery time reduction problem using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). Motivated by time-critical and order-constrained applications, the delivery time is defined, at each transmission, as the number of <b>undelivered</b> <b>messages.</b> The delivery time minimization problem being computationally intractable, most of the existing literature on IDNC propose suboptimal online solutions. This paper suggests a novel method for solving the problem by introducing the delivery delay as a measure of distance to optimality. An expression characterizing the delivery time using the delivery delay is derived, allowing the approximation of the delivery time minimization problem by an optimization problem involving the delivery delay. The problem is, then, formulated as a maximum weight clique selection problem over the IDNC graph wherein the weight of each vertex reflects its corresponding user and message's delay. Simulation results suggest that the proposed solution achieves lower delivery and completion times as compared to the best-known heuristics for delivery time reduction...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{broadcast}} based, service discovery protocols puts a significant {{strain on the}} delivery reliability of messages, particularly when {{a large number of}} devices simultaneously issue discovery requests. This usually results in undelivered discovery requests either requiring the requests to be issued again or the services remaining undiscovered. One of the principle courses of such message loss is the queuing mechanism used by the intermediate routers and/or any control points required to manage devices. This paper presents a significant analysis of the relationships between the different network devices to try to understand the causes of such message loss. In particular it will examine the different causes and how they influence each other. We present a formula which shows the relationship between the different causes of <b>undelivered</b> <b>messages.</b> This formula has been applied to the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol using simulated client and service applications written in C++. This paper provides researchers and network designers a mechanism for analyzing the potential performance of a network. It allows the impact of the relationships between the different causes for the non-delivery of messages to be taken into consideration when designing a network and applying protocols to that network...|$|R
40|$|An {{asynchronous}} {{algorithm is}} described for rapidly constructing an overlay network in a peer-to-peer system where all nodes can in principle {{communicate with each}} other directly through an underlying network, but each participating node initially has pointers to only a handful of other participants. The output of the mechanism is a linked list of all participants sorted by their identifiers, which {{can be used as a}} foundation for building various linear overlay networks such as Chord or skip graphs. Assuming the initial pointer graph is weakly-connected with maximum degree d and the length of a node identifier is W, the mechanism constructs a binary search tree of nodes of depth O(W) in expected O(W log n) time using expected O((d+W) nlog n) messages of size O(W) each. Furthermore, the algorithm has low contention: at any time there are only O(d) <b>undelivered</b> <b>messages</b> for any given recipient. A lower bound of Ω(d + log n) is given for the running time of any procedure in a related synchronous model that yields a sorted list from a degree-d weakly-connected graph of n nodes. We conjecture that this lower bound is tight and could be attained by further improvements to our algorithms. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the observation that traditional ad hoc routing protocols are not an adequate solution for messaging applications (e. g., e-mail) in mobile ad hoc networks. Routing in ad hoc mobile networks is challenging mainly because of node mobility—the more rapid the rate of movement, the greater the fraction of bad routes and <b>undelivered</b> <b>messages.</b> For applications that can tolerate delays beyond conventional forwarding delays, we advocate a relay-based approach {{to be used in}} conjunction with traditional ad hoc routing protocols. This approach takes advantage of node mobility to disseminate messages to mobile nodes. The result is the Mobile Relay Protocol (MRP), which integrates message routing and storage in the network; the basic idea is that if a route to a destination is unavailable, a node performs a controlled local broadcast (a relay) to its immediate neighbors. In a network with sufficient mobility—precisely the situation when conventional routes are likely to be non-existent or broken—it is quite likely that one of the relay nodes to which the packet has been relayed will encounter a node that has a valid, short (conventional) route to the eventual destination, thereby increasing the likelihood that the message will be successfully delivered. Our simulation results under a variety of node movement models demonstrate that this idea can work well for applications that prefer reliability over latency...|$|R
