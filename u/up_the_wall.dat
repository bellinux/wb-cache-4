5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> behind the band.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was told it would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E
5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E

25|$|Another {{particular}} {{feature of}} Romanesque buildings are corbel tables, a projecting moulded string course {{supported by a}} range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small arcade under the string course, the arches of which are pointed and trefoiled. As a rule corbel tables carries the gutter, but the arcaded corbel table was also used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> surface. In some buildings corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a parapet.|$|E
25|$|Fenestration on {{both side}} {{profiles}} consists of five large round-arched stained glass windows framed by molded limestone casings with bracketed sills.

Its entrance is a single door with round-arched window above and on the sides. Its lowest stage is a three-story masonry tower with wooden cornices separating the stories, topped by three frame ones above a curved cornice. The lower two are octagonal, one featuring a clock and the next louvered round-arched vents. The uppermost stage, the conical steeple, has ribs defining its eight facts and is covered with diamond-shaped wooden shingles. Kingston's city ordinances prohibit the construction of any building taller than its base in the Stockade District.|$|E
25|$|The revolutionaries are chased {{into the}} hills by an army {{detachment}} led by Colonel Günther Reza. John and Juan volunteer to stay behind with two machine guns and dynamite. Much of the army's detachment is destroyed while crossing a bridge, which is blown up by John. Colonel Reza, who commands an armoured car, survives. After the battle, John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan's father and children, {{have been killed by}} the army in a cave. Grief-stricken and enraged, Juan goes out to fight the army single-handed and is captured. John sneaks into camp, where he witnesses executions of many of his fellow revolutionaries by firing squad. They had been informed on by Dr. Villega, who has been tortured by Colonel Reza and his men. This evokes in John memories of a similar betrayal by Nolan, his best friend in Ireland. Nolan's betrayal forced John to kill him and two British soldiers, making him a fugitive and forcing him to flee Ireland. Juan faces a firing squad of his own, but John arrives and blows <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> with dynamite just in time. They escape on John's motorcycle.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, Jabiyev {{graduated}} from courses for junior lieutenants. He became a platoon {{commander in the}} 806th Rifle Regiment of the 235th Rifle Division. He fought in the Battle of Königsberg in April 1945. On 6 April, Jabiyev's platoon crossed the moat of Fort Five. The platoon cleared mines from the approaches, then blew <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and broke into the fort. The fighting lasted for days. On 8 April, Jabiyev reportedly raised the red flag on the main tower of the fort. He was wounded, but remained on the front, taking over command of the company. After the fort had been captured Jabiyev went to the field hospital. In subsequent street fighting in the city, the platoon {{was reported to have}} stormed several buildings, destroyed several German firing points, killed 100 German soldiers, and captured a large amount of equipment. Jabiyev reportedly killed eight German soldiers and captured thirteen. On 9 April, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his actions on 6 April. On 19 April, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin.|$|E

500|$|In retrospect, Corgan rued the {{decision}} to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. [...] "That drove Kenny <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow {{of what he was}} feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician." ...|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{was again}} arrested on 13 January 2004. Police {{said at the}} time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest {{followed}} new leads. These new leads were later reported to be a confession by Michael Wainwright, who claimed to have been a cellmate of Gordon's during his short prison stay in 1997. The police then revisited the site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of Westmorland green slate, a stone that matched the rocks that made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the family's bungalow. The case was brought to trial at Manchester Crown Court, and lasted ten weeks. There was no single piece of evidence that pointed to Gordon indisputably, but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together, it could only point at Park, and not a [...] "mysterious stranger or secret lover". Primarily, the case for the prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence, with the jury being asked to consider knots, rocks used to weight down the body and the ice axe, all linking Gordon Park to the crime. However, the statements of Michael Wainwright, and another of Gordon's cellmates, who had learning difficulties, were also used as evidence by the prosecution. He was sentenced to be jailed for life, and told that he must serve at least 15 years. The judge said that he had taken into account the [...] "terrible concealment" [...] of the body.|$|E
500|$|In September 1994, Levine, {{along with}} Mickey Madden, Jesse Carmichael, and Ryan Dusick, another Brentwood High student, formed garage band Kara's Flowers. The group played their first gig at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood, California, with Levine on vocals and guitar. In 1997, {{the band was}} {{discovered}} while they were performing at a beach party in Malibu by independent producer Tommy Allen. Allen, along with his partner John DeNicola, had the band record an 11-track album. Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles, they were signed on to Reprise Records through producer Rob Cavallo. In 1997, Kara's Flowers released their first album, titled The Fourth World. That same year, the band appeared on an episode of the drama series Beverly Hills, 90210. After their graduation, the band toured in support of their debut. Despite high expectations, the album had little success, selling about 5,000 copies, and its only single, [...] "Soap Disco", failed commercially. Finally, on Cavallo's exit from the label, Reprise decided to drop the band. [...] Disappointed {{with the results of}} their album, the band broke up. Later, Levine would say of the experience: [...] "Kara’s Flowers was just floating <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> beneath the sticks. Make a record quickly, put it out. No touring base, no nothing. Just try to make it happen right out of the gate and it just doesn’t work".|$|E

500|$|Mexican {{soldiers}} withdrew and regrouped, {{but their}} second attack was repulsed. Fifteen {{minutes into the}} battle, they attacked a third time. During the third strike, Romero's column, aiming for the east wall, was exposed to cannon fire and shifted to the north, mingling with the second column. Cos' column, under fire from Texians on the west wall, also veered north. When Santa Anna saw {{that the bulk of}} his army was massed against the north wall, he feared a rout; [...] "panicked", he sent the reserves into the same area. The Mexican soldiers closest to the north wall realized that the makeshift wall contained many gaps and toeholds. One of the first to scale the 12-foot (3.7 m) wall was General Juan Amador; at his challenge, his men began swarming <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Amador opened the postern in the north wall, allowing Mexican soldiers to pour into the complex. Others climbed through gun ports in the west wall, which had few defenders. As the Texian defenders abandoned the north wall and the northern end of the west wall, Texian gunners {{at the south end of}} the mission turned their cannon towards the north and fired into the advancing Mexican soldiers. This left the south end of the mission unprotected; within minutes Mexican soldiers had climbed the walls and killed the gunners, gaining control of the Alamo's 18-pounder cannon. By this time Romero's men had taken the east wall of the compound and were pouring in through the cattle pen.|$|E
2500|$|Hayman's first works after Hefner were {{an album}} with The French and an EP with The Stereo Morphonium. Both were {{electronic}} projects.

2500|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Templar Order, on 14 March 1319 (following the request of King Denis of Portugal), Pope John XXII instituted the Order of Christ. The Templar order had been suppressed during most of Europe from [...] 1312–1314, but in Portugal its members, assets, and partly its membership were transferred to the Order of Christ. The seat of the former Knights Templar was converted in 1357 into the seat of this new order. As a result, at about {{the first half of the}} 15th century, work was completed to adapt the Templar oratory, introducing an open choir to the western niche, about half-way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> What remains of this adaptation was the colonnade frame with interior arch. At the same time the main palace was constructed.|$|E
