40|$|Abstract—We {{attempted}} {{investigate a}} boat model, {{based on the}} conversion of energy of surface wave into a sequence of unidirectional pulses of jet spurts, in other words- model of the boat, which is thrusting by the waves field on water surface. These pulses are forming some average reactive stream from the output nozzle on the stern of boat. The suggested model provides the conversion of its oscillatory motions (both pitching and rolling) into a jet flow. This becomes possible due to special construction {{of the boat and}} due to several details, sensitive to the local wave field. The boat model presents the uniflow jet engine without slow conversions of mechanical energy into intermediate forms and without any external sources of energy (besides surface waves). Motion of boat is characterized by fast jerks and average onward velocity, which exceeds the velocities of liquid particles in the wave.

40|$|Northern gannets (Sula bassana) are {{considered}} to obtain prey usually by rapid, vertical, shallow plunge dives. In order to test this contention and investigate underwater foraging behaviour, we attached two types of data-logging systems to 11 parental northern gannets at Funk Island in the North-West Atlantic. We documented, for the ¢rst time to the authors ’ knowledge, gannets performing long, £at-bottomed, U-shaped dives that involved <b>underwater</b> <b>wing</b> propulsion as well as rapid, shallow, V-shaped dives. The median and maximum dive depths and durations were 4. 6 and 22. 0 m and 8 and 38 s, respectively. Short, shallow dives were usually V-shaped and dives deeper than 8 m and longer than 10 s were usually U-shaped, including a period at constant depth (varying between 4 and 28 s with median 8 s). Diving occurred throughout the daylight period and deepest dives were performed during late morning. On the basis of motion sensors in the loggers and food collections from telemetered birds, we concluded that extended, deep dives were directed at deep schools of capelin, a small pelagic ¢sh, and we hypothesized that V-shaped dives were aimed at larger, pelagic ¢shes and squids. Furthermore, these V-shaped dives allowed the birds to surprise their pelagic prey {{and this may be}} critical because the maximum swimming speeds of the prey species may exceed the maximum dive speeds of the birds...|$|E
40|$|Subarctic {{environmental}} changes {{are expected to}} affect the foraging ecology of marine top predators, but the response to such changes may vary among species if they use food resources differently. We examined the characteristics of foraging behavior of two sympatric congeneric diving seabird: common (Uria aalge : hereafter COMUs) and thick-billed (U. lomvia : hereafter TBMUs) murres breeding on St. George Island, located in the seasonal sea-ice region of the Bering Sea. We investigated their foraging trip and flight durations, diel patterns of dive depth, and <b>underwater</b> <b>wing</b> strokes, along with wing morphology and blood stable isotope signatures and stress hormones. Acceleration–temperature–depth loggers were attached to chick-guarding birds, and data were obtained from 7 COMUs and 12 TBMUs. Both species showed similar mean trip duration (13. 2  h for COMUs and 10. 5  h for TBMUs) and similar diurnal patterns of diving (frequent dives to various depths in the daytime and less frequent dives to shallow depths in the nighttime). During the daytime, the dive depths of COMUs had two peaks in shallow (18. 1  m) and deep (74. 2  m) depths, while those of TBMUs were 20. 2  m and 59. 7  m. COMUs showed more frequent wing strokes during the bottom phase of dives (1. 90  s − 1) than TBMUs (1. 66  s − 1). Fish occurred more frequently in the bill loads of COMUs (85  %) than those of TBMUs (56  %). The δ 15 N value of blood was significantly higher in COMUs (14. 5  ‰) than in TBMUs (13. 1  ‰). The relatively small wing area (0. 053  m 2) of COMUs compared to TBMUs (0. 067  m 2) may facilitate their increased agility while foraging {{and allow them to}} capture more mobile prey such as larger fishes that inhabit deeper depths. These differences in food resource use may lead to the differential responses of the two murre species to marine {{environmental changes}} in the Bering Sea...|$|E

50|$|Unlike hydrofoils, {{which use}} <b>underwater</b> <b>wings</b> or struts {{to lift the}} vessel clear of the water, {{standard}} jetboats use a conventional planing hull to ride across the water surface, with only the rear portion of the hull displacing any water. With {{the majority of the}} hull clear of the water, there is reduced drag, greatly enhancing speed and maneuverability, so jetboats are normally operated at planing speed. At slower speeds with less water pumping through the jet unit, the jetboat will lose some steering control and maneuverability and will quickly slow down as the hull comes off its planing state and hull resistance is increased. However, loss of steering control at low speeds can be overcome by lowering the reverse deflector slightly and increasing throttle - so an operator may increase thrust and thus control without increasing boat speed itself. A conventional river-going jetboat will have a shallow-angled (but not flat-bottomed) hull to improve its high-speed cornering control and stability, while also allowing it to traverse very shallow water. At speed, jetboats can be safely operated in less than 7.5 cm (3 inches) of water.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePlunge-diving is a {{specialised}} hunting tactic {{used by some}} avian predators {{to overcome}} the high buoyancy encountered near the water surface and surprise prey. However, plunge-diving is effective only to a certain depth; to access deeper prey, birds need to use an additional method of propulsion, e. g. wings or feet. We used miniature accelerometers to record {{the details of the}} aerial and underwater phases of plunge dives by northern gannets Morus bassanus. Birds never reached depths ~ 11 m using the momentum of the aerial part of the plunge dive and had to flap their <b>wings</b> <b>underwater</b> to gain additional depth. A biomechanical model demonstrates that little additional depth can be obtained from momentum alone when initiating a plunge from heights ~ 40 m. Thus, the additional energy required to attain greater starting heights is not rewarded by reaching significantly greater depths. However, by using their <b>wings</b> <b>underwater,</b> gannets were able to more than double the depth attained (up to 24 m). It appears that prey may be captured by surprise in the first 10 m of the water column, whereas wing-propelled pursuit is required to catch prey at deeper depths, a strategy likely to be used only for prey of sufficient profitability to justify the cost of flapping the gannet's large <b>wings</b> <b>underwater.</b> Our study demonstrates the importance of understanding the constraints placed on predators by the physical environment when interpreting predator-prey interactions...|$|R

40|$|The Decavitator is a human-powered {{hydrofoil}} water vehicle {{designed for}} the fastestpossible speed over short distances. Since 1988, numerous versions of the underwater hydrofoil system, control and stability system, and pontoons were built and tested. In its present configuration, the vehicle consists of two kayak-type pontoons, with a central frame supporting the rider and the large air propeller. Two <b>underwater</b> hydrofoil <b>wings</b> are positioned directly under the rider. The vehicle has three operating modes: on the hulls, on two wings, or on one wing. In the fastest one-wing mode, the Decavitator in October 1991 set an official speed record (pending ratification) of 18. 50 knots / 9. 53 m/s over a 100 -meter course, with an unofficial 19. 59 knots / 10. 08 m/s being the fastest measured speed to date.

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} are energy poor {{and should be}} designed to minimise the power required to propel them throughout their mission. The University of Southampton’s School of Engineering Sciences is {{actively involved in the}} development of improved designs for aerial and maritime autonomous vehicles. The ability to adapt or ‘morph’ their shape in-flight offers an opportunity to extend mission range/duration and improve agility. The practical implementation of such systems at small scale requires detailed consideration of the number, mass and power requirements of the individual actuation elements. Three approaches for minimising actuation requirements are considered. The first uses a combination of push-pull actuators coupled with a snap-through composite lay-up to achieve alterations in shape. It is proposed that such a system could be applied to the trailing edge of an autonomous <b>underwater</b> glider <b>wing</b> instead of the more usual servo operated trailing edge flap. The anisotropy achieved through use of different composite ply orientations and stacking {{can also be used to}} generate bend-twist coupling such that fluid dynamic loads induce ‘passive’ shape adaptation. The third approach uses a detailed understanding of the structural response of buckled elements to applied control moments to deform a complete wing. At this stage of the research no definitive conclusions have been drawn other than that all three approaches show sufficient promise and can now be applied to one of the autonomous vehicles...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. A {{number of}} bird species swim <b>underwater</b> by <b>wing</b> propulsion. Both among and within species, thrust {{generated}} during the recovery phase (upstroke) varies from almost none {{to more than}} during the power phase (downstroke). More uneven thrust and unsteady speed may increase swimming costs because of greater inertial work to accelerate the body fuselage (head and trunk), especially when buoyant resistance is high during descent. I investigated these effects by varying relative fuselage speed during upstroke vs. downstroke in a model for wing-pro-pelled murres which descend at relatively constant mean speed. As buoyant resis-tance declined with depth, the model varied stroke frequency and glide duration to maintain constant mean descent speed, stroke duration, and work per stroke. When mean fuselage speed during the upstroke was only 18 % of that during the downstroke, stroke frequency was constant with no gliding, so that power output was unchanged throughout descent. When mean upstroke speed of the fuselage was raised to 40 % and 73 % of mean downstroke speed, stroke frequency declined and gliding increased, so that power output decreased rapidly with increasing depth. Greater inertial work with more unequal fuselage speeds was a minor con-tributor to differences in swimming costs. Instead, lower speeds during upstrokes required higher speeds during downstrokes to maintain the same mean speed, resulting in nonlinear increases in drag at greater fuselage speeds during the power phase. When fuselage speed was relatively higher during upstrokes, lower net drag at the same mean speed increased the ability to glide between strokes, thereby decreasing the cost of swimming...|$|R
40|$|At {{the present}} time several hundred hydrofoilcraft are in service {{throughout}} the world. The upsurge {{in the use of}} these craft did not really begin until the late 1950 s, although fascination with the idea of supporting small boats with <b>underwater</b> <b>wings</b> dates well back into the nineteenth century. About the turn of the century, hydrofoil flight was achieved, to be followed in a few years by Bell and Baldwin who, at the close of World War I, achieved the modern hydrofoil speed of 60 knots in a very novel craft. Progress and interest in this form of transportation then waned for many years. There were some interesting developments just prior to and through World War II in Europe, and after the war interest quickened in several countries. Current thinking at this time may be judged by Gabdelli & von Karman (1950), who note that the drag of surface vessels may be decreased by lifting the floating structure with hydrofoils. But they go on to add that they " [...] . do not attempt to estimate the effect of such a radical innovation; whether the trials until now appear promising is a question of individual judgment. " As subsequent events have proven, the trials were indeed promising. The many hydrofoil craft now in service are of several different types and a number of more advanced concepts are being developed swiftly. Greater speed in all forms of transportation has always been sought, provided the price is not too great. The air-sea surface is a particularly inhospitable environment for major advances in operating speed, yet it is partly this advance that is the stimulus for hydrofoil craft as well as that for conventional marine craft and the newer hover craft. Silverleaf (1970) and Silverleaf & Cook (1970) review all these recent developments from technical and economic standpoints. High speeds at sea are now possible, they observe, but may not be attained for lack of naval or commercial demands. The successful achievements of hydrofoil craft to date and the possibility of high speeds at sea are due to the greatly increased understanding in recent years of the flow past hydrofoils and also to the development of foil configurations and control systems for coping with the roughness of the sea surface. It seems appropriate, therefore, in this review to link the discussion of hydrofoils with that of progress in the craft, for the two are very interdependent. This interaction has been the source of a great deal of research in applied fluid mechanics in recent years. The methods of analysis, experiment, and design in this field follow closely those in aeronautics, yet there are some important differences because of the medium itself. These include the phenomena due to the free surface (an ever-present boundary in naval hydrodynamics) and the possibility of a phase change through cavitation or ventilation with consequent important modification of the flow; because the liquid density is so much greater than in equivalent aeronautical applications, the dynamic response to motions must be treated very carefully. Hydrofoils, in addition, find application as control surfaces and structural members in marine craft generally, and serve also as elements of propulsion devices. In what follows, the general characteristics of hydrofoil craft are briefly reviewed together with some representative modern examples. Some physical aspects of the flow past hydrofoils are then described, followed by a resume of some of the recent methods used in design and analysis of hydrofoils. In this short account several important topics have of necessity been omitted; these include propulsion, hydroelastic problems, and ship motions, each of which could serve as the topic of a separate article...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{underwater}} glider {{is a type}} of an unmanned {{underwater vehicle}} (UUV). The movement of an underwater glider in the water is based on the buoyancy-propelled for float and fixed-winged for stabilizing the glider’s body. However, a fixed <b>wing</b> <b>underwater</b> glider has limitation to avoid hitting the obstacle in front of it. To overcome this problem, the application of fin system in underwater glider is needed. In this project, a methodology was introduced which is design a flexible fin system of an underwater glider for obstacle avoidance purpose. This final year project mainly focused on SolidWorks’s simulation and analysis of- 30 °,- 45 °,- 60 ° for submerge and rise up at 30 °, 45 °, 60 ° to get the most suitable angle for the glider’s fin system to submerge and rise up. The UTeM underwater glider is modified from fixed to flexible wing. Hence, Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) is used to program the movement of the glider’s wings for upward at 45 °and downward at- 45 °in the water. Thus, a flexible fin system for obstacle avoidance is designed and applied in UTeM underwater glider. Index Terms—Underwater glider, fin system, obstacle avoidance. I...|$|R
