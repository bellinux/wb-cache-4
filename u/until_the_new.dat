5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins.

As part of the Alcatraz jail, it held workshops for inmates to work in.|$|E
5|$|After {{duplication}} in 1890, {{the original}} lattice-girder Como Bridge across the Georges River was laid as gauntlet track. This arrangement remained {{in place for}} many decades, causing a notorious bottleneck on the line, <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> South Wales Government commissioned John Holland & Co {{to build a new}} bridge in 1969. Construction of the new bridge, made of prestressed concrete box girders, commenced in 1969 and was first used by the 18:17 service from Como on 19 November 1972. The old bridge, as well as a former alignment of the line between Mortdale and Oatley replaced in 1905, is now used as a rail trail for pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E

5|$|At this time, {{the first}} serious student revolts started to emerge, {{motivated}} by the local and global changes of the decade, like the Vietnam war, the European student movement, {{the presence of the}} Peace Corps in Latin-America and specially in Colombia, the rejection of the IDB loan and the presence of the foreign foundations. On February 15, 1971, after the unconsulted election of the Dean of the Division of Social Science and Economics, some students took the rectory. This marked the first incursion of the police force to the university campus. For these events, some professors and students were expelled of the university. Nevertheless, the support for the rector dropped, who had to resign. Since mid February to April, the university was closed <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> rector was appointed.|$|E
5|$|C Squadron, {{leading a}} brigade group, {{advanced}} towards Gambut {{on the morning}} of 23 November. On the outskirts of Gambut, the line was stopped to allow the Matilda tanks to lead the column. C Squadron was ordered to charge into Gambut, but when it became apparent that the Axis was retreating, they pursued <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand infantry engaged and then withdrew to Gambut aerodrome. The following evening, the squadron screened the 4th Brigade Group and advanced westward before being recalled at dusk. On 25 November, C Squadron screened the brigade in its advance on Sidi Rezegh and captured a number of German soldiers before being sent to guard divisional headquarters. Four Stuart tanks, captured from the British by the Germans and then recaptured, were given to C Squadron on the afternoon of 27 November.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the canal}} began in 1822, with James Hollinsworth as the {{engineer}} and John Easton as the senior surveyor. The Bristol and Taunton scheme had incorporated a high-level crossing of the River Parrett, but the shortened canal would now join the Parrett at Huntworth, where a basin was to be constructed. This change of route resulted in the Reverend Robert Gray obtaining an injunction, {{and work on the}} lower half {{of the canal}} stopped <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> route could be properly authorised by the 1824 Act. By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000. Below Durston, the canal was cut into the clay subsoil, the clay forming a naturally waterproof channel; but from Durston to Taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight, as the underlying ground was shale.|$|E

5|$|From these positions, the New Zealanders {{were ordered}} to capture Belhamed, Sidi Rezegh proper and Ed Duda. This was to precede a renewed {{break-out}} offensive by the 70th Division. Scobie had informed Lieutenant-General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the XIII Corps commander, responsible for all operations near Tobruk, that the positions between him and Ed Duda were strongly defended. Godwin-Austen assured Scobie that he was {{under no obligation to}} attack <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand Division had taken Ed Duda. Undertaking a night assault, the New Zealand infantry captured Belhamed despite strong resistance, but their attacks to take their other objectives were repulsed.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{implemented}} a staged roll-out of the VE variants, releasing the sedan first in July 2006. Prior to this, Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> station wagon and utility body styles were launched. Variants by Holden's performance vehicle partner, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV), were released {{soon after the}} sedan's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 when it was accompanied by the previewing of a Sportwagon concept. The Sportwagon itself was subsequently introduced in July 2008 with the standard Commodore wheelbase instead of the extended wheelbase of previous Commodore wagons.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone {{topped the}} New York Times list of best-selling fiction, and stayed {{near the top}} of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Times split its list into children's and adult {{sections}} under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings.

5|$|In June 2015, Doyle {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Blackpool, newly relegated to League One. He was named club captain, and selected as starting goalkeeper, ahead of Kyle Letheren, {{for the opening}} match of the season, away to Colchester United. He made several saves to keep his team in the match, but damaged a shoulder in thwarting Colchester's Gavin Massey and {{had to leave the}} field. After an initial prognosis of three months out, a scan suggested he could return to action within a month. He was back in the team for the visit to Scunthorpe United on 5 September, and produced a man-of-the-match performance that earned him a place in the Football League's Team of the Week as Blackpool won their first match of the season. Ankle ligament damage suffered in early November kept him out <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> year.|$|E
5|$|India {{had been}} {{approached}} {{as a possible}} customer for the Jaguar as early as 1968, but had declined, partly {{on the grounds that}} it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service.

A decade later IAF would become the largest single export customer, with a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a long and difficult evaluation process. The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton, and 120 licence-built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the local name Shamsher ("Sword of Justice").|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Horizons mission to Pluto) to appear to be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Infantry Brigade {{took over}} {{the vanguard of the}} advance on 2 September, tasked with {{clearing}} the Germans from their positions overlooking Haplincourt. This they did after overcoming numerous machine gun nests, plus the guns of two disabled tanks being used as outposts. Over 350 prisoners of war were taken, along with 80 machine guns plus a field gun. Their advance was not as quick as that of the 42nd Division, making a corresponding move forward, which had made good progress and the British, <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealanders caught up, had to lay down heavy suppressing fire on both flanks. The New Zealand Division now halted for a few days as pressure was being placed on the German lines elsewhere and the emphasis for IV Corps was now to pursue the enemy to the Hindenburg Line.|$|E
5|$|The Mint struck 500 million {{coins in}} {{anticipation}} of considerable public demand, but the Susan B. Anthony dollar was poorly received, {{in part because of}} confusion caused by its similarity in size and metallic composition to the quarter. Despite its poor reception, the coins eventually began seeing use in vending machines and mass transit systems, gradually depleting the surplus. In 1997, Congress passed a law authorizing the mintage of a new gold-colored one dollar coin depicting Sacagawea, but production could not begin quickly enough to meet demand. As a stopgap measure, <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Sacagawea dollar coin could be issued, the Susan B.
