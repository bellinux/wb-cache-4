40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{calculate}} the <b>universal</b> relaxation <b>times</b> for electron and nucleon fermionic gases. We {{argue that the}} <b>universal</b> relaxation <b>time</b> tau(i) is equal tau(i) =h/m square v(i) where v(i) =alpha(i) c and alpha(1) = 0. 15 for nucleon gas and alpha(2) = 1 / 137 for electron gas, c=light velocity. With the <b>universal</b> relaxation <b>time</b> we formulate the thermal Proca equation for fermionic gases.

5|$|Four {{time zones}} are {{utilized}} in the basin: Central for storms east of 106°W, Mountain between 114.9°W and 106°W, Pacific between 140°W and 115°W, and Hawaii–Aleutian for storms between the International Date Line and 140°W. However, for convenience, all information is listed by Coordinated <b>Universal</b> <b>Time</b> (UTC) {{first with the}} respective local time included in parentheses. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as the subtropical phase of Omeka, is included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.|$|E
5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated <b>Universal</b> <b>Time</b> (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E

5|$|On September 1, the {{hurricane}} began to rapidly deepen over warm {{waters of the}} Caribbean Sea; by 1800 Coordinated <b>Universal</b> <b>Time</b> (UTC), it had strengthened to Category 4 intensity. Continuing westward, the storm passed north of Swan Island later that day. Early on September 2, a double eyewall appeared on satellite imagery. Carmen's forward movement gradually slowed as the storm took a west by north direction, and it reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), accompanied by a central barometric pressure of 928 mbar (hPa; 27.4 inHg). Atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker, and Carmen slowed to a drift. Later on September 2, {{the hurricane}} made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula; its northern jog spared Belize City from a direct hit. The storm's center passed {{a few miles north}} of Chetumal, Quintana Roo.|$|E

For total and annular eclipses, the duration of the eclipse is given, as well as the location of the greatest eclipse (the point of maximum eclipse) and the path width of the total or annular eclipse. The geographical areas from which the eclipse can be seen are listed.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} May 2010, a {{surge in}} the monsoon {{produced}} widespread convection, or thunderstorms, off the southwest coast of India in the southeastern Arabian Sea. After a low-level circulation became evident on May30, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated {{the system as a}} low pressure area. The low moved northwestward within an area of warm water temperatures of , moderate wind shear, and an upper-level environment conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first noted the system on May30 as an area of potential development. The circulation became more defined within the building convection, which was amplified by outflow from an anticyclone over the northern Arabian Sea. At 03:00Coordinated <b>Universal</b> <b>Time</b> (UTC) on May31, the IMD designated the system as a depression about 1,000km (620mi) west-southwest of Mumbai, India, or about 1,260km (785mi) southeast of Muscat, Oman. At 18:00UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 03A.|$|E

40|$|Before {{the wide}} {{distribution}} of standard time signals by tele-graph and {{radio in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-turies, the reported times of earthquakes usually were based on times established from observations of local apparent noon on a sundial.

25|$|A leap {{second is}} a one-second {{adjustment}} that is occasionally applied to Coordinated <b>Universal</b> <b>Time</b> (UTC) {{in order to}} keep its time of day close to the mean solar time, or UT1. Without such a correction, time reckoned by Earth's rotation drifts away from atomic time because of irregularities in the Earth's rate of rotation.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} in History, advances in time-keeping {{have resulted in}} various time scales.
