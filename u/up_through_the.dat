5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E
5|$|Enforcement {{of federal}} civil rights law in the South created {{numerous}} peonage cases, which slowly traveled <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in Clyatt v. United States (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.|$|E

5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E
5|$|For 15,000 years, {{native peoples}} {{gathered}} at Wyam {{to fish and}} exchange goods. They built wooden platforms {{out over the water}} and caught salmon with dipnets and long spears on poles as the fish swam <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rapids and jumped over the falls. Historically, an estimated fifteen to twenty million salmon passed through the falls every year, {{making it one of the}} greatest fishing sites in North America.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cloud base.

The NOAEL’s of these routes have been determined as follows: For the oral route the NOAEL is set to 3.3 mg/kg per day for rats, based on a 2-year study. For absorption <b>through</b> <b>the</b> skin the NOAEL is set to 150 mg/kg per day for rabbits, based on the reduction of food consumption.|$|R

Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate {{as they made their}} way <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in Webber's career the first race of the season was not held in Melbourne, but in Bahrain, due to the {{original}} date clashing with the Commonwealth Games.

He was scheduled {{to continue in the}} Busch Series in 2006, but the team was bought out and his contract didn't allow him to race in a non-Dodge car. He returned to IndyCar late that season.

5|$|In 17th-century Spain, {{painters}} rarely enjoyed high social status. Painting {{was regarded}} as a craft, not an art such as poetry or music. Nonetheless, Velázquez worked his way <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ranks of the court of PhilipIV, and in February 1651 was appointed palace chamberlain (aposentador mayor del palacio). The post brought him status and material reward, but its duties made heavy demands on his time. During the remaining eight years of his life, he painted only a few works, mostly portraits of the royal family. When he painted Las Meninas, he had been with the royal household for 33 years.|$|E

The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame.
