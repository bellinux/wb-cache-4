5|$|Christoph Benzmuller and Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo <b>used</b> <b>an</b> {{automated}} {{theorem prover}} to validate Scott's version of Gödel's ontological argument. It {{has been shown}} by the same researchers that Gödel's ontological argument is inconsistent. However, Scott's version of Gödel's ontological argument is consistent and thus valid.|$|E
50|$|Commonwealth Pres. Manuel Quezon <b>used</b> <b>a</b> 1937 Chrysler Airflow Custom Imperial CW as {{the first}} presidential car. Pres. Jose P.

After the American colonial period, President Manuel Roxas <b>used</b> <b>a</b> 1940 Cadillac Fleetwood Series 75, which was also used by his successors. A 1946 Packard Clipper was used by Vice Presidents Elpidio Quirino and Fernando López. When Quirino assumed the presidency, he <b>used</b> <b>a</b> 1953 Chrysler Imperial limousine, whereas Pres. Ramon Magsaysay <b>used</b> <b>a</b> Cadillac Fisher Fleetwood Series 75. Pres. Ferdinand Marcos <b>used</b> <b>a</b> Mercedes Benz 600 and a Lincoln Continental Signature Series. Pres.

50|$|In {{the game}} series they <b>use</b> <b>a</b> variety of {{different}} weapons. In TMNT: The Arcade Game, Rocksteady <b>used</b> <b>a</b> machine gun while Bebop <b>used</b> <b>a</b> ray gun. In The Manhattan Project, Rocksteady <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> harpoon gun, while Bebop <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> ball and chain mounted on his head. They were absent from the arcade version of Turtles in Time, but in the Super NES version, Rocksteady and Bebop were dressed as a pirate captain and first mate respectively.

5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae to family status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan <b>used</b> <b>an</b> even narrower definition (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E
5|$|During {{his primary}} victories, McGovern <b>used</b> <b>an</b> {{approach}} that stressed grassroots-level organization while bypassing conventional campaign techniques and traditional party power centers. He capitalized on support from anti-war activists and reform liberals; {{thousands of students}} engaged in door-to-door campaigning for him. He benefited by the eight primaries he won being those the press focused on the most; he showed electoral weakness in the South and industrial Midwest, and actually received fewer primary votes overall than Humphrey and had only a modest edge over Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication <b>used</b> <b>an</b> idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E

5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail {{bridge across the}} river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then <b>used</b> <b>an</b> elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant strips {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development of ideas of respect and disrespect among American children used strips from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects could provide qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 study used the strips to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was behaving badly while researchers <b>used</b> <b>an</b> fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Hagley's {{recreation}} ground {{opened on}} the main road in 1902; until then local paddocks were <b>used.</b> <b>An</b> Australian rules football club was formed in Hagley c.1895. Matches were played on a private paddock until 1902 when they moved to the recreation ground. The club's most successful period was, as part of the Esk Association, when they won five successive premierships from 1949–53. The club closed in 1998, as part of a general decline of country football in Tasmania. During the club's 102 years, the most widely known player was former St Kilda player Matthew Young.|$|E

5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and <b>used</b> <b>an</b> infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E

She briefly attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES), but when that school proved to be insufficiently flexible about her acting commitments, she transferred to Fairfax High School, from which she graduated in 2001. She briefly attended UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|Yokes are {{not used}} on all aircraft. Helicopters <b>use</b> <b>a</b> cyclic and the {{majority}} of military fighter aircraft <b>use</b> <b>a</b> centre or side-stick. Some light aircraft <b>use</b> <b>a</b> stick because some sport pilots prefer that control system. The latest Airbus family of passenger jets <b>use</b> <b>a</b> side-stick, not unlike a computer game controller, to actuate control surfaces.|$|R

5|$|Jew {{said that}} he had been {{contacted}} by the owners of a local chain tapioca drink shop, Quickly, to resolve Quickly's business permit issues. Jew demanded $80,000 for his assistance, but agreed to accept $40,000. The shop owners then contacted the FBI, which supplied the cash for a sting operation.

5|$|Marie Thursby has <b>used</b> <b>an</b> {{extended}} {{version of the}} model to examine international trade in wheat, 60% of which is produced by the United States and Canada. Thursby includes marketing boards, possibility of a monopsony, {{and a variety of}} government policies in the analysis. She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the barriers to entry are not high and regardless of the extent of market power that US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an export tax, rather than a subsidy.|$|E
5|$|McBride {{made his}} major league debut for the Cardinals in 1973, but he {{retained}} his rookie status after only appearing in 40 games that year. He became {{known for a}} distinctive appearance, as he wore {{one of the largest}} Afro hairstyles in the major leagues. When he stepped to home plate to bat, McBride made a ritual of wiping away the chalk lines that made up the batter's box. He <b>used</b> <b>an</b> unconventional batting stance, placing his weight on his front foot rather than on his back foot.|$|E
