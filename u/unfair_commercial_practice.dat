40|$|RESUME This thesis {{deals with}} the Czech, French and EU {{regulation}} of the Misleading, Comparative and Hidden advertisement. I described imperfection and non-consistency of the Czech regulation. The Czech regulation of the Misleading, Comparative and Hidden advertisement is to the great extent result of {{the implementation of the}} EU Directives. Nevertheless, these directives have been implemented imperfectly and incompletely. This fact relates namely to the implementation of the Directive of the European Parliament and Councel No. 2005 / 29 /EC, on the Unfair commercial practices towards consumers. One of the key issues that the Czech Academia had to deal with was the possibility of consumer to use for its defence against <b>unfair</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> stipulations of the General Clause of the Unfair Competition set by the Commercial Code. The broadly accepted answer is that the consumer is entitled to use for its defence against <b>unfair</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> the General Clause of Unfair Competition, under the condition that the practice passes through the "unfair practice" test accordingly to the Consumer Protection Act. In this thesis I am defending an opinion that the Czech legislator chose relatively easy, but incorrect way to achieve this implementation.

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the European directive on unfair commercial practices, its provisions started to apply alongside the existing sector-specific European legislation on consumer protection. With the aim of ensuring a coherent system of European consumer law, the directive stated that, in the case of conflict between its rules and other Community law regulating specific aspects of unfair commercial practices, the latter shall prevail and apply to those aspects. The directive, however, did not mandate any enforcement mechanism at the national level. The Italian legislation which implemented the European directive conferred a general enforcement power on unfair commercial practices to the national antitrust authority. Italian law was not, however, very clear regarding the competence of the agency in markets subject to the oversight of a different sector-specific authority. This issue was raised before the Italian administrative law Court which, at first, seemed to limit the general competence of the antitrust authority in fields where the contested practices were also considered by sector-specific regulation. For this reason, the European Commission started an infringement proceeding against Italy for not having correctly implemented the directive on unfair commercial practices. As a consequence, a recent reform in Italian law conferred the antitrust authority an exclusive competence to combat unfair commercial practices also in regulated sectors, after having consulted the sector-specific regulator, apart when the breach of sector-specific regulation does not result in an <b>unfair</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practice.</b> After {{the adoption}} of this provision, the Italian administrative judge finally interpreted the law on <b>unfair</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> consistently with the European directive. The Court denied that {{the adoption of}} secondary legislation by a national sector-specific regulators can exclude the application of the general provisions on unfair commercial practices and affirmed the relevant enforcement competence of the antitrust authority also in regulated sectors. In the light of these different approaches, this paper will attempt to examine the benefits and the drawbacks of the enforcement mechanisms endorsed by the Italian Courts and legislator. The aim of the work is to assess, from a legal perspective, which role should the general antitrust authority play in the enforcement of unfair commercial practices in markets subject to sector-specific regulation. </p...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the merit of the test of the average consumer {{as a basis for}} judicial and regulatory action. In the first part, we describe the origin of the test, its application in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and its possible developments. In the second part, we discuss the theoretical grounds of the average consumer test (i. e., information and rationality), drawing upon the studies of cognitive psychology and behavioural economics concerning consumers’ behaviour. The result of our analysis is that we call into serious question the practical workability of the test of the average consumer, which requires consumers an overly demanding standard of rationality and information without dedicating much attention to the real functioning of consumer behaviour. The average consumer may be described as an interesting, anti-paternalistic and, to some extent, useful notion. It is, however, an overly simplistic concept with little correspondence with the real world of individual consumer behaviour and should be reinterpreted more flexibly, or even abandoned to mirror consumer behaviour more effectively.

40|$|The <b>Unfair</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive (2005 / 29 /EC) fully harmonises <b>unfair</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> {{law in the}} European Union. The Directive aims {{to achieve}} {{a high level of}} {{consumer}} protection, to increase the smooth functioning of the internal market and also more broadly to improve competition in the market as such. The Directive relies to a large extent on general clauses prohibiting <b>unfair</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> Consumer benchmarks are used in this context to determine the expected behaviour of consumers, including {{the degree to which they}} are expected to be informed, attentive and critical. What benchmark is applied is relevant to the level of consumer protection, but also to the other goals of the Directive. For example, the degree to which consumers are protected may affect consumer confidence in cross-border shopping, and what is regarded as unfair also affects competition, since traders acting unfairly can take away market share from fair traders offering better products. This book investigates the three consumer benchmarks in the Directive (i. e., the average consumer benchmark, the target group benchmark and the vulnerable group benchmark), both at the European and at the national level. Moreover, it provides an analysis of the plausibility of the benchmarks and their application from a consumer behaviour perspective.

40|$|AbstractUnfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive {{remains one}} of the most ambitious acts of {{secondary}} legislation adopted in the field of consumer protection over the past decade. This legal instrument seeks to establish a common European understanding of “unfairness” in business-to-consumer legal relations. Hereby Directive introduced a comprehensive regulatory regime applied to all types of commercial activities that can influence the economic behavior of consumers, covering any business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> before, during and after a transaction, thus including marketing, negotiation, sales practices and after-sales conduct. <b>Unfair</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive into Lithuanian legal system was transposed by adopting a completely new legal act – Law on Prohibition of <b>Unfair</b> Business-to-Consumer <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> of the Republic of Lithuania. The implementation of the <b>Unfair</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive in Lithuania led to a split-up between misleading business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and misleading business-to-business advertising regulation regimes. Implementing act among other rules introduced into the national legal system provisions on the prohibition of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> ensuring that consumers are not misled, thus enabling them to make informed and reasonable choices. The purpose of this article is to examine the norms of national act, implementing the prohibition of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> into the national legal system in the context of implementing provisions of the other Member States and to reveal core national regulation and application problems. Also, having in mind that in the text of the Directive a distinction between misleading actions and misleading omissions is made, it is analyzed whether the clear line between the application of these rules is made in legal practice.
