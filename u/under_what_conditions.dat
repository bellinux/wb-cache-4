In the course of studying <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>condition</b> a covering of neighborhoods is a partition, the concept of repeat degree is proposed, {{with the help of}} which the issue is addressed. This paper studies further the application of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods.

As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family.

25|$|After {{observing that}} most civil-military theory {{assumes that the}} {{civilian}} and military worlds must necessarily be separate, both physically and ideologically, Rebecca L. Schiff offered a new theory—Concordance—as an alternative. One of the key questions in Civil-Military Relations (CMR) theory {{has always been to}} determine <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> the military will intervene in the domestic politics of the nation. Most scholars agree with the theory of objective civilian control of the military (Huntington), which focuses on the separation of civil and military institutions. Such a view concentrates and relies heavily on the U.S. case, from an institutional perspective, and especially during the Cold War period. Schiff provides an alternative theory, from both institutional and cultural perspectives, that explains the U.S. case as well as several non-U.S. civil-military relations case studies.|$|E

Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms—some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.|$|E

The prosecution responded that because the state did not plan to argue to the jury that Shafer would be a danger in the future, no Simmons instruction was required. During deliberations, the jury asked <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> someone convicted of murder could become available for parole. The trial judge stated that parole eligibility or ineligibility was not a matter for the jury's consideration.

25|$|The Inca state drew its taxes {{through both}} tax in kind and corvée labor drawn from {{lineages}} and administered through a bureaucracy composed largely of local nobility. The corvée labor force {{was used for}} military operations as well as public works projects, such as roads, aqueducts, and storage buildings known as tampu and qollqa. There were parallel institutions of lineage-based colonies known as mitmaqkuna, which produced goods for the state and provided strategic security in newly acquired areas, and yanakuna, which were retainers with labor obligations to higher members of the state. Lands belonging to the Sapa Inca, the state church, and to panaqas (lineages descending from individual Sapa Incas according {{to the principle of}} split inheritance) were often vertical arrayed to access a variety of resources.
