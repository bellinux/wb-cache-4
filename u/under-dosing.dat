50|$|In {{over-the-counter}} medicines, dosage {{is based}} on age. Typically, different doses are recommended for children 6 years and under, children aged 6 to 12 years, and persons 12 years and older, but outside of those ranges the guidance is slim. This can lead to serial under or overdosing, as smaller people take more than they should and larger people take less. Over-the-counter medications are typically accompanied {{by a set of}} instructions directing the patient to take a certain small dose, followed by another small dose if their symptoms don’t subside. <b>Under-dosing</b> is a common problem in pharmacy, as predicting an average dose that is effective for all individuals is extremely challenging because body weight and size impacts how the dose acts within the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of sulbactam to ampicillin enhances {{the effects of}} ampicillin. This increases the antimicrobial activity by 4- to 32-fold when compared to ampicillin alone. Ampicillin is a time-dependent antibiotic. Its bacterial killing is largely related to the time that drug concentrations in the body remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The duration of exposure will thus correspond to how much bacterial killing will occur. Various studies have shown that, for maximum bacterial killing, drug concentrations must be above the MIC for 50-60% of {{the time for the}} penicillin group of antibiotics. This means that longer durations of adequate concentrations are more likely to produce therapeutic success. However, when ampicillin is given in combination with sulbactam, regrowth of bacteria has been seen when sulbactam levels fall below certain concentrations. As with many other antibiotics, <b>under-dosing</b> of ampicillin/sulbactam may lead to resistance.|$|E

50|$|Anthelmintic drug {{resistance}} {{is a widespread}} emerging problem. Resistance {{has been reported to}} all broad spectrum anthelmintics, which are benzimidazoles (BZs), levamisole/morantel (LEV) and macrocyclic lactones (ML). There are numbers of reports about resistance of C. oncophora to MLs. MLs include ivermectin (IVM), which has been extensively used to treat livestock gastrointestinal parasites since the 1980s. MLs bind irreversible to Glutmate gated chloride ion (GluCl) channels, leading to hyperpolarisation. Pharyngeal and somatic muscle cells get paralyzed, which results in starvation of the worms and also their removal from the gastrointestinal tract. Broad spectrum anthelmintics include benzimidazoles (BZs). BZs have been used since the 1960s, and resistance was detected in sheep shortly after commercialization of the first drug, called thiabendazole, in 1964. Reason for emerging resistance is selection for resistant individuals, particularly by high treatment frequency and <b>under-dosing</b> of the drugs. Other nematodes such as H. contortus are more susceptible to the drugs, which leads to a shift in the nemabiome towards higher relative amount of C. oncophora.|$|E

30|$|The {{results are}} in {{agreement}} with the findings of Onono et al. (2015) who reported that treatment of cattle in Narok County was done by male pastoralists. The pastoralists’ self-medication of their camel and other livestock poses serious public health risks due to use of the wrong veterinary drugs, over-dosing and <b>under-dosing.</b> The over- or <b>under-dosing</b> of camels is complicated by lack of camel dosage information on most drug packages, hence extrapolation of camel dosages based on cattle or horse dosage, which can lead to over-dosing and <b>under-dosing.</b> The presence of veterinary drug residues in camels and camel milk and meat can lead to development of drug resistant organisms in both the camels and the humans consuming camel products. This can result in development of drug- resistant zoonotic organisms in the camel. When camel products are consumed, the drug- resistant foodborne organisms are then transmitted to human consumers, thus posing a food safety and public health issue. Inappropriate and inefficient use of veterinary drugs has been reported to have devastating effects on animal disease management (Redding et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|Background: During breast three fields radiotherapy, {{the problem}} is that the divergency of the field interferes with {{matching}} the edges. So the matching point of these supraclav and tangential field will suffer from over-dose and <b>under-dose.</b> To prevent these these divergency, a half- block is often applied at supracluv field. Also in some techniques like collimator and couch rotation, corner blocks and custom blocks are applied at tangential field which it renders its own problem. Hence, this research employ half-block in all three different radiotherapy scheme to some how radiate the cancerous tissue more appropriately to lessen the over exposure and yet deliver the needed dose to the tissue. Methods: Ten breast cancer patients of Sohadaye Haftome-Tir hospital were considered for this study. The divegency of the fields at the matching point was blocked by using a half-block application and a slope, under patients. Dosimetery was measured by TLD at desired location on the skin before and after the half-block application. The measurement was carried out at 2 groups under 2 different irradiation methods (SSD, SAD). Results: Dosimetery showed that the mean over-dose values at SSD method before applying half–block was 151 % which reduced to 97 % after half–block application, and in the SAD method the <b>under-dose</b> was improved from 41 % to 80 %. Conclusion: Half–block can solve adjacent filelds problem efficiently, and since making the half-block at low cost is easily possible at any radiotherapy center, it is suggested to use block more often...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} two-dimensional radiation dose distributions, an algorithm called the Gamma function {{has recently been}} modified. The current study concentrates on modification of the gamma function as a three-dimensional dose distribution evaluation tool, and includes the recognition of over-dose/under-dose areas. Using a sign term, the conventional gamma function separates the disagreed areas into two parts: over-dose and <b>under-dose</b> areas. The new gamma function was modified using {{an extension of the}} dose difference criterion, ΔD, from two dimensions into three dimensions. In order to provide two-dimensional dose maps for analysis, several images were acquired for a range of regular and irregular radiation fields using a Scanning Liquid Ionization Chamber Electronic Portal Imaging Device. The raw images were then converted into two-dimensional transmitted dose maps using an empirical method. They were utilized as reference dose maps. Translational and rotational manipulations were performed on the reference dose distribution maps to provide evaluated dose maps. The reference and evaluated dose maps were then compared using conventional and modified gamma tools. The results indicated that the modified algorithm is able to enhance the over- and <b>under-dose</b> regions. In addition, a slight increase of the agreement percentage for reference and evaluated dose maps were observed by the extension of ΔD to three dimensions. It is concluded that the modified method is more realistic and applicable for the evaluation of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional dose distributions.

30|$|Conclusions Rates {{of daily}} {{prescription}} are poor, at 42  %. Completed prescriptions show reasonable adherence to recommended dosages. This suggests {{there may be}} a role for prompting to complete/reassess prescriptions within the EPR. Only 29  % of days saw the correct dose of CRRT delivered. It may be that the breaks in CRRT are not adjusted for in the prescribed dose, leading to <b>under-dosing.</b> Higher prescription, in the context of anticipated disruption, may reduce <b>under-dosing.</b> However, this would worsen cases of higher-intensity delivery. Further work is required to understand the reasons for high-intensity prescription and delivery. Improved anticoagulation may reduce breaks in CRRT delivery, and improve filter lifespan. This could reduce workload, cut costs, and potentially improve patient outcomes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Achievement {{of early}} {{therapeutic}} anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) {{is associated with}} improved outcomes in thromboembolic disease. Weight based UFH expedites time to therapeutic anticoagulation. Treatment with UFH is challenging in surgical patients due to their high propensity for bleeding. We sought {{to test the hypothesis}} that an initial weight based UFH infusion in surgical patients increases the percentage of patients who achieve early therapeutic anticoagulation without increasing the risk of hemorrhagic events. Methods: Using a non-concurrent retrospective cohort study design, adult surgical patients receiving UFH for venous thromboembolism (VTE) at a tertiary care center were included. Two groups were identified: the weight based (WB) and the <b>under-dosed</b> (UD) heparin groups. For our primary outcome, we compared percentage of patients in each group that achieved a therapeutic PTT within 24  h. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of supratherapeutic PTT levels, hemorrhagic events, and complications associated with VTE. Results: 73 subjects met study criteria, which included 8 subjects in the WB group and 65 in the UD group. The demographic, baseline laboratory, admitting service and type of VTE were similar between the 2 groups. The percentages of WB and UD subjects who achieved a therapeutic PTT within 24  h were 75 % and 28 %, respectively (p <  0. 01). There was no difference in the incidence of supratherapeutic PTT or hemorrhagic events. Conclusion: Surgical patients who received an initial weight based UFH infusion achieved earlier therapeutic anticoagulation compared to <b>under-dosed</b> UFH without increasing the occurrence of supratherapeutic PTT levels or hemorrhagic events...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose This study aims {{to address}} the {{relationship}} between tumor size and dosimetric inadequacy in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and how it subsequently affects the local control. Material and Methods 444 NPC patients treated with IMRT from 2005 to 2010 {{were included in the}} study. The planning aim was to deliver at least 66. 5 Gy (i. e. 95 % of 70 Gy) to 95 % of the primary gross tumor volume (GTV-P) while keeping all the critical neurological organs at risk (OAR) within dose tolerance. Treatment outcome were analyzed according to T stage, GTV-P volume and the degree of <b>under-dosing.</b> Results Disease outcome was related to T stage, GTV-P volume and the degree of <b>under-dosing.</b> The 5 -year local failure free survival (LFFS), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for T 4 disease were 74 %, 50. 4 % and 63. 6 % respectively. 48 cm 3 was identified as the critical cut-off GTV-P volume, the large volume group (GTV-P ≥ 48 cm 3) had lower 5 -year DFS (50. 4 % vs. 76. 6 %) and OS (65. 2 % vs. 86. 3 %, p < 0. 001). Most T 4 diseases (and some T 3) were under-dosed (< 66. 5 Gy) and an under-dosed GTV-P volume of 3. 4 cm 3 was found to be prognostically important. Multivariate analyses showed that the effect of GTV-P volume on LFFR and DFS was outweighed by the degree of <b>under-dosing.</b> Conclusions Treatment outcome of locally advanced NPC was significantly affected by the volume of under-dosed (< 66. 5 Gy) GTV-P due to the neighboring neurological structures.

30|$|An obvious {{limitation}} {{of these methods}} is that the actual spatial dose distribution of an individual patient is neglected. In general, these methods seek to prevent overdosing to the parenchyma (and lungs), minimizing the occurrence of radioembolization-induced liver disease [25 – 27]. As a consequence, the resultant prescribed activities are likely curbed by toxicity limitations of the most vulnerable patients and the occurrence of patients with a highly unfavorable absorbed dose distribution.

40|$|Prostate cancer {{continues}} to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men. Brachytherapy has {{emerged as one of the}} definitive treatment options for early stage prostate cancer which entails permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate to eradicate the cancer with ionizing radiation.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate off-label medicine use in children and adolescents in Germany in a non-clinical setting and to identify prevalence, determinants and spectrum of off-label medicine use. Methods: Data were obtained from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) conducted by the Robert Koch Institute (2003 – 2006). 17, 450 randomly selected children aged 0 – 17 years took part in the drug interviews. Of those, 8, 899 took at least one medicine during the 7 days preceding the interview. Off-label medicine use was defined as the discrepancy between actual use and the intended use described in the summary of product characteristics. Off-label medicine use was stratified into off-label indication, off-label age, off-label over-dosing, and off-label <b>under-dosing.</b> Results: The prevalence rate of off-label medicine use among those who used medicines amount of is 40. 2 %. The prevalence rate is significantly higher in boys (41. 4 %), in children aged 3 to 6 years (48. 7 %), without migration background (40. 9 %), with high social status (42. 5 %), living in small (42. 0 %) and medium sized cities (41. 6 %), and with a poor parents rated health status (41. 7 %). 12, 667 preparations (attributable in respect to off-label use) were taken by 8, 899 children. 30 % of the medicines have been used off-label. Off-label medicine use was highest in preparations of the ATC-class “C 00 Cardiovascular System”.

40|$|Improved {{optimisation}} {{of radiation}} dose delivery to tumours with improved sparing of normal tissues {{is an ongoing}} goal of radiotherapy practice. Advanced radiotherapy techniques are constantly improving to achieve this goal. However, these techniques are more complex to deliver. Hence verifying the source of dose errors is increasingly challenging. Accurate verification of treatment delivery for advanced radiotherapy becomes increasingly important in mitigating dose delivery errors which may compromise clinical outcome. This dissertation investigated treatment dosimetry verification for two different radiotherapy delivery systems i) Open gantry linear accelerator and ii) Helical TomoTherapy HI-ART ® (HT). Part (i) Open gantry linear accelerator - novel prototype hybrid EPID based dosimeters were developed for treatment verification to combine geometric and dosimetric verification in a single system. Initial work on dose response for standard EPIDs provided a more consistent understanding of EPID <b>under-dose</b> response for small monitor units (MUs).

Methods: National prescription data between 1990 and 2012 were accessed. A retrospective audit (2008 – 2012) of metformin doses and patient renal function (20 % random sample of all in-patients prescribed metformin) was conducted at St Vincent’s Hospital (SVH), Sydney. Prescribers of metformin were interviewed (semi-structured; consultants at SVH) or surveyed (Australian endocrinologists) to gather their understanding of metformin dosing in relation to renal function. Results: Metformin utilisation increased fivefold nationally between 1995 and 2012. Metformin tended to be <b>under-dosed</b> in SVH patients with normal renal function (83. 5 %) and over-dosed in patients with impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min, 50 %). Consultants indicated that metformin doses needed to be reduced in renal impairment. Most endocrinologists (61 %) were comfortable prescribing metformin down to eGFRs around 30 mL/min. Conclusion: The use of metformin increased greatly over the period of the study. Metformin is prescribed frequently for patients with eGFR values below the minimal level approved in the product label (60 mL/min). While prescribers expressed their understanding of the need to reduce metformin doses in patients with renal impairment, we found that metformin doses were higher than appropriate in patients with impaired renal function. Metformin may be used safely when renal function is poor provided dosage is appropriately reduced. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: Artemisinin-based {{combination}} therapy (ACT) {{introduced in the}} mid- 1990 s has been recommended since 2005 by the World Health Organization as first-line treatment against Plasmodium falciparum in all endemic countries. In 2010, the combination dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was recommended {{for the treatment of}} uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. DP is one of the first-line treatments used by the French army since 2013. Case presentation: A case of P. falciparum clinical failure with DP at day 20 was described in a 104 kg French soldier deployed in Djibouti. He was admitted to hospital for supervision of oral treatment with DP [40 mg dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus 320 mg piperaquine tetraphosphate (PPQ) ]. This corresponded to a cumulative dose of 4. 6 mg/kg DHA and 37 mg/kg PPQ in the present patient, which is far below the WHO recommended ranges. No mutation was found in the propeller domain of the Kelch 13 (k 13) gene, which is associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia. Pfmdr 1 N 86, 184 F, S 1034 and N 1042 polymorphisms and haplotype 72 - 76 CVIET for the pfcrt gene were found in the present case. There was no evidence of resistance to DP.

Gas monitoring lines were placed near the bioassay boxes to measure gas concentrations over time during fumigations. Both MB treatments killed 100 % of all stages in the boxes except for large larvae in a few locations. In these locations, the mortality of large larvae ranged from 96 - 98 %. SF treatments killed 100 % of all stages except eggs. In the May treatment with SF, egg mortality ranged from 44 - 100 % with only two boxes showing 100 % mortality, because of <b>under-dosing.</b> <b>Under-dosing</b> occurred because the mill temperature {{was assumed to be}} greater than 27 ºC when it was actually below 27 ºC. In the second SF trial, only three boxes had egg mortalities that were less than 100 %. However, data from the two replications showed that the mean mortalities of eggs and large larvae between MB and SF were not significantly different from each other...|$|E
40|$|Continuous haemo(dia) {{filtration}} {{techniques as}} a means of extracorporeal renal replacement therapy are being used more and more, especially on intensive care units. The effect of intermittent haemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of systemic antibiotics is well documented and advice is provided in the drug data sheets regarding dosage, timing and additional doses (post haemodialysis). Continuous haemofiltration significantly alters the handling of these same antibiotics compared with haemodialysis, such that if the advice given for 'haemodialysis ' is used for patients on haemofiltration, <b>under-dosing</b> the patient may lead to sub-therapeutic antibiotic levels. The reasons for these differences are discussed and suggested dosage modifications are given for commonly used antimicrobials based on available published data...|$|E
40|$|Low {{dose rate}} {{prostate}} brachytherapy treatments {{began at the}} Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH), Australia, in September 2004. This paper {{will focus on the}} evolution of treatment technique since then showing how procedural improvements have enabled timely diagnosis of <b>under-dose</b> and scheduling of top-up treatments for sub-optimum implants, and how significant time savings have been achieved for staff and patients. In addition, implant dosimetry trends over this period have been investigated and results are presented. Iodine- 125 seeds (Oncura model 6711) have been used since LDR prostate treatments began, with an aim to deliver a prostate dose of 145  Gy. Three key changes in implant technique took place during the period Sept 2004 to Sept 2011. The live implant dosimetry trends of the prostate D 90, urethra V 150, and rectum D 0. 1 cc and D 2. 0 cc, were assessed to see if the change in technique {{had an impact on the}} treatment planning and seed deployment. The switch from manual loading of seeds to pre-loaded needles and the change from a two-step pre-planning procedure to live planning have realized the greatest time savings with approximately 1. 0 FTE physicist day saved per 2 patient implant day and 2 patient visits saved per treatment. Dosimetric parameters also improved with mean implant D 90 s rising from 166  Gy to 180  Gy. The average Urethra D 10 also increased over the study group, rising from 186  Gy to 199  Gy while the rectum dose remained unchanged. Both rectum and urethra dose remained below GEC-ESTRO guidelines despite the observed rise in urethral dose. Thomas P. Rutten, John M. Lawson, Loredana G. Marc...|$|R
40|$|The long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) / long-acting muscarinic {{antagonist}} (LAMA) fixed dose combination (FDC) therapy {{represents the}} cornerstone {{for the treatment}} of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Nevertheless, conflicting clinical findings still exist on the real benefit of the LABA/LAMA FDCs. Therefore, we investigated whether combining the LABA vilanterol with the LAMA umeclidinium may induce synergistic bronchorelaxant effect in isolated airways. The effect of umeclidinium and vilanterol, administered alone, in combination at the ratio of concentrations reproducing the doses delivered by Anoro(®) Ellipta(®) (55 : 22), or at isoeffective low concentrations, was investigated on the cholinergic contractile tone induced by the parasympathetic activation of human isolated airways. The interaction was analyzed by using the Bliss Independence and Unified Theory models. Umeclidinium and vilanterol induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated bronchi, with umeclidinium significantly (P < 0. 05) more potent than vilanterol (Emax at 10 Hz: umeclidium 102. 6 ± 6. 8 %, vilanterol 75. 1 ± 13. 8 %; pEC 50 at 10 Hz: umeclidinium 8. 6 ± 0. 4, vilanterol 6. 9 ± 0. 6). When administered at 55 : 22 concentration-ratio, umeclidinium plus vilanterol completely relaxed the isolated airways (Emax at 10 Hz: 99. 6 ± 8. 0 %; pEC 50 at 10 Hz: 8. 2 ± 0. 4). No synergistic interaction was detected for umeclidinium/vilanterol combined at 55 : 22 ratio, whereas strong synergism was elicited when the drugs were administered at low isoeffective concentrations (+ 41. 4 ± 5. 8 % vs. monocomponents), leading to submaximal relaxant effect (81. 4 ± 5. 8 %). Umeclidinium and vilanterol are imbalanced when combined at 55 : 22 ratio, with umeclidinium over-dosed, or vice versa vilanterol <b>under-dosed.</b> Specific studies are needed to identify the dose ratio of umeclidinium/vilanterol combination to guarantee equipotency concentrations of each component into the lung, and induce synergistic bronchodilation...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. The solar ultraviolet (UV) spectrum spans over a range of wavelengths, namely, UVA (315 – 400 nm), UVB (280 – 315 nm) and UVC (100 – 280 nm). The UV radiation reaching {{the surface of the}} Earth comprises of mainly UVA, a small amount of UVB and essentially no UVC. Solar UV can affect the human health. An <b>under-dose</b> will lead to diseases such as rickets and osteoporosis, while an over-dose will cause sunburns, skin cancers and cataracts. It is therefore pertinent to design methods for integrated long-term measurements of UV radiation (e. g., over 1 day). Recently, we succeeded in demonstrating the feasibility of using the Gafchromic EBT 3 radiochromic film to quantify solar (UVA+UVB) exposures (in Jcm- 2). These radiochromic-film products were originally developed for clinical dosimetric applications, with visible-light absorption changes upon X-ray irradiation, but were understood to be also responsive to UV radiations. We found that the usable range of UV exposures for the EBT 3 film was from ~ 0. 2 to ~ 30 Jcm- 2. However, the maximum UV exposure could reach 50 Jcm- 2 per day, so we need a wider usable range. The current work proposed modifications to the EBT 3 film for longer-term measurements (e. g., over 1 day). We explored the UV responses of EBT 3 films covered with 2 and 5 barriers, each barrier being a blue polypropylene film with a thickness of 0. 3 mm. The usable range for the film with 2 barriers was from ~ 4 to ~ 40 Jcm- 2, while the usable range for the film with 5 barriers was from ~ 30 to ~ 300 Jcm- 2. Using both EBT 3 films covered with 2 and 5 barriers will give a continuous usable range from 4 to 300 Jcm- 2, which will be useful for a consecutive 6 -d UV exposure measurement. cf 201...|$|R
