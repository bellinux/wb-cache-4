25|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 2 October, shortly after take-off, the Boeing 757 {{airliner}} crew discovered that their basic flight instruments were behaving erratically and reported receiving contradictory serial emergency {{messages from the}} flight management computer, including rudder ratio, mach speed trim, overspeed, <b>underspeed</b> and flying too low. The crew declared an emergency and requested an immediate return to the airport.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydrogen}} fuel leak {{in one of}} the SSMEs on STS-93 resulted in a slight <b>underspeed</b> at MECO, but was not an ATO, and the shuttle achieved its planned orbit; if the leak had been more severe, it might have necessitated an ATO, RTLS, or TAL abort.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of an abort to orbit, where the shuttle is unable to reach the ISS orbit and the thermal {{protection}} system inspections suggest the shuttle cannot return to Earth safely, the ISS may be capable of descent down to meet the shuttle. Such a procedure is known as a joint <b>underspeed</b> recovery.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSedimentation {{equilibrium}} (SE) analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a {{gold standard}} for the rigorous determination of macromolecular buoyant molar masses and the thermodynamic study of reversible interactions in solution. A significant experimental drawback is the long time required to attain SE, which is usually {{on the order of}} days. We have developed a method for time-optimized SE (toSE) with defined time-varying centrifugal fields that allow SE to be attained in a significantly (up to 10 -fold) shorter time than is usually required. To achieve this, numerical Lamm equation solutions for sedimentation in time-varying fields are computed based on initial estimates of macromolecular transport properties. A parameterized rotor-speed schedule is optimized with the goal of achieving a minimal time to equilibrium while limiting transient sample preconcentration {{at the base of the}} solution column. The resulting rotor-speed schedule may include multiple over- and <b>underspeeding</b> phases, balancing the formation of gradients from strong sedimentation fluxes with periods of high diffusional transport. The computation is carried out in a new software program called TOSE, which also facilitates convenient experimental implementation. Further, we extend AUC data analysis to sedimentation processes in such time-varying centrifugal fields. Due to the initially high centrifugal fields in toSE and the resulting strong migration, it is possible to extract sedimentation coefficient distributions from the early data. This can provide better estimates of the size of macromolecular complexes and report on sample homogeneity early on, which may be used to further refine the prediction of the rotor-speed schedule. In this manner, the toSE experiment can be adapted in real time to the system under study, maximizing both the information content and the time efficiency of SE experiments...|$|R
50|$|In deliberation, only Father Giles and Jakob {{express the}} desire to graduate. The experts also feel similarly, but note that Father Giles' only issue, being <b>underspeed,</b> is fully addressed, while Jakob's issue, road rage, still needs work. Because of this, Father Giles graduates, but not before {{everyone}} salutes him with his signature two thumbs up pose.|$|E

50|$|Straight Line with a Twist — The {{season finale}} kicks off with Canada's Worst Driver 3s Straight Line challenge, {{but with a}} (literal) twist in the middle. Contestants must {{accelerate}} to 40 km/h between two concrete barriers with only 8 cm clearance on either side. Ashley manages to calm down enough to finish after 20 minutes, while it only takes Amy (going last and thinking strategically) 10 minutes (all of her previous runs were <b>underspeed).</b> Emily fails in her hour.|$|E
50|$|In newer {{models of}} constant-speed {{propeller}}s, oil is pumped through the propeller shaft to push on a piston {{that drives the}} mechanism to change pitch. The flow of oil and the pitch are controlled by a governor, consisting of a speeder spring, flyweights, and a pilot valve. The tension of the speeder spring is set by the propeller control lever, which sets the RPMs. The governor will maintain that RPM setting until an engine overspeed or <b>underspeed</b> condition exists. When an overspeed condition occurs, the propeller begins to rotate faster than the desired RPM setting. This would occur as the plane descends and airspeed increases. The flyweights begin to pull outward due to centrifugal force which further compresses the speeder spring. As that happens, the piston moves forward, allowing the pilot valve to open and oil to flow from the oil sump into the hub. This increase in oil pressure will increase the {{pitch of the propeller}} angle causing it to slow back down to the desired RPM setting. When an <b>underspeed</b> condition occurs, as in a climb with loss of airspeed, just the opposite takes place. The airspeed decreases, causing the propeller to slow down. This will cause the flyweights to move inward due to a lack in centrifugal force and tension will be released from the speeder spring. As this happens, the piston will move in the opposite direction causing the pilot valve to allow oil to flow from the hub back to the oil sump. The propeller blade angle will now decrease to a lower pitch allowing the propeller to speed back up to the desired RPM setting. This process usually takes place frequently throughout flight.|$|E
50|$|Swerve and Avoid - In this episode's lesson, Philippe {{teaches the}} contestants to swerve, {{emphasizing}} to never brake while swerving. The contestants have three attempts to accelerate to 35 km/h (originally 40 km/h, but lowered {{at the last}} moment) and swerve in the direction opposite where a fake taxi appears, either {{to the left or}} the right. Amy, going first, fails her three runs (the first when she swerved towards the fake taxi, the second one when she was confused by the absence of either fake taxi, the third by swerving too wide). Emily also fails her three runs, partly due to her poor vision and partly due to poor cornering. Ashley, motivated by her son's first birthday {{at the end of the}} week (which she will miss if she does not graduate this episode), also fails her three runs, driving into the fake cab every time. She is also there to watch Lindsay fail her three runs (once while <b>underspeed).</b> Teagan also fails his three runs from oversteering.|$|E
40|$|The present paper compares control {{strategies}} for fixed pitch Tidal Current Turbines and introduces the <b>underspeed</b> control technique. The {{state of the}} art approach of overspeed control for fixed pitch turbine increases the tip speed ratio to limit the power output of the turbine. This leads to a high fatigue loading as the number of load cycles increases and requires a specific rotor design not to increase the thrust coefficient as well. The <b>underspeed</b> controller on the other side reduces the tip speed ratio resulting in a reduced thrust coefficient and a reduced number of load cycles. However, this point of operation is unstable based on the characteristic curves of the rotor and needs to be stabilized by the controller. The basic structure of the controller as well as the calculated stability limits will be shown in the paper. Further, the performance of the <b>underspeed</b> controller regarding loads is compared to {{state of the art}} fixed and variable pitch controllers. The paper concludes with an analysis of the impacts on the turbine design and further potential and issues arising with the <b>underspeed</b> control approach...|$|E
40|$|Compressor {{performance}} was mapped during the Brayton cycle power system testing. The range of testing included three shaft speeds: the design speed of 36, 000 rpm, 10 percent overspeed (39, 600 rpm), and 10 percent <b>underspeed</b> (32, 400 rpm). A range of compressor inlet temperatures from 60 F to 120 F and discharge pressures from 20 to 45 psia were included. The effects of turbine inlet temperatures (from 1200 F to 1600 F) on the compressor were also studied. The data presented include plots of weight flow, compressor pressure ratio, efficiency, and temperature-rise ratio...|$|E
