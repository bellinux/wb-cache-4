40|$|We {{specify a}} set of {{equations}} defining a dynamic model of international migration and estimate its parameters by using data specially collected in Mexico. We then used it to project the a hypothetical Mexican community population forward in time. Beginning with a stable population of 10, 000 people, we project ahead 50 years under three different assumptions: no international migration; constant probabilities of in- and out-migration, and dynamic schedules of out- and in-migration that change as migratory experience accumulates. This exercise represents an attempt to model the self-feeding character of international migration noted by prior observers and theorists. Our model quantifies the mechanisms of cumulative causation predicted by social capital theory and illustrates the shortcomings of standard projection methodologies. The failure to model dynamically changing migration schedules yields a 5 % overstatement of the projected size of the Mexican population after 50 years, an 11 % <b>understatement</b> <b>of</b> {{the total number of}} U. S. migrants, a 15 % <b>understatement</b> <b>of</b> the prevalence of U. S. migratory experience in the Mexican population, and an 85 % <b>understatement</b> <b>of</b> the size of the Mexican population living in the United States...|$|R

40|$|Travel cost {{models are}} {{regularly}} {{used to determine}} the value of recreational sites or particular site characteristics, yet a key site attribute, congestion, is often excluded from such analyses. One of several reasons is that congestion (unlike many other site attributes) is determined in equilibrium by the process of individuals sorting across sites, and thus presents significant endogeneity problems. This paper illustrates this source of endogeneity, describes how previous research has dealt with it by way of stated preference techniques, and describes an instrumental variables approach to address it in a revealed preference context. We demonstrate that failing to address the endogeneity of congestion will likely lead to the <b>understatement</b> <b>of</b> its costs, and possibly to the mistaken recovery of agglomeration benefits. We apply our technique to the valuation of a large recreational fishing site in Wisconsin (Lake Winnebago) which, if eliminated, would induce significant re-sorting of anglers amongst remaining sites. In our application, ignoring congestion leads to an <b>understatement</b> <b>of</b> the lake’s value by more than 50 percent.

40|$|The {{presence}} of third-party guarantees such as insurance guaranty funds can induce managers of covered institutions to take actions {{that increase the}} level of risk or increase vulnerability to unfavorable developments. This paper presents evidence of these effects taking place under insurance guaranty funds. The strongest evidence appears for Commercial Multi-Peril insurance, where the enactment of a guarnaty fund {{is associated with a}} significant decline in a state's loss ratio. Similar effects appear in Homeowners' Multi-Peril coverage, although evidence for Homeowners' is not as strong as for Commercial Multi-Peril coverage. The observed decline in the loss ratio is not explained by other factors such as state regulation, investment yields, or other time-related trends. The observed decline is too large to be explained by the level of guaranty fund assessments. <b>Understatement</b> <b>of</b> expected future claim payments ("underreserving") offers the most plausible explanation. A concluding section of the paper discusses a pricing model for guaranty fund coverage that could diminish any rewards arising from <b>understatement</b> <b>of</b> future claims. The design of a pricing system could benefit by applying lessons from bank deposit insurance as well as the insurance industry's considerable experience with pricing methods to overcome moral hazards. ...|$|R
