30|$|The Dutch {{compulsory}} schooling {{law requires}} children {{to go to}} school until the age of 18 or until pre-university, <b>upper</b> <b>secondary</b> general <b>education</b> or <b>upper</b> <b>secondary</b> vocational <b>education</b> is successfully finished (i.e. if a degree is attained). For children enrolled in pre-university of <b>upper</b> <b>secondary</b> general <b>education</b> the law simply enforces that children are in education until they are 18  years old and in general these children manage to successfully finish the educational program. However, the situation is dramatically different for vocational education. Students who successfully finish pre-vocational education are, on average, 16  years old and obliged by law to continue with a vocational training program even if they do not prefer to do so. As a result of this law many children enrol in a vocational training program (level 2, 3 or 4) after successfully finishing pre-vocational education, but might drop out legitimately without a degree after 1 or 2  years when they become 18  years old. This context partly explains, at least for the Netherlands, why dropout in vocational education is relatively high.|$|R
