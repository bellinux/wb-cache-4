Al-though mummies are synonymous with ancient Egypt, few people realize that the ancient Egyptians also mum-mified animals, {{including}} their pets. Pet mummies are the kind of mummy that reso-nates most closely with <b>us</b> <b>now.</b> <b>From</b> the Old Kingdom (c. 2663 - 2195 BC) onward, Egyptians are pictured in their tombs with their beloved pets, thus ensuring their continued joint existence in the Afterlife. Occasionally the pets would even have their names carved above their image, providing further insurance for their eternal life. This was particularly true of hunting dogs that were im-mortalized with their names such as “Swifter than the Gazelle ” or “Slayer of Oryx”. Devoted pet-lovers buried their animals with them. If the animal died during its owner’s lifetime, it was mummified and kept safely until the owner’s death, perhaps even in the tomb that was begun quite early in a person’s life. If the animal died after its owner’s demise, it could be mummified and placed in the tomb with its master, or in the courtyard just outside, {{as was the case with}} a pet monkey excavated outside a tomb in Thebes or a horse associated with the family of Senenmut, the architect of the magnificent funerary temple of Queen Hatshepsut built at Deir el-Bahari. Some pets, like hu-mans, enjoyed splendid burials, complete with elaborate coffins and food offerings. Pets were only one of several kinds of animal mummies, which actually far outnumber human mum-mies. Mummification was carried out in order to pre-serve the body for eternity so that the soul (ka and ba) could inhabit it in the Afterlife. A large range of animal species were mummified, including cattle, baboons, rams...|$|R

But the gospel seed which was sown among our poor, wild, simple, ignorant forefathers, was the seed which fell on an honest and good heart, and took root, and brought forth fruit, some thirty, some fifty, and some one hundred fold. Epiphany came late to us--not for three hundred years after our Lord's birth: but, when it came, the light which it brought remained with us, and lights <b>us</b> even <b>now</b> <b>from</b> our cradle to our grave: and so again was fulfilled the Scripture, which says, that God chooses the weak things of this world to confound the strong; the foolish to confound the wise; yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things which are, that no flesh should glory in his presence.|$|R
