40|$|Purpose: Positioning {{mechanically}} ventilated pa-tients in {{an adequate}} semi-recumbent position {{is a low}} cost and apparently easy applied measure to prevent new VAP. We performed an <b>unannounced</b> <b>audit</b> to compare the actual backrest angle with the target backrest angle of 30 - 45 degrees, assess whether compliance was better in patients whose bed had a built-in bedside protractor, and docu-ment diffi culties reported when failing to achieve the target backrest angle. Methods: From 1 / 3 / 2007 to 30 / 6 / 2007, unannounced ad hoc inspections were made on patients receiving mechanical ventilation {{in the intensive care}} unit. During inspections, the angle of elevation of bed was formally measured by a manual technique us-ing a hand-held protractor. The nurse at bed-side was also asked to estimate the angle of elevation of bed without referring to the built-in protractor and interviewed with a structured questionnaire. Results: From 1 / 3 / 2007 to 30 / 6 / 2007, inspections were made on 295 occasions. The median angle o...|$|R
40|$|Background A {{surgical}} safety checklist (SSC) {{was implemented}} and routinely evaluated within our hos-pital. The {{purpose of this}} study was to analyze compliance, knowledge of and satisfaction with the SSC to determine further improvements. Methods The implementation of the SSC was observed in a pilot unit. After roll-out into each operat-ing theater, compliance with the SSC was routinely measured. To assess subjective and objective knowledge, as well as satisfaction with the SSC implementation, an online survey (N = 891) was performed. Results During two test runs in a piloting unit, 305 operations were observed, 175 in test run 1 and 130 in test run 2. The SSC was used in 77. 1 % of all operations in test run 1 and in 99. 2 % in test run 2. Within used SSCs, completion rates were 36. 3 % in test run 1 and 1. 6 % in test run 2.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study is to}} {{investigate}} whether the preschool teachers in three districts in a medium size city in Sweden utilize the hallway, where parents drop off and pick up their kids, in a manner conducive to language developing. I am interested in finding out whether there are any differences between the districts. The method I have used is non-participatory observations. My theoretical starting point is Lev Vygotsky's sociocultural theory. My interest was piqued when I read {{a report from the}} Swedish Schools Inspectorate (Skolinspektionen). In 2015 the Swedish Schools Inspectorate conducted <b>unannounced</b> <b>audits</b> at 196 randomly selected preschools throughout the country. Several preschools had difficulties living up to their pedagogical duties. Against this background, I think it is interesting to investigate whether this is true also for the preschools in the medium size city in Sweden. The results of my study show that language development for all children in the hallway requires a combination of several strategies. The results also show that it takes more than verbal communication to make a situation language developing. There are strategies that all preschool teachers in the three districts is working with in the hallway. But the result also shows that there are differences in strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|Changes {{are needed}} to improve {{transparency}} and competitiveness in Australia’s cattle and beef markets, with an ACCC study highlighting shortcomings in price reporting, a lack of trust in the carcass grading system, and concerns about anti-competitive conduct affecting competition in cattle and beef sales. The findings arose from a detailed market study the ACCC conducted into beef and cattle markets in Australia, which involved consultations with {{all parts of the}} supply chain, and analysis of available market information and industry data. The ACCC’s fifteen recommendations cover issues including: 	improving price information by requesting that meat processors publish price grids for sales made direct to processors. This {{will make it easier for}} producers to consider and compare price offers. Nationally, the vast majority of prime cattle are sold this way 	an increase in the frequency of AUS-MEAT’s random and <b>unannounced</b> <b>audits</b> of cattle grading and trimming in processing plants to improve integrity in the system 	the introduction of an independent dispute resolution process to apply across the industry 	the prioritisation of objective carcase measurement technology to increase the accuracy and transparency of carcase assessments, and the sharing of the data arising from the technology with cattle producers 	the introduction of a buyers register and post auction buyers report for major saleyards 	expanded reporting of historical prices to make it easier for producers to compare prices paid for cattle sold through saleyards, paddock sales and over-the-hoo...|$|E
50|$|On 1 July 1977, 96% of Aeroamerica's unionised German {{flight attendants}} voted {{in favour of}} strike action in a ballot held by the German Salaried Employees' Union. They demanded pay parity with their colleagues working for Pan Am's Internal German Services (IGS) {{division}} and employment contracts governed by local labour law to bring them in line with their unionised counterparts at other Allied airlines that employed their flight attendants locally. The company countered these demands by arguing {{that the nature of}} its business required flight attendants to be stationed anywhere, involving frequent postings to overseas stations at short notice to cover global ad hoc and lease commitments. It furthermore argued that adopting other Allied airlines' local employment conditions and pay for its own flight attendants would restrict operational flexibility and increase costs, that this would undermine its ability to compete globally and that the worldwide nature of its operations made all flight attendants' employment conditions subject to American labour law as well as CAB and FAA regulations to comply with US legal requirements. Initially, the airline was able to maintain its full flying programme {{at the beginning of the}} busy summer holiday period despite staff not showing up for work, following the first week of unsuccessful negotiations between Aeroamerica's local management and the DAG union. However, the conflict escalated during the second week when the local management dismissed without notice two flight attendants who had picketed a Tegel-bound flight in Brussels. As the conflict was still unresolved by the end of July and threatened to disrupt the holiday plans of thousands of West Berliners during the peak month of August, management attempted to break the flight attendants' strike by temporarily reducing the number of flight attendants from four to three per aircraft as well as by hiring contract labour from an unnamed UK airline. As these developments further aggravated the already tense standoff between the airline and its flight attendants' union, the latter sought to increase pressure on the company to settle the dispute by airing its members' grievancies in public. It alleged that Aeroamerica's policy of only complying with minimum FAA requirements resulted in overworking flight attendants, putting lives of crew and passengers at risk in case of an emergency. Despite the negative publicity, management refused to return to the negotiating table and the strike eventually collapsed as the peak summer season drew to a close by the end of August. Following the end of the labour unrest at the company, the FAA subjected Aeroamerica to an <b>unannounced</b> safety <b>audit</b> later the same year. The airline's management alleged that the FAA's move had been prompted by a dismissed flight attendant's act of revenge.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate the Eskom customer safety education programme in the Queenstown Customer Services Area. The research focuses on the implementation of the programme with the aim of assessing whether there is need for optimisation {{in the way that the}} customer education and training is delivered. The paper consists of three sections. Section one is directed to Eskom and is made up of (i) a review of the literature that is relevant to the Eskom safety education programme, (ii) the findings made from the study and (iii) recommendations from the author. Section two is a review of the key concepts which were identified for this paper and these are: (i) education and training, (ii) consumer education, (iii) citizenship education, (iv) training programme development, and (v) training programme evaluation. Section three provides detail on and justifies the research methodology that was followed for this paper. The author adopted the deductive approach and collected data from literature sources and Eskom documents as well as face-to-face interviews with the Eskom trainers and customers. Qualitative data was collected from the interviews and is presented in section one of the report in the form of (i) narratives, (ii) graphs and (iii) tables. The research has identified some shortcomings in the delivery of the training and recommendations have been made on how these shortcomings can be addressed. Trainer skills, training evaluation and training tools are amongst the issues that require attention in the Queenstown Customer Services Area. The results revealed that 67 percent of the trainers have not received training related to conducting customer forums. Inconsistencies with regard to the evaluation of the training interventions were also identified and there were differences in terms of the training tools that are utilised at the forums. The recommendations made by the author are based on the literature that was reviewed as part of this study and are aimed at addressing the delivery of the training. The respondents all displayed an understanding of the objectives of the Eskom safety education programme and made recommendations in terms of how Eskom can reduce the tampering of Eskom equipment. The recommendations made included the involvement of the community as well as <b>unannounced</b> door-to-door <b>audits</b> aimed at identifying damaged and tampered Eskom equipment. These recommendations are in line with the guiding principles of safety education presented in McWhirter (2008 : 32) which include the involvement of young people in real decisions to help them stay safe, as well as the use of active approaches in addressing safety issues. A review of the electrical contact incidents which were reported to Eskom in 2011 / 12 revealed that in 61, 5 percent of the cases that occurred in the Eastern Cape, Eskom had conducted electricity safety education before the incidents occurred. The recommendations in terms of the training delivery should be implemented to improve the delivery of the training. The author however recommends further research on how Eskom can reduce the number of electrical contact incidents that occur, as it has been proven through previous studies that safety education “has an impact on knowledge, behaviour, risk and skills and no papers have provided evidence of the impact of safety education on injury rates” (Mulvaney, Watson and Errington, 2012 : 27) ...|$|R

In 2014, 164 (18. 4 %) operating team members responded to the online survey, 160 of which were included in the analysis. 146 (91. 3 %) consultants and nursing staff reported to use the SSC regularly in daily routine. These data show that the implementation of new tools such as the adapted WHO SSC needs constant supervision and instruction until it becomes self-evident and accepted. Further efforts, consisting mainly of hands-on leadership and training are necessary...|$|E
