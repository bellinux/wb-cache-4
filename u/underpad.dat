5000|$|Mattress pad: Also {{known as}} a {{mattress}} topper, or <b>underpad.</b> This is used above the mattress and beneath a bottom sheet to add comfort.|$|E
50|$|In {{hospital}} or other medical settings, a disposable <b>underpad</b> {{may be used}} to absorb blood and other bodily fluid, in concert with a hospital gown. This is sometimes light blue and known as chux pad, after an old brand name for a disposable diaper.|$|E
5000|$|A {{mattress}} pad, mattress topper, or <b>underpad</b> {{is designed}} to lie atop a mattress. Made primarily from foam, its function {{is to provide a}} layer of comfort and warmth between the user and the mattress. It is of particular benefit when the existing mattress is worn or uncomfortable. Toppers quite often have a contoured profile to facilitate airflow. Visco-elastic foam toppers are regularly used in medical institutions because of their pressure relieving properties. The foam used in the construction of these memory foam toppers reacts to both pressure and temperature. This, combined with its greater density, are properties that give them their characteristic [...] "weightlessness" [...] sensation.|$|E

50|$|Halfway {{between a}} halberd and a spear, the tepoztopilli was equally useful for {{slashing}} and thrusting. Conquistador Bernal Díaz del Castillo mentions that {{on one occasion}} his armour was pierced by an Aztec lance and that only his thick cotton <b>underpadding</b> saved his life. The last authentic tepoztopilli was destroyed in a fire in 1884 in the Armería Real in Madrid where it was housed.|$|R
50|$|A limited-edition {{version of}} the Republic album, {{entitled}} Republic - The Limited Run.., was also released in the United States. Although the tracks {{are the same as}} the normal release, the packaging is entirely different. Instead of a jewel case, the CD comes in a folding wallet made of bright orange vinyl <b>underpadded</b> with soft foam, giving it the feel of an inner tube. The CD's label is also redesigned, with no words but with a picture of several orange rubber inner tubes against a background of flames, a reference to the cover artwork. The booklet, tucked into a pocket of the vinyl wallet, {{is the same as the}} standard version, but made of a plastic waterproof material instead of paper.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{model for}} the Mode I popcorn effect is {{presented}} here for packages with rectangular die pads (P-DSO). A package "stability parameter," relating to its moisture sensitivity, {{is derived from the}} popcorn model. It describes the critical factors for a robust package-molding compound properties and package, leadframe design for a given preconditioning and soldering process. Furthermore, nomograms generated from the model facilitate an easy estimation of moisture sensitivity levels (between 1 and 5) of packages with different die pad sizes and molding compound <b>underpad</b> thicknesses and for different soldering temperatures ranging from 220 °C to 260 °C (lead-free soldering) ...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is on {{improving}} the understanding of mechanical and tribological mechanisms in microelectronic wire bonding. In particular, it focusses on the development and application of quantitative models of ultrasonic (US) friction and interfacial wear in wire bonding. Another objective of the thesis {{is to develop a}} low-stress Cu ball bonding process that minimizes damage to the microchip. These are accomplished through experimental measurements of in situ US tangential force by piezoresistive microsensors integrated next to the bonding zone using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The processes investigated are thermosonic (TS) Au ball bonding on Al pads (Au-Al process), TS Cu ball bonding on Al pads (Cu-Al process), and US Al wedge-wedge bonding on Al pads (Al-Al process). TS ball bonding processes are optimized with one Au and two Cu wire types, obtaining average shear strength (SS) of more than 120 MPa. Ball bonds made with Cu wire show at least 15 % higher SS than those made with Au wire. However, 30 % higher US force induced to the bonding pad is measured for the Cu process using the microsensor, which increases the risk of <b>underpad</b> damage. The US force can be reduced by: (i) using a Cu wire type that produces softer deformed ball results in a measured US force reduction of 5 %; and (ii) reducing the US level to 0. 9 times the conventionally optimized level, the US force can be reduced by 9 %. It is shown that using a softer Cu deformed ball and a reduced US level reduces the extra stress observed with Cu wire compared to Au wire by 42 %. To study the combined effect of bond force (BF) and US in Cu ball bonding, the US parameter is optimized for eight levels of BF. For ball bonds made with conventionally optimized BF and US settings, the SS is ≈ 140 MPa. The amount of Al pad splash extruding out of bonded ball interface (for conventionally optimized BF and US settings) is between 10 – 12 µm. It can be reduced to 3 – 7 µm if accepting a SS reduction to 50 – 70 MPa. For excessive US settings, elliptical shaped Cu bonded balls are observed, with the major axis perpendicular to the US direction. By using a lower value of BF combined with a reduced US level, the US force can be reduced by 30 % while achieving an average SS of at least 120 MPa. These process settings also aid in reducing the amount of splash by 4. 3 µm. The US force measurement is like a signature of the bond as it allows for detailed insight into the tribological mechanisms during the bonding process. The relative amount of the third harmonic of US force in the Cu-Al process is found to be five times smaller than in the Au-Al process. In contrast, in the Al-Al process, a large second harmonic content is observed, describing a non-symmetric deviation of the force signal waveform from the sinusoidal shape. This deviation might be due to the reduced geometrical symmetry of the wedge tool. The analysis of harmonics of the US force indicates that although slightly different from each other, stick-slip friction is an important mechanism in all these wire bonding variants. A friction power theory is used to derive the US friction power during Au-Al, Cu-Al, and Al-Al processes. Auxiliary measurements include the current delivered to the US transducer, the vibration amplitude of the bonding tool tip in free-air, and the US tangential force acting on the bonding pad. For bonds made with typical process parameters, several characteristic values used in the friction power model such as the ultrasonic compliance of the bonding system and the profile of the relative interfacial sliding amplitude are determined. The maximum interfacial friction power during Al-Al process is at least 11. 5 mW (3. 9 W/mm²), which is only about 4. 8 % of the total electrical power delivered to the US transducer. The total sliding friction energy delivered to the Al-Al wedge bond is 60. 4 mJ (20. 4 J/mm²). For the Au-Al and Cu-Al processes, the US friction power is derived with an improved, more accurate method to derive the US compliance. The method uses a multi-step bonding process. In the first two steps, the US current is set to levels that are low enough to prevent sliding. Sliding and bonding take place during the third step, when the current is ramped up to the optimum value. The US compliance values are derived from the first two steps. The average maximum interfacial friction power is 10. 3 mW (10. 8 W/mm²) and 16. 9 mW (18. 7 W/mm²) for the Au-Al and Cu-Al processes, respectively. The total sliding friction energy delivered to the bond is 48. 5 mJ (50. 3 J/mm²) and 49. 4 mJ (54. 8 J/mm²) for the Au-Al and Cu-Al processes, respectively. Finally, the sliding wear theory is used to derive the amount of interfacial wear during Au-Al and Cu-Al processes. The method uses the US force and the derived interfacial sliding amplitude as the main inputs. The estimated total average depth of interfacial wear in Au-Al and Cu-Al processes is 416 nm and 895 nm, respectively. However, the error of estimation of wear in both the Au-Al and the Cu-Al processes is ≈ 50 %, making this method less accurate than the friction power and energy results. Given the error in the determination of compliance in the Al-Al process, the error in the estimation of wear in the Al-Al process might have been even larger; hence the wear results pertaining to the Al-Al process are not discussed in this study...|$|E
40|$|This {{systematic}} review considers the evidence supporting {{the use of}} prophylactic dressings {{for the prevention of}} pressure ulcer. Electronic database searches were conducted on 25 July 2013. The searches found 3026 titles and after removal of duplicate records 2819 titles were scanned against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 2777 were excluded based on their title and abstract primarily because they discussed pressure ulcer healing, the prevention and treatment of other chronic and acute wounds or where the intervention was not a prophylactic dressing (e. g. <b>underpads,</b> heel protectors and cushions). Finally, the full text of 42 papers were retrieved. When these 42 papers were reviewed, 21 were excluded and 21 were included in the review. The single high-quality randomised controlled trial (RCT) and the growing number of cohort, weak RCT and case series all suggest that the introduction of a dressing as part of pressure ulcer prevention may help reduce pressure ulcer incidence associated with medical devices especially in immobile intensive care unit patients. There is no firm clinical evidence at this time to suggest that one dressing type is more effective than other dressing...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of my {{research}} was to advance {{our understanding of the}} potential for novel compliant flooring systems to reduce the risk for fall-related injuries in older adults, including fall-related traumatic brain injury (TBI). This entailed an assessment of how these floors affect the competing demands of fall-related TBI – impact severity attenuation in concert with minimal concomitant impairments to balance control and postural stability. Two studies are included as part of this thesis. The first study used a mechanical drop tower to assess the effects of four traditional flooring systems and six novel compliant flooring conditions on the impact dynamics of a surrogate headform during the impact phase of simulated ‘worst- case’ head impacts. The second study entailed an assessment of the effect of two traditional and three novel compliant floors on the initial phase of the compensatory balance reactions of older adult men and women living in a residential-care facility environment following an externally induced perturbation using a tether-release paradigm. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that novel compliant floors substantially attenuate the forces and accelerations applied to the head during simulated worst- case impacts when compared to traditional flooring surfaces such as vinyl and carpet with <b>underpadding.</b> These benefits are achieved without compromising indices of balance control, supported by the finding that parameters characterizing early compensatory balance reactions were unaffected by the novel compliant floors tested. This work supports the introduction of pilot installations of novel compliant flooring systems into environments with high incidences of falls to test their effectiveness at reducing fall-related injuries in clinical settings...|$|R
40|$|This {{systematic}} review aimed {{to evaluate the}} best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of topical skin care interventions for residents of aged care facilities. Introduction. Natural changes to skin, as well as increased predisposition to pressure sores and incontinence, means residents of aged care facilities readily require topical skin care. A range of interventions exist that aim to maintain or improve the integrity of skin of older adults. Methods. Pubmed, Embase, Current Contents, CINAHL and The Cochrane Library databases were searched, as well as Health Technology Assessment websites up to April 2003. Systematic reviews and randomized or non-randomized controlled trials were evaluated for quality and data were independently extracted by two reviewers. Results. The effectiveness of topical skin interventions was variable and dependent on the skin condition being treated. Studies examined the effectiveness of washing products on incontinence irritated skin. Disposable bodyworns may prevent deterioration of skin condition better than non-disposable <b>underpads</b> or bodyworns. Clinisan, a no-rinse cleanser may {{reduce the incidence of}} incontinence associated pressure ulcers when compared with soap and water. Conclusion. In general the quality of evidence for interventions to improve or maintain the skin condition in the older person was poor and more research in this area is needed. Relevance to Clinical Practice. Skin care is a major issue for nurses working with older people. On the basis of this review no clear recommendations can be made. This lack of strong evidence for nurses to base effective practice decisions is problematic. However, the 2 ̆ 7 best 2 ̆ 7 evidence suggests that disposable bodyworns are a good investment in the fight against skin deterioration. No rinse cleansers are to be preferred over soap {{and the use of the}} bag bath appears to be a useful practice to reduce the risk of dry skin (a risk factor for breaches in skin integrity) ...|$|R
