30|$|In the {{standard}} BP algorithm, all value r_ij^l should be <b>updated</b> before <b>updating</b> all value g_ij^l. We observe that, since the sub-codes Pe′ in transmission vectors {{should not be}} connected {{to each other as}} shown by (4), all value r_ij^l for <b>updating</b> g_ij^(l+ 1) of kth sub-code have already been <b>updated</b> before <b>updating</b> r_ij^l of the (k+ 1)th sub-code, 1 ≤k≤(Ng− 1). Therefore, the <b>updating</b> of g_ij^(l+ 1) for kth sub-code can be computed in parallel with the <b>updating</b> of r_ij^l for (k+ 1)th sub-code.

5|$|Agitos {{original}} {{release was}} plagued with multiple issues including long load times, which the team sought to rectify through <b>updates.</b> After the initial release, a Club Activities system {{was going to}} be added. Similar to the Guilds of previous games, players could ally with them, engage in activities unique to the clubs and compete with rival clubs in contests. From the end of July to mid August during the game's original release, it was featured in a crossover with Rise of Mana, a mobile installment in Square Enix's Mana series. An earlier collaboration was also staged between Agito and Square Enix Legend World, a Japan-exclusive browser game. Eventually, it was determined by the developers that Agito was no longer suited for continued <b>updates.</b> The game was shut down on November 30, 2015. As part of its announcement of the game's shutdown, Square Enix said that a new updated version was being prepared that would be better suited for further <b>updates</b> and improved player experience. This updated version was revealed to be Final Fantasy Type-0 Online, a 2016 multiplayer game for similar platforms to Agito.|$|E

These included the ability to select all playable characters from the game and its downloadable content (DLC) to be used in all combat and predator challenge maps. Previously, each map had predefined character selection; the addition of a harder difficulty setting on combat challenges; more round-based challenges as well as interior map locations; and the removal of the blue wall around the challenges, which players found distracting.|$|E

40|$|Katsuno and Mendelzon have {{distinguished}} two abstract {{frameworks for}} reasoning about change: theory revision and theory <b>update.</b> Theory re-vision involves {{a change in}} knowledge or belief {{with respect to a}} static world. By contrast, theory <b>update</b> involves a change of knowledge or belief in a changing world. In this paper we are concerned with theory <b>update.</b> Winslett has shown that theory <b>update</b> should be computed model at a time. " Accordingly, we focus exclusively on <b>update</b> of interpretations. We begin with a study of revision programming, introduced by Marek and Truszczynski to formalize interpretation <b>update</b> in a language similar to logic programming. While revision programs provide a useful and natural de nition of interpretation <b>update,</b> they are limited to a fairly restricted set of <b>update</b> rules. Accordingly, we introduce the more general notion of rule <b>update</b> | interpretation <b>update</b> by arbitrary sets of inference rules. We show that Winslett's approach to <b>update</b> by means of arbitrary sets of formulae corresponds to a simple subclass of rule <b>update.</b> We also spec-ify a simple embedding of rule <b>update</b> in Reiter's default logic, obtained by augmenting the original <b>update</b> rules with default rules encoding the commonsense law of inertia | the principle that things change only when they are made to. / 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>updating</b> of an agent's knowledge. We propose a formal method of knowledge <b>update</b> {{on the basis of}} the semantics of modal logic S 5. In our method, an <b>update</b> is specified according to the minimal change on both the agent's actual world and knowledge. We discuss general minimal change properties of knowledge <b>update</b> and show that our knowledge <b>update</b> operator satisfies all the <b>update</b> postulates of Katsuno and Mendelzon. We characterize several specific forms of knowledge <b>update</b> which have important applications in reasoning about change of agents' knowledge. We also examine the persistence property of knowledge and ignorance associated with knowledge <b>update.</b> We then investigate the computational complexity of model checking for knowledge <b>update.</b> We first show that in general the model checking for knowledge <b>update</b> is Σ 2 P-complete. We then identify a subclass of knowledge <b>update</b> problems that has polynomial time complexity for model checking. We point out that some important knowledge <b>update</b> problems belong to this subclass. We further address another interesting subclass of knowledge <b>update</b> problems for which the complexity of model checking is NP-complete...|$|R
