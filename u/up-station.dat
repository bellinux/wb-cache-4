50|$|From 1830 - 1920 royal {{succession}} {{was among}} cousins that is, if a Fon passed on, his cousin took over. Reasons {{why they were}} short lived. In 1920 {{following the death of}} Ga Nyamyin II, and with the intervention of British Administrative soldiers from <b>up-station</b> Bamenda, who had just taken over from the Germans after World War I, Galabe III was enthroned taking over directly from the immediate father. This marked the end of succession by cousins. The British, Balikumbat king makers and the entire population made a pact for direct hereditary.|$|E
60|$|The animals {{which appear}} {{to support the}} hard work and {{irregular}} food with the least deterioration are the bullocks. Of these {{a very small number}} indeed have been ill, and the deaths amount to only one or two weekly. They look in really good condition, and perform their work admirably. Indeed, the greater part of the mules and ponies look in fair condition, and they have certainly no lack of food, except at the <b>up-stations.</b> Very great credit is due to the commissariat department, who have done very well, and against whom one never hears a complaint. Since the first landing they have had an abundance of stores for the men; and no instance has, as far as I have heard, occurred of men being unable to obtain their proper rations. The Commander-in-chief is making every effort to strengthen the transport train, and has gazetted a number of unattached subalterns for it. He has also, I believe, applied to the native regiments here for volunteers for that corps; among the subalterns, I hear, there have been few, if any, answers in the affirmative. I understand that the European regiments have also been applied to for volunteers among the noncommissioned officers and men, to act as inspectors in the train. Among these, as among the officers, I hear the appeal has not been responded to. The work of the train is tremendously hard; and men fancy, and perhaps with reason, that they have less chance of going forward to the front in the train than they would have in their own regiments. There would have been no difficulty originally in obtaining any number of men from the regiments not coming to Abyssinia, as men would have volunteered for the very reason that makes the men here refuse to do soâ€”namely, that they wished to see the war; in addition to which, as I have said, the pay in the train is really very good.|$|R
