25|$|On June 13, 1989, five park {{guests were}} injured on the Loch Ness Monster roller coaster when a train {{collided}} with a tree at an estimated 15mph. The tree had been blown onto the coaster's tracks by a sudden storm. The collision happened on a slightly banked right turn that follows a minor descent from the coaster's second lift hill. There were supposedly twenty-five riders in the train {{at the time of}} the incident. A 16-year-old boy suffered a broken leg, but he was later released in stable condition. Four other people were treated for minor injuries. While the riders were stranded, another train began its usual course. The train plummeted down the ride's 114-foot major descent just before passing through the <b>upper</b> <b>loop</b> of the coaster's two interlocking loops. The stranded riders feared for the worst as the train passed through the first loop. The trapped riders were relieved when the ride's safety features functioned properly and stopped the other train. The train involved in the collision was severely damaged when the front right corner of the first car was totally torn away from the rest of the train.|$|E

[...] The lower loop was to the left, and embraced the high and steep {{projection}} which was crowned by the ruins; the <b>upper</b> <b>loop</b> enclosed a lawny promontory, fringed by thorn and willow. It was easy to reach it from the castle side, for the river ran in this part very quietly among innumerable boulders and over dam-like walls of rock. The place was all enclosed, the wind a stranger, the turf smooth and solid; so it was chosen by Nance to be her bleaching-green.|$|E

5000|$|Doctor 6: <b>Upper</b> right <b>loop.</b> Successive loops {{enable a}} full-playfield {{multiplier}} {{of up to}} 4X. Without Doctor 6 scored, and using default settings, the game's playfield multiplier advances at 0.5X per loop completed, {{and the amount of}} time each step of the multiplier remains active gets shorter until 4X (which is 10 seconds long). With Doctor 6, the playfield multiplier advances by 1 instead of 0.5, again to a maximum of 4X, and the time for each step of the multiplier lengthens. Additionally, every 10th loop enables the Sonic Boom, which reroutes the ball back to the left inlane. The player can then hit the W-H-O shots (right ramp, left entrance lane, <b>upper</b> right <b>loop)</b> in order to earn 10 million per shot.|$|R

The numbers were {{standard}} block numbers with drop shadows. The fonts were vertical in 1992–93, and italicized in 1993–94. The following season, the name font changed to a block font, vertically arched, while the number font changed to a painted style resembling the letters [...] "Tampa Bay" [...] in the logo. This style was also used on the blue alternate in 1998–99, replacing an [...] "electrified" [...] number font used from 1996–98. In 2001–02, the old fonts were replaced with traditional block letters and numbers, which have been used ever since. They also darkened their shades of blue that season from a royal blue to a speed (Indy) blue.|$|R
50|$|To cast on, the yarn is {{put through}} the hole in the lucet from the front, and the yarn in front of the lucet is wound around the prongs twice in a figure-of-eight. The two lower loops are then lifted over the two <b>upper</b> <b>loops</b> using either the fingers or a stick until they come over the horns, and the thread behind the lucet is pulled to tighten the knot. The process is then repeated, but this time only winding the yarn once around the prongs, as there is already a figure-of-eight on the fork. When the desired length is reached, the lucet can be cast off by {{carefully}} lifting the loops off the prongs, passing the remaining thread through them and pulling the knot tight. Any loose thread can be cut off with scissors or tied together to form a closed circle. The cord can be wrapped around the lucet handle as it grows.|$|R

50|$|As with {{motion picture}} cameras, the {{intermittent}} {{motion of the}} gate requires that there be loops {{above and below the}} gate in order to serve as a buffer between the constant speed enforced by the sprockets above and below the gate and the intermittent motion enforced at the gate. Some projectors also have a sensitive trip pin above the gate to guard against the <b>upper</b> <b>loop</b> becoming too big. If the loop hits the pin, it will close the dousers and stop the motor to prevent an excessively large loop from jamming the projector.|$|E
5000|$|One {{technique}} of meme mapping represents the evolution and transmission of a meme {{across time and}} space. Such a meme map uses a figure-8 diagram (an analemma) to map the gestation (in the lower loop), birth (at the choke point), and development (in the <b>upper</b> <b>loop)</b> of the selected meme. Such meme maps are nonscalar, with time mapped onto the y-axis and space onto the x-axis transect. One can read the temporal progression of the mapped meme from south to north on such a meme map. Paull has published a worked example using the [...] "organics meme" [...] (as in organic agriculture).|$|E
5000|$|Among the {{examples}} of counterfeits of high-value collectible coins are the [...] "Omega" [...] coins produced in the early 1970s by an unknown counterfeiter who signed his creations with a miniature Greek letter omega. He {{is believed to have}} made over 20,000 fake 1907 high-relief nominally US$20 gold Double Eagle coins with the signature omega in the claw of the eagle, worth {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} at today's prices. His counterfeits are of such high quality that collectors will pay upwards of $1,000 for one; although a genuine coin sells for about $50,000 to $100,000. The same counterfeiter also counterfeited other US gold coins, including a large quantity of $3 gold pieces, dated 1874, 1878 and 1882, with the 1882 being the most prevalent. Three of the counterfeit $10 gold pieces, the 1910-P, the 1913-P and the 1926-P, have the omega placed upside down within the <b>upper</b> <b>loop</b> of the [...] "R" [...] of [...] "LIBERTY" [...] in the Native American's headdress.|$|E

The maxima of the 13 brightenings observed are listed and characterized; a comparison {{is made with}} a 'normal' flare at 17 : 26 UT on the same day. The HXIS and UVSP data are {{discussed in terms of}} the physical properties, X-ray flux, O V flux, and H-alpha flux. The variations are found to be mainly thermal and purely coronal, with no chromospheric (H-alpha) participation (in contrast to the 17 : 26 flare). Since strong X-ray emissions were observed which should have involved the chromosphere through magnetic-field-line heat conduction, it is proposed that the variations wre produced ina coronal plasmoid magnetically separate from the chromosphere. A mechanism for the evolution of such a plasmoid from the <b>upper</b> <b>loops</b> of a giant X-ray arch is discussed.

50|$|The runic {{inscription}} {{consists of}} text inscribed on a thin interwined beast with one <b>upper</b> <b>loop</b> around a Christian cross and two lower loops. This runestone {{was discovered in}} 1975 being used as building material at the southern buttress of the Vasa burial chapel during renovations at the Uppsala Cathedral. Many runestones have been reused in building, road, and bridge construction before their historical importance was recognized. The runic inscription was carved by the runemaster Öpir, whose signature {{is at the bottom}} of the inscription in a horizontal text band. Öpir was active in the Uppland region during the late eleventh or early twelfth centuries. The inscription is classified as being in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks.|$|E
5000|$|The Corbie type {{as used in}} the 8th century, {{was based}} on uncial and the Luxeuil type, but was also similar to half-uncial and insular script, with {{elements}} of Roman cursive. It is sometimes called [...] "eN-type", as the letter ⟨e⟩ has a high, open <b>upper</b> <b>loop,</b> and the uncial form of the letter ⟨n⟩ (resembling majuscule ⟨N⟩) is very frequently used. After the mid-8th century, the letter (a) also has an open loop and resembles the letter ⟨u⟩; this type {{is referred to as}} [...] "eNa-type". A more distinctive type was developed at Corbie in the 9th century, the [...] "a-b type". The letter ⟨b⟩ is similar to Luxeuil type, but the letter ⟨a⟩ has a straight first stroke, resembling a combination of ⟨i⟩ and ⟨c⟩. This type was used {{from the end of the}} 8th century until the mid-9th century. The Liber glossarum, a major medieval reference work, was written in the [...] "a-b type" [...] script of Corbie.|$|E

50|$|The type object most {{commonly}} used to define Ringerike Style is a 2.15 m high carved stone from Vang in Oppland. Apart from a runic memorial inscription on its right edge, the main field of the Vang Stone is filled with a balanced tendril ornament springing from two shell spirals at the base: the main stems cross twice to terminate in lobed tendrils. At the crossing, further tendrils spring from loops and pear-shaped motifs appear from the tendril centres on the <b>upper</b> <b>loop.</b> Although axial in conception, a basic asymmetry arises in the deposition of the tendrils. Surmounting the tendril pattern appears a large striding animal in double-contoured rendering with spiral hips and a lip lappet. Comparing the Vang Stone animal design with the related animal from the Mammen axe-head, the latter lacks the axiality seen in the Vang Stone and its tendrils are far less disciplined: the Mammen scroll is wavy, while the Vang scroll appears taut and evenly curved, these features marking a key difference between Mammen and Ringerike ornament. The inter-relationship between the two styles is obvious, however, when comparing the Vang Stone animal with that found on the Jelling Stone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inscription}} on U 210 consists of runic {{text in the}} younger futhark that is carved on a serpent that makes three loops and with a cross located in the <b>upper</b> <b>loop.</b> The inscription, which measures 1.5 meters tall by 1.3 meters broad, is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which {{is also known as}} Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. U 210 was described by one runic scholar as being a [...] "good example" [...] of a Pr4 style inscription. The runic text indicates that the inscription was carved by a runemaster with a normalized name of Öpir, who was active in Uppland in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. Öpir was known for using loop patterns in his inscriptions, and used a three loop pattern for U 210. Other signed inscriptions where Öpir used a three loop pattern include U 142 in Fällbro, U 279 in Skälby, U 287 in Vik, U 566 in Vällingsö, U 687 in Sjusta, U 893 in Högby, U 898 in Norby, U 961 in Vaksala, and U 1106 in Äskelunda.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} perform much differently for {{the crews}} {{going up the}} grade. The #70 has more power and does not usually struggle with a loaded train, however the #192, with larger drivers, longer frame, and lower boiler pressure, needs to be run with the throttle wide open and speed adjusted with the Johnson Bar. The first grade {{right out of the}} station is upwards of 5%, and the #192 will stall and need to make another run at the hill if it loses enough momentum. The grade does flatten out for a couple hundred feet as it approaches the Thunderhead Gap bridge. The engineer will blow a warning whistle for the crossing just beyond the bridge, and as the train emerges from the trees, the throttle is opened up as the engine hits the second hill and grinds up the 3-4% grade to the horseshoe curve beyond Sawmill Rd. At the end of this curve, the #192 with its long frame will buck against the curvature which is evidenced by the wear on the frame behind the trailing and pilot trucks. After negotiating a small S-curve through a cut in the hillside, the grade steepens again to about 6% until topping over near the <b>upper</b> <b>loop</b> switch. The crew will need to have enough water in the boiler to keep the crown sheet of the firebox covered for the downhill trip, and while the engineer is blowing the whistle and making the first brake pipe reduction, the fireman is using the raging fire to inject water against the climbing pressure gauge.|$|E

60|$|At {{the eastern}} {{extremity}} of the island, however, was a small, densely-wooded peninsula, with {{a thicket of}} underbrush so closely matted as nearly to prevent the possibility of seeing across it, {{so long as the}} leaves remained on the branches. Near the narrow neck that connected this acre {{with the rest of the}} island, a small blockhouse had been erected, with some attention to its means of resistance. The logs were bullet-proof, squared and jointed with a care to leave no defenceless points; the windows were loopholes, the door massive and small, and the roof, like the rest of the structure, was framed of hewn timber, covered properly with bark to exclude the rain. The lower apartment as usual contained stores and provisions; here indeed the party kept all their supplies; the second story was intended for a dwelling, as well as for the citadel, and a low garret was subdivided into two or three rooms, and could hold the pallets of some ten or fifteen persons. All the arrangements were exceedingly simple and cheap, but they were sufficient to protect the soldiers against the effects of a surprise. As the whole building was considerably less than forty feet high, its summit was concealed by the tops of the trees, except from the eyes of those who had reached the interior of the island. On that side the view was open from the <b>upper</b> <b>loops,</b> though bushes even there, more or less, concealed the base of the wooden tower.|$|R

We evaluate the algorithm on a number of standard WCET benchmarks, giving evidence that it is capable to derive valid bounds for many types of loops. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether the}} oral bioavailability of cyclosporin A is controlled primarily by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or CYP 3 A {{in the small}} intestine. In situ loop method {{was used to evaluate}} the uptake of cyclosporin A (40 nmol) at the upper and lower intestine of wild-type and mdr 1 a/ 1 b knockout mice treated or not treated with dexamethasone (75 mg/kg/day, 7 days, i. p.). Expression of CYP 3 A mRNA in the control group was higher in the upper than the lower intestine, while that of the multidrug resistance- 1 a (mdr 1 a) mRNA was in the opposite order. Dexamethasone administration potently induced CYP 3 A and mdr 1 a mRNAs in the lower and upper intestine, respectively. At 45 min after cyclosporin A administration into an <b>upper</b> intestinal <b>loop</b> of the control group of wild-type mice, the ratio of residual cyclosporin A to dose did not differ significantly from that of mdr 1 a/ 1 b knockout mice, whereas in dexamethasone-treated wild-type mice, the residual ratio was increased significantly. The ratio of the cyclosporin A metabolite M 17 to cyclosporin A in portal venous blood at an <b>upper</b> intestinal <b>loop</b> of mdr 1 a/ 1 b knockout mice was much higher than that a lower intestinal loop. The M 17 /cyclosporin A ratio of portal venous blood at a lower intestinal loop in mdr 1 a/ 1 b knockout mice was increased significantly by dexamethasone treatment. These results suggest that, under physiological conditions, the oral bioavailability of cyclosporin A is mainly controlled by CYP 3 A in the upper intestine, rather than liver, but when P-gp is induced by steroid, the intestinal absorption of cyclosporin A may be inhibited. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Tidal {{flushing}} {{of animal}} burrows in mangrove swamps provides {{an effective and}} important mechanism for transport of salt and other soluble substances. The burrows have complex morphologies consisting of multiple loops. Using established computational modelling techniques, burrow geometries were simulated from characteristic burrow dimensions {{and the effect of}} multiple loops on flushing is studied. The computational models show that flushing is enhanced in multiple-loop burrows as <b>upper</b> <b>loops</b> can be completely evacuated, increasing the volume of burrow water removed. The models indicate {{that there may be a}} depth limit to which flushing occurs in complex burrow structures. Periscope loops extend further than one characteristic loop depth and are shown to affect the flushing of burrows if the surface-water plume penetrates to their lower depth. Periscope loops with surface openings on the downstream side of the burrow, relative to the tidal inundation, most frequently experience this condition and thus have a great impact on burrow flushing. Field measurements of salinity agree with the hypothesis that there is a depth limit of flushing for complex burrows that is independent of burrow salinity, and suggest a value of 30 – 35 cm. The measurements also support the suggestion that significant flushing of burrows occurs within a single tidal event. An experiment considered the movement of animals across the interface created by low-salinity surface water and high-salinity burrow water after a partial flushing event. The motion enhances the effective diffusion coefficient of salt by a factor of at least 102, as compared with free diffusion of salt in water, resulting in a more even distribution of dissolved salt in the burrow water between tidal inundations. This distribution may lead to an increase in the depth to which flushing occurs during subsequent inundations...|$|R
