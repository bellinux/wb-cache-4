He feels that a certain amount of trouble has been taken on his behalf, that retreat will be cowardly, and that the journey for nothing will be personally disagreeable to his own feelings. And then, too, there was that renewed ambition in his breast,--an ambition which six months ago he would have declared to be at rest for ever,--but which prompted him, now as strongly as ever, to go forward and do something. It is so easy to go and see;--so hard to retreat when one has seen. He had not found Percycross to be especially congenial to him.

40|$|Abstract: Santalum lanceolatum, the {{commercial}} species of sandalwood harvested in Queensland, was worth $ 4. 2 million in export earnings in 1988. The {{ecology of the}} species in natural forests is summarized, and information on seedling regeneration and coppice and root suckering strategies is provided. Stand characteristics and size class distribution in two different environments in northwest Queensland are provided. It is important to manage the resource for conservation. The harvesting guidelines, pricing criteria, and procedures are discussed along with information on heartwood recovery and moisture content of harvested sandalwood. Future research should be <b>undertaken</b> <b>to</b> monitor <b>stand</b> dynamics, growth rates, {{and the effects of}} land use practices on the distribution, growth, and dynamics of sandalwood in natural stands. The trade in this fragrant wood has been going on since the dawn of history and will probably not cease until the connection between santal trees and idolators existing from time immorial, shall have been broken up, by either the one or the other becoming as extinct a race as the Archaepteryx or the Dodo.

His legacy, however, was in his role of Crown Prince, exercised between 1956 and 1969, towards the end of which he was the de facto ruler of Libya. As Crown Prince, he repeatedly undertook official trips abroad, notably to negotiate the purchase of U.S.-built jet fighters from the Kennedy Administration for the Libyan Air Force.|$|R

If, on the contrary, they decided not to defend Thessaly, then the pass of Thermopylæ would be the point at which they must make their stand, and in that case Thessaly must be at liberty to submit on the first Persian summons.|$|R
