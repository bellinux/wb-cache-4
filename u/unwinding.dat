5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, <b>unwinding</b> it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by <b>unwinding</b> of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E

30|$|In the <b>unwind</b> roll process, the {{acceleration}} of the transport speed, the change of radius and the swing of carbon fiber along the core can cause tension deviation from the desired value. Larger acceleration and larger radius cause greater tension deviation. The length of <b>unwind</b> roll and the distance between <b>unwind</b> roll and guide roller can cause tension deviation from the set value periodically.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{investigate}} abstract algebras having the so-called <b>unwind</b> property, i. e., algebras where every total computable function can be defined by open formulas in an adequate first-order language. A method of proving the <b>unwind</b> property is given for {{a special kind of}} algebra. Applying this method we prove that there exists a structure satisfying the <b>unwind</b> property for all flow charts, but not for recursive procedures. We prove also that algebraically closed and real closed fields with infinite degrees of transcendence over their prime subfields satisfy the <b>unwind</b> property for all schemas...|$|R
25|$|An exception-handling {{language}} {{without this}} <b>unwinding</b> is Common Lisp with its Condition System. Common Lisp calls the exception handler {{and does not}} unwind the stack. This allows the program to continue the computation {{at exactly the same}} place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available). The stackless implementation of the Mythryl programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack <b>unwinding.</b>|$|E
25|$|The DNA helicases and polymerases {{must remain}} {{in close contact}} at the {{replication}} fork. If <b>unwinding</b> occurs too far in advance of synthesis, large tracts of single-stranded DNA are exposed. This can activate DNA damage signaling or induce DNA repair processes. To thwart these problems, the eukaryotic replisome contains specialized proteins {{that are designed to}} regulate the helicase activity ahead of the replication fork. These proteins also provide docking sites for physical interaction between helicases and polymerases, thereby ensuring that duplex <b>unwinding</b> is coupled with DNA synthesis.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the term}} [...] "slitter rewinder" [...] or [...] "slitting machine" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} the machine, the three parts are referred to as the <b>unwind,</b> the slitting section and the rewind. Slitter rewinders are normally used to slit plastic films, paper and metal foils. The <b>unwind</b> stage holds the roll stably and allows it to spin; it is either braked or driven to maintain accurate tension in the material. Some machines have a driven <b>unwind</b> which reduces the effect of inertia when starting to <b>unwind</b> heavy rolls or when the material is very tension-sensitive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unwind</b> {{received}} positive reviews upon release, with praise {{focusing on}} the novel's immersive environment and sociological implications. It also received many awards from young adult literature authorities. A film adaptation of <b>Unwind</b> is currently in production by independent producers. A second novel titled UnWholly was released in August 2012, and a third in December 2013, titled UnSouled and a fourth in October 2014, titled UnDivided. A novella, UnStrung, was also published. UnBound is the newest edition to the <b>Unwind</b> Dystology. It's written by Neal Shusterman (Creator), Michelle Knowlden, Jarrod Shusterman, Terry Black, and Brendan Shusterman. It was published December 15, 2015 by Simon & Schuster. This collection of novellas gives the readers more insight into the secrets and lost stories of the <b>Unwind</b> world.|$|R

25|$|Toxic {{effect of}} ethidium bromide on trypanosomas {{is caused by}} shift of their kinetoplastid DNA to Z-form. The shift is caused by {{intercalation}} of EtBr and subsequent loosening of DNA structure that leads to <b>unwinding</b> of DNA, shift to Z-form and inhibition of DNA replication.|$|E
25|$|Quinolones exert their {{antibacterial}} {{effect by}} preventing bacterial DNA from <b>unwinding</b> and duplicating.

Most of them are named with the -oxacin suffix.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of siRNAs in RNAi is largely dependent on its binding ability to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Binding of the duplex siRNA to RISC {{is followed by}} <b>unwinding</b> and cleavage of the sense strand with endonucleases. The remaining anti-sense strand-RISC complex can then bind to target mRNAs for initiating transcriptional silencing.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 90% of {{individuals}} with Werner Syndrome have any {{of a range of}} mutations in the eponymous gene, WRN, the only gene currently connected to Werner syndrome. WRN encodes the WRNp protein, a 1432 amino acid protein with a central domain resembling members of the RecQ helicases. WRNp is active in <b>unwinding</b> DNA, a step necessary in DNA repair and DNA replication. Since WRNp's function depends on DNA, it is only functional when localized to the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) marks the potential sites for the initiation of DNA replication. Consistent with the minichromosome maintenance complex encircling double stranded DNA, {{formation of}} the pre-RC {{does not lead to}} the immediate <b>unwinding</b> of origin DNA or the recruitment of DNA polymerases. Instead, the pre-RC that is formed during the G1 of the cell cycle is only activated to unwind the DNA and initiate replication after the cells pass from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{isolated}} CMG helicase and Replisome Progression Complex {{contain a}} single Mcm protein ring complex {{suggesting that the}} loaded double hexamer of the Mcm proteins at origins might be broken into two single hexameric rings {{as part of the}} initiation process, with each Mcm protein complex ring forming the core of a CMG helicase at the two replication forks established from each origin. The full CMG complex is required for DNA <b>unwinding,</b> and the complex of CDC45-Mcm-GINS is the functional DNA helicase in eukaryotic cells.|$|E

25|$|The six {{minichromosome}} maintenance {{proteins and}} Cdc45 are essential during initiation and elongation {{for the movement}} of replication forks and for <b>unwinding</b> of the DNA. GINS are essential for the interaction of Mcm and Cdc45 at the origins of replication during initiation and then at DNA replication forks as the replisome progresses. The GINS complex is composed of four small proteins Sld5 (Cdc105), Psf1 (Cdc101), Psf2 (Cdc102) and Psf3 (Cdc103), GINS represents 'go, ichi, ni, san' which means '5, 1, 2, 3' in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|The seller {{takes the}} risk that the buyer may default on the contract, depriving the seller of the {{expected}} revenue stream. More important, a seller normally limits its risk by buying offsetting protection from another partyâ that is, it hedges its exposure. If the original buyer drops out, the seller squares its position by either <b>unwinding</b> the hedge transaction or by selling a new CDS to a third party. Depending on market conditions, that may be at a lower price than the original CDS and may therefore involve a loss to the seller.|$|E
25|$|Topoisomerase inhibitors are {{drugs that}} affect the {{activity}} of two enzymes: topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II. When the DNA double-strand helix is unwound, during DNA replication or transcription, for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening {{the middle of a}} twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single- or double-strand breaks into DNA, reducing the tension in the DNA strand. This allows the normal <b>unwinding</b> of DNA to occur during replication or transcription. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.|$|E

25|$|When TBP binds to a TATA box {{within the}} DNA, it distorts the DNA by {{inserting}} amino acid side-chains between base pairs, partially <b>unwinding</b> the helix, and doubly kinking it. The distortion is accomplished through {{a great amount}} of surface contact between the protein and DNA. TBP binds with the negatively charged phosphates in the DNA backbone through positively charged lysine and arginine amino acid residues. The sharp bend in the DNA is produced through projection of four bulky phenylalanine residues into the minor groove. As the DNA bends, its contact with TBP increases, thus enhancing the DNA-protein interaction.|$|E
25|$|Dicer {{processing}} of the pre-miRNA {{is thought to}} be coupled with <b>unwinding</b> of the duplex. Generally, only one strand is incorporated into the miRISC, {{selected on the basis of}} its thermodynamic instability and weaker base-pairing on the 5' end relative to the other strand. The position of the stem-loop may also influence strand choice. The other strand, called the passenger strand due to its lower levels in the steady state, is denoted with an asterisk (*) and is normally degraded. In some cases, both strands of the duplex are viable and become functional miRNA that target different mRNA populations.|$|E
25|$|In {{studying}} coin flipping, {{to observe}} the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, {{so that when the}} speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin â after a flip, one could count rotations by <b>unwinding</b> the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time.|$|E
