Regular inspection is required to intercept such failures, and in situ sensors would be a superior technology for that purpose. We are developing MEMS-based transducers for ultrasonic flaw detection, to be permanently mounted at critical locations on structures. Ultrasonic testing requires the emission of a short pulse of ultrasonic energy and the detection of echoes from nearby surfaces or flaws. In a permanently mounted device, phased-array detection {{will be needed to}} scan for flaws in off-axis locations. The device we envision will use a mm-scale piezoelectric emitter and an array of MEMS capacitive diaphragm detectors. We have designed and fabricated arrays of MEMS capacitive diaphragm transducers using the MUMPS process and we report on their performance as pulse-echo detectors in direct contact with metal specimens. Our chip contains 23 sensor elements, featuring nine elements in a linear array and 14 other elements to study alternative diaphragm designs.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{cardiogenic}} shock is myocardial ischemia developing early or late in the course of acute myocardial infarction. The incidence of cardiogenic shock (CS) is around 7 % in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients and has remained constant over the last 20 years. Therapy should be chain based by increased patient's awareness. Early and prehospital diagnosis and treatment, with prompt transfer to a catheterization laboratory. Early revascularization is the cornerstone treatment of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. According to the guidelines, revascularization is effective up to 36 hours after the onset of CS and performed within 18 hours after the diagnosis of CS.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{studied the}} effects of LV {{unloading}} by the Impella on coronary hemodynamics by simultaneously measuring intracoronary pressure and flow and the derived parameters fractional flow reserve (FFR), coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR), and coronary microvascular resistance (MR). BACKGROUND: Patients with compromised left ventricular (LV) function undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may benefit from LV unloading. Limited information is available on {{the effects of}} LV unloading on coronary hemodynamics. METHODS: Eleven patients (mean LV ejection fraction of 35 +/- 11 %) underwent PCI during LV support by the LV <b>unloading</b> <b>device</b> (Impella Recover LP 2. 5). Intracoronary measurements were performed in a nonstenotic coronary artery after the PCI, before and after adenosine-induced hyperemia at four different support levels (0 - 2. 5 L/min). RESULTS: Aortic and coronary pressure increased with increasing support levels, whereas FFR remained unchanged. Baseline flow velocity remained unchanged, while hyperemic flow velocity and CFVR increased significantly with increasing support levels (61 +/- 24 to 72 +/- 27 cm/sec, P = 0. 001 and 1. 88 +/- 0. 52 to 2. 34 +/- 0. 63, P < 0. 001 respectively). The difference between baseline MR and hyperemic MR significantly increased with increasing support levels (1. 28 +/- 1. 32 to 1. 89 +/- 1. 43 mm Hg cm(- 1) sec, P = 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS: Unloading of the LV by the Impella increased aortic and intracoronary pressure, hyperemic flow velocity and CFVR, and decreased MR.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a lunar base is technologically and financially challenging. Given the necessary resources and political support, it can be done. In addition to the geopolitical obstacles, however, there are logistical problems involved in establishing such bases {{that can only be}} overcome with the acquisition of a significant transportation and communications network in the Earth-Moon spatial region. Considering the significant number of payloads that will be required in this process, the mass-specific cost of launching these payloads, and the added risk and cost of human presence in space, it is clearly desirable to automate major parts of such an operation. One very costly and time-consuming factor in this picture is the delivery of payloads to the Moon. Foreseeable payloads would include atmospheric modules, inflatable habitat kits, energy and oxygen plant elements, ground vehicles, laboratory modules, crew supplies, etc. The duration of high-risk human presence on the Moon could be greatly reduced if all such payloads were delivered to the prospective base site in advance of crew arrival. In this view, the idea of a 'Self-Unloading Reusable Lunar Lander' (SURLL) arises naturally.

From LLO, the lander shuttles payloads down to the lunar surface, where, by means of some resident, detachable <b>unloading</b> <b>device,</b> it deploys the payloads and returns to orbit.

40|$|Ventilatory demand {{increases}} throughout endurance exercise. It was hypothesised that if {{the normal}} loads on the respiratory muscles contribute to the limitation of endurance exercise, then a reduction of these loads (resistive unloading) should improve exercise performance. Inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) unloading is possible at rest and moderate exercise levels, with the recent development of a feedback controlled loading/unloading device [Younes. et al: JAP 62 : 2491, 1987]. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} specific modifications that were necessary in this device, to apply respiratory muscle unloading (FWUL) throughout the high ventilatory levels of prolonged exercise. The device was also used in a study in which seven healthy males performed constant load heavy exercise on two days, one with and one without (control) respiratory muscle unloading. With FWUL, mouth pressure was made positive with inspiration and negative with expiration proportional to flow, to provide a mean unloading of 1. 7 cmH 20 · 1 - 1 • s, effectively eliminating 73 % of the total airflow resistance. The order of the two tests was randomised and they were separated by 4 days. The subjects exercised at high exercise levels (- 90 % maximum oxygen consumption) and flow proportional unloading was applied throughout these exercise levels. There was no significant difference (paired t test) in exercise duration between the control (mean ± SE, 11. 4 ± 1. 2 min) and FWUL (12. 6 ± 2. 1 min) tests. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed no difference in minute ventilation, tidal volume, respiratory frequency, heart rate and oxygen uptake, between the two tests. To confirm respiratory muscle unloading, intraoesophageal pressure (Ppl) was measured throughout exercise in 5 subjects. Respiratory muscle output (Pmus) was calculated by using Ppl and the measured values for chest wall elastic recoil, and normal values for chest wall resistive pressures. Peak and mean Pmus were significantly less with unloading (A(I) - 18 %, 16 %; A(E) - 36 %, 37 %, respectively), throughout exercise. The <b>unloading</b> <b>device</b> with its modifications was thus successfully used to unload the respiratory muscles at the high ventilatory levels of endurance exercise. The lack of improvement in exercise performance with unloading, in spite of a fall in respiratory muscle output, indicates that the normal resistive loads do not significantly contribute to endurance exercise limitation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The project goal is {{to develop}} a machine that can unload nuclear sphere fuel pebbles in a {{controlled}} sequence. The unloading machine will be operational in an environment filled with graphite dust and the gas medium is helium. Furthermore, the environment is radioactive and therefore maintenance activities must be reduced to a minimum. The unloading machine must fit {{in the bottom of a}} fuel storage tank. Access to the tank is only from the top, so as to control radioactive releases. The unloading machine must additionally be capable of unloading usable spheres and separate pieces of spheres to the bottom of the tank. A scale model was built to confirm the functionality of two unloading principles, gravity unloading and suction unloading. The gravity unloading concept was selected and further developed. Different improvements were made to the original concept used for the scale model. At first sequencing was not achieved, and therefore the concept was improved to separate spheres mechanically. This caused a possibility to damage spheres. The concept was further improved to remove the disadvantage of sphere damage. Spheres were now again unloaded through the centre of rotation of the unloading head. This mechanism achieved sphere separation, but not sequencing control. Another unloading level was added to the unloading head which proved theoretically to improve sequencing. At this stage of the design it proved theoretically possible to achieve sequentially controlled unloading of spheres, with separation of pieces of spheres to the bottom of the tank. The tests proved that the concept would work, but another improvement was required to prevent strung unloading of spheres. The tank unloading machine was not further tested with the required improvement. Therefore the tests should be repeated when the improvement has been incorporated. It is proposed to add bumps in the housing at the level of the second level of the unloading head. These bumps will prevent spheres from rolling towards the exit in the head. The spheres will then maintain their position in the second unloading level until the exit hole will pass the sphere to take it in. The conclusion is that the concept will probably be acceptable when the latest test was performed. It is however believed that this last improvement will be successful. The tank unloading machine is developed to be low on maintenance. It is believed that the bearings will not need replacement, thus no maintenance is foreseen. The tank <b>unloading</b> <b>device</b> can separate pieces of spheres before the usable spheres are delivered into the sphere transportation pipe. Master...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} technologically {{advanced}} developments in South Africa. In order to build a commercially viable demonstration power plant, all the specifically and uniquely designed equipment must first be qualified. All the prototype equipment is tested at the Helium Test Facility (HTF) at Pelindaba. One of the largest components that are tested is the Core <b>Unloading</b> <b>Device</b> (CUD). The main function of the CUD is to unload fuel from the bottom of the reactor core to enable circulation of the fuel core. The CUD housing vessel forms part of the reactor pressure boundary. Pebble-directing valves and other moving machinery are installed inside its machined inner surface. It is essential that the interior surfaces of the CUD are case hardened to provide a corrosion- and wear-resistant layer. Cold welding between the moving metal parts and the machined surface must also be prevented. Nitriding is a case hardening process that adds a hardened wear- and corrosion-resistant layer that will also prevent cold welding of the moving parts in the helium atmosphere. Only a few nitriding furnaces exist that can house a forging as large as the CUD of the PBMR. Commercial nitriding furnaces in South Africa are all too small and have limited flexibility in terms of the nitriding process. The nitriding of a vessel as large as the CUD has not yet been carried out commercially. The aim of this work was to design and develop a custom-made nitriding plant to perform the nitriding of the first PBMR/HTF CUD. Proper process control is essential to ensure that the required nitrided case has been obtained. A new concept for a gas nitriding plant was developed using the nitrided vessel interior as the nitriding process chamber. Before the commencement of detail design, a laboratory test was performed on a scale model vessel to confirm concept feasibility. The design of the plant included the mechanical design of various components essential to the nitriding process. A special stirring fan with an extended length shaft was designed, taking whirling speed into account. Considerable research was performed on the high temperature use of the various components to ensure the safe operation of the plant at temperatures of up to 600 °C. Nitriding requires the use of hazardous gases such as ammonia, oxygen and nitrogen. Hydrogen is produced as a by-product and therefore safety was the most important design parameter. Thermohydraulic analyses, i. e. heat transfer and pressure drop calculations in pipes, were also performed to ensure the successful process design of the nitriding plant. The nitriding plant was subsequently constructed and operated to verify the correct design. A large amount of experimental and operating data was captured during the actual operation of the plant. This data was analysed and the thermohydraulic analyses were verified. Nitrided specimens were subjected to hardness and layer thickness tests. The measured temperature of the protruding fan shaft was within the limits predicted by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models. Graphs of gas flow rates and other operation data confirmed the inverse proportionality between ammonia supply flow rate and measured dissociation rate. The design and operation of the nitriding plant were successful as a nitride layer thickness of 400 μm and hardness of 1 200 Vickers hardness (VHN) was achieved. This research proves that a large pressure vessel can successfully be nitrided using the vessel interior as a process chamber. Master...|$|E
40|$|Programs in unsafe languages, like C and C++, may {{dynamically}} {{load and}} unload modules. For example, some operating system kernels support dynamic loading and <b>unloading</b> of <b>device</b> drivers. This causes specific {{difficulties in the}} verification of such programs and modules; in particular, it must be verified that no functions or global variables from the module are used after the module is unloaded. We present the approach we used to add support for loading and unloading modules to our separation-logic-based program verifier VeriFast. Our approach to the specification and verification of function pointer calls, based on parameterizing function types by predicates, is sound {{in the presence of}} unloading, {{but at the same time}} does not complicate the verification of programs that perform no unloading, and does not require callers to distinguish between function pointers that point into unloadable modules and ones that do not. We offer a machine-checked formalization and soundness proof and we report on verifying a small kernel-like program using VeriFast. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach for sound modular verification of C programs that load and unload modules. nrpages: 22 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Gravity {{reduction}} {{affects the}} energetics and natural speed of walking and running. But, {{it is less}} clear how segmental coordination is altered. Various devices have been developed {{in the past to}} study locomotion in simulated reduced gravity. However, most of these <b>devices</b> <b>unload</b> only the body center of mass. The authors reduced the effective gravity acting on the stance or swing leg to 0. 16 g using different simulators. Locomotion under these conditions was associated with a reduction in the foot velocity and significant changes in angular motion. Moreover, when simulated reduced gravity directly affected the swing limb, it resulted in significantly slower swing and longer foot excursions, suggesting an important role of the swing phase dynamics in shaping locomotor patterns...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesLeft {{ventricular}} assist {{devices are}} proposed {{as a bridge}} to recovery, but recurrent ventricular deterioration has limited this approach. We describe a new animal model that simulates the effects of left ventricular assist <b>device</b> <b>unloading</b> and then reloading after device removal. The model might facilitate the evaluation of interventions intended to prevent recurrent ventricular dysfunction. MethodsThe hearts and lungs of Lewis rats were removed and transplanted into the abdomen of recipient rats by anastomosing the donor’s ascending aorta to the recipient’s abdominal aorta. The transplanted hearts were maintained unloaded for 2 weeks in 49 animals. Eighteen transplanted hearts were removed after 2 weeks of unloading. In 17 animals the donor’s right pulmonary artery was anastomosed to the recipient’s abdominal aorta to reload the heart for an additional 2 weeks. In 14 animals the hearts were maintained unloaded for 4 weeks (an additional 2 weeks). The unloaded and reloaded hearts were compared with normal rat hearts (n = 18). ResultsIn the unloaded hearts the left ventricular end-diastolic pressures remained low. The left ventricular systolic pressures were lower than the aortic pressures. The left ventricular weights (n = 8) and volumes (n = 4) remained significantly lower (P <. 01) than in the normal hearts. Two weeks after reloading, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (n = 8) increased (P <. 01), and the ventricle ejected. The left ventricular systolic pressures exceeded the aortic pressures. The left ventricular weights and volumes increased (P <. 01) and approached those of normal hearts. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (n = 6 /group) levels decreased in the unloaded state (P =. 02) and increased back to normal values after reloading. ConclusionsThis surgical model simulated left ventricular assist <b>device</b> <b>unloading</b> of the left ventricle. The second operation reloaded the left ventricle, which then enlarged. This model will permit the evaluation of adjunctive interventions, such as cell transplantation, intended to facilitate successful left ventricular assist device removal and prevent recurrent dilatation...|$|R
