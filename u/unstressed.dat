5|$|Double- and multi- {{exposure}} holography is one {{of three}} methods used to create holographic interferograms. A first exposure records the object in an <b>unstressed</b> state. Subsequent exposures on the same photographic plate are made while the object is subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and <b>unstressed</b> states.|$|E
5|$|Stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are <b>unstressed.</b> Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than <b>unstressed</b> syllables, and vowels in <b>unstressed</b> syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not. Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.|$|E
5|$|Final <b>unstressed</b> short vowels {{dropped out}} in most words, making it {{possible}} for long vowels to occur in closed syllables.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} rhythm, English is {{generally}} {{described as a}} stress-timed language, meaning {{that the amount of}} time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but <b>unstressed</b> syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in <b>unstressed</b> syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.|$|E
5|$|Stress {{movement}} from light syllable to following heavy syllable {{when not in}} pausa, with newly <b>unstressed</b> light syllable reducing the schwa.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman vowel {{harmony and}} other aspects of Wagiman phonotactics require further investigation. It is not known, for instance, whether vowel harmony equally affects <b>unstressed</b> syllables.|$|E
5|$|Most Nahuatl dialects have {{stress on}} the {{penultimate}} syllable of a word. In Mexicanero from Durango, many <b>unstressed</b> syllables have disappeared from words, and the placement of syllable stress has become phonemic.|$|E
5|$|Metrical rhythm {{generally}} involves precise {{arrangements of}} stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse {{the pattern of}} stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and <b>unstressed</b> syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.|$|E
5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the <b>unstressed</b> object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E
5|$|The rhyme is {{constructed}} of quatrains in trochaic tetrameter catalectic, (each line {{made up of}} four metrical feet of two syllables, with the stress falling on the first syllable in a pair; the last foot in the line missing the <b>unstressed</b> syllable), which is common in nursery rhymes. In its most common form it relies on a double repetition, rather than a rhyming scheme, which is a frequently employed device in children's rhymes and stories. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 502.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of names for other types of feet, right up to a choriamb, a four {{syllable}} metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two <b>unstressed</b> syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Languages which utilize vowel length or intonation rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and <b>unstressed</b> syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the needles and leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. <b>Unstressed</b> trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
5|$|The rhyme {{is made up}} of quatrains, with a rhyming {{scheme of}} abcb (with {{occasional}} internal rhymes), using falling rhymes (where the rhyming sound is on a relatively <b>unstressed</b> syllable: de-emphasising the rhyme) and a trochaic rhythm (with the stress falling on the first of a pair of syllables), known as a ballad form, which is common in nursery rhymes. The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by the composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs (1870). The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 10266.|$|E
25|$|Another {{defining}} {{feature of}} the Romansh language {{is the use of}} <b>unstressed</b> vowels. All <b>unstressed</b> vowels (except /a/) disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Like Catalan and German, Portuguese uses vowel {{quality to}} {{contrast}} stressed syllables with <b>unstressed</b> syllables: isolated vowels {{tend to be}} raised, {{and in some cases}} centralized, when <b>unstressed.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Unstressed</b> vowels are short.|$|E
25|$|The poem's meter is anapestic tetrameter (four feet of unstressed-unstressed-stressed). The anapest is {{the same}} foot used to {{construct}} limericks, and the common metrical modifications that {{can be observed in}} the limerick form also can be observed in Moore's poem. For example, while the first two lines each use full anapests, lines 3 and 4 each drop the first <b>unstressed</b> syllable. Likewise, lines 9 and 10 drop the first <b>unstressed</b> syllable; they also add an extra <b>unstressed</b> syllable to the end.|$|E
25|$|One early {{difference}} {{shared by}} the West Germanic dialects is the monophthongization of <b>unstressed</b> diphthongs. <b>Unstressed</b> *ai became ē, as in haitē (Kragehul I) from Proto-Germanic *haitai, and <b>unstressed</b> *au likewise became ō. Characteristic is also the Proto-Norse lowering of Proto-Germanic stressed ē to ā, which is demonstrated by the pair Gothic mēna and Old Norse máni (English moon). Proto-Norse thus differs from the early West Germanic dialects, as West Germanic ē was lowered to ā regardless of stress; in Old Norse, earlier <b>unstressed</b> ē surfaces as i. For example, the weak third-person singular past tense ending -dē appears in Old High German as -ta, with a low vowel, but in Old Norse as -ði, with a high vowel.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphology}} of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, {{specially in}} <b>unstressed</b> forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian). Features include the gender-neutral ho {{and the great}} degree of freedom when combining different <b>unstressed</b> pronouns (65 combinations).|$|E
25|$|Shortening of long vowels in <b>unstressed</b> syllables.|$|E
25|$|The long vowel /a/ becomes /a/ when <b>unstressed.</b>|$|E
25|$|The long vowel a: {{becomes a}} when <b>unstressed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Collapsing of vowels in hiatus (producing new <b>unstressed</b> long vowels).|$|E
25|$|Ř disappears when {{followed}} by <b>unstressed</b> i {{and more than}} one syllable.|$|E
25|$|Stress only, as in Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian: {{stressed}} (á) vs. <b>unstressed</b> (a).|$|E
25|$|Dactylic – three syllables, {{with the}} first one long or {{stressed}} {{and the other two}} short or <b>unstressed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anapestic – three syllables, {{with the}} first two short or <b>unstressed</b> and the last long or stressed.|$|E
25|$|Iambic – two {{syllable}}s, {{with the}} short or <b>unstressed</b> syllable {{followed by the}} long or stressed syllable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} {{indicative}} of both {{formal and informal}} Quebec French, (s')asseoir (to sit/seat) only uses the vowel /wa/ in stressed roots and /e/ in <b>unstressed</b> roots: je m'assois, tu t'assois, il s'assoit, ils s'assoient but nous nous asseyons, vous vous asseyez. In Metropolitan French, stressed /wa/ and /je/ are in free variation as are <b>unstressed</b> /wa/ and /e/. Note that in informal Quebec French, (s')asseoir is often said as (s')assire.|$|E
25|$|Syntactically, I {{bought it}} is grammatical, but done (always <b>unstressed)</b> {{is used to}} {{emphasize}} the completed nature of the action.|$|E
25|$|If {{the first}} {{stressed}} morpheme is stressed anywhere {{except for the}} final mora of a stem-final vowel, the subsequent morpheme is <b>unstressed.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Barcelona {{metropolitan}} area <b>unstressed</b> schwa is lowered to a near-open central vowel , sounding closer to but in RP or Californian English.|$|E
25|$|Other transformations include <b>unstressed</b> {{i became}} e, ln became ll, a stop + s became ss, and a nasal + velar became /ŋ/ + velar.|$|E
25|$|Russian has vowel {{reduction}} in <b>unstressed</b> syllables. This feature {{is found in}} English, but not in most other Slavic languages, such as Polish, Czech, and Serbo-Croatian.|$|E
25|$|Trochaic – two syllables, {{with the}} long or {{stressed}} syllable followed by the short or <b>unstressed</b> syllable. In English, this metre is found almost entirely in lyric poetry.|$|E
