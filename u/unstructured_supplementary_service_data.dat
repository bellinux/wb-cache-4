40|$|Abstract—Real time {{tracking}} {{is required in}} many aspects of life like tracking vehicle fleet for optimized use of resources, tracing a stolen object and so on. <b>Unstructured</b> <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Data</b> (USSD) is a GSM service that allows high-speed interactive communication between the subscribers and applications across a GSM Network. The primary benefits of USSD are that it is cheaper then existing methods and allows for very fast communication between the user and an application giving the system real-time characteristics. This paper proposes a unique real-{{time tracking}} method with its architecture using USSD and GPS system on mobile station which even works in VPLMN and is faster than existing methods. The proposed method has been implemented using GPS, GSM and AJAX technologies. Keywords—USSD, Real-time tracking, Implementation, Architecture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{initiating}} IP-based peer-to-peer (P 2 P) communication sessions {{in cases where the}} target of the initial communication attempt is a mobile device. Mobile P 2 P networking poses certain problems: a battery-powered device may not always keep its network interfaces on for IP communications due to battery life issues, and mobile hosts are typically also behind a NAT that hinders incoming connections. Our proposed solution to these problems is Network-Assisted P 2 P Invocation (NAPI). It takes advantage of an established feature of the GSM and 3 G cellular networks: the <b>Unstructured</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Data</b> (USSD) signaling protocol. The USSD protocol, which operates over the “always-active ” channel to the base station, would be used for requesting the initiation of an IP (TCP, UDP) connection at the mobile target peer; the thus formed IP-based connection can then be used for any application-specific P 2 P communications. After the initiation, USSD is not used in actual communication. I...|$|R

5000|$|From {{the patent}} Accordingly, {{it is an}} object of the present {{invention}} to provide a mechanism for selecting the optimal bearer for each data packet in varying situations. The object is achieved by a method and equipment which are characterized by what is disclosed in the attached independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the attached dependent claims. The invention {{is based on the}} idea that selecting the optimal bearer for a data packet between the MBN and the mobile node is based on a combination of 1) the quality-of-service requirement (traffic class) of the data packet in question, 2) the mobility data related to the mobile node, 3) the traffic data related to the multiple bearers, and 4) bearer preference information. The bearer preference information can be obtained from the mobile node, and optionally, from the operators of the home and visited MBN operators.In order to save the battery of a portable mobile node, it is preferable that the mobile node only monitors one bearer type (network) at a time. For example, the subscriber data related to the mobile node can include a default bearer type, such as GSM or UMTS. The mobile node should be paged on this bearer. The mobile node can be ordered to monitor the selected bearer type by sending a modified page message which indicates the selected bearer type, channel, possible decryption data, etc. Alternatively, such information can be sent in a separate message, such as a short message, USSD, (<b>Unstructured</b> <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Data),</b> data call or the like. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, as long as the mobile node is within a certain coverage area, all IP packets belonging to the same session (or flow if flow labels are used) are routed via the same interface unit. For example, if a mobile node is receiving IP packets from a DAB network, via a cell x, all IP packets of the same session should be routed via DAB cell x, unless the mobile node moves out of the coverage area of this cell.|$|E

We examine over a decade of ICT 4 D research, analyzing how USSD can extend and complement current uses of IVR and SMS for data collection, messaging, information access, social networking and complex user initiated transactions. Based on these findings we identify situations when a mobile based project should consider using USSD with increasingly common third party gateways over other mediums. This analysis also motivates the design and implementation of an open source library for rapid development of USSD applications. Finally, we explore three USSD use cases, demonstrating how USSD opens up a design space not available with IVR or SMS...|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{intervention is}} the <b>Unstructured</b> <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Data</b> (USSD) multicultural health intervention service. The USSD is a protocol used by cellular phones {{to communicate with}} a telecommunication service provider. A USSD application has a unique short code {{in the form of}} *specific numbers# (e.g. * 128 #) or *specific numbers*specific numbers# (e.g. * 121 * 2 #). These short codes are dialed and sent to the service provider’s server using a phone. In response, the phone receives a message or a menu linked to different messages (from the server). Harnessing this two-way communication technology, the proposed intervention would allow culturally and linguistically diverse groups in the country to dial specific USSD codes on their phones, receive a menu of pertinent health information in response, and access (read) any information needed, in understood language options.|$|E

At this exact moment the charging is done. The due amount of money is simply added to the monthly bill, in case of postpaid phones, or subtracted from available credits, in case of prepaid mobile phones. The functionality of sending USSD messages from the system to the subscriber mobile phone was achieved by using Telco 2. 0 Web Services provided by Orange Labs...|$|E
40|$|Mobile phone {{users in}} rural {{parts of the}} {{developing}} world, especially Africa, adapt to lack of electricity, poverty, remote locations, unpredictable services, and second-hand technology.

We draw from fieldwork in Kenya with mobile phone owners to relate specific practices and issues facing rural users. Problems such as “spoiled ” phone batteries and “China-makes ” suggest larger design implications. We use our findings to motivate a design agenda for the rural poor built on the assumption of off-grid use and limited power, simple cheap phones, and <b>Unstructured</b> <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Data</b> (USSD) protocol.
