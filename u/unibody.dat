5|$|A more {{expensive}} black model was offered until {{the introduction of}} the <b>unibody</b> aluminum MacBook. The polycarbonate MacBook was the only Macintosh notebook (until the new 2015 model) to be offered in more than one color since the iBook G3 (Clamshell).|$|E
5|$|For the <b>unibody</b> {{polycarbonate}} MacBook (2009), {{the ports}} {{from left to}} right are the MagSafe power connector, Gigabit Ethernet, Mini DisplayPort, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.|$|E
5|$|On October 20, 2009, Apple {{released}} a MacBook that {{introduced a new}} polycarbonate (plastic) <b>unibody</b> design, faster DDR3 memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The polycarbonate <b>unibody</b> MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.|$|E
5|$|The design had stylistic {{traits of}} the MacBook Air which were also {{implemented}} {{into the design}} of the MacBook Pro. This model is thinner than the original polycarbonate MacBooks, and it made use of a <b>unibody</b> aluminum case with tapered edges. The keyboard of the higher-end model included a backlight.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{released}} {{the third generation}} of MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen during WWDC 2012 and discontinued the 17-inch variant. The previous generation 13- and 15-inch <b>unibody</b> models continued to sell with updated processors. The third generation model was a quarter thinner than its predecessor and introduced the Retina Display with a much higher screen resolution. A 13-inch variant was released in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Ralph Budd met Edward G. Budd (no relation), an {{automotive}} steel pioneer who was {{founder and}} president of the Budd Company. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new Budd-Michelin rail motorcar built of stainless steel. Pneumatic-wheeled railcars never found popularity for actual service in the US - they tended to derail - but they demonstrated the successful construction of lightweight stainless steel <b>unibody</b> railcars.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with <b>unibody</b> construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} new laptop's {{performance}} and compact size, {{the quality of}} the screen, and sturdy <b>unibody</b> build, which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models. Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines. Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a <b>unibody</b> {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The <b>unibody</b> frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One (codenamed and retroactively called M7) is a touchscreen-based Android {{smartphone}} designed, developed, {{and manufactured}} by HTC. The smartphone was unveiled on 19 February 2013 at press events in New York City and London and is HTC’s seventh flagship smartphone. It is {{the successor to}} the company’s 2012 flagship model, the One X—which was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful {{due in part to}} insufficient marketing efforts. To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a <b>unibody</b> aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC’s Sense user experience, BlinkFeed—an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device’s power button.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} mid-2010 revision, {{there is a}} {{removable}} panel on the bottom, enabling the user to upgrade the RAM. The new Mac Mini has an all-aluminium enclosure, called <b>unibody.</b> The <b>unibody</b> manufacturing process was originally developed for the MacBook Air and later also used in the MacBook and MacBook Pro, and the iMac before being introduced into the Mac Mini range.|$|E
25|$|Some major {{smartphone}} manufacturers use polycarbonate. Nokia {{has used}} polycarbonate in their phones {{starting with the}} N9's <b>unibody</b> case in 2011. This practice continues with various phones in the Lumia series. Samsung has started using polycarbonate with Galaxy S III's battery cover in 2012. This practice continues with various phones in the Galaxy series. Apple started using polycarbonate with the iPhone 5C's <b>unibody</b> case in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The Regal {{utilizes}} <b>unibody</b> construction with {{galvanized steel}} front fenders, hood, roof and door panels and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) bumper covers.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 and 1964 models {{used the}} same <b>unibody</b> {{platform}} as the 1962s, but were restyled to look longer and wider.|$|E
25|$|The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a {{full-size}} luxury SUV {{produced by the}} American manufacturer Jeep. While some other SUVs were manufactured with body-on-frame construction, the Jeep Grand Cherokee has always used a <b>unibody</b> chassis.|$|E
25|$|The updated <b>unibody</b> Mac Mini was Apple's first {{computer}} with an HDMI video port {{to connect to}} a television or other display, more readily positioning the unit as a home theater device alternative to the Apple TV.|$|E
25|$|From their inception, Vespa scooters {{have been}} known for their painted, pressed steel <b>unibody</b> which {{combines}} a complete cowling for the engine (enclosing the engine mechanism and concealing dirt or grease), a flat floorboard (providing foot protection), and a prominent front fairing (providing wind protection) into a structural unit.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the sedan, the Alliance was now offered as a convertible for 1985 (AMC's first of this body type since the 1968 Rebel). The design was in collaboration with American Sunroof Company (now American Specialty Cars) that reinforced the Alliance's <b>unibody</b> for torsional rigidity during manufacture in Kenosha, Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|The final {{generation}} Toronado {{made its}} debut in 1985 for the 1986 model year. It was even smaller, lost its body-on-frame construction {{in favor of a}} <b>unibody</b> platform, and was the first Toronado since 1969 to feature hidden headlights. For the first time ever V8 engines were gone, with the fuel-injected version of the Buick 231cuin (3.8L) V6 now the only powerplant available.|$|E
25|$|The Aurora {{was highly}} {{regarded}} {{at the time}} for its refined engine, excellent build quality, well-balanced ride, and structural integrity. During normal crush-to-failure tests done by automakers to evaluate body rigidity, the Aurora's <b>unibody</b> construction broke GM's testing machine. A frame-crusher otherwise used to test stronger truck frames had to be used instead, with the car exceeding federal standards for passenger cars by two times.|$|E
25|$|The Trabant had a steel <b>unibody</b> frame, {{with the}} roof, trunk lid, hood, fenders and doors made of Duroplast, a hard plastic made from {{recycled}} cotton waste from the Soviet Union and phenol resins from the East German dye industry. It was the second car with a body made of recycled material; {{the first was the}} AWZ P70 Zwickau, produced from 1955 to 1959. The material was durable, and the average lifespan of a Trabant was 28 years.|$|E
25|$|The crisis {{reduced the}} demand for large cars. Japanese imports, {{primarily}} the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with <b>unibody</b> construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Cherokee thus {{became the}} first Chrysler-badged Jeep product. Development work for the new Jeep model {{continued}} and Chrysler's employees (after the 1987 buyout of AMC) were eager for a late-1980s release date; however, CEO Lee Iacocca was pushing for redesigned Chrysler minivans, thus delaying the Grand Cherokee's release until late-1992 as an Explorer competitor. Unlike the Explorer, the Grand Cherokee utilized monocoque (<b>unibody)</b> construction, whereas the Explorer was a derivative of the Ranger pickup with a separate body-on-frame.|$|E
25|$|The RX {{was built}} on a <b>unibody</b> chassis. Its {{exterior}} design was not typical of existing four-door vehicles at its introduction. Among design features, the vehicle featured front triangular quarter-windows, door-mounted side mirrors, a rear liftgate with top-mounted spoiler, and translucent front and rear light covers with round lenses. The exterior color scheme was two-tone, with the bumper and lower body-side cladding a gray color. The RX 300 carried a drag coefficient of 0.36 C'd. The first-generation Lexus RX was built in Kyushu, Japan.|$|E
25|$|The {{design has}} a {{monocoque}} (<b>unibody)</b> construction with four-wheel independent air suspension. Air suspension allowed variable ride height and achieved similar axle articulation {{to the previous}} live axle design. This retained off-road abilities while improving on-road performance. The new Range Rover's introduction in late 2002 as a 2003 model for the North American market resulted in the Range Rover and Ford Expedition (also new for 2003) being the only two SUVs in the full-size sport utility class with four-wheel independent suspension systems at that time.|$|E
25|$|The Alfa Romeo Spider {{was based}} on Giulia mechanicals, {{including}} its Alfa Romeo twin cam inline-four, independent front and solid axle rear suspension, and <b>unibody</b> construction, incorporating the relatively new principles of crumple zones into the front and rear. Following the evolution the other Giulia sport variants, the Spider was powered by a 1.6L engine, later received the 1.3L 1300, 1.8L 1750 and finally 2.0L 2000 engines. Unlike any other Giulia derivative, it was upgraded and continued to sell through four decades, into the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The iPhone 5C has new LTE antennas {{that now}} cover more LTE bands {{than any other}} {{smartphone}} according to Apple. The device {{is made up of}} a <b>unibody</b> hard-coated polycarbonate body with a steel-reinforced frame, which also acts as an antenna. The iPhone 5C is available in multiple bright colors for the back — blue, green, pink, yellow, and white, with a black glass front. It features a 4-inch Retina, multi-touch display, which has a 640×1136nbsp&pixel resolution. Storage capacities available are fixed at 8, 16, or 32nbsp&GB; plug-in memory card are not supported.|$|E
25|$|The new Thunderbird {{abandoned}} <b>unibody</b> {{construction in}} favor of a body-on-frame construction with sophisticated rubber mountings between the body and frame to reduce noise and vibration. A pair of significant departures from the previous generation Thunderbird was the elimination of a convertible model and the addition a four-door model, which used suicide doors for rear seat access. The available four-door design would remain a unique feature to this generation as it was not carried on after 1971. One of the most noticeable design elements of the fifth generation Thunderbird was the gaping, fighter jet-inspired grille opening that incorporated hidden headlights.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, AMC {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with the Griffith Company for a convertible body style Eagle, and a prototype version was developed. The cars were marketed during the 1981 and 1982 model years as the Sundancer conversion. The Eagle's monocoque (<b>unibody)</b> body was reinforced and a steel targa roll bar was welded to the door pillars for passenger compartment protection. The front portion of the roof was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material and the back window folded down and had a boot cover when in the down position.|$|E
25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP <b>unibody</b> replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the Watt's linkage rear suspension came first. This {{was followed by the}} front anti-dive modifications. The {{development of}} the anti-dive geometry was actually done quite quickly. To meet AMC’s schedule, Kaplan copied the basic design of the inner fender components from a Mustang. He added two more degrees of anti-dive to the Mustang’s 4 degrees, made the drawings, and sent them to the factory. The manufacture of the parts was then contracted to Central Stamping. Despite succeeding in developing the parts as a rush job, however, there was no capacity to fit the components to the <b>unibody</b> on the 1969 assembly line, so it fell to Kaplan to incorporate them into the cars when they arrived in his shop as bodies in white. Other related suspension pieces were also acquired through specialty manufacturers who were also building performance parts for Ford.|$|E
25|$|A {{new model}} of the Mac Mini was {{introduced}} on June 15, 2010. The new model was thinner, with a <b>unibody</b> aluminum case designed to be easily opened for RAM access, and incorporated upgraded hardware, such as an HDMI port and Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics. An update announced July 20, 2011 dropped the internal CD/DVD optical drive from all versions and introduced a Thunderbolt port, Intel Core i5 processor, and either Intel HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics or AMD Radeon HD 6630M dedicated graphics. The server model was upgraded to a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. Quad-core i7 CPUs are also used in the late-2012 desktop Mac Mini computers. It got a much anticipated refresh after long two years in October 2014, bringing Haswell CPUs, better graphics, $100 lower price for the base model, while the metal body remained nearly the same. The only change was {{the removal of the}} two holes used to open the case, as the RAM is no longer upgradable because it's now soldered to the logic board; this idea is similar to the Retina MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air and the Mid 2014 21.5-inch iMac.|$|E
500|$|<b>Unibody</b> {{construction}} {{first went}} into mass-production in the 1934 Citroën Traction Avant, the 1936 Lincoln-Zephyr, and the 1941 Nash 600. It came into popular use until the 1950s. <b>Unibody</b> construction {{differs from the}} traditional [...] "coachwork on chassis" [...] design in that it integrates much of the framing into a single body using a number of pieces welded together into a single unit, thus distributing the load over the entire frame of the car. [...] Chrysler claimed that <b>unibody</b> construction made its automobiles much stronger, more rigid, easy to handle, and quieter.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} four {{separate}} designs of the MacBook. The original model used {{a combination of}} polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4. The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's <b>unibody</b> aluminum casing, but omitted FireWire. [...] A third design, introduced in late 2009, had a polycarbonate <b>unibody</b> casing.|$|E
500|$|The rubber {{bottom of}} <b>unibody</b> MacBooks {{have been known}} to peel off. [...] Apple has noticed this as a flaw and will replace the bottom for free, with or without a warranty. Some {{consumers}} have also reported defects in their LCD displays in mid-2010–2011 models.|$|E
500|$|On February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro {{line was}} again updated. LED {{backlighting}} was added {{as an option}} for the 17-inch model. Processors were updated to [...] "Penryn" [...] cores, which are built on the 45 nanometer process (65 nanometer [...] "Merom" [...] cores were previously used), and hard drive and memory capacities were increased. Multi-touch capabilities, first introduced with the MacBook Air earlier that year, were brought over to the MacBook Pro's trackpad. When the 15-inch <b>unibody</b> MacBook Pro was introduced on October 14, 2008, the pre-unibody model with the same screen size was discontinued, while the 17-inch pre-unibody model continued to be sold. The original case design was discontinued on January 6, 2009, when the 17-inch MacBook Pro was also updated with <b>unibody</b> construction.|$|E
