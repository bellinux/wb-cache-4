40|$|Many {{universities}} {{intend to}} obtain ORCID identifier for their researchers {{and to use}} it in their <b>university</b> <b>systems,</b> {{one of the most common}} being the university repository. University repositories are no isolated archives. They provide significant added value to the existing university information infrastructure, and their integration within the <b>university</b> information <b>system</b> is essential. The Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU) systematically builds integration of its repository within various subsystems of the <b>university</b> information <b>system.</b> It provides mutual advantages. The article discusses a technical and process solution to how users can obtain their ORCID identifiers through <b>university</b> identity management <b>system,</b> its distribution to the integrated <b>university</b> <b>systems</b> (such as <b>university</b> repository, study information system, CRIS), and the design of the optimized automated data flow and data management of ORCID identifier distribution between the entities involved without a need of frequent manual intervention. It illustrates the possibilities of integrating ORCID to <b>university</b> <b>systems</b> using ORCID APIs and advantages of synchronizing ORCID identifier to DSpace using newly developed DSpace authority control and extension of DSpace RESTful API. The synchronization processes are fully automated and they are based on Enterprise Service Bus technology...|$|R
