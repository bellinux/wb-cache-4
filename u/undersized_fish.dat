40|$|Short-term {{mortality}} and size selectivity resulting from different hook types and sizes were studied. Special {{emphasis was on}} derbio, Trachynotus ovatus, as it is commonly caught as an undersized species in recreational fisheries of the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean). Results showed that mortality was generally low (0 - 17. 9 %). The anatomical hook location (AHL) (the anatomical region where the hook penetrated) was the main significant predictor of mortality, as more than 85 % of fish caught in deep locations of the body, such as the oesophagus, stomach or gills, died over a 2 h-holding period. Hook size was also {{a significant predictor of}} mortality because the mortality rates caused by the smallest hooks (sizes 14 and 12) were higher than those of the largest hooks (sizes 10, 8 and 6). For circle hooks, {{mortality and}} deep-hooking incidences were not observed, confirming the conservation properties of this hook type. To estimate size selectivity parameters, applied logistic models normally used in commercial fisheries were fitted to estimate descriptors of slope of selectivity curves and L 50 (length at 50 % selection). Results showed that larger hooks were more size-selective than smaller hooks, but also fewer fish were caught. However, the yield (g h- 1) between hook sizes did not change dramatically (large hooks 1345. 0 ± 179. 8 g h- 1; small hooks 1467. 8 ± 66. 5 g h- 1), since large hooks tended to catch much larger fish than the smaller hooks. As a strategy to conserve resources the use of larger hooks in recreational fisheries is therefore recommended since they result in minimal mortality to released fish and reduce incidental catch of <b>undersized</b> <b>fishes.</b> © 2008 The Authors.

40|$|To {{find ways}} of {{reducing}} the by-catch in the North Sea brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishery, experiments were carried out with electric pulses. The basic idea was to selectively invoke a startle response in shrimp without stimulating any by-catch species. A selective groundrope could then be used in combination with electric pulses to obtain catch separation. Sea trials with the electro-net showed that the raised groundrope created an escape route for most fish species regularly caught in shrimp trawls, while the electric field made the shrimps tail-flip high enough to be caught. The electro-net with raised groundrope and small meshes in the top panel gave satisfactory results. The losses of commercial shrimp catches were negligible. Part of the <b>undersized</b> commercial <b>fish</b> catch could escape and non-commercial fish and invertebrates were caught in lower numbers compared to the standard gear.

40|$|The Brown Shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) {{fishery in}} the North Sea, {{the focus of}} this study, is carried out with small meshed nets in {{vulnerable}} areas like coastal zones and estuaries. The discarding practices associated with it have been regarded as a problem for many years. The discussion, however, was difficult since no sufficiently reliable discard data were available. The need for data on this issue and a solution for the discard problem was the starting point of the study. The main objectives were to quantify the biological and economic consequences of discarding in the Brown Shrimp fishery and to evaluate possible technical alterations to the shrimp beam trawl to reduce discarding in this fishery. To fill the gap in knowledge on discarding practices in the North Sea Brown Shrimp fishery, a cooperative discard sampling programme was set up. In this study, absolute numbers of discards were produced. These were carefully examined in relation to other factors that determine the composition of a fish stock by using a newly designed biological and economic model. A next step in the project was a detailed study of the selectivity of the shrimp trawl. This was done for the sake of having a good description of the selective properties of the shrimp beam trawl and as a preparation for the experiments with selectivity improving devices. Three such devices were selected for study: 1) a selective sorting grid, 2) a selective sieve net and 3) electric pulses as an alternative stimulation. Although the selective grids have some clear advantages, like catch reduction of Age 1 + fish, non-commercial fish and invertebrates and better cod-end selectivity, they were found to be too susceptible to malfunction. The sieve net on the other hand, seemed to be a more acceptable device to fishermen with better selective properties. The basic idea in the application of electric pulses was to invoke selectively a startle response for shrimp with electric ticklers and to allow non-reacting species to escape underneath a raised groundrope. From the sea trials, it can be concluded that the electro-net gave satisfactory results. The losses of commercial shrimp were small or even non-existent. Part of the catch of <b>undersized</b> commercial <b>fish</b> species could escape and especially non-commercial fish and invertebrates were caught in lower numbers compared to the standard net. New technical measures were established in 2002 and included, for Belgium, the enforcement of the use of sieve nets in the Brown Shrimp fishery. Without doubt, these measures will reduce the impact that shrimp fishing has on the fish stocks and on the ecosystem as a whole. Nevertheless, where fishing occurs, impact on the ecosystem is inevitable. The Sea Fisheries Department has the intention to continue to strive towards more environmental friendly fishing...|$|R
40|$|The landing {{obligation}} {{is a key}} element of the reform to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which came into force on 1 st January 2014. Other key changes include regionalised fisheries management and a legal commitment to fish sustainably. A ban on discarding comes into force for pelagic fisheries first, on 1 st January 2015. Subsequently, it will cover demersal fisheries between 2016 and 2019. It only applies to fish stocks which are managed by catch limits, or quotas. Non-quota stocks are not covered by the discard ban. The {{landing obligation}}, {{often referred to as the}} discard ban, is a ban on discarding fish which are subject to catch limits, so that all catches must be brought ashore, except where they are subject to specific exemptions. This means that quotas now control what is caught at sea, rather than what is landed onshore. Article 14 of the new CFP basic regulation stipulates that “Member States may produce a “discard atlas” showing the level of discards in each of the fisheries covered by the landing obligation”. For the North Sea, the ‘Scheveningen Group’ developed a discard atlas to document the current knowledge of how much discards are generated in the North Sea and to assemble information on strategies to mitigate discards. This latest report presents an analogous document, following the format of the North Sea work, to produce a discards atlas for the North Western Waters (NWW) region – specifically, for demersal fisheries. The principle of the landing obligation is to provide a limit on total catch, whereby all catches of regulated species are landed, and once any of the quotas in a fishery are reached, fishing activities cease on species whose quotas are exhausted. It is anticipated this will motivate changes in fishing behaviour and practices. To maximize revenue from their catch, fishermen will attempt to avoid catching fish that will result in a curtailment of the fishing season (sometimes referred to as ‘choke species’) and avoid catching <b>undersized,</b> and low-value <b>fish,</b> which would be deducted from their quota for little or no profit. The level of incentive, and the potential impact for vessel operators, will be dependent on their catch and discard patterns and the quota availability. The purpose of this discard atlas is to provide evidence of discard patterns for different fishing fleets in the North Western Waters region. This information may be used to assist regional managers with the identification of fisheries which may need more focussed attention in the transition to the landing obligation, and in the formulation of a Discard Plan and Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs). There is substantial detail presented in this atlas. The NWW Atlas is intended to be interrogated by regional managers to enable comparisons between fishing vessel groups (fleet segments), fisheries and species, and in turn facilitate priority setting. It is not the intention of the atlas to articulate different management options; hence there is limited analysis and discussion of the content. With this purpose in mind, it is important to understand the quality of the data. The NWW Atlas is derived from the best available data. The results presented are based on the official STECF database which holds information on landings and discards between 2003 and 2012. The information on effort,landings and discards in EU fisheries are derived from two sources - effort and landings from the national fisheries statistics, and discards data collected under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF, EEC, 2000). Discard data are sampled and recorded for less than 2 % of all fishing operations, and these data are extrapolated to the fleet level. Where no data exist for a fishery, fill-ins are used from data from related fisheries, as is standard practice. If an estimate is largely derived from such filled-in data it may be less accurate. As with the North Sea atlas, the data quality of discard estimates was assessed by calculating the proportion of the discard estimate derived from actual observations relative to the overall amount of discards. However, this does not account for the level of initial extrapolation from the samples to the fleet, which can mean estimates are based on low samples. Known uncertainties in the data are described in the text that support the tables. The STECF database was used to compile landings and discards data for some of the most-commonly caught species in the North Western Waters (STECF 2013 a) using data from 2010 to 2012. The data presented are from the west of Scotland (VIa), Irish Sea (VIIa) and the Celtic Sea (ICES Divisions VII b-c and e-k). The data for the Eastern Channel (VIId) was compiled for the Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries and can be found in Annex 8. Discard ratios were used to express the percentage proportion of the catch that consisted of discards. Data are presented in the same format as that in the ‘Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries’ - estimated totals of landings and discards (in tonnes) by year and species, country and fisheries. The analysis of the pelagic fisheries was conducted prior to, and separately from, the demersal fisheries. The ‘Discard Atlas of the North Western Waters Pelagic and Industrial Fisheries’ can be found here. Included within the NWW Discard Atlas is a review of some of the legislation introduced and research conducted to mitigate discards. To improve mitigation strategies, it is important to know the reasons for discarding. Unfortunately, precise reasons are often unknown, because they are not recorded by fishers, and also because a mix of market- and regulatory conditions may influence decisions to discard. Inferences on the drivers for discarding can be made based on the length of the fish and the presence of different regulations. This is further elaborated upon in the ‘Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries’ which can be found here. The various reasons for discarding will necessitate different solutions. It should be understood that the methods most effective at mitigating discards of larger fish, driven by quota restrictions, will be different to discards that are undersized and are driven by the selective properties of fishing gears. Therefore, the data presented here should be used as a start point to identify fisheries which require more attention in the implementation of the CFP. More detailed analysis of the discard patterns in these fisheries is then required to determine appropriate mitigation and management strategies. It should also be noted that historical discard patterns (2010 - 12) indicate the potential issues under the future landing obligation, but pulses in recruitment or changing distributions of species may create different issues for fishing vessel operators than those that can be deduced from the historical data presented here...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary In {{biological}} terms, a discard ban will {{be beneficial}} if total removals are reduced. From an economic perspective {{it is important}} that this reduction in total removals is done in a cost-effective way. For a landing obligation to help to reduce or avoid discards, either a high level of surveillance or proper economic incentives to land the catch are needed. If a landing obligation is established but there are no incentives to avoid <b>undersized</b> <b>fish,</b> the exploitation pattern would remain unchanged and landings would include undersized individuals that would be otherwise discarded. In this case, the effort (or fishing mortality) that maximizes landings in weight (including <b>undersized</b> <b>fish)</b> will be higher than the effort (fishing mortality) that maximizes landings without the landing obligation (that did not include <b>undersized</b> <b>fish).</b> This happens because in the long-term higher fishing effort and fishing mortality level lead to lower average size of the individuals. If quotas are set accordingly to landing maximisation, this could lead to a lower biomass at sea and larger landings but a reduction of their average size. For some fisheries a landing obligation could provide by itself (i. e., with no need of more measures) an incentive to improve selectivity, either because the storage capacity on board is constrained or because sorting time is too large. If fish that was previously discarded could be avoided, then compared to the current situation (with the same effort or quota level), landings above Minimum Landing Size (MLS) would increase together with the average weight of landings and the biomass at sea. Hence, we identify the economic and social criteria to evaluate discard mitigation strategies. These criteria can be divided in three groups: changes in the economic performance, changes in employment, and changes in production. A series of parameters are provided, that need {{to be taken into account}} in order to measure the economic and social impacts of each Discard Mitigation Strategies (DMS) or of any other defined management scenario...|$|E

40|$|Benthos release panels (BRPs) {{are known}} for their {{capacity}} to release large amounts of unwanted benthos and debris, which can decrease mortality on these animals and eases the on board sorting process aboard demersal beam trawlers. They can reduce the bycatch of <b>undersized</b> <b>fish,</b> which is desired once the European discard ban is implemented. However, unacceptable commercial losses of sole (Solea solea L.) and damage to the BRP as a consequence of suboptimal and unsuitable rigging in the traditional beam trawl with chain mat, is hampering a successful introduction in commercial beam-trawl fisheries. To eliminate these drawbacks, square-meshed BRPs with different mesh sizes (150, 200, and 240 [*]mm) were rigged in a trawl with square net design as used in electrotrawls and tested for selectivity. In addition to this, the effect of electric stimulation {{at the height of the}} BRP to eliminate the loss of commercial sole was examined. According to our observations, no abrasion of the net attributable to suboptimal rigging occurred in any of the BRPs tested. The catch comparisons showed significant release of benthos and <b>undersized</b> <b>fish</b> in all panel mesh sizes, but there was always a significant loss of marketable sole in the 150, 200, and 240 [*]mm BRPs. Adding a 80 [*]Hz electric cramp stimulus to the BRP, resulted in equal catches of sole larger than 25 [*]cm as the standard net, without negatively affecting the release of benthos and most undersized commercial fish. This clearly demonstrates the promising potential of electrified BRPs (eBRPs), but further optimization by using smaller BRP mesh sizes or optimized electric stimuli is warranted to retain all marketable sole...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, two model {{designs for}} {{estimating}} selection curves of trawl fishing gears are studied. [...] The first, a probabilistic model design is introduced in this dissertation. It is a Three- Part Model Design use in Trouser Trawl Experiments. In this model design, {{the problem of}} Greenland halibut (turbot) fish meshed in the forepart component of the fishing net is addressed and retention probabilities for all length classes are derived from specific experimental data. Furthermore, a bell-shaped selection curve is adopted for the forepart component of the gear. This model design {{will enable us to}} make more accurate assessment of fishing efficiency of trawl gears and their ability to release <b>undersized</b> <b>fish.</b> [...] The second probabilistic model design introduced in this dissertation is the Modified Alternate Haul Model Design use in Trawl Experiments. In this model design, the control gear (which measures the total population) involved in traditional alternate haul experiments is eliminated. By utilizing this model design, an arbitrary number of gear modifications (including standard gear) can be compared from limited experimental data. This model design will also enable the experimental data collected on fishing gears evaluation, to be used to produce their individual selection curves. Application of this model design has significant potential to reduce monetary costs and waste of <b>undersized</b> <b>fish,</b> and improve efficiency of future experimental work. [...] In this dissertation, several examples are provided to illustrate applications of two proposed model designs. The results of applying the models to the experimental data sets collected in Phrase I study on Greenland halibut (turbot) in Canadian Waters are most encouraging...|$|E
