25|$|Most {{countries}} have breed descriptions that {{say that the}} Irish Terrier should not be more than 48cm measured at the withers. However, it is not <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> females that are 50cm tall or dogs that are even 53cm (20in). Younger generations are closer to the ideal, {{but there is a}} downside to this: when an Irish Terrier is very small and light-boned, it loses the correct racy type.|$|E

25|$|When the Lincoln Cent was {{introduced}} in 1909, {{it was discovered that}} the coining dies and their curved fields were unable to be polished to proof coining condition by existing Mint equipment. To produce Proof coinage for collectors, the U.S. Mint adopted the French technique of the Matte Proof, which was thought to highlight the design, while leaving the details of the coin as the designer intended. This was done by a sandblasting of the dies prior to use. When struck by the high pressure hydraulic press of the Philadelphia Mint Medal Room, the result was a semi-rough surface, a gentle luster and strongly defined wide square rims. These coins were produced in very small numbers, and the dies quickly developed small marks, known as diagnostics. These marks are used today by Third Party Graders and Collectors to authenticate the coin. Sold for mere pennies over face during the years of production, they were not popular with collectors. When new, the coins were wrapped in a tarnish-proof tissue, which over time proved to be anything but. Since many of these coins sat for decades unsold, vivid colors and toning developed. It is not <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> vivid blues, greens, lavender, coppery orange, deep reds and purple hues on these coins. Eagerly collected by numismatists today, they are among the most valuable Lincoln cents. Unencapsulated coins are easily identified by wide, square outer rims, quite unlike the rounded edges of business strikes.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{found himself}} in the Judan once more, this time 14 years after his last bid as {{challenger}} in 1991 against Masaki Takemiya (Cho lost 3â€“2). Cho {{found himself in}} a league with old friends and rivals, including Masao Kato, Rin Kaiho, and Yoda Norimoto. The league also included young guns Cho U, Shinji Takao, and Keigo Yamashita. Keeping this in mind, it {{was not going to be}} an easy campaign for Cho. His first match was against Yujiro Hashimoto. Cho, holding black, won the match by resignation. In his next match, he found himself against another young powerhouse, Kimio Yamada. This time, holding white, Cho squeezed by with a win of just half a point. Cho continued his run, his next opponent being Naoto Hikosaka. Again holding white, Cho went on to win by 2 and a half points. His last match of the main tournament was against Tomoyasu Mimura, of which he held white once more, and cruised past by resignation. His opponent for the challenger final was Shinji Takao, who had beaten at then some of the top players in Japan, Masao Kato and Norimoto Yoda, on his way into the loser's section of the tournament. Cho took white in the game, and won by 1 and a half points. This made Cho the challenger for the 43rd Judan against title holder O Rissei. O had held the title for 4 straight years before being challenged by Cho. The final would prove to be an exciting one, as the first match ended with a half point win for Cho. The next match was a win for O, by 5 and a half points. The third match was a very large win for O, winning by 19 and a half points, which is <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in pro games. This didn't stop Cho, as he would get revenge by forcing O into resignation in the fourth game. The fifth and last game would go Cho's way, with a 5 and a half point win over O. This was Cho's 68th title, and fourth time winning the Judan.|$|E

500|$|It is not <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> thrashing, tormenting and caning in Busch's works. Sharp pencils pierced through models, housewives fall onto kitchen knives, thieves are spiked by umbrellas, tailors {{cut their}} {{tormentors}} with scissors, rascals are ground in corn mills, drunkards burn, and cats, dogs and monkeys defecate while being tormented. Busch has been frequently called a sadist by educators and psychologists. Tails that are burnt, pulled off, trapped, stretched or eaten {{is seen by}} Weissweiler as not aggression against animals, but a phallic allusion to Busch's undeveloped sexual life. [...] Such graphic text and imagery in cartoon form was not unusual at the time, and publishers, the public or censors found it not particularly noteworthy. Topics and motifs for his early work were derived from 18th- and 19th-century popular literature, the gruesome endings of which he often softened.|$|E
500|$|The {{passage is}} obscure, but Cerutti and Richardson argue that Gracchus begins the fight as a loincloth-wearing retiarius. When the tide turns against him, he dons a tunic and a womanish wig (spira), {{apparently}} {{part of the}} same costume, and thus enjoys a reprieve, although this attire may not itself have been considered effeminate as it was also worn by the priests of Mars of whom Gracchus was the chief priest. The change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent. It is <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a gladiator depicted this way in a satire, as such fighters usually take the role of men who are [...] "brawny, brutal, sexually successful with women of both high and low status, but especially the latter, ill-educated if not uneducated, and none too bright intellectually." [...] The retiarius tunicatus in the satire is the opposite: [...] "a mock gladiatorial figure, of equivocal sex, regularly dressed in costume of some sort, possibly usually as a woman, and matched against a secutor or murmillo in a mock gladiatorial exhibition." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{players are}} {{permitted}} to wear gloves, and goalkeepers usually wear specialist goalkeeping gloves. Prior to the 1970s, gloves were rarely worn, but it is now extremely <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a goalkeeper without gloves. In Portugal's match against England in the Euro 2004 tournament, Ricardo drew much comment for deciding to remove his gloves during the penalty shoot-out. Since the 1980s significant advancements {{have been made in}} the design of gloves, which now feature protectors to prevent the fingers bending backwards, segmentation to allow greater flexibility, and palms made of materials designed to protect the hand and to enhance a player's grip. Gloves are available in a variety of different cuts, including [...] "flat palm", [...] "roll finger" [...] and [...] "negative", with variations in the stitching and fit. Goalkeepers sometimes also wear caps to prevent glare from the sun or floodlights affecting their performance. Players with sight problems may wear glasses as long as there is no risk of them falling off or breaking and thereby becoming dangerous. Most players affected choose to wear contact lenses, although Dutch player Edgar Davids, unable to wear contact lenses due to glaucoma, was known for his distinctive wraparound goggles. Other items that may be dangerous to other players, such as jewellery, however, are not allowed. [...] Players may also choose to wear headgear to protect themselves from head injury as long as it presents no risk to the safety of the wearer or any other player.|$|E

500|$|Production in Sydney {{commenced}} {{the week}} beginning 1 October and lasted for 18 days. The main cast and Sean Pertwee were flown out {{along with a}} skeleton crew. Additional staff were drawn from those already working for Granada Australia, the Australian production arm of Granada Productions, as flying a complete British crew overseas would have been prohibitively expensive. Filming locations included Hyde Park, Kirribilli, Double Bay and the Northern Beaches. The scenes of Shawn's barbecue were filmed in Palm Beach and the facade of a terraced house in Paddington was used for an establishing scene of Lucy's apartment. The wedding scenes were set in the grounds of Strickland House, Vaucluse. Another scene was filmed on location outside the Sydney Opera House. While preparing for the scene, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst were distracted {{by a group of}} British tourists yelling that Karen should leave David after David's affair in Series 3. The group remained quiet when the scene was being shot. Karen and David's apartment was filmed at a building near Luna Park in Milsons Point. A stunt team co-ordinated the fight scene between Mark and David but could not convincingly choreograph a headbutt between Mark and David. The stunt co-ordinator and Pertwee, who was already experienced in stunt fighting, agreed Pertwee would get a better reaction from Bathurst by almost headbutting his face for real, instead of [...] "hitting air". Initially startled by the move, Bathurst conceded that it was better for him to be surprised as he might have flinched if he had known what Pertwee was about to do. Hermione Norris found the scene upsetting insofar as it was <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Robert Bathurst playing David in such an emotional state.|$|E

Large sections of the track have been gravelled. Without this, much of the track would degrade into mud, due to the peaty soil, and the rain that falls frequently throughout the year. In general, the track is well-maintained, and of easy to medium difficulty. Walking the track offers the <b>unusual</b> opportunity <b>to</b> <b>see</b> kiwi in the wild.
