25|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} staged by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, {{which is based}} on {{clinical}} examination, rather than surgical findings. It allows only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous <b>urography,</b> and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization.|$|E
25|$|The main imaging tests {{performed}} {{in order to}} identify renal cell carcinoma are pelvic and abdominal CT scans, ultrasound tests of the kidneys (ultrasonography), MRI scans, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or renal angiography. Among these main diagnostic tests, other radiologic tests such as excretory <b>urography,</b> positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning, ultrasonography, arteriography, venography, and bone scanning {{can also be used to}} aid in the evaluation of staging renal masses and to differentiate non-malignant tumours from malignant tumours.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{may include}} a {{fluorescence}} {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) test, computed tomography <b>urography</b> (CTU), magnetic resonance <b>urography</b> (MRU), intravenous pyelography (IVP) x-ray, ureteroscopy, or biopsy.|$|E

40|$|A new {{contrast}} medium, BC- 80 L (methylglucamine salt o f 3 -acetamidomethyl- 5 -acetamido 1, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid), {{was used}} chiefly for excretory pyelography {{as well as}} for angiography and other <b>urographies.</b> The results obtained are summarized as follows in comparison with that with Diatrizoate. 1. Excretory pyelography performed on 63 cases with BC- 80 L showed satisfactory contrast in 85. 7 % of the cases. 2. On 38 ca ses, excretory pyelography was performed with both BC- 80 L and Diatrizoate. Excellent contrast was obtained in much more cases with the former than with the latter. (In few number of the cases, however.) 3. For the other urog r a phical procedures, however, contrast was not significantly different between with BC- 80 L and with Diatrizoate. 4. Side effects were observe d in 22. 2 % of the cases studied with BC- 80 L, but they were slight and temporary and were not significantly different from that with the other contrast media. 5.

40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} impact of lower pole calyceal anatomy on clearace of lower pole stones after extracorporeal {{shockwave}} lithotripsy (ESWL) by means of a new and previously defined radiographic measurement method. Materials and Methods Sixty-four patients with solitary radiopaque lower pole kidney stones were enrolled in the study. Infundibulopelvic angle (IPA), infundibulotransverse angle (ITA), infundibular lenght(IL), and infundibular width (IW) were measured on the intravenous <b>urographies</b> which were taken before the procedure. Results 48 of 64 patients (75 %) were stone-free after a follow-up period of 3 months. The IPA,ITA,IL and IW were determined as statistically significant factors, while age,gender and stone area were found to have no impact on clearance. Conclusion By the help of radiographic measurement methods related to lower pole kidney anatomy, appropriate patient selection and increment in success after ESWL may be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 4 years 18 {{children}} were observed at the La Timone-Enfants Hospital in Marseille with renal lesions consequent to nonpenetrating abdominal traumas. Hematuria {{was reported in}} 14 cases (7 macroscopic and 7 microscopic) and all cases suffered from abdominal and/or lumbar pain. In relation to the diagnostic iter used: 18 echographies, 15 <b>urographies,</b> 13 TAC, 2 ascendant pyelographies, 2 scintigraphies with DMSA, 1 echo-Doppler and one angiography were performed. Renal lesions were classified as: 8 type 1, 5 type 2, 4 type 3, 1 type 4. Four cases were operated and one case underwent percutaneous drainage of an urohematoma. Following an analysis of these case and a revision of the literature, the authors emphasise that the evolution and progress in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this important aspect of traumatic pathology in children enables an almost complete recovery of kidney function in almost all cases...|$|R
40|$|Conray 400 was {{examined}} {{as to its}} contrast ability and side effects on 67 excretory pyelographies with intravenous injection of 40 ml, and the following results were obtained. Diagnostic pyelograms were observed in 125 out of 132 kidneys (94. 7 %). In 58. 3 %, more than {{one third of the}} whole length of the ureter or the ureter above the obstruction was also clearly visualized. And in 55 out of 67 cases (82. 1 %), it was possible to make diagnosis without other <b>urographies.</b> Side effects were observed in 44. 8 %, among which pain in the blood vessel was most frequent. All of them, however, were slight and serious side effects were not experienced. Characteristically, Conray 400 is easy to inject intravenously owing to the low viscosity, hax excellent contrast ability and gives clear and detailed image. It was emphasized that the pre-treatment of intestines was almost not required for 40 ml-injection method and that Conray 400 was easy to inject, giving a natural image of the urinary tract without need of a pressure bandage over the ureter...|$|R

40|$|Many {{intravenous}} <b>urographies</b> (IVU) {{are still}} made shortly after ureteral reimplantation as a routine procedure {{to evaluate the}} function of both kidneys and to exclude a severe distal ureteral obstruction known as a complication of the operation (Broaddus et al., 1978). By studying two groups of patients we present {{an evaluation of the}} use of this IVU and the possible replacement by ultrasonography (US). The first group consisted of 119 cases with 155 reimplanted ureters. All of the patients underwent an IVU within two weeks and again three months after the operation. The second group included 35 patients, who underwent 55 reimplantations: US of the kidneys was performed within two weeks and three months and also one year after operation. In the first group three patients needed a second reimplantation because of a developed distal ureteral stenosis after three months. The second IVU showed severe dilatation in all of them. In two patients of the second group we also saw an increase in dilatation during follow-up within three months, for which a ureteral reimplantation was indicated. There was not a single case in which the outcome of the early IVU or US gave rise to a serious change in postoperative management. Our conclusion is that the early postoperative IVU, should be replaced by US of the kidneys, the result of which should function as a baseline for further follow-up studie...|$|R
40|$|Microscopic haematuria is a urinary {{finding more}} and more {{frequently}} observed in routine analysis in childhood. The diagnostic problems, most of which unresolved, are yet the principal question concerning in. We have studied 123 patients during five years from 1975 to 1980, and followed them for 1 - 8 years (mean 4 years). Oue experience allowed us to consider “normal” or without remarkable pathologic significance a urinary findings {{less than or equal}} to 5, 000 RBC/m’ at the Addis count. Such findings was pointed out in 55 cases (44 %); 27 patients (22 %) had 5 - 10, 000 RBC/m’, 34 patients (27. 6 %) presented 10 - 50, 000 RBC/m’, and 7 cases (5. 7 %) had more than 50, 000 RBC/m’. The familiar background, the clinical, biological, and immunological data, the roentgenographic investigations and the renal biopsy carried out in 4 group of patients, led us to the following conclusions: (1) 26 % of the 123 cases had an “unexplained” microscopic haematuria with complete lack of anamnestic data, symptomatology and with normal biological findings. (2) In 65. 8 % of the cases it was possible to discover frequent upper respiratory tract infections (and allergy in 5. 6 % of them). (3) In 26 % of the patients we discovered a previous or actual genitor-urinary (10. 5 % and 15. 5 % respectively) infection: 9. 4 % of 96 <b>urographies</b> demonstrated a variable degree of nephro-urological abnormalities. (4) 23 children (18. 7 %) was selected for renal biopsy, primarily by the hypocomplementemia and positive anti-DNA ab. Test, and secondly by elevated degree of microematuria. The histological and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of mesangial proliferation glomerulonephritis with IgC-IgA-C 3 deposits in 7 cases (30 % of the cases biopsied and 5. 6 % of the total), 69. 6 % of the cases had only minimal changes with negative immunofluorescence. (5) A mean follow-up of 4 years in two groups of patients (6 years of age) has demonstrated that microscopic haematuria remains unchanged in 18 - 19 % of both groups. A more marked improvement or normalization has been documented in the children more than 6 years aged (p< 0. 001) while a worsening has been observed in the children less than 6 years aged (p< 0. 005), with a difference statistically significant between the two groups considered...|$|R
