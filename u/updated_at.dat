5|$|The Storm Prediction Center also is {{responsible}} for issuing fire weather outlooks (FWD) for the continental United States. These outlooks are a guidance product for local, state and federal government agencies, including local National Weather Service offices, in forecasting the potential for wildfires. The outlooks issued are for Day 1, Day 2, and Days 3–8. The Day 1 product is issued at 4:00 a.m. Central Time and is <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> 1700Z, and is valid from 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 2 outlook is issued at 1000Z and is <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> 2000Z for the forecast period of 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 3–8 outlook is issued at 2200Z, and is valid from 1200Z {{two days after the}} current calendar date to 1200Z seven days after the current calendar date.|$|E
5|$|The Hanzhong {{state was}} divided into 24 regions which were led by an official. Each {{district}} had a civil register which recorded people's names and ranks. Three times a year, the registers were <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> {{the same time as}} an important feast. While a child's rank rose automatically, adults had to raise their own rank through religious achievement or marriage. Higher ranked people had more divine generals at their command, which could be used to fight demons that caused bad luck or disease. The state had a system of law that encouraged confession and benevolence rather than strict punishment. Criminals were asked to confess their crimes and meditate, and were given public work to do as a sentence. Few texts written by the Hanzhong Celestial Masters survive, with the most important being the Xiang'er commentary to the Dao De Jing. While the Hanzhong state lasted for only twenty-five years, their beliefs influenced all subsequent Daoist movements.|$|E
5|$|While {{eight of}} the Nine Ministers could be of {{commoner}} origin, the post of Minister of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng 宗正), {{also known as the}} Director of the Imperial Clan, was always occupied {{by a member of the}} imperial family. He oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of each year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member of the imperial family, the Minister of the Imperial Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister of the Imperial Clan.|$|E

25|$|Party Shuffle {{was renamed}} iTunes DJ in iTunes 8. When iTunes was updated to 8.1, {{quite a few}} {{features}} were added to iTunes DJ.

Along with the song request feature voting on songs in the queue was added, the more votes a song gets the higher in the queue it will be and the sooner it will be played. Song voting can only be done when song requesting is enabled and in two ways: the first by right clicking on a song in the iTunes DJ queue on the host's computer in iTunes, the second is in the Remote application ether connected with the iTunes DJ option by a guest or by the host in the full playlist section. When song requesting is enabled a customizable welcome message is displayed below the host's shared library name in the button used to connect to iTunes DJ.|$|E

25|$|Every {{municipality}} {{is required}} to maintain a publicly accessible zoning map indicating what parcels of property within the municipality {{may be used for}} what purpose. This map must be <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> least every five years. Every municipality is required by state law to have a zoning administrator who oversees the local government's regulatory scheme, and is generally the party responsible for bringing legal actions against zoning violators. Each municipality is also required to have a board of zoning appeals empowered to grant variances and settle boundary disputes. The standard for granting of variances is that the party requesting the variance faces an unnecessary hardship unique to that party, but that adjacent property will not suffer a substantial detriment, and the character of the district will not be changed. The board may also grant special use permits allowing a property owner to use a property for a purpose that is neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited within a particular zoning area, and such permits may be conditioned on the property owner making concessions such as improving roads leading into the property, providing street lighting in the area, or setting aside a certain amount of land for public use. The board of zoning appeals may be appealed to the local Circuit Court if such an appeal is filed within 30 days of the zoning board decision, and from there decisions may be appealed directly to the Virginia Supreme Court.|$|E

500|$|The editor was {{available}} {{for the first time}} during the phase 1 beta testing of StarCraft II, when it came with a patch. With the start of phase 2, the editor was <b>updated.</b> <b>At</b> present, there is a large map-making community using the editor, creating first-person shooter games, RPGs, tower defense, and AoS-type games. The map database is constantly being updated as more map makers create mods for the community. The new editor also changes the way maps are distributed: rather than hosting games using local map files, users now create and join games using maps that have been published to Battle.net. [...] map or mod uploads are limited to a total of 50 MB of storage, divided between ten files at most, with no file being larger than 10 MB. [...] Although the StarCraft II Editor offers more features than the original StarCraft Editor in terms of game customization, there are concerns that the publishing limitations of Battle.net will not allow for large-scale custom maps or extensive map availability unless there is an external map publishing tool.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} website and Twitter {{account for the}} project were both launched on July 3, 2012 and confirmed the Persona 3: The Movie project's theatrical nature. The July 3 launch was scheduled so as {{to pay homage to}} the use of two major plot mechanics in the Persona 3 video game — namely the midnight Dark Hour phenomenon as well as correlation to the lunar phases with respect to the calendar full moon whereby an exceptionally powerful Shadow would appear on the night of its occurrence. This tactic was henceforth utilized by Aniplex to mark succeeding updates regarding the project and also aided by the Twitter account which <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> select lunar occurrences thereafter. When the {{official website}} was launched it featured the simple ambiguous caption [...] "Coming soon". This was later changed during the full moon of December 28, 2012 when the website showcased the first promotional image along with the line, [...] "Persona 3 the Movie #1 2013 in theaters" [...] — teasing a future film franchise. However word had yet to be announced on the number of planned films.|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{often said}} that the Abbey Road studio was [...] "no good", much to {{producer}} George Martin's annoyance: [...] "The trouble was that Alex was always coming to the studios {{to see what we}} were doing and to learn from it, {{while at the same time}} saying ‘These people are so out of date.’ But I found it very difficult to chuck him out, because the boys liked him so much. Since it was very obvious that I didn’t, a minor schism developed". Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track tape machine, instead of the 4-track at Abbey Road—which was being <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> the time to an 8-track—so he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters on Savile Row. One of Mardas' more outrageous plans was to replace the acoustic baffles around Starr's drums with an invisible sonic force field. Starr remembered that Mardas bought some [...] "huge" [...] computers from British Aerospace, which were stored in his barn, but [...] "they never left the barn", and were later sold as scrap metal.|$|E
500|$|Typical HMM-based methods work by {{representing}} an MSA {{as a form}} of directed acyclic graph {{known as}} a partial-order graph, which consists of a series of nodes representing possible entries in the columns of an MSA. In this representation a column that is absolutely conserved (that is, that all the sequences in the MSA share a particular character at a particular position) is coded as a single node with as many outgoing connections as there are possible characters in the next column of the alignment. In the terms of a typical hidden Markov model, the observed states are the individual alignment columns and the [...] "hidden" [...] states represent the presumed ancestral sequence from which the sequences in the query set are hypothesized to have descended. An efficient search variant of the dynamic programming method, known as the Viterbi algorithm, is generally used to successively align the growing MSA to the next sequence in the query set to produce a new MSA. This is distinct from progressive alignment methods because the alignment of prior sequences is <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> each new sequence addition. However, like progressive methods, this technique can be influenced by the order in which the sequences in the query set are integrated into the alignment, especially when the sequences are distantly related.|$|E

500|$|The {{publicity}} {{surrounding the}} allegations had a drastic effect on Cosby's reputation, {{as seen in}} the following drop in his ratings. In March 2013, Cosby had a 76.3 rating on the Davie-Brown Index, a rating of the public perceptions of roughly 3500 personalities published by Omnicom Group company The Marketing Arm, placing him as the third most-trusted celebrity, behind Morgan Freeman and Dr. Mehmet Oz. By November 19, this had fallen to 57.1, placing him at either the 2,626th spot or 2615th, depending on the source. The same company's separate rating on who consumers view as an [...] "effective product spokesperson" [...] saw Cosby drop to 2,746th spot; at one point, he had been 5th. Awareness of Cosby increased from 63rd to 51st. The Marketing Arm warns about misinterpreting the ratings fall; it said 900 celebrities were within the margin of error for Cosby's rating. At the time of the accusations, E-Poll Market Research had not updated its scores; a Q Score for Cosby was not expected until 2015. The executive vice-president of Q Scores Co. said polling {{in the midst of a}} scandal would likely overstate the score's longterm effects. All three companies' scores are <b>updated</b> <b>at</b> different intervals, meaning they are not directly comparable. Jell-O was relatively unaffected on social media by allegations against Cosby. The brand was mentioned in one percent of posts about Cosby, which was considered low. Still, negative connections continued, including by rapper Eminem in a freestyle rap, and an article by Food Drink and Franchise magazine pointed out moments in commercials that were awkward in retrospect.|$|E
