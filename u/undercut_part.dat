25|$|<b>Undercuts</b> on molded <b>parts</b> are {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into {{internal and external}} undercuts, where external undercuts are on {{the exterior of the}} <b>part</b> and interior <b>undercuts</b> are {{on the inside of the}} <b>part.</b> <b>Undercuts</b> can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.|$|R

The machining outputs are explained based on different aspects ofchip formation mechanism and practical issues faced by industries during titaniummachining. This study also analyzed and linked the methods that effectively improve themachinability of titanium alloys. It is found that the deformation mechanism duringmachining of titanium alloys is complex and causes basic challenges, such as saw-toothchips, high temperature, high stress on cutting tool, high tool wear and <b>undercut</b> <b>parts.</b> Thesechallenges are correlated and affected by each other. Saw tooth-chips cause variation incutting forces which results in high cyclic stress on cutting tools. On the other hand, lowthermal conductivity of titanium alloy causes high temperature. These cause a favorableenvironment for high tool wear.

50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1980s, {{centrally}} <b>parted</b> <b>undercuts,</b> derived from the bowl cut, made a comeback among fans of new wave, synthpop, and electronic music {{as an alternative to}} the mullets and backcombed hair worn by glam metal bands. A collar-length version of the haircut, known as curtained hair, went mainstream in the early 1990s and was worn by many celebrities, most notably Tom Cruise.|$|R
50|$|Undercuts {{should be}} avoided for ease of manufacturing. Undercuts {{typically}} require additional mechanisms for manufacture adding to mold cost and complexity. In addition, the part must have room to flex and deform. Clever part design or minor design concessions often can eliminate complex mechanisms for undercuts. Undercuts may require additional time for unloading molds. It is recommended that <b>undercuts</b> on a <b>part</b> {{should be avoided}} to the extent possible.|$|R
40|$|Controlled Metal Build Up (CMB) is a Rapid Prototyping/Rapid Tooling {{technology}} for the automated generation of metal parts and tools. It combines laser cladding and high speed milling in one machine tool. Based on the principal of laser cladding, in general, {{it is impossible to}} create undercuts, i. e. for conformal cooling channels. As a first step of the study, a material to build up supporting structures had to be chosen. Then, using the chosen material, <b>undercuts</b> in metal <b>parts</b> were created and their usability for industrial applications was discussed. At least Controlled Metal Build Up was economically compared with conventional technologies, such as milling or EDM/ECM...|$|R
2500|$|Webster retains {{his high}} {{prestige}} in recent historiography. Baxter argues that his nationalistic {{view of the}} union as one and inseparable from liberty helped the union to triumph over the states-rights Confederacy, making it his greatest contribution. However Bartlett, emphasizing Webster's private life, says his great oratorical achievements were in <b>part</b> <b>undercut</b> by his improvidence with money, his excessively opulent lifestyle, and his numerous conflict of interest situations. Remini points out [...] that Webster's historical orations taught Americans their history before textbooks were widely available.Webster was godlike in his articulation of American nationalism, Remini agrees, but his negative traits ruined his presidential ambition. He lacked the necessary modesty and his overpowering desire for the White House, and his craving for money was unbecoming to a statesman of his caliber in a nation committed to republicanism and fearful of corruption.|$|R
40|$|The FluidForming {{technology}} {{represents an}} alternative {{sheet metal forming}} approach {{as compared to the}} traditional, bladder based hydroforming, metal spinning, and sheet metal stamping processes. The machine construction allows for much higher forming pressures of up to 400 [*]MPa/ 60, 000 psi. The technology also enables material flow into the dies, thus, providing more material in potentially critical areas. Modular die construction allows for very cost effective solutions including plastic dies, 3 D printed dies, die nesting, and split dies. This approach, in-turn, allows <b>undercuts</b> in the <b>parts</b> and generates scratch- and mostly distortion-free parts from pre-painted, pre-patterned, and pre-polished materials like AL, SS, CU, TI or any of the new high performance alloys. As a result, the technology enables a new product development approach that can focus on optimization and/or Time-to-Market while maintaining or lowering the overall Cost-to-Market. In fact, the development cycle can be accelerated to be less than a week from the CAD design to the production of highly accurate, repeatable metal parts that may not even be manufacturable with other technologies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the authors}} propose {{a system for}} {{assisting}} mold designers of plastic parts. With a CAD model of a part, the system automatically determines the optimal ejecting direction of the <b>part</b> with minimum <b>undercuts.</b> Since plastic <b>parts</b> are generally very thin, many rib features are placed {{on the inner side}} of the part to give sufficient structural strength. Our system extracts the rib features from the CAD model of the part, and determines the possible ejecting directions based on the geometric properties of the features. The system then selects the optimal direction with minimum undercuts. Possible ejecting directions are represented as discrete points on a Gauss map. Our new point distribution method for the Gauss map is based on the concept of the architectural geodesic dome. A hierarchical structure is also introduced in the point distribution, with a higher level “rough” Gauss map with rather sparse point distribution and another lower level “fine” Gauss map with much denser point distribution. A system is implemented and computational experiments are performed. Our system requires less than 10 seconds to determine the optimal ejecting direction of a CAD model with more than 1 million polygons...|$|R
40|$|Sex {{offender}} commitment statutes are {{a controversial}} and recurring {{response to the}} threat of sexual violence. These statutes, claiming exemption from the strict constitutional limitations of the criminal law, use civil-commitment-like procedures to detain sex offenders in secure 2 ̆ 2 treatment centers. 2 ̆ 2 Litigation testing these statutes has sought to locate the border between legitimate exercise of the state 2 ̆ 7 s mental health power, and illegitimate preventative detention. This article examines the central roles that medicine and behavioral science play in the operation of sex offender commitment statutes and the litigation testing their constitutional validity. The thesis of this article is that the presence of these sciences in sex offender commitment schemes is central to their claims of validity. It is the systemic, rather than causal or interstitial, presence of science that provides the central pillar in the claim for legitimacy. But the way in which science is used, the pattern of its use and non-use, undercuts those very claims. Sex offender commitment statutes can partially rehabilitative their claims to legitimacy by restructuring their use of science. Part IA of this article describes briefly the operation of sex offender commitment laws, introduces the legitimacy claims they make through the use of science, and sketches how the actual usage pattern of science <b>undercuts</b> those claims. <b>Part</b> IB reviews the literature on the use of science in law, highlighting concepts that are useful in assessing science in the context of sex offender commitment laws. Part II sets out in more detail the way sin which sex offender commitment schemes use and fail to use science. Part III then sets out recommendations for the use of science in sex offender commitments. The article suggests that science can be used to restore some of the legitimacy claimed by sex offender commitments but lost by current practices. It posits that courts lack the knowledge to set meaningful legal standards for sex offender commitments. The article concludes in Part IV by raising a set of cautions about even this use of science in law...|$|R
40|$|Why Do Nice Guys Finish Last?Although the {{original}} quote {{is said to}} have been about baseball, popular culture applies the idea to romantic relationships between men and women. A debate rages on in the academic community as to whether there is any truth to the old adage, "Nice guys finish last. " This short documentary film will not enter into that debate, but will instead accept the phrase as a premise, and offer one possible answer to those who wonder why. From infancy we begin learning the difference between boys and girls, men and women. Cultural cues inform our understanding from the earliest ages. Men are bigger, stronger, and tougher. Women are smaller, frailer, and softer. Men have muscles. Women have curves. Men sweat. Women glow. These cultural stereotypes are filed away in our subconscious minds and help us form impressions of who we are and how we are different from others. Yet gender stereotypes can also undermine our attempts to connect at deeper levels with other human beings and thwart our romantic affairs. The film will explore this theory in three parts. Part One will first pose the question, why do nice guys finish last? Next it will focus on cultural ideals of masculinity through a video montage using clips from popular movies. Part Two will engage expert opinions on the development of gender in our society, and outline the theory that gender role expectations <b>undercut</b> interpersonal relationships. <b>Part</b> Three will center around a frank and open discussion among college-age women in which they explore what kind of men they are usually attracted to versus what kind of man they eventually want to end up with. A documentary film on the subject of gender role studies sounds pretty dry. This short film is intended to be shown to college students in a classroom setting as a way of engaging their interest on the topic much more effectively than a lecture would be likely to do. Therefore the film will use a comedic approach and down-to-earth tone to explore the issues, and must clearly illustrate how this topic relates directly to students' everyday lives.
