5|$|B.telmatiaea grows as {{an upright}} bush up to 2m (7ft) high. It has hairy stems and branchlets, and straight, narrow leaves from 1½ to 3cm (½–1in) long {{and about a}} {{millimetre}} (in) wide. The leaves have a green <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> and white hairy undersurface. The new growth is pale brown, later turning green.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, adult males {{of the species}} were characterized by greatly enlarged upper arms (humerus) with a bony ridge covered by skin and black keratinized spines. Spines were also present on the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the area just before the thumbs. These spines were likely used during amplexus.|$|E

50|$|The {{species are}} 8-20 mm. in length. Ratio of body length to {{greatest}} body width 2.5-4.55. Body slightly flattened to moderately convex. Sides of body not evenly curved. Body {{not capable of}} conglobation (rolling into a ball). <b>Upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of body clothed with distinct hairs, setae or scales. Vestiture of <b>upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> not including stiff, erect, dark bristles; not including scales or scale-like setae. <b>Upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of body without deep foveae. Prothorax, metathorax and-or abdomen without extrusible glands. Underside of body without hydrofuge surface(s).|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{epithelial}} cells and fibroblasts fail to move over one another's <b>upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> in culture, resulting in monolayering. The failure of seeded fibroblasts {{to adhere to}} and spread on epithelial cell surfaces suggests that monolayering in culture {{is due to the}} lack of adhesion of the <b>upper</b> cell <b>surface,</b> at least of epithelial cells. Seeded fibroblasts and postmitotic, rounded fibroblasts likewise fail to spread on the <b>upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of spread fibroblasts, suggesting that the inability of the <b>upper</b> cell <b>surface</b> to support spreading may be a general phenomenon. Inert particles and cell processes do not adhere directly to the <b>upper</b> cell <b>surface.</b> However, they can initiate adhesions to the surface at a cell's free margin, suggesting a variation of adhesive properties over a cell's surface...|$|R
5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|Teratological (developmentally abnormal) {{forms of}} H.aurantiaca were {{reported}} {{to occur in the}} United Kingdom. The fruit bodies of these specimens were club-shaped with a wrinkled <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of convoluted gill tissue. The overall morphology of these forms somewhat resembles species of Clavariadelphus. Although the cause of this abnormal development is not known with certainty, environmental pollutants or virus infection have been suggested as contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|The caps {{form from}} the top of the short stipe by the growth and {{expansion}} of a blunt margin and later as a thickening of the <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b> Spines start to form when the cap hangs over the stipe slightly. They are white in many species, but become brown in maturity as the brown-colored spores accumulate on the surface.|$|E

5|$|The {{lacrimal}} fossa, {{a depression}} in the skull, {{is located on the}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz found that it was further to the back, inside the orbit (eye socket) in the false potto and the slow loris. Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The coronoid process of the mandible is said to be more hooked in the false potto than in the potto and slow loris.|$|E
5|$|Workers of Tatuidris {{present a}} {{distinctive}} morphology, {{consisting of a}} shield-like head with a broad vertex (<b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the head), ventrally-turned heavy mandibles which do not overlap at full closure, deep antennal scrobes (an impression that receives parts of the antenna) with eyes at or close to their apex, compact and fused mesosoma, 7-segmented antenna, first gastral segment ventrally directed, and unique among ants– an antenna socket apparatus sitting upside-down {{on the roof of}} the expanded frontal lobe.|$|E
5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the <b>upper</b> <b>surface,</b> relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E

50|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of {{the wings}} of the male of the species are {{predominantly}} brown overlaid with a vividly iridescent bluish purple. In the middle of the <b>upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of both forewings and hindwings is a white band that is usually only barely visible. The undersides of the wings are a pale brown. At the tip of the forewing is a small orange patch.|$|R
50|$|The female of {{the species}} is also {{predominantly}} brown on the <b>upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the wings, but it lacks the purple coloration of the males. It also has a band of white {{in the middle of}} the <b>upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of both forewings and hindwings. Unlike in the male, this band is very distinct and broad, though it does not touch the front edge of the forewings.|$|R
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|Skulls {{of early}} tyrannosauroids were long, low and lightly constructed, {{similar to other}} coelurosaurs, while later forms had taller and more massive skulls. Despite the {{differences}} in form, certain skull features are found in all known tyrannosauroids. The premaxillary bone is very tall, blunting {{the front of the}} snout, a feature which evolved convergently in abelisaurids. The nasal bones are characteristically fused together, arched slightly upwards and often very roughly textured on their <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b> The premaxillary teeth {{at the front of the}} upper jaw are shaped differently from the rest of the teeth, smaller in size and with a D-shaped cross section. In the lower jaw, a prominent ridge on the surangular bone extends sideways from just below the jaw joint, except in the basal Guanlong.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded {{body that}} tapers {{significantly}} to the short caudal peduncle. The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it originates roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than a}} third as high as the first, and originates ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E

5|$|The fish's <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> is brown to reddish {{brown with}} many {{scattered}} darker spots, lighter streaks, and reticulations. The {{center of each}} pectoral fin is marked with an oval spot or blotch. The lower surface is light, white to grey, blotched irregularly with gray spots. The barndoor skate is unique from other species of skate in its having a straight line that begins at the snout and ends at the anterior margin of the outer corner of the disk, but stopping short of the disk.|$|E
5|$|The forearms {{are dark}} gray. The forefeet are unpigmented and ungual tufts of white hairs {{surround}} the equally unpigmented claws. The animal has long, narrow hindfeet, longer than in T.talamancae, with usually smooth soles (lacking squamae, which {{are present in}} T.talamancae). The three middle digits are much longer than the outer two. Six pads are present on the sole. The <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> and {{the sides of the}} hindfeet are white and appear naked, although short, white hairs are present; these hairs are longer in T.talamancae. Ungual tufts of long, white or gray hairs are present around the claws, which are short and lack pigment.|$|E
5|$|The larger scutes {{display a}} pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's {{plastron}} (ventral shell) is yellowish in color and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the plastron terminates in a V-shaped notch. Although sometimes speckled with yellowish spots, the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the head is often a dark gray to solid black. The ventral surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals. Seasonal variation in color vibrancy {{have been known to}} occur.|$|E
