40|$|When {{individual}} vessel quotas {{are used}} in fisheries management, quotas are set species by species, in most cases. Often, {{it is only the}} most important of the target species that are regulated by quota. There is a growing concern that the introduction of individual vessel quotas leads to increased fishing pressure on <b>unregulated</b> <b>species.</b> To model the behavior of fishermen with this regulatory structure, a constrained profit function is used, where the quota species are treated as fixed, while the <b>unregulated</b> <b>species</b> are variable. An empirical analysis is provided for Norwegian purse seiners. ...|$|E
40|$|Species' {{interactions}} and {{the involvement of}} fishermen in several fisheries may not be properly accounted for by regulatory schemes,thus making regulation suboptimal. Being the only implementable instruments, the degree of ineffciency of three second-best instruments is assessed (by using a bioeconomic multispecies model) {{in terms of their}} ability to get close to socially optimal effort and stock levels. The type of regulation and the existing biological interaction are also shown to result in different impacts on effort re-allocation: a specific regulation does not necessarily increase the pressure on the <b>unregulated</b> <b>species.</b> Finally, we discuss how the choice of which second-best policy to implement is situation-specific...|$|E
40|$|A {{sampling}} {{campaign with}} seven {{different types of}} vehicles was conducted in 2009 at the vehicle test facilities of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra (Italy). The vehicles chosen were representative of some categories circulating in Europe and were fueled either with standard gasoline or diesel and some with blends of rapeseed methyl ester biodiesel. The aim of this work was to improve the knowledge about the emission factors of gas phase and particle-associated regulated and <b>unregulated</b> <b>species</b> from vehicle exhaust. <b>Unregulated</b> <b>species</b> such as black carbon (BC), primary organic aerosol (OA) content, particle number (PN), monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and a~selection of unregulated gaseous compounds, including nitrous acid (N 2 O), ammonia (NH 3), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), formaldehyde (HCHO), acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and methane (CH 4), were measured in real time with a suite of instruments including a high-resolution aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer, a resonance enhanced multi-photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and a high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Diesel vehicles, without particle filters, featured the highest values for particle number, followed by gasoline vehicles and scooters. The particles from diesel and gasoline vehicles were mostly made of BC with a low fraction of OA, while the particles from the scooters were mainly composed of OA. Scooters were characterized by super high emissions factors for OA, which were orders of magnitude higher than for the other vehicles. The heavy duty diesel vehicle (HDDV) featured the highest nitrogen oxides (NO x) emissions, while the scooters had the highest emissions for total hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds due to the unburned and partially burned gasoline and lubricant oil mixture. Generally, vehicles fuelled with biodiesel blends showed lower emission factors of OA and total aromatics than those from the standard fuels. The scooters were the main emitters of aromatic compounds, followed by the gasoline vehicle, the diesel vehicles and the HDDV...|$|E

5000|$|Neurotoxic {{shellfish}} poisoning (NSP) {{is caused}} by the consumption of shellfish contaminated by brevetoxins which are produced by the dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis. There are often both gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms of NSP includingdiarrhea, nausea/vomiting, numbness or tingling in lips face or extremities, disorientation, and partial paralysis.For public safety, NSP in shellfish is monitored by the State of Florida. There have been no new deaths attributed to NSP. Occasional new cases of NSP may occur when people consume <b>unregulated</b> shellfish <b>species,</b> when shellfish are illegally harvested, or when blooms expand to unmonitored geographic areas.There have been recent discoveries of Planktivorous finfish that retain the toxins in their muscles and organs,especially the liver. However, these toxins occur in finfish at much lower concentrations than shellfish [...] The toxins of K. brevis can also become aerosolized by surf, winds, or breaking waves. The inhalation of aerosolized K. brevis red-tide toxins may result in conjunctival irritation, runny nose, nonproductive cough, and wheezing. In healthy individuals, {{there seems to be a}} rapid reversal of these symptoms by leaving beach areas or entering an air-conditioned area. However, persons with severe asthma appear to be more susceptible to K brevis red-tide toxins. It has been shown that these individuals report a decrease in respiratory function after only 1 hour of exposure to a K brevis red-tide beach and these symptoms may last for days.|$|R
5000|$|By design, CITES regulates and {{monitors}} {{trade in the}} manner of a [...] "negative list" [...] such that trade in all species is permitted and <b>unregulated</b> unless the <b>species</b> in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained. Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review. For example, recently several bird classified as threatened with extinction appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status. If a [...] "positive list" [...] approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.|$|R
40|$|The saxitoxin-group (STX-group) {{corresponds}} to toxic metabolites produced by cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates {{of the genera}} Alexandrium, Gymnodinium, and Pyrodinium. Over the last decade, it has been possible to extrapolate the areas contaminated with the STX-group worldwide, including Chile, a phenomenon that has affected ≈ 35 % of the Southern Pacific coast territory, generating a high economic impact. The objective {{of this research was}} to study the toxicity of the STX-group in all aquatic organisms (bivalves, algae, echinoderms, crustaceans, tunicates, cephalopods, gastropods, and fish) present in areas with a variable presence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Then, the toxic profiles of each species and dose of STX equivalents ingested by a 60 kg person from 400 g of shellfish were determined to establish the health risk assessment. The toxins with the highest prevalence detected were gonyautoxin- 4 / 1 (GTX 4 /GTX 1), gonyautoxin- 3 / 2 (GTX 3 /GTX 2), neosaxitoxin (neoSTX), decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX), and saxitoxin (STX), with average concentrations of 400, 2800, 280, 200, and 2000 µg kg− 1 respectively, a species-specific variability, dependent on the evaluated tissue, which demonstrates the biotransformation of the analogues in the trophic transfer with a predominance of α-epimers in all toxic profiles. The identification in multiple vectors, as well as in <b>unregulated</b> <b>species,</b> suggests that a risk assessment and risk management update are required; also, chemical and specific analyses for the detection of all analogues associated with the STX-group need to be established...|$|E

The U. S. Mid-Atlantic Golden Tilefish (Lopholatilus Chamaeleonticeps) fishery, under IFQ management, is {{required}} to undergo a review every 5 to 7 years to describe and analyze {{the changes that have}} taken place in the fishery since the IFQ implementation in 2009. Standardized performance metrics are used to evaluate performance, productivity changes, allocation choices and changes in concentration and distribution.   Particularly relevant in this case, is an assessment of the programs effects on “historical” participants who were previously but are no longer involved in the fishery. Of special concern is the dramatic impact an <b>unregulated</b> <b>species</b> of tilefish, the Blueline tilefish (Caulolatilus microps), is having on the Golden tilefish as its population has expanded northward due to climate change. The rapid increase in unregulated Blueline Tilefish harvest has forced the NMFS to implement temporary regulations (commercial and recreational possession limits) though an emergency action in 2015. The interaction between these two fisheries (with overlapping gear, location and vessel permits) is examined from an economic and social perspective as an adjunct to the required review of the Golden Tilefish IFQ program...|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} chondrichthyan (sharks, batoids and chimaeras) {{conservation}} in the Indo-Australasian region is examined, and issues {{relevant to the}} conservation of this fauna at the subregional level [Australia, Indonesia (excluding West Papua), New Guinea (West Papua and Papua New Guinea), New Caledonia and New Zealand] are discussed. According to the 2009 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, c. 21 % of Indo-Australasian chondrichthyans are classified as threatened (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable) and c. 40 % are of conservation concern (threatened and near threatened). The proportion of threatened species is highest in New Guinea (c. 39 %) and Indonesia (c. 35 %) and least in New Zealand (c. 11 %). In New Guinea, {{three quarters of the}} species are of conservation concern; in Indonesia, nearly two thirds are of conservation concern. Within the region, the proportion of threatened batoids (c. 29 %) is higher than threatened sharks (c. 17 %), while there are no threatened chimaeras. Conservation status is discussed at the order (for sharks), suborder (for batoids) and family level. Issues relating to the conservation status of chondrichthyans vary greatly between each subregion, but they mostly relate to targeted or incidental capture in fisheries. A handful of sharks and batoids are protected within Australian waters, while one species is protected in New Zealand. Both Australia and New Zealand have developed National Plans of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (NPOA-Sharks), but these are lacking elsewhere. Development and implementation of NPOA-Sharks are a priority in order to drive the conservation of the regional fauna. Sustainable fisheries management (including by-catch), confronting the challenge of illegal, unreported and <b>unregulated</b> fishing, <b>species</b> protection where appropriate and marine protected areas (MPA) are all likely to prove vital in ensuring the long-term conservation of Indo-Australasian sharks, batoids and chimaeras...|$|R
40|$|Crohn’s disease (CD) is an {{inflammatory}} disorder characterised by a transmural {{inflammation of the}} intestinal wall. Although the physiopathology of the disease is not yet fully understood, {{it is clear that}} the immune response plays an important role in it. This hyperreactive immune system is accompanied by the presence of <b>unregulated</b> reactive oxygen <b>species</b> (ROS). These elements are modulated in normal conditions by different elements, including enzymes that function as antioxidant defences preventing the harmful effects of ROS. However, in CD there is an imbalance between ROS production and these antioxidant elements, resulting in oxidative stress (OxS) phenomena.

40|$|Octopus cyanea {{is taken}} as an <b>unregulated,</b> recreationally fished <b>species</b> from the {{intertidal}} reefs of Ningaloo, Western Australia. Yet despite its exploitation and importance in many artisanal fisheries throughout the world, {{little is known about}} its life history, ecology and vulnerability. We used stylet increment analysis to age a wild O. cyanea population {{for the first time and}} gonad histology to examine their reproductive characteristics. O. cyanea conforms to many cephalopod life history generalisations having rapid, non-asymptotic growth, a short life-span and high levels of mortality. Males were found to mature at much younger ages and sizes than females with reproductive activity concentrated in the spring and summer months. The female dominated sex-ratios in association with female brooding behaviours also suggest that larger conspicuous females may be more prone to capture and suggests that this intertidal octopus population has the potential to be negatively impacted in an unregulated fishery. Size at age and maturity comparisons between our temperate bordering population and lower latitude Tanzanian and Hawaiian populations indicated stark differences in growth rates that correlate with water temperatures. The variability in life history traits between global populations suggests that management of O. cyanea populations should be tailored to each unique set of life history characteristics and that style...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenylalanine}} biosynthetic pathway in {{the yeast}} Rhodotorula glutinis was examined, {{and the following}} results were obtained. (i) 3 -Deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate- 7 -phosphate (DAHP) synthase in crude extracts was partially inhibited by tyrosine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine. In the presence of all three aromatic amino acids an additive pattern of enzyme inhibition was observed, suggesting the existence of three differentially regulated species of DAHP synthase. Two distinctly regulated isozymes inhibited by tyrosine or tryptophan and designated DAHP synthase-Tyr and DAHP synthase-Trp, respectively, were resolved by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, along with a third labile activity inhibited by phenylalanine tentatively identified as DAHP synthase-Phe. The tyrosine and tryptophan isozymes were relatively stable and were inhibited 80 and 90 % by 50 microM of the respective amino acids. DAHP synthase-Phe, however, {{proved to be an}} extremely labile activity, thereby preventing any detailed regulatory studies on the partially purified enzyme. (ii) Two species of chorismate mutase, designated CMI and CMII, were resolved in the same chromatographic step. The activity of CMI was inhibited by tyrosine and stimulated by tryptophan, whereas CMII appeared to be <b>unregulated.</b> (iii) Single <b>species</b> of prephenate dehydratase and phenylpyruvate aminotransferase were observed. Interestingly, the branch-point enzyme prephenate dehydratase was not inhibited by phenylalanine or affected by tyrosine, tryptophan, or both. (iv) The only site for control of phenylalanine biosynthesis appeared to be DAHP synthase-Phe. This is apparently sufficient since a spontaneous mutant, designated FP 9, resistant to the growth-inhibitory phenylalanine analog p-fluorophenylalanine contained a feedback-resistant DAHP synthase-Phe and cross-fed a phenylalanine auxotroph of Bacillus subtilis...|$|R
40|$|Disinfection {{byproducts}} (DBPs) {{are formed}} in water treatment and in distribution systems when disinfectants, most commonly chlorine, react with organic matter and inorganic precursors, e. g. bromide. Reducing exposure to DBPs remains {{a concern for}} the national drinking water utility community, as some of them are of health concern. Currently, two class sums of DBPs, total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and five haloacetic acids (HAA 5) are regulated under the Stage 2 D/DBP Rule. Changes in climate, as well as anthropogenic activities, can lead to increased DBP precursors, specifically total organic carbon (TOC) and bromide, which could force water utilities to make important and expensive decisions regarding treatment processes. Additionally, increased bromide can increase the formation of brominated DBPs, which are of greater health concern than their fully chlorinated counterparts. The impact of climate on source water quality, particularly TOC and bromide concentration, and subsequent impact on a water treatment plant’s capacity to meet DBP regulations was evaluated at three sites. Source water TOC concentration was modeled with climate, temperature and precipitation, and land surface, soil moisture and vegetation, predictors using a local polynomial regression. A methodology was developed for determining site-specific source water TOC and bromide thresholds for Stage 2 D/DBP compliance. Thresholds were determined for the three sites; TOC thresholds varied monthly from 1. 6 - 2. 6 mg/L, 2. 2 - 3. 2 mg/L, and 2. 2 - 4. 2 mg/L and bromide thresholds for one site ranged from National occurrence of brominated DBP formation was assessed through analyzing trends for all nine haloacetic acids that include four unregulated haloacetic acids and for bromine incorporation factors (BIFs), along with spatial analysis for BIFs. Changes in HAA 9 and in HAA 5 occurrence before and after the D/DBP Rule implementation were compared to assess how regulatory changes have impacted <b>unregulated</b> brominated HAA <b>species.</b> For one case study location, BIFs were modeled using local polynomial regression with climate, temperature, and water quality covariates, the bromide-to-TOC ratio and UV 254 absorbance...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral thesis {{studying}} the TA toxin HicA from Burkholderia pseudomallei. Firstly, toxin HicA was evaluated {{as a potential}} antimicrobial compound, through ectopic expression {{in a range of}} bacterial species. Secondly, residues or regions of the toxin involved in toxicity or TA complex formation were identified using a scanning alanine mutagenesis study. Thirdly, interactions between non-cognate TA pairs were examined to determine if type II TA systems are able to form co-operative networks in B. pseudomallei. Four type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems were previously identified in Burkholderia pseudomallei K 96243. Type II TA toxins are able to induce cell growth arrest or death by interfering with key processes within the organism. BPSS 0390 - 0391 is one of the TA systems previously identified and has homology to hicBA system in Acinetobacter baumannii. B. pseudomallei HicA is able to cause a {{reduction in the number of}} culturable cells after expression in E. coli. This study aimed to characterise B. pseudomallei HicA in three ways: by inducing expression of HicA in bacterial species other than E. coli, by identifying amino acids in HicA involved in toxicity and neutralisation by the antitoxin HicB and by examining the interaction of HicA with other TA antitoxins identified within B. pseudomallei genome. A broad host range plasmid encoding BPSS 0390 was transformed into a range of Gram negative bacteria including Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP 32953, Vibrio vulnificus E 64 MW, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL 1344 and Burkholderia thailandensis E 264. Expression of BPSS 0390 was toxic in all bacterial species tested, despite the presence of antitoxin BPSS 0391 homologues in some <b>species.</b> <b>Unregulated</b> expression in E. coli resulted in the appearance of escape mutants encoding non-toxic variants of HicA. An alanine scanning mutagenesis study of HicA identified 20 mutants where toxicity was abolished despite high levels of expression, but identified no mutants that affected TA complex formation. Finally an existing co-expression assay was modified to examine interactions between HicA and other type II TA antitoxins in B. pseudomallei. The assay revealed no interaction between HicA and non-cognate antitoxins and clarified the role of IPTG as an inhibitor of PBAD promoter on the arabinose operon.
