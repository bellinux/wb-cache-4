5000|$|<b>Unionoida</b> have {{a unique}} and complex life cycle {{involving}} parasitic larvae. This larval form used to be described as [...] "parasitic worms" [...] on the fish host, however, the larvae are not [...] "worms" [...] and do not harm fish under normal circumstances. Most of these freshwater mussel species have separate sexes (although some species, such as Elliptio complanata, {{are known to be}} hermaphroditic). The sperm is ejected from the mantle cavity through the male's excurrent aperture and taken into the female's mantle cavity through the incurrent aperture. Fertilised eggs move from the gonads to the gills (marsupia) where they further ripen and metamorph into glochidia, the first larval stage. Mature glochidia are released by the female and then attach to the gills, fins or skin of a host fish. Typically, the freshwater mussel larvae (glochidia) have hooks, which enable the individual to attach itself to fish. Some freshwater mussels release their glochidia in mucilaginous packets called conglutinates. The conglutinate has a sticky filament that allows it to adhere to the substrate so it is not washed away. There is also an even more specialized way of dispersal known as a super-conglutinate. The super-conglutinate resembles an aquatic fly larva or a fish egg, complete with a dark area that looks like an eyespot, and it is appetizing to fish. When a fish consumes it, it breaks up, releasing the glochidia. Mussels that produce conglutinates and super-conglutinates are often gill parasites, the glochidia attaching to the fish gills to continue their development into juveniles. A cyst is quickly formed around the glochidia, and they stay on the fish for several weeks or months before they fall off as juvenile freshwater mussels which then bury themselves in the sediment. [...] This unique life cycle allows <b>Unionoida</b> freshwater mussels to move upstream with the fish host species.|$|E

40|$|Background: Several clades of bivalve {{molluscs}} have invaded freshwaters {{at various times}} throughout Phanerozoic history. The most successful freshwater clade {{in the modern world}} is the <b>Unionoida.</b> Unionoids arose in the Triassic Period, sometime after the major extinction event at the End-Permian boundary and are now widely distributed across all continents except Antarctica. Until now, no freshwater bivalves of any kind were known to exist in the Early Triassic. Principal Findings: Here we report on a faunule of two small freshwater bivalve species preserved in vertebrate coprolites from the Olenekian (Lower Triassic) of the Burgersdorp Formation of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Positive identification of these bivalves is not possible due to the limited material. Nevertheless they do show similarities with <b>Unionoida</b> although they fall below the size range of extant unionoids. Phylogenetic analysis is not possible with such limited material and consequently the assignment remains somewhat speculative. Conclusions: Bivalve molluscs re-invaded freshwaters soon after the End-Permian extinction event, during the earliest part of the recovery phase during the Olenekian Stage of the Early Triassic. If the specimens do represent unionoids then these Early Triassic examples may be an example of the Lilliput effect. Since the oldest incontrovertible freshwater unionoids are also from sub-Saharan Africa, it is possible that this subcontinent hosted the initial freshwater radiation of the <b>Unionoida.</b> This find also demonstrates the importance of coprolites as microenvironments of exceptional preservation that contai...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{delimitation}} of a species’ {{geographic range}} {{is important for}} conservation planning and biogeography. Geographic range limits provide insights into the ecological and historical factors that influence species distributions (Gaston 1991; Brown et al. 1996), whereas the extent of occurrence of a taxon is {{a key component of}} IUCN criteria used for assessing the conservation status of species (IUCN 2001). Freshwater mussels (<b>Unionoida)</b> are an ancient group of palaeoheterodont bivalves that inhabit lotic and lentic freshwater environments on every continent except Antarctica (Graf and Cummings 2006). The Australian <b>Unionoida</b> is represented by the Hyriidae with six genera and 18 species (Ponder and Walker 2003). The <b>Unionoida</b> are distinguished from other bivalves by their larval stage that are, with a few exceptions, are obligate parasites of fish and sometimes amphibians (Watters and O’Dee 1998; Wächtler et al. 2001). All freshwater mussels brood their larvae in specialised regions of the female’s gills known as ‘marsupia’ (Bauer and Wächtler 2001). In the Hyriidae, the marsupia are restricted to the inner pair of demibranchs. An opportunistic stopover along the Great Northern Highway in the eastern Pilbara region (Indian Ocean Drainage Division) of Western Australia revealed the existence of a Lortiella population in the De Grey River, the first record of the genus to occur in the region.

40|$|Abstract Background Doubly uniparental {{inheritance}} (DUI) is an atypical system of animal mtDNA inheritance {{found only in}} some bivalves. Under DUI, maternally (F genome) and paternally (M genome) transmitted mtDNAs yield two distinct gender-associated mtDNA lineages. The oldest distinct M and F genomes are found in freshwater mussels (order <b>Unionoida).</b> Comparative analyses of unionoid mitochondrial genomes and a robust phylogenetic framework are necessary to elucidate the origin, function and molecular evolutionary consequences of DUI. Herein, F and M genomes from three unionoid species, Venustaconcha ellipsiformis, Pyganodon grandis and Quadrula quadrula have been sequenced. Comparative genomic analyses were carried out on these six genomes along with two F and one M unionoid genomes from GenBank (F and M genomes of Inversidens japanensis and F genome of Lampsilis ornata). Results Compared to their unionoid F counterparts, the M genomes contain some unique features including a novel localization of the trnH gene, an inversion of the atp 8 -trnD genes and a unique 3 'coding extension of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene. One {{or more of these}} unique M genome features could be causally associated with paternal transmission. Unionoid bivalves are characterized by extreme intraspecific sequence divergences between gender-associated mtDNAs with an average of 50 % for V. ellipsiformis, 50 % for I. japanensis, 51 % for P. grandis and 52 % for Q. quadrula (uncorrected amino acid p-distances). Phylogenetic analyses of 12 protein-coding genes from 29 bivalve and five outgroup mt genomes robustly indicate bivalve monophyly and the following branching order within the autolamellibranch bivalves: ((Pteriomorphia, Veneroida) <b>Unionoida).</b> Conclusion The basal nature of the <b>Unionoida</b> within the autolamellibranch bivalves and the previously hypothesized single origin of DUI suggest that (1) DUI arose in the ancestral autolamellibranch bivalve lineage and was subsequently lost in multiple descendant lineages and (2) the mitochondrial genome characteristics observed in unionoid bivalves could more closely resemble the DUI ancestral condition. Descriptions and comparisons presented in this paper are fundamental to a more complete understanding regarding the origins and consequences of DUI. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aunique mode of {{mitochondrial}} DNA inheritance, designated doubly-uniparental inheritance (DUI), {{occurs in}} three bivalve subclasses (Pteriomorpha: Mytiloida, Palaeoheterodonta: <b>Unionoida,</b> Heterodonta: Veneroida), indicating that DUI {{may be a}} widespread phenomenon among bivalves. In mytiloids, breakdown of this pattern of inheritance (gender-switching) is observed in natural populations and in a phylogenetic context. In contrast, gender-switching has not occurred during the evolutionary history of unionoids. Here we present 1 sequences for the male (M) and female (F) mitotypes from an additional 8 species of <b>Unionoida.</b> Consistent with previous observations, the M and F mitotypes of all species form reciprocally monophyletic clades supporting the hypothesis of taxon-specific rates of gender-switching. Coinciding with the absence of gender-switching is an 185 codon extension of the cytochrome c oxidase II (MTCO 2) locus in the male genome. The extension is present in all 12 unionoid species examined, including {{a representative of the}} family Margaritiferidae, indicating that this 5 protein coding polymorphism originated ‡ 200 MYBP. Although the extension is well conserved in length among 11 of the 12 species, one taxon has a significantly shortened extension. Lastly, examination of the rates and patterns of substitution indicate that the extension is evolving under relaxed purging selection, a pattern inconsistent with the conserved nature of MTCO 2 or any cytochrome c oxidase locus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Australian {{freshwater}} mussel Hyridella depressa (L marck, 1819) has extensive deposits of calcium phosphate granules in its interstitial connective tissues. The tructure, distribution and elemental profile of these granules were documented by light and electron microscopy. For the elemental study, granules in cryo-prepared mantle tissue were examined by X-ray microanalysis. The granules were bright orange {{and formed a}} conspicuous cover over the mantle and palps, and were also abundant in the visceral mass. By contrast, they were not common in the gills and foot. The granules were typically distributed in discrete clusters and,in places, dominated the tissue space. Iron was a particularly important component of th granules and may account for their colour. The granules also contained other common elements, including Mg, Mn and A 1, and trace elements, including Cu, Zn and Pb. Considering the important position of the Hyriidae in understanding the evolution and phylogeny of the <b>Unionoida,</b> {{emphasis was placed on}} comparison of the calcium granules of H. depressa to those in the Margaritiferidae nd Unionidae.

40|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} are endangered nowadays {{the world}} over. One group of freshwater bivalve, Margaritiferidae {{is a family}} that is particularly endangered and is devised for conservation measure in many countries. Life history of <b>unionoida</b> including Margaritiferidae is very unique and their larvae known as glochidia are parasitic to fish and/or amphibians. Accordingly, host and population dynamics of Margaritiferidae are closely related. The major objective {{of the present study}} was to clarify the mechanism and cause of extinction of a Margaritiferid, Margaritifera laevis. For the purpose of age estimation, marked mussels were reared in situ for one year and it was confirmed that internal and external growth bands of the shell increased annually. Both growth rings on the shell surface and growth bands on the cross-sectional surface of shell ligament could be used for determination of mussel age. For comprehending the status of growth and recruitment success, shell sizes and ages were examined for 14 populations in Japan. Irrespective of their reproductive potential, some populations lacked juveniles. These populations would become extinct if environment of habitat was not improved. The Lack of juveniles in mussel populations as described above is observed worldwide, and has been considered as the major cause of margaritiferid extinction. It was implied that the lack of juveniles in mussel populations was associated with dam and eutrophication. For clarifying the mechanism and cause of the lack of juveniles, I compared two contrasting populations, i. e. the population in the Chitose River which consists of adult and juvenile mussels, and the population in Abira River which consists of adult mussels only. Adult mussels in the Abira River had full reproductive potential indicated by glochidial release from exhalant siphon, parasitism on host fish and growth of parasitic glochidia. Accordingly, the reproductive potential was not the cause of the lack of juveniles. Survival rate in the early life stage from free-living glochidia to juveniles was lower in the Chitose River. Free-living glochidia cannot survive without infection to hosts. Although viability in the free-living glochidial stage was superior in the Abira River, it was suggested that the survival rate of free-living glochidia in the Abira River was inferior due to a low density of host fish and a low rate of overlap of distribution between mussels and host fish. In the Abira River, the rate of glochidial infection to host was higher and the mean number of attached glochidia per host was larger. However the water temperature in the Abira River was colder than that in the Chitose River, which extended the duration of parasitic stage exposing attached glochidia to immune attack by host fish. In rearing juveniles in the rivers survival times were shorter in the Abira River, irrespective of the origin of glochidia. This suggested that the environment in the Abira River was not appropriate for juvenile mussels. Therefore, the lack of juveniles in M. laevis was caused by the low survival rate in early life stages irrespective of the mussel’s reproductive potential. Furthermore, the population dynamics of host fish was closely related to that of M. laevis. In Margaritiferidae, sizes of glochidia were smaller than those in the other <b>Unionoida</b> and glochidium does not have a hook. Accordingly their host species and the suitable parts for their glochidia to attach on the host are extremely restricted. Survival time in free-living glochidia in Margaritiferidae is also shorter than that in the other <b>Unionoida.</b> These traits in Margaritiferidae make success rate of parasitism to keep low. The duration of the parasitic stage in Margaritiferidae is typically longer than that in the other <b>Unionoida.</b> In Margaritiferidae, attached glochidia are originally easy to be excluded by host immunity and their survival rate is typically low. In general, the survival of Margaritiferidae during the early life stages strongly depends on the distribution, population dynamics and physiological response of host fish...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Necropsy was {{performed}} on 2 smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) that died 8 days after experimental gill inoculation with Actinonaias pectorosa glochidia. The salient feature at necropsy was ragged gills containing multiple petechial hemorrhages and numerous white, iridescent dust-like particles easily confirmed as glochidia in squash preparations of the gill filaments. Microscopically, the gills contained multiple rounded glochidia encysted at the tips or {{along the length of}} the filaments. Parasitized filaments were thickened, blunted, and often fused. Lamellae were extensively fused and obliterated, with proliferation of the epithelial cells giving the filament a smooth outline. Sometimes glochidia were associated with necrosis and/or hemorrhage.

We fitted several growth models to the shell length-age relationships of these two populations, which had different densities and age distributions. The Gompertz function showed the best fit, in terms of both RSS (residual sum of squares) and the difference between the observed maximum shell length and the asymptotic shell length. The life span of M. laevis was shorter than that reported for Margaritifera margaritifera populations at higher latitudes (≥ 50 °N), which have been widely recognized as threatened. Margaritiferid mussels living at lower latitudes tend to have shorter life spans and smaller maximum size.

A cluster of discoidal, proacrosomal vesicles (between 9 to 15 in number) constitutes the acrosomal complex at the nuclear apex. The nucleus is short (2. 4 - 2. 6 μm long, maximum diameter 2. 2 μm), blunt-conical in shape, and exhibits irregular lacunae within its contents.
