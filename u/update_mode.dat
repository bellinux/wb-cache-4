Fast link speeds, {{the desire to}} classify with fine granularity, {{and the need for}} agility in a dynamic environment all pose significant challenges for {{packet classification}}. We propose an approach that is capable of handling a changing set of classification rules that span multiple fields. Our approach is based on extracting a relatively small set of bits that uniquely identify the packets satisfying each rule. Changes to the rule set are handled in-line via a fast <b>update</b> <b>mode</b> that adds to the rule table, while a background process performs reoptimization of the full rule table less frequently.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, chip-level {{adaptive}} channel estimation {{has been}} explored by using LMS algorithm for wideband CDMA channel estimation. The expression for the optimum step-size is modified for fading channel estimation problem.

For slow fading channels, like pedestrian channel, LMS estimator with no <b>update</b> <b>mode</b> is found to give satisfactory results. For fast fading channels, like vehicular channel, a common decision directed technique of channel estimation is modified to be used at chip-level in the downlink (DL).

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} novel {{algorithm}} for hybrid transactional replication (HTR) of highly dependable services. It combines two schemes: a transaction is executed either optimistically {{by only one}} service replica in the deferred <b>update</b> <b>mode</b> (DU), or deterministically by all replicas in the state machine mode (SM); the choice is made by an oracle. The DU mode allows for parallelism and thus takes advantage of multicore hardware. In contrast to DU, the SM mode guarantees abort-free execution, so it is suitable for irrevocable operations and transactions generating high contention. For expressiveness, transactions can be discarded or retried on demand. We developed HTR-enabled Paxos STM, an object-based distributed transactional memory system, and evaluated it using several benchmarks: Bank, Distributed STMBench 7, and Twitter Clone. We tested our system under various workloads and three oracle types: DU and SM, which execute all transactions in one mode, and Hybrid—tailored specifically for each benchmark—which selects a mode for each transaction dynamically based on various parameters. In all our tests, the Hybrid oracle is not worse than DU and SM and outperforms them {{when the number of}} replicas grows.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new generic approach for defining a new query mode {{which is the}} intelligent generic statistical query mode for any database application. It is combined with the optimized intelligent generic query mode (IGSQM) for relational database applications. Since it is generic then {{it can be used}} in developing any database application without rewriting any source code. It is intelligent {{in the sense that it}} submits to user an enormous amount of statistical reports without the need or support of the application developer, actually the total number of those statistical reports depends on the database schema. The Interface of the new approach is very simple in use. The new approach saves time for developing the required statistical reports by the user. The developed applications which exploit the proposed intelligent generic statistical query mode will empower users and improve the quality and efficiency of service provided by those applications. IGSQM can be used widely in scientific statistical researches. It has been implemented using PowerBuilder (release 11. 5) as a front end tool and Adaptive Server Anywhere (one of Sybase products) as a database engine.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has emerged}} as a long dreamt vision of utility computing paradigm that provides reliable and resilient infrastructure for users to remotely store data, and use on demand applications and services. Currently, many individuals and organizations mitigate the burden of local data storage and reduce the maintenance cost by outsourcing data to the cloud. However, the outsourced data is not always trustworthy due to the loss of physical control and possession over the data. As a result, many scholars have concentrated on relieving the security threats of the outsourced data by designing the Remote Data Auditing (RDA) technique as a new concept to enable public auditability for the stored data in the cloud. The RDA is a useful technique to check the reliability and integrity of data outsourced to a single or distributed servers. This is because all of the RDA techniques for single cloud servers are unable to support data recovery, such techniques are complemented with redundant storage mechanisms. The article also reviews techniques of remote data auditing more comprehensively in the domain of the distributed clouds in conjunction with the presentation of classifying on-going developments within this specified area. The thematic taxonomy of the distributed storage auditing is presented based on significant parameters, such as scheme nature, security pattern, objective functions, auditing mode, <b>update</b> <b>mode,</b> cryptography model, and dynamic data structure.

40|$|Low-rank {{factorization}} {{is used in}} {{many areas}} of computer science where one performs spectral analysis on large sensitive data stored in the form of matrices. In this paper, we study differentially private low-rank factorization of a matrix with respect to the spectral norm in the turnstile update model. In this problem, given an input matrix A∈R^m × n updated in the turnstile manner and a target rank k, the goal is to find two rank-k orthogonal matrices U_k ∈R^m × k and V_k ∈R^n × k, and one positive semidefinite diagonal matrix Σ_k ∈R^k × k such that A≈U_k Σ_k V_k^T with respect to the spectral norm. Our main contributions are two computationally efficient and sub-linear space algorithms for computing a differentially private low-rank factorization. We consider two levels of privacy. In the first level of privacy, we consider two matrices neighboring if their difference has a Frobenius norm at most 1. In the second level of privacy, we consider two matrices as neighboring if their difference can be represented as an outer product of two unit vectors. Both these privacy levels are stronger than those studied in the earlier papers such as Dwork et al. (STOC 2014), Hardt and Roth (STOC 2013), and Hardt and Price (NIPS 2014). As a corollary to our results, we get non-private algorithms that compute low-rank factorization in the turnstile update model with respect to the spectral norm. We note that, prior to this work, no algorithm that outputs low-rank factorization with respect to the spectral norm in the turnstile update model was known; i. e., our algorithm gives the first non-private low-rank factorization with respect to the spectral norm in the turnstile <b>update</b> <b>mode.</b> Comment: 33 page...|$|E
