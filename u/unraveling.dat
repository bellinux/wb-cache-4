5|$|Identifying such shared phrasing {{was one of}} {{the first}} steps in <b>unraveling</b> the {{structure}} of the script, as it is the best way to detect ligatures and allographs, and thus to establish the inventory of rongorongo glyphs.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Douglas {{was very}} close with her mother after her parents' separation. She {{witnessed}} her mother's emotional <b>unraveling</b> that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her, she exhibited bizarre, childlike behaviors.

While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while <b>unraveling</b> the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil {{explains}} that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core.

25|$|Despite the Union {{tactical}} success, however, it was {{the start}} of a strategic debacle and the <b>unraveling</b> of the Peninsula Campaign. McClellan began to withdraw his army to the southeast and never regained the initiative. The next day the Seven Days Battles continued as Lee attacked Porter at the Battle of Gaines' Mill.|$|E
25|$|In terms {{specific}} to screws, the helix angle {{can be found}} by <b>unraveling</b> the helix from the screw, representing the section as a right triangle, and calculating the angle that is formed.

25|$|Hero generations enter {{childhood}} {{after an}} Awakening, during an <b>Unraveling,</b> {{a time of}} individual pragmatism, self-reliance, and laissez faire. Heroes grow up as increasingly protected post-Awakening children, come of age as team-oriented young optimists during a Crisis, emerge as energetic, overly-confident midlifers, and age into politically powerful elders attacked by another Awakening.|$|E
25|$|While {{many factors}} {{have contributed to}} the {{escalating}} violence, security analysts in Mexico City trace the origins of the rising scourge to the <b>unraveling</b> of a longtime implicit arrangement between narcotics traffickers and governments controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which began to lose its grip on political power in the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|He {{asked himself}} why was {{there such a}} drastic {{discrepancy}} between the Buddhist doctrines that he read about in books and {{the actual practice of}} Buddhism in real life. He yearned to dedicate his whole life to <b>unraveling</b> this mystery. His mind was set on finding places where Buddhism was still practiced the way it should be. It was at this point where he decided to become a monastic.|$|E
25|$|The <b>unraveling</b> of {{the false}} {{intelligence}} reports began with 23-year-old Sergeant Lonnie D. Franks of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. who was an intelligence specialist for Gabriel's wing at Udorn. Two days after the strike on the MiG runway, on January 25, 1972, Franks debriefed an F-4 pilot and navigator who had flown a reconnaissance mission. They said they had not received any ground fire or hostile reaction, but had been instructed nevertheless to report hostile reaction.|$|E
25|$|Artist generations enter {{childhood}} {{after an}} <b>Unraveling,</b> during a Crisis, {{a time when}} great dangers cut down social and political complexity in favor of public consensus, aggressive institutions, and an ethic of personal sacrifice. Artists grow up overprotected by adults preoccupied with the Crisis, come of age as the socialized and conformist young adults of a post-Crisis world, break out as process-oriented midlife leaders during an Awakening, and age into thoughtful post-Awakening elders.|$|E
25|$|The {{complaint}} {{sets out}} a detailed {{view of the}} {{events leading up to}} the case, the university's response, and the subsequent <b>unraveling</b> of the case; it alleges corruption and collusion between Duke, the hospital, and Nifong. It accuses the university of refusing to enforce its own anti-discrimination policies as to faculty and student harassment of the lacrosse players, and of violating federal law when it issued team key-card access data to the Police without a warrant, and subsequently attempted to cover up the disclosure.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, Krugman {{published}} {{a collection of}} his columns under the title, The Great <b>Unraveling,</b> about the Bush administration's economic and foreign policies and the US economy in the early 2000s. His columns argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration {{as a result of}} decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the Iraq war. Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis. The book was a best-seller.|$|E
25|$|The {{confrontation}} was an undeclared {{war with}} most of the action occurring in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo (known as Kalimantan in Indonesia). The conflict was characterised by restrained and isolated ground combat, set within tactics of low-level brinkmanship. Combat was usually conducted by company- or platoon-sized operations {{on either side of the}} border. Indonesia's campaign of infiltrations into Borneo sought to exploit the ethnic and religious diversity in Sabah and Sarawak compared to that of Malaya and Singapore, with the intent of <b>unraveling</b> the proposed state of Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} in Hobyo shocked Italian policymakers in Rome. It was the Adwa fiasco of the First Italo–Ethiopian War all over again, and Italy's plans for East Africa were <b>unraveling</b> before their very eyes. Blame soon fell on Governor De Vecchi, whose perceived incompetence was blamed for Omar's rise. Rome instructed De Vecchi {{that he was}} to receive the reinforcement from Eritrea, but that the commander of the Eritrean battalions was to assume the military command and De Vecchi was confined to Mogadishu and limited to an administrative role. The commander was to report directly to Rome, bypassing De Vecchi entirely.|$|E
25|$|Boelcke had to swerve {{to avoid}} a mid-air {{collision}} in the dogfight and Böhme's Albatros briefly collided with that of Boelcke. The wheels of Böhme's plane barely brushed {{the fabric of the}} top wing of Boelcke's craft, enough to start the fabric <b>unraveling.</b> Boelcke struggled for control as his plane's control surface shredded in the turbulence. He skillfully crashlanded after the entire upper wing tore loose. However, in his haste to be airborne he had not fastened his seat belt. Boelcke was killed by his relatively mild impact. Böhme survived the accident, as he had suffered only a landing gear damage.|$|E
25|$|The film {{tells the}} story of two women {{separated}} by more than six decades. In 1998, lonely New Yorker Wally Winthrop is obsessed with King Edward VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson. But Wally's research, including several visits to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, reveals that the couple's life together was not as perfect as she thought. Weaving back and forth in time, W.E. intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis and Edward, from the early days of their romance to the <b>unraveling</b> of their lives in the decades that followed.|$|E
25|$|His next {{period of}} {{imprisonment}} occurred in 1899 {{when he was}} identified from his picture in The Police Gazette and held to account for multiple signature forgeries. The trial and subsequent newspaper reports reveal the extent of Hardy's <b>unraveling.</b> His past was completely exposed, back to the abandoning of his first wife and numerous periods in prison. After being held briefly in Holloway Gaol, {{he was sentenced to}} seven years in Dartmoor Prison for forgery and bigamy, including making false entries in the marriage register. He had apparently anticipated his detainment, as two loaded revolvers were found among his possessions when he was arrested.|$|E
25|$|At {{this moment}} Saint-Cyr {{arrived at the}} front to witness the {{collapse}} of the first attack. The French commander immediately directed Souham's 10 battalions to angle to their left and assault Reding's right flank. He also sent Pino's second brigade, the three battalions each of the 1st Light and 6th Line, to rush the Spanish center. Fontane continued to distract the enemy's left flank with his two battalions. Souham's heavy column plowed into and ruptured Reding's line. Meanwhile, Pino's second brigade pressed back the Spanish center. With the Spanish position <b>unraveling,</b> Saint-Cyr ordered the Italian light cavalry under Carlo Balabio to charge up the main highway. As the horsemen galloped up the hill, the entire Spanish force bolted to the rear.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{seemingly}} successful career, Bates' life, {{both on and}} off screen, started <b>unraveling.</b> She became a victim of extreme mood swings, insecurity, ill health, and chronic depression. In 1954, she won the role of Cathy on the NBC sitcom It's a Great Life, co-starring Frances Bavier as her mother, Amy Morgan, and James Dunn as her uncle, Earl Morgan. After 26 episodes, she was written out of the show due to her erratic behavior, depression and instability. Bates tried to salvage her career and traveled to England to find work. She was signed on as a contract player with the Rank Organisation, only to be replaced in two leading roles before filming began. Bates continued to be too emotionally unstable to work and in 1957, her contract with the Rank Organisation was canceled.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 1982, Janet Harduvel (Laura Dern) is {{devastated by}} {{the news of the}} death of her husband Ted (Vincent Spano) who flew as a United States Air Force pilot in one of the world's most {{sophisticated}} fighter aircraft, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. She is stymied in finding out the truth behind his crash in Korea and takes on the US military and General Dynamics, maker of the F-16. With the help of her lawyer, Leo Morrone (Robert Loggia), and her sister Mary (Welker White), Harduvel begins the long process of <b>unraveling</b> the lies and deception that are behind a joint military and General Dynamics cover-up that blames the accident on pilot error. Despite setbacks, she proves to be unwavering in her search for the truth to clear his name and uncover the deadly secret buried in the F-16.|$|E
