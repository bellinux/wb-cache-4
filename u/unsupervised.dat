5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 lambs per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} <b>unsupervised</b> lambing to produce hardy, active lambs.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for <b>unsupervised</b> detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the schools}} were <b>unsupervised,</b> often underfunded and of varying standards.|$|E

25|$|Such helmets are not {{intended}} for use anywhere motor vehicles are present. To avoid serious accidents, parents and carers should take care to ensure that children do not wear bicycle helmets during <b>unsupervised</b> play, or when using climbing equipment.|$|E
25|$|To {{overcome}} this problem, Schmidhuber's multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pre-trained one level {{at a time}} by <b>unsupervised</b> learning, fine-tuned by backpropagation. Behnke (2003) relied only on {{the sign of the}} gradient (Rprop) on problems such as image reconstruction and face localization.|$|E
25|$|Multilayer kernel {{machines}} (MKM) {{are a way}} {{of learning}} highly nonlinear functions by iterative application of weakly nonlinear kernels.

25|$|As of 2011, {{the state}} of the art in deep and {{feedforward}} networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, alternated convolutional layers and max-pooling layers, topped by several fully or sparsely connected layers followed by a final classification layer. Learning is usually done without <b>unsupervised</b> pre-training.|$|E
25|$|Sparse {{dictionary}} {{learning has}} been successfully applied to various image, video and audio processing tasks {{as well as to}} texture synthesis and <b>unsupervised</b> clustering. In evaluations with the Bag-of-Words model, sparse coding was found empirically to outperform other coding approaches on the object category recognition tasks.|$|E
25|$|The Gurt Dog ("Great Dog") of Somerset is {{an example}} of a benevolent dog.

25|$|Investigators stated {{publicly}} {{that they did}} not believe Biryukova's story and suspected criminal activity had occurred. However they did not formally describe her as a suspect or person of interest, nor did they charge her with child endangerment despite the circumstances of the case and her past arrest, along with her then-husband, for leaving Sky in the car <b>unsupervised.</b>|$|E
25|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{missed an}} opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was never collected. In 2003, {{he was convicted of}} a felony and was serving three years of supervised probation. In 2004, voters passed Proposition 69, which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the DNA database. In July 2005, Franklin was on <b>unsupervised</b> probation, but his DNA was not entered into the system. Probation officers did not collect DNA samples from people who were on <b>unsupervised</b> probation between November 2004 and August 2005. During that period, the probation department did not have the resources to collect samples. Officers did not collect samples until August 2005.|$|E
25|$|Requirements vary, but in {{most states}} about 3000 hours of {{supervised}} work as an intern are needed to sit for a licensing exam. MFTs must be licensed {{by the state to}} practice. Only after completing their education and internship and passing the state licensing exam can a person call themselves a Marital and Family Therapist and work <b>unsupervised.</b>|$|E
25|$|David Michael Krueger (March 5, 1939 – March 5, 2010), {{best known}} by his birth name, Peter Woodcock, was a Canadian serial killer and child rapist. He gained notoriety {{for the murders}} of three young {{children}} in Toronto in the late 1950s, {{as well as for}} a murder on his first day of <b>unsupervised</b> release from the psychiatric institution he was incarcerated in for his earlier crimes.|$|E
25|$|After John Africa's death, his widow, Alberta, married John Gilbride, Jr., a {{white man}} 20 years younger than she. Together they had a child, Zackary Africa, circa 1996. The couple {{divorced}} in 1999. After a custody battle, a court ruling granted Gilbride partial custody of Zackary, allowing him <b>unsupervised</b> visits. Gilbride, by this point a former MOVE supporter, moved to Maple Shade, New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|Medications in Spain are {{regulated}} under Law 29/2006 of 26 July, of guarantees and rational use of medications {{and health care}} products (Ley 29/2006, de 26 de julio, de garantías y uso racional de los medicamentos y productos sanitarios). One of the SNS's priorities with respect to pharmaceuticals is to teach patients to make rational use of medications and to avoid, insofar as possible, <b>unsupervised</b> self-medication.|$|E
25|$|Flash drives {{may present}} a {{significant}} security challenge for some organizations. Their small size {{and ease of}} use allows <b>unsupervised</b> visitors or employees to store and smuggle out confidential data with little chance of detection. Both corporate and public computers are vulnerable to attackers connecting a flash drive to a free USB port and using malicious software such as keyboard loggers or packet sniffers.|$|E
25|$|After a {{long night}} of partying, Bobby Moore and four of his friends become drunk and drive over a bridge and crash into a truck, killing all five. Bobby's father Shaw Moore, the Reverend of the Beaumont, Georgia church, persuades the city council to pass several {{draconian}} laws, including a ban on all <b>unsupervised</b> dancing within the city limits (based, in part, on New York City Cabaret Law).|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Hinckley was {{permitted}} to leave the hospital for supervised visits with his parents; he was granted longer <b>unsupervised</b> releases in 2000. These privileges were revoked when he {{was found to have}} smuggled materials about Foster into the hospital. Hinckley was allowed supervised visits with his parents again during 2004 and 2005. Court hearings were held in September 2005 on whether he could have expanded privileges to leave the hospital.|$|E
25|$|On October 10, 2008, Canseco was {{detained}} by immigration officials at a San Diego border crossing {{as he tried}} to bring a fertility drug from Mexico. He stated the drug was to help with his hormone replacement therapy, needed due to his use of steroids. On November 4, 2008, Canseco pleaded guilty in Federal court and was sentenced to 12 months' <b>unsupervised</b> probation by U.S. Magistrate Judge Ruben B. Brooks.|$|E
25|$|Wilmette's first {{informal}} {{beach was}} {{established at the}} foot of Elmwood Avenue in 1910. Wooden steps were constructed down the bluff to allow access to the beach from the street. In 1914 the Wilmette Beach Improvement Association was founded to clean up the village's <b>unsupervised</b> shoreline. The group established an official swimming beach {{at the foot of}} Lake Avenue, the site of today's Gillson Beach, with facilities including a bathhouse, swings, benches, and umbrellas.|$|E
25|$|As an example, in an {{extension}} of a theory for <b>unsupervised</b> learning of invariant visual representations to the auditory domain and empirically evaluated its validity for voiced speech sound classification was proposed. Authors empirically demonstrated that a single-layer, phone-level representation, extracted from base speech features, improves segment classification accuracy and decreases the number of training examples in comparison with standard spectral and cepstral features for an acoustic classification task on TIMIT dataset.|$|E
25|$|On 18 October 2005, Sanno Amra and Champa, a Hindu couple {{residing}} in the Punjab Colony, Karachi, Sindh returned home to find that their three teenage daughters had disappeared. After inquiries to the local police, the couple discovered that their daughters had been taken to a local madrassah, had been converted to Islam, and were denied <b>unsupervised</b> contact with their parents. In January 2017, a Hindu temple was demolished in Pakistan's Haripur district.|$|E
25|$|Howard and Harold are {{the adoptive}} fathers of Clyde McBride, {{who is a}} main {{character}} and the best friend of protagonist Lincoln Loud. They shower Clyde with attention and rarely let him do anything <b>unsupervised.</b> Howard is sensitive and neurotic, often getting over-emotional while watching Clyde grow up. Harold's parenting style contrasts with Howard's; he is calm, collected, and concerned with Clyde's safety and health above everything else. The McBrides serve as foils to Lincoln's less worrisome parents.|$|E
25|$|When {{data are}} not labeled, {{supervised}} learning is not possible, and an <b>unsupervised</b> learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The clustering algorithm which provides an improvement to the support vector machines is called support vector clustering and is often used in industrial applications either when {{data are not}} labeled or when only some data are labeled as a preprocessing for a classification pass.|$|E
25|$|Going {{beyond the}} {{specific}} problem of learning states and transformations, {{the task of}} clustering also admits a fully quantum version, wherein both the oracle which returns the distance between data-points and the information processing device which runs the algorithm are quantum. Finally, a general framework spanning supervised, <b>unsupervised</b> and reinforcement learning in the fully quantum setting was introduced in, where it was also shown {{that the possibility of}} probing the environment in superpositions permits a quantum speedup in reinforcement learning.|$|E
25|$|To {{implement}} the ideas described in previous sections, one {{need to know}} how to derive a computationally efficient invariant representation of an image. Such unique representation for each image can be characterized as it appears by a set of one-dimensional probability distributions (empirical distributions of the dot-products between image and a set of templates stored during <b>unsupervised</b> learning). These probability distributions in their turn can be described by either histograms or a set of statistical moments of it, as it will be shown below.|$|E
25|$|Early on, deep {{learning}} was also applied to sequence learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are general computers and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. The depth of an RNN is unlimited and {{depends on the}} length of its input sequence. RNNs can be trained by gradient descent but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. In 1992, it was shown that <b>unsupervised</b> pre-training of a stack of recurrent neural networks can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems.|$|E
25|$|After a July 1996 brawl at a Lafayette, Louisiana {{health club}} {{involving}} Kelly and his entourage, Kelly {{was placed on}} a year's <b>unsupervised</b> probation starting August 13, 1997, after being found guilty of battery. One of the victims, Christopher Mahoney, needed 110 facial stitches. Also that year, 20-year-old Tiffany Hawkins sued Kelly for $10 million and accused him of having sexual relations with her when he was 24 and she 15. Kelly settled the lawsuit in 1998 for $250,000, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.|$|E
