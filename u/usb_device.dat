5|$|When a <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> {{is first}} {{connected}} to a USB host, the <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b> The data rate of the <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device {{is supported by the}} host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E
5|$|ADDR: Address of <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> (maximum of 127 devices).|$|E
5|$|The host {{controller}} directs {{traffic flow}} to devices, so no <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> can transfer any {{data on the}} bus without an explicit request from the host controller. In USB2.0, the host controller polls the bus for traffic, usually in a round-robin fashion. The throughput of each USB port {{is determined by the}} slower speed of either the USB port or the <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> connected to the port.|$|E
50|$|The {{virtual machine}} can {{interface}} with {{many types of}} physical host hardware. These include: hard disks, CD-ROM drives, network cards, audio interfaces, and <b>USB</b> <b>devices.</b> <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> can be completely emulated (mass storage from image files, input devices), or the host's <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> can be used (however, this requires administrator privileges and does not work with all devices).|$|R

5|$|The {{functionality}} of a <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> {{is defined}} by a class code sent to a USB host. This allows the host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent {{mechanism}} for upgrading the firmware of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) {{a way for}} firmware bugfixes to be deployed. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a PROM programmer. Any class of <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications.|$|E
5|$|SPLIT is used {{to perform}} split transactions. Rather than tie up the {{high-bandwidth}} USB bus sending data to a slower <b>USB</b> <b>device,</b> the nearest high-bandwidth capable hub receives a SPLIT token followed by one or two USB packets at high-bandwidth, performs the data transfer at full- or low-bandwidth, and provides the response at high-bandwidth when prompted by a second SPLIT token. It contains a seven-bit hub number, 12bits of control flags, and a five-bit CRC.|$|E

5|$|To {{reliably}} {{enable a}} charge-only feature, modern USB accessory peripherals now include charging cables that provide power {{connections to the}} host port but no data connections, and both home and vehicle charging docks are available that supply power from a converter device and do not include a host device and data pins, allowing any capable <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> to charge or operate from a standard USB cable.|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> may {{consist of}} several logical sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as device functions. A single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). This kind of device is called a composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each logical device a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.|$|E
5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b> Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E

40|$|<b>USB</b> storage <b>devices,</b> {{also known}} as USB sticks, pen drives, flash drives, thumb drives, and key drives, have {{replaced}} many other portable storage media. <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> are popular given their robustness, low power consumption, rapid response rates, non-volatile nature, capacity, and ease of transportation. However, the data on these devices are most often unsecured and not deleted when disposed of. Using a quantitative and case study method to assess the extent and potential impact of the problem, this study obtained second-hand <b>USB</b> <b>devices,</b> purchased from eBay Australia to determine the data and erasure status of the devices using forensic acquisition and analysis techniques. Where data fragments were recovered, the volume and potential sensitivity of were investigated. The findings from the research show that in most cases, the <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> held a large volume of data, were owned by both individuals and organizations, and were used to store highly sensitive and confidential data. This data were neither permanently nor securely destroyed prior to disposal (by sale) of the devices. Such incidents highlight the failure to meet regulatory obligations regarding privacy legislation in Australia. The paper provides recommendations for secure disposal of data from <b>USB</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
25|$|Web-based {{services}} such as Open Diary (started in October 1998) and LiveJournal (January 1999) soon appeared to streamline and automate online publishing, but growth in personal storytelling came {{with the emergence of}} blogs. While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals. Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries. For example, some diary software now stores entries in encrypted format, such 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption, and others only permit access to the diary after correct PIN entry on a secure <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
25|$|The program, when installed, prompts {{the user}} to create a {{whitelist}} of devices that are allowed to connect to the computer via its USB ports, which it checks at a default sample rate, a rate which can be adjusted. The user may also choose what actions the computer will take if it detects a <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> not on the whitelist (by default, it shuts down and erases data from the RAM and swap file). Users need to be logged in as root. Hephaest0s cautions users they must be using at least partial disk encryption along with USBKill to fully prevent attackers from gaining access; Gizmodo suggests using a virtual machine {{that will not be}} present when the computer reboots.|$|E
25|$|A metamaterial-based device {{wirelessly}} converts a 900MHz microwave {{signal to}} 7.3 volts of direct current (greater {{than that of}} a <b>USB</b> <b>device).</b> The device can be tuned to harvest other signals including Wi-Fi signals, satellite signals, or even sound signals. The experimental device used a series of five fiberglass and copper conductors. Conversion efficiency reached 37 percent. When traditional antennas are close to each other in space they interfere with each other. But since RF power goes down by the cube of the distance, the amount of power is very very small. While the claim of 7.3 volts is grand, the measurement is for an open circuit. Since the power is so low, there can be almost no current when any load is attached.|$|E

40|$|The BadUSB attack leverages the {{modification}} of firmware of <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> {{in order to}} mimic the behaviour of a keyboard or a mouse and send malicious commands to the host. This is a new and dreadful threat for any organization. Current countermeasures either require special <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> or ask the user to decide if the device can be used. We propose a new approach that, before allowing the device to be used, forces the user to interact with it physically, {{to ensure that a}} real human-interface device is attached. Our implementation is hardware-based and, hence, can be used with any host, comprising embedded devices, and also during boot, i. e., before any operating system is running.

25|$|A {{television}} set, {{also called}} a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is {{a device that}} combines a tuner, display, and speakers {{for the purpose of}} viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as VHS and later DVD. In the late 2000s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced cathode ray tubes. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

500|$|<b>USB</b> <b>device</b> {{communication}} {{is based on}} pipes (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity, found on a device, and named an endpoint. Because pipes correspond 1-to-1 to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> could have up to 32 endpoints (16 IN, 16 OUT), though it is rare to have so many. An endpoint is defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called [...] "enumeration") and so is relatively permanent, whereas a pipe may be opened and closed.|$|E
