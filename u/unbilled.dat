5|$|The film's {{cast and}} credits were <b>unbilled</b> {{and very few}} details emerged, but the film has been claimed to have {{featured}} Lon Chaney by two scholars. Jon Mirsalis states that Lon Chaney has an <b>unbilled</b> part as a pawnbroker. Michael Blake also notes that Lon Chaney {{had a role in}} the film, but Blake also states that the film had only one reel and lists the production code as 0119. Blake's claim that it was a single reel is the subject of dispute because the release was originally as a two reel production in publications and many advertisements for the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 Pickford co-founded United Artists with Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and Douglas Fairbanks. Pickford {{starred in}} 11 silent films for United Artists release and co-produced three film {{starring}} her brother, Jack Pickford, {{and one with}} their sister, Lottie Pickford. Mary Pickford also made <b>unbilled</b> cameo appearances in six other films during this time.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, six of {{the films}} Chaplin starred in {{have been added to}} the American National Film Registry: The Immigrant (1917), The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), and The Great Dictator (1940). Also {{selected}} was Show People (1928), which features Chaplin in an <b>unbilled</b> cameo appearance. For his work in motion pictures, Chaplin has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Credited as Lucille LeSueur, {{her first}} film was Lady of the Night in 1925, {{as the body}} double for MGM's most popular female star, Norma Shearer. She also {{appeared}} in The Circle and Pretty Ladies (both 1925), starring comedian ZaSu Pitts. This was soon followed by equally small and <b>unbilled</b> roles in two other 1925 successes, The Only Thing and The Merry Widow.|$|E
5|$|The Restless Spirit is a 1913 American silent short drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Allan Dwan, featuring J. Warren Kerrigan and Pauline Bush. The film is based on Thomas Gray's 1751 poem, Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and {{tells the story of a}} man who wishes to be a conqueror. The Dreamer heads out into the desert and is nursed back to health by the Desert Flower. A series of illusions follows which shows the futility of conquest when he cannot conquer his own community. He returns and eventually becomes respected by the community that once ridiculed him. The film makes use of numerous dissolves which were technically difficult to execute, and reportedly sent the cameraman to the hospital due to stress. The film may have been the last <b>unbilled</b> appearance by Lon Chaney, and was released on October 27, 1913 by Universal Film Manufacturing Company under the Victor label. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on September 26, 1913 and played in theaters throughout the United States. The <b>unbilled</b> cast list has been stated to include Lon Chaney {{in the role of}} the pawn broker. The propaganda film was billed as a popular love story by theaters, but the production was the subject of much concern by organized charities. The Charity Organization Societies sought to produce a film to counter the negative portrayal of charities in The Blood Red Tape of Charity. P. L. Whitney stopped short of directly calling the film's portrayal dangerous, but advocated that charity members use the media to highlight the film's faults and exaggerations. Patricia Erens would use the surviving film still of the pawn broker, claimed to be Lon Chaney by scholars, as an example of Jewish character archetypes that were prominent in silent films. The film is now considered lost.|$|E
25|$|Brynner went to Yugoslavia {{to appear}} in a war film, Battle of Neretva (1969). He {{supported}} Katharine Hepburn in the big budget flop The Madwoman of Chaillot (1969). Brynner appeared in drag (as a torch singer) in an <b>unbilled</b> role in the Peter Sellers comedy The Magic Christian (1969).|$|E
25|$|The <b>unbilled</b> {{appearance}} of the character actor Walter Huston, in a small cameo role as the freighter captain who delivers the Falcon, was done as a good luck gesture for his son, John Huston, on his directorial debut. The elder Huston had to promise Jack Warner {{that he would not}} demand a dime for his little role before he was allowed to stagger into Spade's office.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>unbilled</b> cameo {{appearances}} (mostly in the circus audiences) including Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, Dorothy Lamour's co-stars in the Road to... movies. William Boyd appears in his usual guise of Hopalong Cassidy. Danny Thomas, Van Heflin, character actor Oliver Blake, and Noel Neill are seen as circus patrons, among others. Leon Ames is seen and heard in the train wreck sequence.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 Ladd {{played an}} <b>unbilled</b> role in Pigskin Parade. He had short term stints at MGM and RKO, but only got regular {{professional}} acting work {{when he turned}} to radio. Ladd's rich, deep voice was ideal for that medium and in 1936 he ended up being signed by station KFWB as their sole radio actor. He stayed for three years at KFWB doing up to 20 shows a week.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{low level}} of {{metering}} it is difficult to estimate the level of non-revenue water in Saudi Arabia. Only in the case of Riyadh, where meters exist, a meaningful estimate has been done, resulting in an estimated 34% of non-revenue water. It is broken down into 21% physical losses and 13% commercial losses from undermetering, illegal connections and authorized <b>unbilled</b> consumption such as for mosques. In addition, 24% of billed consumption is not being paid. The overall level is high by international standards.|$|E
25|$|By September 1949 {{and using}} her new name, Oliver {{returned}} to the East Coast to begin drama studies at Swarthmore College, followed by professional training at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. After working in summer stock, regional theater and in <b>unbilled</b> bits in daytime and primetime TV shows and commercials, she made her first major television appearance in a supporting role in the July 31, 1955, episode of the live drama series Goodyear TV Playhouse, and quickly progressed to leading parts in other shows.|$|E
25|$|Upon Stewart's arrival {{by train}} in Los Angeles, Fonda greeted {{him at the}} station {{and took him to}} Fonda's studio-supplied lodging, next door to Greta Garbo. Stewart's first job at the studio was as a {{participant}} in screen tests with newly arrived starlets. At first, he had trouble being cast in Hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence. Aside from an <b>unbilled</b> appearance in a Shemp Howard comedy short called Art Trouble in 1934, his first film was the poorly received Spencer Tracy vehicle The Murder Man (1935). Rose Marie (1936), an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After having mixed success in films, he received his first intensely dramatic role in 1936's After the Thin Man, and played Jean Harlow's character's frustrated boyfriend in the Clark Gable vehicle Wife vs. Secretary earlier that same year.|$|E
500|$|The comedian Jack Benny {{may have}} had an <b>unbilled</b> cameo role, as was claimed by a {{contemporary}} newspaper advertisement and in the Casablanca press book. When asked in his column [...] "Movie Answer Man", critic Roger Ebert first replied, [...] "It looks something like him. That's all I can say." [...] In a later column, he responded to a follow-up commenter, [...] "I think you're right. The Jack Benny Fan Club can feel vindicated." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{enduring}} legacy {{stems from}} the disputed belief that Lon Chaney debuted in this film. Jon C. Mirsalis writes [...] "None of the characters are billed in this Rex melodrama, although Chaney is clearly featured in a publicity still. This is the earliest known film in which Chaney appeared, but is undoubtedly one of many <b>unbilled</b> appearances he made at Universal." [...] In the Michael Blake's book A Thousand Faces: Lon Chaney's Unique Artistry in Motion Pictures does not mention the film, but notes that the possibility exists of Chaney performing in a role {{during a period of}} unemployment in 1912. The date of the film's production is unknown, but the book notes that he rejoined Clarence Kolb and Max Dill's company in San Francisco, California in September 1912. The documentary Lon Chaney: A Thousand Faces also states that Chaney's first works were at Nestor Studios." [...] The documentary also notes that his film debut occurred after his wife's suicide attempt in April 1913.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{ethereal}} aspects {{and double}} exposures were {{performed in the}} camera because {{the ability to create}} the effects in lab did not yet exist. Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film, each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to be exact otherwise the shot would be ruined. Lombardi notes that the cinematographer, Walter Pritchard, was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said {{he was one of the}} company's oldest men. Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production. In The Parade's Gone By, Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done. Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots. This production may have been the last <b>unbilled</b> movie credit of Lon Chaney. The discovery of Lon Chaney's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head. Chaney wrote [...] "This is me just below the X sign. Here I am a Russian Prince." [...] on the back of the still. The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23, 1913. The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman, which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film.|$|E
500|$|The song's first {{televised}} {{performance was}} at the 2014 BRIT Awards on February 19, 2014, marking her first performance at the ceremony since the one held in 2004. The performance was confirmed by James Corden on BBC Radio 2 several hours prior to the ceremony, following rumours that circulated for several weeks. Beyoncé appeared on stage wearing a shimmering, floor-length sequin blue gown designed by Vrettos Vrettakos containing 140,000 blue zircon crystals and big earrings. The singer performed {{in front of a}} simple set of flashing neon lights along with fireworks and lasers on a screen as well as smoke surrounding her dedicating the performance to her fans. Sam Lansky of Time magazine praised the simplicity of the performance as [...] "classy and spare" [...] and wrote that the singer [...] "more than did it justice" [...] with her [...] "pretty much peerless" [...] vocals. MTV News' Emily Blake favorably reviewed the performance as more [...] "subdued" [...] in comparison with the other live shows by Beyoncé. Daily News Kirthana Ramisetti said that the singer managed to stun at the awards show with the impassioned performance only with the [...] "power of her voice". Vanity Fair writer Josh Duboff described the performance as [...] "powerful and fairly straightforward, sedate even". E! Online's Bruna Nessif wrote that the singer [...] "absolutely stunned as she belted the sweet ballad, giving the audience a memorable show. There was no extra glitz or glamour (not really necessary with a dress like that) or backup dancers and crazy antics. The singer's main focus were her powerhouse vocals". Mark Savage of BBC News opined, [...] " [...] <b>unbilled,</b> stripped-back performance of XO was undoubtedly the night's most flawless vocal". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described her as [...] "clearly the star of the show". However, Mark Sutherland of the Rolling Stone gave a mixed review about the performance saying it was [...] "a bit... dull". At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, Beyoncé performed [...] "XO" [...] live during a medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. She performed the song dressed in a bejeweled bodysuit and dedicated it to her fans as the closing track of her performance, stating [...] "This one is for my incredible fans. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be on this stage". Nadeska Alexis from MTV News felt that the singer kept the audience [...] "lifted" [...] with the performance of the song.|$|E
2500|$|Director Tommy Carr's brother Steve {{appeared}} as an <b>unbilled</b> extra {{in nearly every}} one of the first 26 shows, and frequently in more substantial character roles. He was also the show's dialog director, and was the man pointing [...] "up in the sky" [...] in the introductions of the black-and-white shows.|$|E

2500|$|Known in her prime as [...] "America's Sweetheart" [...] and the [...] "girl {{with the}} curls", Pickford {{was one of}} the Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood and a {{significant}} figure in the development of film acting. Pickford {{was one of the}} earliest stars to be billed under her name (film performers until that time were usually <b>unbilled),</b> {{and was one of the}} most popular actresses of the 1910s and 1920s, earning the nickname [...] "Queen of the Movies".|$|E
2500|$|Ladd's {{performance}} in The Mikado {{was seen by}} a talent scout. In August 1933 Ladd {{was one of a}} group of young [...] "discoveries" [...] signed to a long-term contract with Universal Pictures. The contract had options which could go for seven years, but they were all in the studio's favor. Ladd appeared <b>unbilled</b> in a film, Once in a Lifetime (1932), but the studio eventually decided Ladd was too blond and too short and dropped him after six months. (All of Ladd's fellow [...] "discoveries" [...] would be dropped, including a young Tyrone Power.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1945, and for {{the next}} two years, Julie Andrews {{performed}} spontaneously and <b>unbilled</b> on stage with her parents. [...] "Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening," [...] Andrews explained. She would stand on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. [...] "It must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clayton {{made several}} films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, {{none of which}} was notable, except for an <b>unbilled</b> role in 1948 as a singing inmate in The Snake Pit. [...] Earlier, however, she had been {{selected}} {{to play the role}} of Julie Jordan in the original 1945 Broadway production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic Carousel. Clayton can be heard on the original cast recorddings of both Carousel (1945) and the 1946 film version of Kern's 1927 musical play Show Boat. The Show Boat album was the first American production of the show to be recorded with its original cast.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Condit was {{a member}} of the [...] "Gang of Five" [...] with Charles M. Calderon of Whittier, Gerald R. Eaves of Rialto, Rusty Areias of Los Banos and Steve Peace of Chula Vista. [...] The group tried and failed to unseat Willie Brown, who was serving as Speaker of the Assembly of the California State Assembly at the time, by making a deal with {{assembly}} Republicans. [...] Steve Peace co-wrote and produced the 1988 film Return of the Killer Tomatoes; Condit appeared as <b>unbilled,</b> unspeaking pizzeria patron during a fight sequence wearing a trucker cap who smashes a bottle on the head of a cowboy.|$|E
2500|$|After several {{calls from}} Central Casting {{and a number}} of {{rejected}} job offers, Harlean was pressed into accepting work by her mother. She appeared in her first film, Honor Bound, as an <b>unbilled</b> extra for $7 a day. [...] This led to small parts in feature films such as Moran of the Marines (1928), This Thing Called Love (1929), Close Harmony (1929), and The Love Parade (1929), among others. In December 1928, she signed a five-year contract with Hal Roach Studios for $100 per week. She had a co-starring role in Laurel and Hardy's short Double Whoopee in 1929, and went on to appear in two more of their films: Liberty and Bacon Grabbers (both 1929).|$|E
2500|$|Allman {{made her}} film debut {{as an actress}} in 1940's The Road to Singapore in an <b>unbilled</b> bit (as were the {{majority}} of Allman's motion picture appearances in the '40s) as a homely woman who pursues Bob Hope. Another memorable bit was {{as one of the}} several psychotics Abbott & Costello run into when trying to find the Susquehanna Hat Co. (on Bagel St.) in [...] "In Society" [...] (1944). She worked most successfully during this period as a radio comedian playing assorted guest parts, typically as a shrewish woman. [...] One of her more steady radio gigs was on the Blondie radio series in the part of Cora Dithers, the domineering wife of Dagwood Bumstead's boss.|$|E
