This approach relates the real per capita growth rate over a given period to an initial level of per capita real gross domestic product (GDP), plus a variety of control and environmental variables representing international openness, governance, and prevailing human, physical and natural capital endowments (Barro and Sala-I-Martin 2004). These factors have been found to influence long-term growth in Latin America since 1900 (Astorga 2010). The possible endogeneity of these explanatory variables was taken into account using lagged values as instruments.

40|$|AbstractThe {{differences}} between countries in national income, growth, human development {{and many other}} factors are used to classify countries into developed and developing countries. There are several classification systems that use different sets of measures and criteria. The most common classifications are the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank (WB) systems. The <b>UN</b> <b>classification</b> system uses the UN Human Development Index (HDI), an indicator that uses statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita for countries' classification. While the WB system uses gross national income (GNI) per capita that is calculated using the World Bank Atlas method. According to the UN and WB classification systems, there are 151 and 134 developing countries, respectively, with 89 % overlap between the two systems. Developing countries have limited human development, and limited expenditure in education and research, among several other limitations.

40|$|AbstractBoth a {{prospective}} and a retrospective validation study were undertaken {{to assess the}} suitability of the Ocular Irritection® assay to discriminate ocular hazards {{as defined by the}} OECD and UN Globally Harmonized System (<b>UN</b> GHS) for <b>classification.</b> The primary focus {{of the study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of the Ocular Irritection® assay to reliably discriminate chemicals not requiring <b>classification</b> (<b>UN</b> GHS non-classified), from classified chemicals (UN GHS Categories 1 and 2). Furthermore a post-hoc evaluation was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of the assay to discriminate chemicals inducing serious eye damage (UN GHS Category 1) from other classes. The prospective validation study was conducted between 2009 and 2012 following internationally agreed principles. A set of 56 coded test chemicals for which quality and/or peer-reviewed in vivo data were available were used to obtain prospective data on the assay’s reliability (reproducibility within and between laboratories) and relevance (predictive capacity). The assay showed good within-laboratory variability, transferability including to a naïve laboratory, and between-laboratory concordance of classifications (82 % for the discrimination of non-classified from classified chemicals, and 83 % for the discrimination of Category 1 from other classes). The obtained prospective data were then combined with existing data on the Ocular Irritection® collected from various sources, totaling 88 chemicals with parallel in vivo and in vitro data to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the test method performances. The enlarged dataset comprised 43 non-classified, 25 Category 2 and 20 Category 1 chemicals according to the <b>UN</b> GHS <b>classification.</b> When used for the identification of UN GHS non-classified versus classified materials (based on the existing cut-off of 12. 5) the Ocular Irritection® assay showed an overall a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 58 %. An evaluation on possible reasons for misclassification identified some organic functional groups (acrylate, carboxamide and cycloalkene) to correlate with the observed mispredictions. If these functional groups were excluded from the Ocular Irritection® applicability domain, the obtained dataset (n= 79 chemicals distributed as 41 UN GHS Classified and 38 Non-Classified chemicals) had an overall sensitivity of 98 %, and specificity of 63 %, which is in line with currently adopted test methods. When used for the identification of UN GHS Category 1 versus other categories (based on the existing cut-off of 30. 0) the Ocular Irritection® assay showed an overall specificity of 81 % and a sensitivity of 50 % which is again in line with currently adopted test methods. The Ocular Irritection® assay appeared therefore as a useful test method to predict chemicals not requiring classification for eye hazards according to the <b>UN</b> GHS <b>classification</b> system.

Eight Spanish plants located in Madrid, Barcelona and Málaga were considered and several sludge samples were taken in different seasons. The base for the assessment of the spontaneous ignition behaviour of dust accumulations is the experimental determination of the self-ignition temperature under isothermal conditions. Self-ignition temperatures at four volumes were obtained for one sample of sewage sludge, allowing their extrapolation to large storage facilities. A simple test method, based also on an isothermal study of samples, is the <b>UN</b> <b>classification</b> of substances liable to spontaneous combustion. Two different samples were so tested, obtaining unlike results if transported in packages of different volumes. By means of thermogravimetric techniques it is possible to analyse the thermal susceptibility of dried sewage sludge. Apparent activation energy can be obtained from the rate of weight loss. It is also applied to the study of self-ignition susceptibility by modifying test conditions when oxygen stream is introduced. As a consequence of this oxidant contribution, sample behaviour can be very different during testing and a step drop or sudden loss of weight is observed at a characteristic temperature for every substance, associated to a rapid combustion. Plotting both the activation energy and the characteristic temperature, a map of self-ignition risk was obtained for 10 samples, showing different risk levels for samples taken in different locations and at different seasons. A prediction of the self-ignition risk level can be also determined...|$|E
40|$|The safe {{management}} of nuclear waste arising from nuclear activities {{is an issue}} of great importance for the protection of {{human health and the environment}} now and in the future. The primary goal of this report is to identify the current situation and practices being utilized across the globe to manage and store low and intermediate level radioactive waste. The countries included in this report were selected based on their nuclear power capabilities and involvement in the nuclear fuel cycle. This report highlights the nuclear waste management laws and regulations, current disposal practices, and future plans for facilities of the selected international nuclear countries. For each country presented, background information and the history of nuclear facilities are also summarized to frame the country's nuclear activities and set stage for the management practices employed. The production of nuclear energy, including all the steps in the nuclear fuel cycle, results in the generation of radioactive waste. However, radioactive waste may also be generated by other activities such as medical, laboratory, research institution, or industrial use of radioisotopes and sealed radiation sources, defense and weapons programs, and processing (mostly large scale) of mineral ores or other materials containing naturally occurring radionuclides. Radioactive waste also arises from intervention activities, which are necessary after accidents or to remediate areas affected by past practices. The radioactive waste generated arises in a wide range of physical, chemical, and radiological forms. It may be solid, liquid, or gaseous. Levels of activity concentration can vary from extremely high, such as levels associated with spent fuel and residues from fuel reprocessing, to very low, for instance those associated with radioisotope applications. Equally broad is the spectrum of half-lives of the radionuclides contained in the waste. These differences result in an equally wide variety of options for the {{management of}} radioactive waste. There is a variety of alternatives for processing waste and for short term or long term storage prior to disposal. Likewise, there are various alternatives currently in use across the globe for the safe disposal of waste, ranging from near surface to geological disposal, depending on the specific classification of the waste. At present, there appears to be a clear and unequivocal understanding that each country is ethically and legally responsible for its own wastes, in accordance with the provisions of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. Therefore the default position is that all nuclear wastes will be disposed of in each of the 40 or so countries concerned with nuclear power generation or part of the fuel cycle. To illustrate the global distribution of radioactive waste now and in the near future, Table 1 provides the regional breakdown, based on the <b>UN</b> <b>classification</b> of the world in regions illustrated in Figure 1, of nuclear power reactors in operation and under construction worldwide. In summary, 31 countries operate 433 plants, with a total capacity of more than 365 gigawatts of electrical energy (GW[e]). A further 65 units, totaling nearly 63 GW(e), are under construction across 15 of these nations. In addition, 65 countries are expressing new interest in, considering, or actively planning for nuclear power to help address growing energy demands to fuel economic growth and development, climate change concerns, and volatile fossil fuel prices. Of these 65 new countries, 21 are in Asia and the Pacific region, 21 are from the Africa region, 12 are in Europe (mostly Eastern Europe), and 11 in Central and South America. However, 31 of these 65 are not currently planning to build reactors, and 17 of those 31 have grids of less than 5 GW, which is said to be too small to accommodate most of the reactor designs available. For the remaining 34 countries actively planning reactors, as of September 2010 : 14 indicate a strong intention to precede with introduction of nuclear power; 7 are preparing but haven't made a final decision, 10 have made a decision and are preparing infrastructure, 2 have ordered a new nuclear power plant, and 1 has a plant under construction. In all countries interested in pursuing nuclear power, it is necessary for the governments to create an environment for investment and advancement of nuclear power, including development of a professional and independent regulatory framework and regime, knowledge and refinement of skills in nuclear safety and control, definition of policies on nuclear waste management and decommissioning, and participation in international non-proliferation measures. Specifically related to radioactive waste management, nuclear facilities and industries that utilize radioactive material work to well-established safety standards for the management of their waste...|$|E
40|$|A {{key factor}} in the {{sustainability}} of China's economic growth is the potential of Chinese firms to develop innovative capabilities autonomously and international management know-how thus enabling them {{to move up the}} technological ladder of the production process and to globalise their operations. If successful, some Chinese firms will eventually develop their own brands and open up subsidiaries abroad like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts a few decades ago. If this is not achieved, then China’s future growth could remain overly dependent on overseas markets and foreign technology. Chinese firms could remain highly competitive in traditional labour-intensive exports (such as the textile, lighters and toys industries of the Zhejiang province) or in relatively simple electric products (such as household appliance) but would not possess the capacity to become innovators of high tech products. The Chinese firms could only operate internationally in highly competitive industries characterised by low barriers to entry and with moderate margins while firms from the most advanced economies could continue to extract rents in industries characterised by high tech and/or differentiated products thanks to their technological innovation capacities and management know-how. The purpose of this paper will be to assess the capacity of China's largest firms to transform themselves into global competitors possessing ownership-specific advantages or intangible assets like some of their East Asian counterparts and to determine to what extent could the Chinese state pursue a strategic industrial policy to help them do so. The fact that a firm establishes a subsidiary abroad does not make it a global competitor, not even a Multinational Enterprise (MNE) or a Trans-National Corporation (TNC). According to United Nations’ (<b>UN)</b> <b>classification,</b> to be considered as TNC or MNE, a firm must have subsidiaries in at least six different countries. Many Chinese firms satisfy these criteria and can be considered as MNEs. Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in terms of possession of intangible assets between being a multinational enterprise and a top global competitor. According to UN estimates, in 2004, there were 70, 000 MNE which controlled 690, 000 subsidiaries across the globe (El Mouhoub, 2006 : 17). Obviously all of those firms cannot be considered as truly global competitors. To delineate more clearly the prerequisites necessary for a firm to evolve into a global competitor, this section will refer to Dunning’s eclectic paradigm and OLI configuration. For Dunning, in order for a firm to transform itself into a MNE, it must possess “ownership-specific advantages”. That is, intangible assets which constitute substantial barriers to entry for other potential competitors. Dunning lists the following assets: “product innovations, product management, organizational and marketing systems, innovatory capacity, organization of work, non-codifiable knowledge (bank of human capital experience), ability to reduce the cost of intra and/or inter-firm transactions” (Dunning, 1993 : 81). Dunning also includes absolute cost advantages coming from a privileged access to inputs, learning by doing, “knowledge of international markets and operations”, “capacity to learn from societal difference in organisational and managerial processes and systems” (Dunning, 1993 : 81). In this paper, the term “global competitors” refers to incumbents of their industries which are protected by natural and strategic barriers to entry and which operate across the different regions of the world economy. These global competitors enjoy most and often all of the ownership-specific Expert PDF Evaluation 2 advantages listed above. Many of them are the “prime movers” from America and Europe whose emergence in the late 19 th century has been analysed by Chandler (Chandler, 1990). They were joined by the Japanese keiretsu in the 1960 ’s and the South Korean chaebol in the 1980 ’s. This paper will attempt to determine whether emerging Chinese champions are effectively acquiring sufficient ownership-specific advantages to have a hope of joining this group of global competitors. The analysis of China’s greatest MNEs and outward FDI flows will show that both the type of ownership-specific advantages and the motivations of Chinese firms investing overseas differ radically from the global competitors of the developed economy. It will also show that, in that respect, Chinese firms are not following the internationalisation path of the Japanese keiretsu in the 1960 ’s or the South Korean chaebol in the 1980 ’s. The first part of the paper will provide an analysis of Chinese outward FDI outflows in an attempt to determine the importance of Chinese MNEs and their performance compared to other developing economies. It will also highlight the limitations of working with such an aggregate {{when it comes to the}} official Chinese data of foreign direct investment. The second part of this contribution will provide a qualitative analysis of the overseas projects made by Chinese MNEs. An attempt will be made to determine the technological level and the capital- intensity of their overseas operations. The extent of government protection and support extended to these largest firms and the sector in which they operate will be examined. It will be demonstrated that the largest Chinese firms are located in sectors which are heavily protected and aided by the Chinese central government. Finally, it will be made clear that that Chinese FDI outflows are predominantly motivated by the Chinese government's geopolitical objectives rather than by business profit maximisation. The third part of the paper will provide a comparative analysis of the performance of China's largest firms’ with that of their global competitors. Aspects to be looked at include capital-intensity, profits and assets. This comparison has two purposes: to clearly delineate the existing gap between these two groups; and to compare the current relative situation of the largest Chinese firms with that of East Asian MNEs at the time of their overseas expansion. This will reveal that Chinese firms have a much lower degree of profitability and capital intensity than the largest Japanese and Korean firms had in the early stages of internationalising their business operations. The three first parts of this paper will highlight the weaknesses of the largest Chinese firms and the gap with their global competitors in terms of profitability, capital and technology intensity. It will be demonstrated that they are unlikely to transform themselves into global competitors without being sheltered by a strong Chinese state industrial policy, as was the case also for their South Korean and Japanese counterparts at a similar stage of their expansion. The fourth and fifth part of the paper will follow up on this by focusing on the capacity of the Chinese state to pursue a strategic trade and industrial policy necessary to transform its national champions into global competitors...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of its {{explosive}} rise since {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, the population of the world has tripled in comparison with 1950. In 2009, the number of inhabitants living in cities was over the number of people inhabiting rural areas, while from 75 in 1950 the number of cities with more than 1 million inhabitants is expected to increase to 553 by 2050. Nevertheless, the most evident forms of the march of urbanization are megacities, i. e. those urban agglomerations where extremely large populations are concentrated. One important problem of defining megacities is the determination of an optimum population threshold that is the establishment of the population value over which an urban agglomeration can be regarded to be a megacity.

A description of all the ocular effects observed in vivo, i. e. degree of severity and persistence of corneal opacity (CO), iritis, and/or conjunctiva effects, was added for each individual study in the database and the studies were categorised according to their <b>UN</b> GHS/EU CLP <b>classification</b> and the main effect driving the classification. An evaluation of the various in vivo drivers of classification compiled in the database was performed to establish which of these are most important from a regulatory point of view. These analyses established that the most important drivers for Cat 1 Classification are (i) CO mean ≥ 3 (days 1 - 3) (severity) and (ii) CO persistence on day 21 in the absence of severity and those for Cat 2 classification are (iii) CO mean ≥ 1 and (iv) conjunctival redness mean ≥ 2. Moreover, it is shown that all classifiable effects (including persistence and CO = 4) should be present in > 60 % of the animals to drive a classification. As a consequence, our analyses suggest the need for a critical revision of the UN GHS/EU CLP decision criteria for the Cat 1 classification of chemicals. Finally, a number of key criteria are identified that should be taken into consideration when selecting reference chemicals for the development, evaluation and/or validation of alternative methods and/or strategies for serious eye damage/eye irritation testing. Most important, the DRD is an invaluable tool for any future activity involving the selection of reference chemicals. JRC. F. 3 -Chemicals Safety and Alternative Method...|$|R

The two dyes, Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16) and Reactive Green 19 (RG 19) {{are classified as}} Category 2 A (irritating to eyes) based on the UN Globally Harmonized System for <b>classification</b> (<b>UN</b> GHS), according to the Draize test. On the other hand, animal welfare considerations and the enforcement of a new regulation in the EU are drawing much attention in reducing or replacing animal experiments with alternative methods. This study evaluated the eye irritation of the two dyes RO 16 and RG 19 by combining the Short Time Exposure (STE) and the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP) assays and then comparing them with in vivo data from the GHS classification. The STE test (first level screening) categorized both dyes as GHS Category 1 (severe irritant). In the BCOP, dye RG 19 was also classified as GHS Category 1 while dye RO 16 was classified as GHS no prediction can be made. Both dyes caused damage to the corneal tissue as confirmed by histopathological analysis. Our findings demonstrated that the STE test did not contribute to arriving at a better conclusion about the eye irritation potential of the dyes when {{used in conjunction with}} the BCOP test. Adding the histopathology to the BCOP test could be an appropriate tool for a more meaningful prediction of the eye irritation potential of dyes...|$|R
40|$|Land-cover is an {{important}} parameter in analyzing the state and dynamics of natural and anthropogenic terrestrial ecosystems. Land-cover classes related to semi-arid savannas currently exhibit among the greatest uncertainties in available global land cover datasets. This study focuses on the Kalahari in northeastern Namibia and compares the effects of different composite lengths and observation periods with class-wise mapping accuracies derived from multi-temporal MODIS time series classifications to better understand and overcome quality gaps in mapping semi-arid land-cover types. We further assess the effects of precipitation patterns on mapping accuracy using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observation data. Botanical field samples, translated into the <b>UN</b> Land Cover <b>Classification</b> System (LCCS), were used for training and validation. Different sets of composites (16 -day to three-monthly) were generated from MODIS (MOD 13 Q 1) data covering the sample period from 2004 to 2007. Land-cover classifications were performed cumulatively based on annual and inter-annual feature sets {{with the use of}} random forests. Woody vegetation proved to be more stable in terms of omission and commission errors compared to herbaceous vegetation types. Generally, mapping accuracy increases with increasing length of the observation period. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) verified that inter-annual classifications significantly improved class-wise mapping accuracies, and confirmed that monthly composites achieved the best accuracy scores for both annual and inter-annual classifications. Correlation analyses using piecewise linear models affirmed positive correlations between cumulative mapping accuracy and rainfall and indicated an influence of seasonality and environmental cues on the mapping accuracies. The consideration of the inter-seasonal variability of vegetation activity and phenology cycling in the classification process further increases the overall classification performance of savanna classes in large-area land-cover datasets. Implications for global monitoring frameworks are discussed based on a conceptual model of the relationship between observation period and accurac...|$|R

The {{objective of}} the ESA-Globcover project is the generation of a land cover {{map of the world}} using an automated processing chain from the 300 m MERIS time series. The Globcover project carried out by an international consortium started in April 2005 and relied on very rich feedback and comments from a larger partnership including end users belonging to international institutions (JRC, FAO, EEA, UNEP, GOFC-GOLD and IGBP) in addition to ESA internal assessment. The Globcover products presented here and freely available for any non-commercial use are the following: Bimonthly MERIS Full Resolution (FR) mosaics (6 products a year, 10 products from December 2004 to June 2006). The bimonthly MERIS FR mosaic is computed every 2 months and provides, for each spectral band, the average surface reflectance calculated from all valid observations of this 2 months period. Annual MERIS FR mosaic (1 product a year). The annual MERIS FR mosaic is computed by averaging the surface reflectance values of the bimonthly products generated over one year. The Globcover Land Cover map for the period December 2004 - June 2006 (1 product). This global Land Cover map is derived by an automatic and regionally-tuned classification of a MERIS FR time series. Its 22 land cover classes are defined with the <b>UN</b> Land Cover <b>Classification</b> System (LCCS). The regional Globcover Land Cover maps for the period December 2004 - June 2006 (11 products). This set of regional land cover maps are also derived by the same automatic and regionally-tuned classification of a MERIS FR time series.

However, a {{little is known about}} the patterns of mobility across socioeconomic segments of the country. The study aims to explore gender differences in travel behavior across urban and rural areas that remain unexplored due to the non-availability of suitable data. The paper employs national dataset of 2007 Time Use Survey (TUS) carried out to measure gendered time use in paid and unpaid work activities. In TUS, a national sample of 37830 respondents living in 19380 households, ageing 11 and above, was selected for household and time diary surveys during the whole year 2007. Time use diary recorded various activities carried out by respondents in forty eight 30 -minute long episodes of the past day, their context locations and simultaneity, according to 125 activity codes based on <b>UN</b> designed International <b>Classification</b> of Activities for Time Use Surveys. Preprocessed TUS, that is publically available from Pakistan Strategy Support Program, was analyzed using longitudinal data analysis techniques. According to the results, large gender differences are found in travel behavior related to trip rate, travel mode, duration and purpose of travel. Female are more likely to be immobile as 55 percent female respondents did not report any trip in the diary day as compared to just 4 percent male respondents. Women make lesser daily trips (2. 8) than men (5. 4) and the greatest difference exist for leisure and sociocultural trips. Women are more automobile dependent as their share of automobile trips (13 %) is greater than men’s share (10 %). Period of adulthood and marriage seems to restrict female mobility and leisure travel strongly. Female travel behavior is largely shaped by sociocultural, economical and built environment of the country. The findings points out the need for gender sensitive transport and land use policies in the country as women are more likely to be immobile or travel less due to their concerns related to safety, security and quality of transportation. Potential sources of bias and research directions are pointed out at the end. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, {{scientists}} {{have been trying to}} replace the regulatory in vivo Draize eye test by in vitro methods, but so far only partial replacement has been achieved. In order to better understand the reasons for this, historical in vivo rabbit data were analysed in detail and resampled with the purpose of (1) revealing which of the in vivo endpoints are most important in driving United Nations Globally Harmonized System/European Union Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging (<b>UN</b> GHS/EU CLP) <b>classification</b> for serious eye damage/eye irritation and (2) evaluating the method’s within-test variability for proposing acceptable and justifiable target values of sensitivity and specificity for alternative methods and their combinations in testing strategies. Among the Cat 1 chemicals evaluated, 36 – 65 % (depending on the database) were classified based only on persistence of effects, with the remaining being classified mostly based on severe corneal effects. Iritis was found to rarely drive the classification (< 4 % of both Cat 1 and Cat 2 chemicals). The two most important endpoints driving Cat 2 classification are conjunctiva redness (75 – 81 %) and corneal opacity (54 – 75 %). The resampling analyses demonstrated an overall probability of at least 11 % that chemicals classified as Cat 1 by the Draize eye test could be equally identified as Cat 2 and of about 12 % for Cat 2 chemicals to be equally identified as No Cat. On the other hand, the over-classification error for No Cat and Cat 2 was negligible (< 1 %), which strongly suggests a high over-predictive power of the Draize eye test. Moreover, our analyses of the classification drivers suggest a critical revision of the UN GHS/EU CLP decision criteria for the classification of chemicals based on Draize eye test data, in particular Cat 1 based only on persistence of conjunctiva effects or corneal opacity scores of 4. In order to successfully replace the regulatory in vivo Draize eye test, it will be important to recognise these uncertainties and to have in vitro tools to address the most important in vivo endpoints identified in this paper.
