5000|$|The <b>UHF</b> <b>connector</b> is a World War II {{or earlier}} {{threaded}} RF connector design, from {{an era when}} [...] "UHF" [...] referred to frequencies over 30 MHz.|$|E
50|$|In many applications, <b>UHF</b> <b>connectors</b> were {{replaced}} by designs that have a more uniform surge impedance over {{the length of the}} connector, such as the N connector and the BNC <b>connector.</b> <b>UHF</b> <b>connectors</b> are still widely used in amateur radio, Citizens Band radio, and marine VHF radio applications.|$|R
50|$|<b>UHF</b> <b>connectors</b> {{can handle}} RF peak power levels over one {{kilowatt}} {{based on the}} voltage rating of 500 volts peak.|$|R
50|$|Composite {{monitors}} usually use RCA jacks or BNC connectors {{for video}} input. Earlier equipment (1970s) often used <b>UHF</b> <b>connectors.</b> Typically simple composite monitors give a picture inferior to other interfaces.|$|R
50|$|PL-259, SO-239, {{and several}} other related {{military}} references refer to one specific mechanical design collectively known as the <b>UHF</b> <b>Connector.</b> In some countries, for example in Israel, the term 'PL connector' is confusingly associated rather with the analog phone connector.|$|E
50|$|By design, all {{connectors}} in the <b>UHF</b> <b>Connector</b> family mate {{using the}} 5/8 inch 24 tpi threaded shell for the shield connection and an approximately 0.156 inch (4mm) diameter pin and socket for the inner conductor. Similar connectors with an incompatible 16mm diameter, 1mm metric thread have been produced, {{but these are}} not standard UHF connectors by definition.|$|E
50|$|UHF {{connectors}} have a non-constant surge impedance. For this reason, UHF connectors {{are generally}} usable through HF {{and the lower}} portion {{of what is now}} known as the VHF frequency range.Despite the name, the <b>UHF</b> <b>connector</b> is rarely used in commercial applications for today's UHF frequencies, as the non-constant surge impedance creates measurable electrical signal reflections above 100 MHz.|$|E
50|$|Mini-UHF {{connectors}} are miniaturized {{versions of}} <b>UHF</b> <b>connectors,</b> designed primarily {{for use in}} bag-type mobile phones and similar applications where size is an important consideration. Introduced in the 1970s, Mini-UHF has a 3/8-24 thread size and operates up to 2.5 GHz.|$|R

40|$|Here {{are some}} {{practical}} tips for making simple test accessories {{to use at}} your engineering workbench: filters, detectors, attenuators and return loss bridges for audio and RF/IF Every engineering lab bench needs a supply of handy test accessoriesâ€”cables, adapters, attenuators, couplers, combiners, filters, detectors, limiters, etc. This article describes several accessories that can be built quickly (and cheaply), yet they provide sufficient performance from DC to 100 MHz. This frequency range includes most audio, baseband and intermediate frequency circuits, {{as well as many}} RF applications from VLF through VHF. Connector-Mounted Accessories Low cost tests pieces can be realized using BNC panel jacks and associated hardware, although improvements can be attained using <b>UHF</b> <b>connectors</b> and panel jacks, as well as the higher quality N and TNC connectors. SMA and similar microwave connectors can certainly be used, but most hand-built circuits will not require their microwave performance. Low cost test pieces can be constructed readily, via machine screw and solder assembly, using four hole coaxial panel jacks without printed circuit boards or enclosures. This technique has been demonstrated for passive circuits using BNC <b>connectors</b> [1], and <b>UHF</b> <b>connectors</b> have been extensively used with low cost transmission line transformers [2]...|$|R
5000|$|The Gonset Communicators were {{packaged}} {{in a square}} box with a carrying handle and a <b>UHF</b> <b>connector</b> for the antenna on top, making them quite portable. Early models had a magic eye tube tuning indicator in front. The configuration earned them the name [...] "Gooney Box." [...] The radios could operate from 110 volt AC mains, or 6 or 12 volt DC from a car battery. A simple whip antenna could be plugged into the antenna connector on top. The transmit/receive switch {{was on the front}} panel, not the microphone. The Gonset could also be connected to an external speaker and used as a public address (PA) system.|$|E
5000|$|RX signals may be input via a front BNC {{connector}} or a rear <b>UHF</b> SO-239 <b>connector</b> (Yaesu {{calls it}} a type [...] "M" [...] connector) using a relay on the PA unit. The selection {{has to be made}} per band (HF, 6, 2 m or 70 cm) using menu selection. The BNC connector is the antenna connector chosen when the relay is bypassed.|$|R
