40|$|ABSTRACT: Four {{kinds of}} moles {{are found in}} the Pacific coast states but only the Townsend mole (Scapanus townsendii) in Washington and Oregon and the broad-handed mole (Scapanus latimanus) in California are {{considered}} economically important. Damage in agricultural areas is caused by mole mounds and burrow systems which reduce pasture production, make harvesting difficult by breaking or plugging machinery, contaminate hay and silage thus, retarding proper curing, contribute to soil erosion and make ready-made homes for invading meadow mice, pocket gophers, and other rodent pests. Moles also damage lawns, gardens, flower beds and occasionally eat or destroy valuable seeds and bulbs. Control methods reviewed include traps, poisoned baits, gases, soil fumigants, natural enemies, and miscellaneous methods such as <b>mole</b> wheels, <b>mole</b> <b>plants,</b> nest digging, and flooding...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the failed}} Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings of 1927, the Communists {{began to focus}} on {{establishing}} a series of rural bases of operation in southern China. Even before moving to Jiangxi, Zhou had become involved in the politics of these bases. Mao, claiming the need to eliminate counterrevolutionaries and Anti-Bolsheviks operating within the CCP, began an ideological purge of the populace inside the Jiangxi Soviet. Zhou, perhaps due to his own success <b>planting</b> <b>moles</b> within various levels of the KMT, agreed that an organized campaign to uncover subversion was justified, and supported the campaign as de facto leader of the CCP.|$|R

40|$|The espionage {{activity}} {{by both sides}} during the Spanish Civil War is the missing dimension of the conflict, given its crucial importance. Both Nationalists and Republicans used intelligence to frustrate arm dealings of their enemies in foreign countries, <b>planted</b> <b>moles</b> on the enemy HQs or used decrypted radio messages to know their intentions. The improvisation of various intelligence services in competition during the first months gave place to a process of unity and centralization. The Germans and Italians supervised the Francoists while the Russians {{did the same with}} the Republicans in the creation and development of SIM. During the Second World War Spain became the field of intense rivalry among Axis and Allied Intelligence Services and the stage of crucial operations...|$|R
50|$|Despite being dry at times, vernal pools teem {{with life}} when filled. The most obvious {{inhabitants}} are various species of breeding frogs and toads. Some salamanders also utilize vernal pools for reproduction, but the adults may visit the pool only briefly. Other notable inhabitants are Daphnia and fairy shrimp, the latter {{often used as}} an indicator species to decisively define a vernal pool. Other indicator species, at least in New England, are the wood frog, the spadefoot toad, and some species of <b>mole</b> salamanders. Certain <b>plant</b> species are also associated with vernal pools, although the particular species depend upon the ecological region. The flora of South African vernal pools, for example, {{are different from those}} of Californian vernal pools, and they have characteristic Anostraca, such as various Branchipodopsis species. In some northern areas, tadpole shrimp are more common.|$|R
5000|$|... "According to the Director of Central Intelligence, Bob Gates, {{at least}} 20 nations from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America are {{involved}} in intelligence activities that are detrimental to our economic interests. Some of the specific cases are shocking. According to a recent New York Times article by Peter Schweizer, `between 1987 and 1989, French intelligence <b>planted</b> <b>moles</b> in several <b>U.S.</b> companies, including IBM. In the fall of 1991, a French intelligence team attempted to steal `stealth' technology from Lockheed.' Other accounts report that French intelligence units conduct 10 to 15 break-ins every day at large hotels in Paris to copy documents that belong to businessmen, journalists, and diplomats. According to other accounts, the French have been hiding listening devices on Air France flights in order to pick up useful economic information from business travelers.|$|R
5000|$|Constitutional Modernisation {{has come}} to the {{forefront}} of politics recently {{with the collapse of the}} now defunct Euro Bank Corporation in 2003. The prosecution in the trial was forced to reveal that the British Government had <b>planted</b> <b>moles</b> (and used wire taps) throughout the banking industry using MI6, with the consent of the Governor. This caused the trial's collapse, and subsequent release of those charged with wrongdoing. Along with this, the only mole that was known at the time was allowed to leave the country, never to answer for what he (or the United Kingdom) was doing. This infuriated the elected members of the Legislative Assembly as they maintained that the Governor and the United Kingdom had put into question the Cayman Islands' reputation as a tightly regulated offshore jurisdiction. Some saw this as the United Kingdom meddling in the territory's affairs to benefit itself (and the EU), at the expense of the islands' economy.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2001, Kalugin {{testified at}} the espionage trial of George Trofimoff, a retired Colonel of the United States Army Reserve who {{was charged with}} spying for the KGB during the 1970s and '80s. Upon being asked whether he knew {{the name of the}} <b>U.S.</b> {{military}} intelligence <b>mole</b> codenamed [...] "Markiz," [...] Kalugin responded [...] "Yes. I did. His name was George Trofimoff." [...] Kalugin testified that Metropolitan bishop Iriney (Susemihl), the Russian Orthodox hierarch of Austria, had recruited Trofimoff into the service of the KGB. Kalugin further described having invited the Metropolitan to visit his dacha in 1978. According to Kalugin [...] "He did good work, particularly in recruiting Markiz. I wanted to thank him for what he had done." [...] Kalugin further described his own meeting with Col. Trofimoff at a location in Austria. When asked his reasons for testifying, Kalugin explained that, as a resident alien, he was trying to obey American law. After the case went to the jury, Col. Trofimoff was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|After 1954-55, when {{relations}} between Egypt and the Soviet Union drastically improved, the SSIS was intensively {{trained by the}} Soviet State Security apparatus on political suppression, infiltration, public surveillance, public intimidation, and coercive interrogation. State Security officers {{were sent to the}} Soviet Union to undergo training under the KGB. After 1963, Egyptian State Security officers were sent to Algeria, Syria, Yemen and Iraq to train the newly formed state security agencies of the Baathist and nationalist regimes of those countries. In the 1960s, the SSIS forged new ties with the State Security apparatus of East Germany, which took SSIS competence against political subversion to an extremely competent level. Recruits were carefully screened and {{selected on the basis of}} political reliability, and practicing Muslims were virtually barred during the Nasser era. Officers were mostly recruited from the military and the regular Police, who had proven their political reliability. Candidates had to be recommended by loyal Police officers and serving State Security officers. During the Sadat and Mubarak eras, the agency continued its focus on radical Islamists but eased up on the suppression of the Liberal opposition. The SSIS excelled in <b>planting</b> <b>moles</b> and infiltrators within Islamist groups, a practice that would later be carried out with ruthless efficiency by the agency's trainees in Algeria and Syria. Torture was rampantly used during interrogation. Detainees were regularly beaten to death, and sexual penetration was used as a form of torture against Islamist detainees. The agency came to be regarded as professionally competent and capable by Western counter-terror agencies.|$|R
5000|$|In Mission: Impossible 2, Hunt {{recruits}} Luther (along with IMF Agent Billy Baird) to {{help stop}} Sean Ambrose, a former IMF agent, from unleashing a deadly virus (code-named, [...] "Chimera" [...] after the mythological beast) upon Sydney, Australia. This time around, Luther utilizes GPS tracking satellites {{to keep tabs}} on Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a GPS-bugged <b>mole</b> they have <b>planted</b> inside of Ambrose's complex. As the mission progresses, Ethan enlists Nyah to lift a memory card containing information on the virus from Ambrose's jacket so that Luther can analyze the virus and its capabilities. Luther also provides Ethan with an entrance to a biological lab in the city of Sydney through a jammed-open vent on the roof by hacking into the building's computer-controlled electronics system. During the infiltration of the building, however, Luther is nearly killed when one of Ambrose's men plants a bomb {{on the underside of the}} van Luther is using as an observation station in an attempt to trap Ethan in the building without a second pair of eyes to get him out. Luther manages to escape just in time with only some cuts and bruises but finds that his main laptop is damaged in the bombing and that the rest of his computer equipment has been destroyed. After repairing it, he eventually assists Ethan in infiltrating an island complex where Nyah has been tracked and Ambrose is selling the virus. Luther helps Ethan find his way around once the fight moves above ground but backs off when the helicopter he's in comes under fire by Ambrose's troops. He eventually injects Nyah with the cure to the virus (symbolically named, [...] "Bellerophon" [...] after the Greek hero who managed to slay the Chimera according to myth) and helps Ethan escort her safely away from Ambrose.|$|R
