5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a <b>urethane</b> plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at Farmitalia soon {{discovered}} that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes {{in the structure of}} the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl <b>urethane,</b> and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{saturated}} hydrocarbon based <b>urethanes</b> was prepared and characterized for hydrolytic and oxidative stability.

The alkane based materials absorbed little or no water and were reversion resistant. There was little loss in hardness or weight when exposed to high temperature and humidity. Dielectric properties were excellent and suffered little adverse effects from the high temperature/humidity conditions. The alkane based <b>urethanes</b> were not degraded by ozone exposure...|$|R

5|$|The Batsuit {{consisted}} of 110 separate pieces, {{each of which}} had to be replicated dozens of times {{over the course of the}} production. The base layer was made of a polyester mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible <b>urethane</b> were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since The Dark Knight.|$|E

40|$|Segmented poly(ester <b>urethanes)</b> were {{synthesized}} from oligomeric {{cellulose triacetate}} diols, poly(caprolactone) diols, and 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate. The {{effects of the}} molecular mass and structure of soft and hard segments of poly(ester <b>urethanes)</b> on their thermal behavior, mechanical properties, and degradation in aqueous solutions of a phosphate buffer were studied by DSC and IR spectroscopy. The combination of soft segments derived from poly(caprolactone) diols with M = (1. 0 – 3. 5) × 103, hard segments based on depolymerized cellulose triacetate with M = (2 – 4) × 103, and 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate {{makes it possible to}} synthesize poly(ester <b>urethanes)</b> with excellent mechanical characteristics. The degree of crystallinity of these polymers increases with a decrease in the molecular mass of the depolymerized cellulose triacetate block in the hard segment. As the soft segment lengthens, phase separation between domains of soft and hard segments becomes more pronounced. Upon incorporation of poly(ethylene glycol) blocks into the soft segments of poly(ester <b>urethanes),</b> their hydrophobicity is enhanced and biodegradability is accelerated...|$|R

25|$|In 1981 Ebonite began {{manufacturing}} {{the very}} first <b>urethane</b> cover stock bowling balls and sold the rights to AMF. Ebonite produced AMF balls at that time. Ebonite {{did not believe that}} bowlers would pay the $80.00 price this new technology would demand. That ball became the AMF Angle and this one coverstock change allowed the ball to get a better grip on the <b>urethane</b> finishes used on natural wood lane surfaces, which changed the nature of the bowling game significantly. Then in 1991, Nu-Line Industries produced the X-Calibur, a reactive resin cover. Part-time professional Steve Cooper was the owner and president of the corporation. But production lagged in the early days, allowing firms like Storm, Brunswick and Columbia to enter the reactive market by the following summer. The race to create more and more dynamic balls was on.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet honored California beach resorts {{once again}} by naming the top Chevelle series Laguna with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply Deluxe.
