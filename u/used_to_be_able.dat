5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which people <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to see in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E

But when McCall was appointed the new manager in June 2007, Wetherall was reinstated as club captain for the 2007–08 season. On 20 February 2008 he announced the 2007–08 season {{would be his last}} as a player, although Bradford City would keep his registration, and instead he would join the club's coaching staff. Wetherall said: [...] "I was becoming increasingly frustrated at not being able {{to do the things that}} I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do. Situations I would normally deal with comfortably were suddenly becoming a struggle." [...] Bradford fans held a special day to celebrate Wetherall's career, when they took banners and wore fancy dress and laboratory coats during the club's 1–1 draw with Rotherham United on 22 March 2008. In his penultimate month as a footballer, Wetherall was also named the League Two fans' player of the month by the Professional Footballers' Association. He played his final game for Bradford against Wycombe Wanderers on 3 May 2008 in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E

[...] The producer said that during recording he [...] "had to force my brain to fire different synapses" [...] to remember {{how to deal with the}} analog equipment and the lack of a digital display. One of the habits Vig had to call back was editing using a razor blade—"I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do 20 edits in half an hour if need be. It took me about 20 minutes to do the first edit!"—a technique he employed for the first songs recorded. Eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and punch out tapes instead, as the process was time-consuming and a more editable tape sent to Vig from Smart Studios was mostly ruined by one of Grohl's daughters. While many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded, the only song that had to be redone from scratch was [...] "I Should Have Known", as Grohl felt Vig was [...] "trying to make this into a radio single" [...] when the singer wanted it [...] "to sound really raw and primal".|$|E

Tactical running in cricket rarely strays beyond the consideration of [...] "can I {{make it to the}} other end before the ball does". One exception of this is towards the end of a closely fought limited overs game, where a batsman (normally a tail-ender) would sacrifice his wicket to allow the better batsman to remain on strike, usually in the last few balls. While in baseball, steals, sacrificial running, forces, double plays, intimidation, and physical contact enter into the equation.|$|E
