2500|$|The Hanging (The Suspended) Church [...] {{is named}} for its {{location}} above a gatehouse of Babylon Fortress, the Roman fortress in Coptic Cairo (Old Cairo); its nave is suspended over a passage. The church is approached by twenty-nine steps; early travelers to Cairo dubbed it [...] "the Staircase Church." [...] The land surface has risen by some six metres since the Roman period so that the Roman tower is mostly buried below ground, reducing the visual impact of the church's elevated position. The entrance from the street is through iron gates under a pointed stone arch. The nineteenth-century facade with twin bell towers is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard decorated with modern art biblical designs. <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> through the entrance is a further small courtyard leading to the eleventh-century outer porch.|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E
60|$|Carter went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> without pausing {{informed}} him {{of what had}} happened.|$|E
60|$|He leaped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> <b>and</b> was in <b>the</b> room. Her mother {{appeared}} in the inner doorway, large and hostile.|$|R
60|$|Louisa came grimly over <b>the</b> field, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{verandah}} <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> into <b>the</b> {{room without}} knocking.|$|R
60|$|However, {{there is}} no need to tell how many cross and quarrelsome things the two tired friends said to each other. They were sitting on {{opposite}} sides of the fire, one very gloomy, and the other very pettish, when the waggonette stopped at the gate, to put out Miss Hacket and take up Dolores. Hands pulled her <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> <b>and</b> a hubbub of merry voices received her in the dark.|$|R
60|$|Francine was {{the first}} to {{discover}} him. She darted <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> held out her hand.|$|E
60|$|Then he ran lightly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> they {{remained}} {{seated in the}} launch until he returned.|$|E
60|$|They went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure scanned {{books on}} the hawker's cart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little gipsy! I'll settle her," [...] muttered the old man, bustling <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> ringing <b>the</b> bell, as if {{the house}} was on fire.|$|R
6000|$|The two {{brothers}} ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> verandah <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> were soon {{seated at a}} light bamboo stand, with the backgammon-board between them. As they were setting their men, Alfred said, ...|$|R
60|$|The decipherer of the {{coat-of-arms}} had ventured <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>step,</b> <b>and,</b> shrinking back immediately, {{pale and}} tremulous, affirmed that the torch {{was held by}} the very image of old Cæsar.|$|R
60|$|She ran lightly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> {{waved her}} hand. He watched her {{pass through the}} doors into the hotel.|$|E
60|$|With sudden resolve Louise sprang <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> {{approached}} her. Any woman, she felt, in this emergency, was {{a welcome}} refuge.|$|E
60|$|The attendant, getting between Clennam and the carriage-door, {{with a sharp}} 'By your leave, sir!' bundled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> {{they drove}} away.|$|E
60|$|Theodosia {{went out}} and stood looking inscrutably on, while Wesley and Irving hoisted the trunk into the wagon and tied it. Then Wesley came <b>up</b> <b>the</b> porch <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> looked at her.|$|R
60|$|He stood <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>step</b> <b>and</b> {{she kissed}} him quickly. The train started, and Miss Wilkinson sank {{into the corner of}} her {{carriage}} and wept disconsolately. Philip, as he walked back to the vicarage, felt a distinct sensation of relief.|$|R
6000|$|Ebbo {{was alone}} till nearly {{the end of}} the supper below stairs. He had been dozing, when a {{cautious}} tread came <b>up</b> <b>the</b> turret <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> he started, and called out, [...] "Who goes there? I am not asleep." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then he made}} {{a flying}} leap from the carriage, rushed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> gave his aunt such a hug as made her gasp for breath.|$|E
60|$|How he did it, {{she never}} knew; but Mac had her <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> on the parlour sofa {{before she could}} put her foot to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} charmed. But won't you miss your train?" [...] said Dorian Gray, languidly, {{as he passed}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> opened the door with his latch-key.|$|E
60|$|Tavernake, {{instead of}} obeying his first impulse and {{making his way}} direct to the Milan Court, walked to the flat in Kingsway, climbed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> asked for Beatrice. She met him at her own door, fully dressed.|$|R
60|$|My {{companion}} took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> candle, <b>and</b> <b>stepping</b> to <b>the</b> bedside, he drew {{apart the}} curtains.|$|R
60|$|And {{with the}} {{exchange}} of a kiss, the two good women set themselves to practical pounds, shillings, and pence, which was just concluded when the patter of feet <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> voices in <b>the</b> hall announced the return of Mrs. Best's boarders.|$|R
60|$|A familiar, light-moccasined tread sounded on the path, a tall figure loomed up {{from the}} darkness; it came up the path, passed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> crossed the threshold.|$|E
60|$|They {{supported}} her <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> found a chair {{for her in}} the hall. She was white almost to the lips, but she struggled bravely to keep consciousness.|$|E
60|$|He {{watched the}} old man’s still strong figure {{as it passed}} slowly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> {{allowing}} him to get some little distance start, cautiously followed. He followed him <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> along the cliff, the figure in front never halting until it reached a small court {{at the back of}} a livery stable; then, heedless of the small shadow, now very close behind, it pushed open the door of a dirty little house and entered. The shadow crept up and paused irresolute, and then, after a careful survey of the place, stole silently and swiftly away.|$|E
60|$|Lalaperu {{brought out}} the glasses and {{cigarettes}} and the eternal whisky and soda, and before the five minutes were past the gate clicked and Christian Young, tawny and golden, gentle of voice and look and hand, came <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bungalow <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> joined them.|$|R
60|$|I {{gathered}} from this fellow's exclamation {{that he was}} divided between amaze and mirth. Then he got <b>up</b> from <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> went into <b>the</b> restaurant and {{was followed by the}} man called Jim. Before the door was closed he made another remark, but it was unintelligible to me.|$|R
6000|$|The Haydocks {{saw them}} laboring <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{slippery}} concrete walk, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> perilous front <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> came to <b>the</b> door chanting: ...|$|R
60|$|Valise in hand, {{he climbed}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> entered {{one of the}} cars. He had hardly time to reach a window seat, and wave a parting adieu, when the train moved off.|$|E
60|$|Wildeve slowly went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> {{descended into}} the {{darkness}} on the other side; and as he walked he glanced back, till the bank blotted out her form from his further view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough," [...] he said almost roughly. [...] "I {{pray that}} Allah may send me counsel in the night." [...] And upon that he stalked past her, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> so into the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I {{had better}} go in alone," [...] {{suggested}} Dick. [...] "If I need you I'll whistle or wave my handkerchief;" [...] {{and then he}} ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> front <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> rang <b>the</b> bell. A tall, angular woman, wearing large spectacles, soon answered his summons.|$|R
60|$|They {{had little}} trouble in going back, {{although}} the tunnel was so dark {{in places that}} they had to feel their way. But finally daylight could be seen ahead, and a few minutes later they scrambled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> squeezed through <b>the</b> little doorway.|$|R
60|$|He runs <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> between Caesar <b>and</b> Britannus to {{the coping}} of the parapet; springs into the air; and plunges head {{foremost}} into the sea.|$|R
