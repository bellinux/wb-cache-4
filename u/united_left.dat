5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} quicker {{of the two}} teams. Inside a minute, a miskick by Manchester <b>United</b> <b>left</b> back John Aston troubled his defence, and {{presented}} Reg Lewis and Rooke with shooting opportunities. After three minutes, Arsenal took the lead; combination play from Jimmy Logie and Bryn Jones forced goalkeeper Jack Crompton out of his area, and ended with Jones hitting the ball high into an empty net. Lewis headed in Archie Macaulay's cross from the right to double Arsenal's lead, and the team scored their third almost immediately, when Rooke maneuvered past the United defence to shoot past Crompton.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{performances}} in the 1968/69 cup competitions meant Liverpool had less fixture congestion than the previous season. They {{finished second in the}} 1968–69 Football League six points behind Leeds <b>United.</b> <b>Left</b> back, Gerry Byrne, retired after 333appearances and 12 seasons. Shankly started replacing ageing players in his squad, purchasing future captain Emlyn Hughes and goalkeeper Ray Clemence the season before. Tony Hateley joined for a club record fee of £96,000 from Chelsea, but transferred after a year to Coventry City after injury and poor form. Mid-season Shankly signed Alun Evans from Wolverhampton Wanderers for a then record £100,000 fee for a teenager. After a good start, Evans' career was curtailed by injuries.|$|E
5|$|The 2003–04 {{season was}} {{difficult}} for the club, and Gordon Strachan resigned in March. Higginbotham felt that his replacement, Paul Sturrock, was unable to handle the pressure at St Mary's, but denied press rumours that Sturrock had lost {{the confidence of the}} players. Steve Wigley took charge for 2004–05 and the club's decline continued. Wigley demoted Higginbotham to the reserves after following a falling out between the pair, though he soon reversed the decision and returned him to the first team. Harry Redknapp replaced Wigley as manager in December2004 but failed to arrest the decline, and Southampton were relegated in last place. Higginbotham had scored the equalising goal in the penultimate match of the season at Crystal Palace, but a final day defeat to Manchester <b>United</b> <b>left</b> Southampton two points from safety.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, UNITE HERE {{withdrew from}} the AFL-CIO and joined the Change to Win Federation, along with several other unions, {{including}} the Teamsters, SEIU and the UFCW. In May 2009, union president Bruce Raynor (originally from <b>UNITE)</b> <b>left</b> <b>UNITE</b> HERE, taking with him numerous local unions and between 105,000 and 150,000 members, mostly garment workers and a labor-owned bank, Amalgamated Bank. They formed a new Service Employees International Union (SEIU) affiliate called Workers United.|$|R
5|$|A shock came on 6 February, when Bill Shankly's Workington {{earned a}} 2–0 win at Borough Park – {{the only time}} in the season Vale lost by more than one goal. Seven days later Scunthorpe & Lindsey <b>United</b> <b>left</b> Vale Park with a point as the home side came close to finding the net on {{numerous}} occasions without success despite one shot from Hayward partially injuring goalkeeper Norman Malan after he struck the ball hard into Malan's jaw. Following this short run of poor form they next recorded a win against York City, securing a 1–0 victory at Bootham Crescent. On 27 February, Chesterfield became the first away side to score at Vale Park since September, as they fought back from a two-goal deficit to win a point. Vale had previously conceded just one goal in 20 home games over an 11-month period, and had last conceded twice in a home league game on 30 August 1952.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{the second}} Champions League season to feature clubs that had not won their {{national}} leagues the year before, Manchester United and Bayern Munich were the first such clubs to reach the final of the competition. Nevertheless, both went into the match as champions, having won their domestic leagues in 1998–99; Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title with a 1–1 draw against Hertha BSC on 9 May with three games to go, while Manchester <b>United</b> <b>left</b> it until {{the last day of the}} season (16 May), when they came back from 1–0 down against Tottenham Hotspur to win 2–1 and beat Arsenal to the title by a point. Both teams were also playing for the Treble; in addition to their league win, Manchester United had beaten Newcastle United in the 1999 FA Cup Final on 22 May to claim the Double, while Bayern were due to play Werder Bremen in the 1999 DFB-Pokal Final on 12 June.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} republican {{political}} parties {{on the national}} level. However, since the Spanish transition to democracy, only the <b>United</b> <b>Left,</b> {{and one of its}} component parties before its formation, the Communist Party of Spain, had representation in Parliament until 2011. In that year, the <b>United</b> <b>Left</b> was joined by EQUO as the two political parties with parliamentary representation that advocated a republic.

25|$|Spain's 314-day {{political}} stalemate {{ended with}} Mariano Rajoy's election as Prime Minister, {{after a period}} which {{saw some of the}} most dramatic political upheaval since the country's return to democracy: two inconclusive general elections, two failed investiture attempts, Podemos and <b>United</b> <b>Left</b> teaming up together, Pedro Sánchez's ouster as Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leader and his party torn apart by internal strife as it allowed the formation of a right-wing government {{for the first time in}} its history.|$|E

25|$|By Spanish Civil Code Art. 22.1, the {{government}} created concessions for gaining citizenship to nationals of several countries and Sephardi Jews historically linked with Spain, {{allowing them to}} seek citizenship after five years rather than the customary ten required for residence in Spain. Later it was dropped to two years. In November 2012, the residency requirement was eliminated completely. In October 2006, the Parliament of Andalusia asked the three parliamentary groups that form the majority to support an amendment that would similarly ease the way for nationals of Morisco descent to gain Spanish citizenship. The proposal was originally made by IULV-CA, the Andalusian branch of the <b>United</b> <b>Left.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{parallel}} {{process was}} one of increasing self-confidence and unity amongst the Lankan left-wing. In the parliament {{they were in the}} opposition. On May Day 1963 the three main left parties (LSSP, CP and MEP) held a massive joint rally. That was followed by the launching of <b>United</b> <b>Left</b> Front on 12 August, the tenth anniversary of the 1953 Hartal. ULF launched agitations on issues like bring down the prices of essential commodities. ULF represented an immediate threat to the governance of SLFP, and SLFP were not late in reacting to it. It began to offer the left parties ministerial posts and worked intensively to break the unity of ULF.|$|E
25|$|Back in Portugal, Cunhal {{took charge}} of the newly legalised PCP and led the party through the {{political}} upheavals which followed the revolution. He was minister without portfolio in several of the provisional governments which followed the revolution. A faction of army officers seen as aligned with the PCP dominated the post-revolutionary provisional governments, with pro-communist prime minister Vasco Gonçalves leading four provisional governments, bringing accusations that the PCP was attempting to take power via the military. Cunhal was largely responsible for the PCP's hardline attitude, particularly its hostility towards the Socialist Party led by Soares, which prevented the formation of a <b>united</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite Aznar's {{designation}} as PP candidate, {{the opposition}} remained divided and weak {{on the road}} to the 1989 election. This, coupled with a buoyant economy, made a new PSOE victory inevitable. The electoral campaign, thus, focused on whether the Socialists would be able to maintain their absolute majority on the Congress of Deputies for a third term in office. <b>United</b> <b>Left</b> had also appointed a new leader, Julio Anguita, and had high expectations to increase their parliamentary representation from the 7 seats they had won in 1986. During the campaign, Felipe González pledged that this would be the last time he would stand for the office of Prime Minister. He would eventually stand for two more elections, until 1996.|$|E
