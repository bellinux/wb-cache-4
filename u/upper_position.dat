2500|$|The General Electric Central Fire Control {{system on}} the B-29 {{directed}} four remotely controlled turrets armed with two [...]50 Browning M2 machine guns each. All weapons were aimed optically with targeting computed by analog electrical instrumentation. There were five interconnected sighting stations located in the nose and tail positions and three Plexiglas blisters in the central fuselage. Five General Electric analog computers (one dedicated to each sight) increased the weapons' accuracy by compensating for factors such as airspeed, lead, gravity, temperature and humidity. The computers also allowed a single gunner to operate two or more turrets (including tail guns) simultaneously. The gunner in the <b>upper</b> <b>position</b> acted as fire control officer, managing the distribution of turrets among the other gunners during combat. The tail position initially had two [...]50 Browning machine guns and a single M2 20 mm cannon. Later aircraft had the 20mm cannon removed, and sometimes replaced by a third machine gun.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mechanism}} was operated {{from the}} top level. For a descent, the box was first wound into its <b>upper</b> <b>position</b> using a double rack-and-pinion mechanism, then drawn tightly against {{the frame of the}} opening using a ratchet mounted {{on the top of the}} wall. The outer door was then drawn up with another rack-and-pinion. At this point the water levels in the top pound and inside the box would have been roughly equal, but as the inner door [...] – the box door – swung outwards horizontally (like a normal single lock gate) it would not open if the outer level was to any extent higher. A small equalising cock was therefore provided. The door was opened, the boat was floated in, the doors closed and the ratchet released. Because the entering boat would displace its weight of water back into the pound, the total weight of the box was always the same and no great endeavour was needed to wind it up and down. However, the operators could release a little water into the box to assist the descent. Water pressure against the outward-opening doors kept them firmly closed and watertight.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the table}} lifts the {{remaining}} pins, the machine runs the sweep, clearing dead pins from the pin deck, then {{returns to the}} guard position. Ball and pins travel on a continuously running carpet belt {{at the bottom of}} the pit. The ball, being heavier, travels to one of the side kick-backs where it enters the ball return, shared by adjacent lanes. The pins travel under the cushion into the ring-shaped, revolving circular pin elevator, at the rear center of the unit, which brings the pins up to a [...] "distributor arm" [...] that travels laterally as well as forward and back (on the 82-30, [...] governs the distributor's head piece movements) over the table , to deliver the pins to the corresponding bins or [...] "spotting cups" [...] as known in the 82-30's factory manuals, awaiting the next spotting cycle. In the 82-30, its semi-cylindrical [...] "spotting cup" [...] bins are part of the visible spotting table (unique to the design of the 82-30) suspended below the table's frame, each at a roughly a 45° angle with each [...] "cup" [...] inclined, pin-base-forward, in front of each spotting cell, and clearly visible to the bowler whenever the table approaches its lowermost position. After the table returns to its <b>upper</b> <b>position,</b> the sweep also lifts, and the machine shuts down to await the next ball. For spotting the new rack of pins, the 82-30 version tilts the pin-filled spotting cups vertically as the table descends, and tilts the cups slightly rearwards [...] to clear the new rack of pins just as the table starts upwards, leaving the new rack of pins spotted on the lane for the next frame.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was; to compare sugar content and {{composition}} in buds of four in Sweden commercially grown grapevine cultivars (‘Kerner’, ‘Regent’, ‘Rondo’ and ‘Solaris’), at three different vineyards in Scania and try to investigate the relationship between sugar content and cold hardiness. The concentration of fructose, glucose, sucrose, raffinose and stachyose was determined in the lower positioned buds, 2 - 8 and <b>upper</b> <b>positioned</b> buds, 9 - 14 of the grapevine shoots with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The cultivar ‘Solaris’ seems to be more cold tender than ‘Kerner’, ‘Regent’ and ‘Rondo’ when comparing the ratio of fructose and glucose to sucrose. This ratio is strongly related to cold hardiness in Vitis vinifera grapevine cultivars. The ratio increases as the two monosaccharides fructose and glucose accumulates. No clear difference in the ratio could be seen between the other cultivars. Lower positioned buds showed a higher ratio than <b>upper</b> <b>positioned</b> buds, significantly in {{more than half of the}} observations (53. 3 %). Differences between vineyards showed no clear patterns when comparing the ratio. This is probably because of differences in many cultural practices that may influence cold hardiness such as choice of rootstock, fertilisation strategy, temperature in the vineyard, and occurrence of diseases. No correlation was found between the temperature on the sampling day and the mean temperature five days preceding sampling and sugar concentration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesThe {{increased}} {{intraocular pressure}} (IOP) - which decreases perfusion {{pressure on the}} optic nerve - increases by prone positioning (1). The aim of our study was to compare the effect of head rotation 45 ° laterally in prone position on the increase in IOP of upper placed and lower placed eyes in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). MethodsForty-five patients were randomly divided into 2 Groups. IOP of the patients were recorded bilaterally in supine position before the operation had started. Patients were turned to prone position. The head was placed on a prone headrest without external direct compression to both eyes. Patients in Group I were kept in strictly neutral prone position where as patients in Group II were placed prone with their heads rotated 45 ° laterally to the right side. At {{the end of the}} operation, patients were turned to supine position and their IOP was measured immediately. ResultsThere was no difference related to demographics, duration of surgery, blood loss and fluid input data. IOP values after surgery in prone position increased significantly compared to preoperative values in both groups (p < 0. 05). After surgery in prone position IOP values of the <b>upper</b> <b>positioned</b> eyes in Group II were significantly lower than Group I and lower positioned eyes in Group II (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Spatial variabillity of soil nitrogen(N) {{dynamics}} {{was examined}} along a slope in a 45 -year-old Cryptomeria japonica D. Don plantation {{in the southeastern}} paet of Shiga Prefecture. Net N mineralization showed no clear gradient along the slope, while net nitrification and percent nitrification were high at lower positions,and very low at <b>upper</b> <b>positions</b> of the slope. Principal component(PC) analysis showed soil properties were divided into three groups which were PC 1 (water content and pH), and PC 3 (total C and N). Regressions of net soil N transformations against PCs scores suggested net N mincralization was mainly regulated by PC 3, while net nitrification and percent nitrification were mainly regulated by PC 1 and PC 2. The difference in the main form of inorganic N was expected to affect soil N availability for plants through {{the difference in the}} mobility in negatively changed forest soil. We evaluated the soil N availability that reflebted the ion mobility factors by ion exchange resins and found that greater mobility of nitrate lead to greater soil N availability at lower positions of the slope. In addition, gross N transformations were directly measured using 15 N isotope dilution, and the influence of microbial caebon (C) availability on the internal soil N cycles were examined by long-term laboratory incubation. Gross nitrifivation was detected in both soils taken at <b>upper</b> and lower <b>positions</b> on the slope, suggesting that nitrification was also an important process at <b>upper</b> <b>positions</b> where almost no net nitrification was detected. Changes in net and gross N transformations, the organic C and N pools, and microbial respiration suggested that start of rapid net nitrifibation might be affected not only by the availability of C for microbial biomass, but also by the relative availability of C and N...|$|R
