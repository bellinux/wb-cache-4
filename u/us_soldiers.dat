5|$|Four <b>U.S.</b> <b>{{soldiers}}</b> {{were killed}} {{within the first}} 20 minutes of the battle, another died later, and at least three others were wounded. Three times teams of soldiers from the main base ran through Taliban fire to resupply the observation post and carry back the dead and wounded.|$|E
5|$|In a November 2004 Zogby International poll of 987 people, 79% of {{respondents}} thought the U.S. chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> who {{were affected by}} the toxic chemical used {{during the war in}} Vietnam. Also, 51% said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 1890, the Wounded Knee Massacre {{occurred}} on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Lakota Sioux Nation, the massacre resulted {{in the deaths of}} at least 146 Sioux, many of them women and children. 31 <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> were also killed in the conflict.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{details of}} the {{massacre}} are sketchy, {{and based on the}} accounts of four <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> who survived the event. Three captured North Korean soldiers were pointed out by the survivors as participants in the killings, and these three also gave conflicting accounts of what happened.|$|E
5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through the floorboards. Subsequently, just before touch down, Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little directional control, the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped completely, the five-man crew got out as quickly as they could. About 20 minutes later, <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers.</b> Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the loadmaster was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying to maintain order.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00 on 12 May, U.S. commanders on {{the ground}} in Khâm Đức were {{notified}} of Westmoreland's decision to evacuate all military personnel, both American and Vietnamese, as well as their civilian dependents. However, most army units {{on the ground}} were left uninformed about the decision, and it led to chaos later when evacuation was underway. During the predawn hours of 12 May, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division continued to increase their pressure on the main compound of the Special Forces Camp. The North Vietnamese made final preparations for the main assault by capturing one mountain outpost at a time, which were manned by <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the Americal Division, who had placed machine-guns around the main camp as advanced defensive positions. At 04:23, <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> reported that outpost number 1 had been overrun, and fighter-bombers were scrambled in an attempt to save it. About 30 minutes later, the defenders of outpost number 7 reported that their position had been surrounded. They attempted to hold their position by calling on an AC-47 gunship to fire directly into their position, in order to stop the attack, but soon afterwards outpost 7 succumbed to the North Vietnamese and the defenders retreated back to Khâm Đức.|$|E

5|$|Commanded by General Henry Atkinson, the U.S. troops {{tracked the}} British Band. Militia under Colonel Henry Dodge {{caught up with}} the British Band on July 21 and {{defeated}} them at the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Black Hawk's band was weakened by hunger, death, and desertion and many native survivors retreated towards the Mississippi. On August 2, <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> attacked the remnants of the British Band at the Battle of Bad Axe, killing many or capturing most who remained alive. Black Hawk and other leaders escaped, but later surrendered and were imprisoned for a year.|$|E
5|$|Dean's small force {{eventually}} {{made it out}} of the city past several North Korean roadblocks. Just outside the city Dean stopped his jeep to tend to several wounded <b>US</b> <b>soldiers</b> in a wrecked truck in the ditch. However, as they attempted to escape further they ran into another North Korean roadblock and were forced to continue on foot, crossing the Taejon River and climbing a nearby mountain. In the confusion, Dean was separated from the group.|$|E
5|$|Flying Tiger Line Flight 739 was a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation propliner {{chartered}} by the United States {{military that}} disappeared on March 16, 1962, over the Western Pacific Ocean. The aircraft was transporting 93 <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> and 3 South Vietnamese from Travis Air Force Base, California to Saigon, Vietnam. After refueling at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, the Super Constellation {{was en route}} to Clark Air Base in the Philippines when it disappeared.

5|$|On 10 May, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, was ambushed by a {{much larger}} North Vietnamese force in the Se San Valley. Eight <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> were killed and 28 wounded. Among the killed was Spc. Leslie Sabo, Jr. (posthumously {{promoted}} to sergeant), who was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but the paperwork went missing until 1999. Sabo was awarded the Medal of Honor on 16 May 2012 by President Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|Prevented by treaty from invading the Holy See's embassy, <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{erected a}} {{perimeter}} around the Nunciature. Psychological warfare {{was used in}} an attempt to dislodge him, including blaring rock music, and turning a nearby field into a helicopter landing zone. After ten days of Operation Nifty Package, Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990. He was detained as a prisoner of war, and later taken to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Starting in fall 1942, {{large numbers}} of Soviet {{soldiers}} arrived in Fairbanks {{to work with the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> already in the town. The massive Lend-Lease effort required additional facilities to be built in and near Fairbanks. Ladd Field expanded in size, and the grounds of the U.S. Army post expanded until it met the city limits of Fairbanks. The University of Alaska, which saw most of its students taken up by the draft, provided office and dormitory space for U.S. and Soviet soldiers. Its professors also contributed to the war effort with specially created Russian language classes. Russian airmen were regular customers of Fairbanks stores, and they bought large amounts of consumer goods unavailable at home. To meet demand when Ladd Field was unusable due to fog, an airfield now known as Eielson Air Force Base was built southeast of Fairbanks. Although there were some conflicts between Soviet and <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> and civilians, Lend-Lease operations in Fairbanks continued {{through the end of the}} war, and when Lend-Lease ended in September 1945, 7,926 aircraft and tons of cargo had been transferred to Soviet officials in Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|The National Parliament house, {{located on}} the hill above Hibiscus Avenue, built with American aid, is a {{concrete}} structure of conical-shape, which was inaugurated in 1993. The dome has exquisite tapestry, frescoes, and traditional artwork. The parliament building was built {{at a cost of}} US$5million in honour of the 450 <b>US</b> <b>soldiers</b> and 1,200 marines who died during the Guadalcanal operations during the war. Ironically the building was originally built by a Japanese firm.|$|E
5|$|The Taliban {{surrounded}} the remote base and its observation post, attacking it from Quam and surrounding farmland. They destroyed {{much of the}} U.S. heavy munitions, broke through American lines, and entered the main base before being repelled by artillery and aircraft. The United States claimed to have killed at least 21 Taliban fighters {{for the loss of}} nine <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> killed and 27 wounded, and four Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers wounded.|$|E
5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E

5|$|Following some fruitless negotiations, {{the women}} and {{children}} were allowed to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the War Office and the Office of Works held discussions on how to manage the castle. In 1908, Portland was placed onto what was known as the Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would {{continue}} to use and manage the historic property, but with input on repairs from the Office of Works. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Portland Harbour became an important naval base and the castle was used an ordnance store. The castle became a military residence again in the interwar years, and during the Second World War it was used for accommodation and offices by British and <b>US</b> <b>soldiers,</b> with part of the castle used once again for storing ordnance. A concrete pillbox, since demolished, was constructed alongside the castle early on in the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth control}} {{movement}} received an unexpected boost during World War I, {{as a result}} of a crisis the U.S. military experienced when many of its soldiers were diagnosed with syphilis or gonorrhea. The military undertook an extensive education campaign, focusing on abstinence, but also offering some contraceptive guidance.Tone, pp. 91–115 contains a history of contraception in the U.S. military in World War I. Navy secretary Josephus Daniels led the efforts to enforce abstinence. The military, under pressure from purity advocates, did not distribute condoms, or even endorse their use, making the U.S. the only military force in World War I that did not supply condoms to its troops. When <b>U.S.</b> <b>soldiers</b> were in Europe, they found rubber condoms readily available, and when they returned to America, they continued to use condoms as their preferred method of birth control.|$|E
