500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, reserves, public {{recreation}} {{areas and}} drainage sites were {{set aside in}} western Hamersley, and facilities were erected in quick succession – the 1st Hamersley Scout Group in 1973, the colonial-style Holy Cross Anglican Church in 1974, and a community hall at Aintree Street in 1975. Residents in the region were at this time {{on the fringe of}} Perth's suburban area, relying on partly built main roads, distant shopping centres and overstretched local facilities for several years after the suburb's construction. A locally produced fortnightly newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, started in early 1973 by Peter Flanigan, from his home in Manton Court, covering the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood, with the open aim of helping to form community associations and campaign for better facilities. A July 1973 article, for example, lamented that [...] "work on Erindale Road appears to have come to a standstill... great piles of dirt and <b>unmade</b> <b>road</b> surfaces bear testimony to the fact that something is going on, or should be going on, but this one is taking a very long time." ...|$|E
60|$|Jongejuffrouw Beresteyn {{followed}} {{rapidly in}} the wake of her lanthorn bearers and keeping Maria--who was always timorous on dark nights and in lonely places--quite close to her elbow. Every footstep of the way was familiar to her. Now the ground was frozen hard and the covering of snow crisp beneath her feet as she walked, but in the autumn and the spring the mud here was ankle-deep, save on one or two rare spots in front of the better houses or public buildings where a few stones formed a piece of dry pavement. Such a spot was the front of the Oudenvrouwenhuis with its wide oaken gateway and high brick walls. The <b>unmade</b> <b>road</b> here was always swept neatly and tidily; during the rainy seasons the mud was washed carefully away and in the winter it was kept free from snow.|$|E

However, these bikes {{are harder to}} ride on <b>unmade</b> <b>roads,</b> which may limit route options. For some, the advantages of a recumbent bicycle are particularly relevant to touring.|$|R
60|$|One should not, {{and we knew}} it. One {{should never}} enter into these {{southern}} towns that look so nice, so lovely, from the outside. However, {{we thought we would}} buy some cakes. So we crossed the avenue which looks so beautiful from the sea, and which, when you get into it, is a cross between an outside place where you throw rubbish and a humpy <b>unmade</b> <b>road</b> in a raw suburb, with a few iron seats, and litter of old straw and rag. Indescribably dreary in itself: yet with noble trees, and lovely sunshine, and the sea and the islands gleaming magic beyond the harbour mouth, and the sun, the eternal sun full focussed. A few mangy, nothing-to-do people stand disconsolately about, in southern fashion, {{as if they had been}} left there, water-logged, by the last flood, and were waiting for the next flood to wash them further. Round the corner along the quay a Norwegian steamer dreams that she is being loaded, in the muddle of the small port.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the early}} 1950s, when {{residential}} development commenced in the area, Warrigal Road formed {{the boundary of}} suburban development, with market gardens, poultry farms and <b>unmade</b> <b>roads</b> to the east. The new dwellings constructed at this time were typically double-fronted cream brick houses. By 1951 the population of Ashwood had risen to an estimated 1500 persons.|$|R
50|$|Cooktown Cemetery is a 9.72 hectare reserve {{situated}} approximately 1.7 km southwest {{from the}} centre of town. The reserve fronts the Cooktown-McIvor River Road (formerly the Palmer Road) to the southeast, and gazetted but <b>unmade</b> <b>roads</b> form its northern and southern boundaries. On the west it is bounded by a local government reserve for slaughtering purposes, and on the east by freehold land.

50|$|On 28 May 1881, Keith-Falconer went cycle-touring through Oxford, Pangbourne and Harrow, {{a warm-up}} to his Land's End - John o'Groats ride, that started on 4 June. Riding {{from one end}} of Britain to the other was, in the 19th century, a journey of poor or <b>unmade</b> <b>roads,</b> riding a high-wheeled bicycle with {{precarious}} balance and poor brakes. It demanded good weather. When it did not come, Keith-Falconer left Penzance after four days and returned to London and Cambridge.|$|R

50|$|Having been {{influenced}} in his teenage years by American {{rock and roll}} 45s and London jazz clubs, Stuart moved rapidly from working for society photographer Tom Hustler, to having his own Pimlico studio. Stuart's fashion shots were featured in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and the national press, and exhibited at the Hampstead and Kingsway Galleries. He also drove a customised Mini - with a tent on the roof - round the Mediterranean, on largely <b>unmade</b> <b>roads,</b> to photograph BP's oil installations.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Rover had become {{convinced}} {{a market for}} a more comfortable 4x4 existed {{in areas such as}} Africa and Australia, where ordinary motorists faced long journeys on <b>unmade</b> <b>roads</b> that called for four-wheel drive and tough suspension. In 1958 the first of the [...] "Road Rover" [...] development cars was built, combining the Land Rover's tenacity with the comfort of a Rover saloon car. Dubbed the [...] "Road Rover", it featured a Land Rover chassis and running gear clothed in a functional estate car-like body. It never made it into production.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court said}} that it was {{possible}} to interpret the expression [...] "driving" [...] as driving anywhere in the country and on any terrain, including passenger transportation on a public road. The reasonable reader, however, would probably not interpret it in this way, and so, in light of established interpretative canons, the court did not favour this interpretation. The word [...] "driving" [...] occurred in the context of other adventure activities; it therefore made better sense to understand it to entail driving over <b>unmade</b> <b>roads</b> or slippery, steep or otherwise exciting terrain. Since Drifter's, as a cross-border tour operator, was statutorily obliged to have passenger liability insurance, it would be perverse for it to have contracted out of this liability altogether.|$|R
5000|$|The {{world famous}} English author, D. H. Lawrence visited Thirroul in 1922 {{and wrote the}} novel Kangaroo about Australian fringe {{politics}} after the First World War whilst there. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, his house Wyewurk is the earliest Australian bungalow to show {{the influence of the}} Californian Bungalow style of architecture. He gave this description of the town... "…The town trailed down from the foot of the mountain towards the railway, a huddle of grey and red painted iron roofs. Then over the rail line towards the sea, it began again in a spasmodic fashion…. There were wide <b>unmade</b> <b>roads</b> running straight as to go nowhere, with little bungalow homes…..Then quite near the inland, rose a great black wall of mountain or cliff…..".|$|R
50|$|Dixter Halt was a {{short-lived}} halt {{station on the}} Kent and East Sussex Railway on an <b>unmade</b> <b>road</b> leading to Great Dixter house near Northiam in East Sussex. Opened in May 1981 it was used for occasional special services to and from Bodiam until the line from Northiam was finally reopened for regular passenger services to Bodiam in 2000.|$|E

50|$|The Mawson Trail {{traverses}} {{remote areas}} of the Mount Lofty and Flinders Ranges, mostly away from bitumen roads, and often off-road on tracks and <b>unmade</b> <b>road</b> or forest reserves.

25|$|The {{area was}} officially named St Kilda in 1841. The first sale of Crown lands in St Kilda {{took place on}} 7 December 1842. The first block was bought by James Ross Lawrence, who had been master of the Lady of St Kilda until 1842. Lawrence had now settled in Melbourne. His block was bounded by three <b>unmade</b> <b>roads.</b> One of these roads he named Acland Street after Thomas Acland, who had been his {{employer}} until 1840 but {{who had never been}} to Port Phillip District. The remaining two became Fitzroy Street and The Esplanade. (A plaque at the junction of Acland and Fitzroy Streets marks the site of the block.) By 1845, Lawrence had subdivided and sold the land on which he had built a cottage. The land on the sea-side of The Esplanade has continued to be Crown land.|$|R
50|$|In 1859 Albert Napper {{converted}} a small cottage into {{a hospital}} {{in the village of}} Cranleigh in Surrey. This hospital opened because Mr Napper was concerned that there were no local hospital facilities for the poor in the village. St Thomas’ Hospital was the nearest voluntary hospital and that was about 45 kilometres away on <b>unmade</b> <b>roads,</b> a dangerous journey for an ill person. The only other possibility for care was in a local workhouse infirmary but this was some 12 kilometres away in Guildford, had no trained nurses and carried the real (at that time) risk of the patient being stigmatized as a pauper. The third possibility was to stay at home; in those days and for poor people this condition is indicated by Horace Swete, a village surgeon in Wrington in Somerset, UK, in his book of 1870.|$|R

50|$|West End Cemetery, Townsville {{is located}} on the {{southern}} slope of Castle Hill and is bounded to the north by <b>unmade</b> <b>road</b> reserve (Francis Street), on the west by Church Street, on the south by a recreation reserve fronting Flinders Street West and residential allotments fronting Norman and Musgrave Streets, and on the east by a school reserve.|$|E
50|$|River Lily is a {{small stream}} that flows through Knutsford, England. It has been claimed {{that it is the}} {{smallest}} river in Europe.

Issues surrounding flood management strategies remain unresolved.|$|E
50|$|Rollo {{is reached}} by an <b>unmade</b> <b>road,</b> taking {{half an hour}} by {{motorbike}} or considerably longer in a vehicle, from the main N-S Kongoussi-Bourzanga road that links Ouagadougou {{to the north of}} the country.

50|$|In {{the early}} years of the nineteenth century, mineral {{extraction}} and smelting was a dynamic industry in West Cornwall, and the port of Hayle was well established. However the transport of heavy materials over imperfect <b>unmade</b> <b>roads</b> was a severe limitation. When the Redruth and Chasewater Railway was opened in 1826 (as a horse-drawn railway), it was immediately successful operationally and financially. This encouraged owners of mines and works not served by that line to promote a railway from Tresavean to Hayle, serving numerous other mines in between. Accordingly, the Hayle Railway Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 27 June 1834; the company was to have headquarters in London, and a share capital of £64,000, with authority to borrow £16,000 in debenture. A branch to Helston was included, but this was dropped in a second Act of 4 July 1836.|$|R
50|$|The horse-drawn {{coaches were}} {{originally}} {{imported from the}} United States and were known as the Concord Coach design. This design was a 'thorough-brace' or {{also known as a}} 'jack' style coach, characterized by an elegant curved lightweight body suspended on two large leather straps, which helped to isolate the passengers and driver from the jolts and bumps of the rough <b>unmade</b> country <b>roads.</b> Soon Australian coach builders using many of the Concord design features customized the design for Australian conditions.|$|R
50|$|A Mrs Simmonds ran a tiny {{sweet and}} food {{store in the}} ancient {{building}} opposite side of Church Hill to the White Horse, and a Spar shop and butchers were situated near to the Crown pub. All these operated through the early 1960s, closing one by one into the 1970s. Even <b>unmade</b> New <b>Road</b> had a shop purpose built in its short terrace of early Edwardian housing, closed for many years it reopened in the late 1960s, trading into the 1970s before closing again (Mrs Bryson).|$|R
