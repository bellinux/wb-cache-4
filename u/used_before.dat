This included the Great White Fleet, 16 battleships which peacefully circumnavigated the globe as an illustration of United States' rising yet neutral prestige under Roosevelt's direction.|$|E

5|$|Radiotherapy {{can also}} be <b>used</b> <b>before</b> surgery in certain cases. When {{pre-operative}} imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a total hysterectomy is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT {{can also be}} used, singly or in combination, {{when there is a}} contraindication for hysterectomy. Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

40|$|The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} is disproportionately impacting young African Americans. Efforts {{to understand and}} address risk factors for unprotected sex in this population are critical in improving prevention efforts. Situational risk factors, such as relationship type and substance <b>use</b> <b>before</b> sex, {{are in need of}} further study. This study explored how established cognitive predictors of risky sexual behavior moderated the association between situational factors and unprotected sex among low-income, African American adolescents. The largest main effect on the number of unprotected sex acts was classifying the relationship as serious (event rate ratio = 10. 18); other significant main effects were alcohol <b>use</b> <b>before</b> sex, participant age, behavioral skills, and level of moti-vation. HIV information moderated the effect of partner age difference, motivation moderated the effects of partner age difference and drug <b>use</b> <b>before</b> sex, and behavioral skills moderated the effects of alcohol and drug <b>use</b> <b>before</b> sex. This novel, partnership-level approach provides insight into the complex interactions of situa-tional and cognitive factors in sexual risk taking...|$|R

Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year, and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal ligation.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{scenes in}} Cannibal Holocaust {{have also been}} noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film Savana violenta, {{specifically}} the scene in which Monroe bathes naked in {{the river and the}} scene of the forced abortion rite. The cinéma vérité style used heavily in Cannibal Holocaust was also <b>used</b> <b>before</b> in Climati's first Mondo film, Ultime grida dalla savana, in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions. Another scene, in which a native man is captured, tortured, and murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.|$|E
5|$|H-63 is a county-designated highway (CDH) in the Upper Peninsula of the US {{state of}} Michigan. The highway {{parallels}} the Interstate 75 (I-75) corridor between St. Ignace and Sault Ste.

Originally, the roadway was {{built as a}} section of US Highway 2 (US2) before being added to the CDH system in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In an {{environment}} where motor transport could not operate, the Australian Army was forced to rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never <b>used</b> <b>before.</b> The Australian Army had many lessons to learn, but it proved capable of adapting to the circumstances it found itself in.

5|$|Modern {{horses are}} often used to reenact many of their {{historical}} work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that <b>used</b> <b>before</b> {{the invention of the}} modern motorized truck.|$|E

5|$|The {{defense of}} Xuân Lộc had been {{entrusted}} to the 18th ARVN Division, {{reinforced by the}} 8th Regiment of the 5th Division, the 3rd Armored Brigade, two Ranger and two artillery battalions, and the 81st Airborne Ranger Group. The week-long fighting that erupted on 8 April raged in and around Xuân Lộc and became the most significant engagement of the entire offensive. The initial attack was conducted by the 341st and 3rd North Vietnamese Divisions, which attacked headlong into the town, a tactic widely <b>used</b> <b>before,</b> hoping to quickly rout the defender. However, they had to call off the attack after meeting 2 weeks of heavy resistance and effective fire support which cost them dearly. The attackers were then reinforced by the 7th Division.|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been <b>used</b> <b>before</b> in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in Husbands and Wives (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E
5|$|The score {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from various soundtrack forums soon after being released. Spectral {{analysis of the}} content of the CD revealed certain frequency cutoff patterns around 16kHz, which are typical for lossy codecs. By analyzing the block size of these cutoffs, individuals at Hydrogenaudio were able to identify the lossy codec that was <b>used</b> <b>before</b> mastering the CD as MP3 with a sample rate of 48kHz. According to the aforementioned forums, Varèse's German subsidiary Colosseum Schallplatten acknowledged this as a mastering error, while Varèse Sarabande itself denied this. It is so far unclear if a remastered version with full frequency content will be released.|$|E
