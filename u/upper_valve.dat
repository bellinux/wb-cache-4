5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Some bivalves, {{including}} the true oysters, the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the thorny oysters and the kitten's paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone and, like most bivalves, are filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{lives on}} the seabed in the sublittoral zone between low tide mark and a depth of , on soft {{sediment}} or on rock, particularly in areas with a strong current. It is a filter feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> and helps protect it from predators.|$|E
50|$|All {{species have}} shells {{cemented}} to a substrate. Shells are considered brittle, inequivalve, with the left, lower (cemented) valve convex {{and the right}} (<b>upper,</b> non-cemented) <b>valve</b> flat or slightly concave.|$|R

50|$|Zigzag {{scallops}} inhabit shallow waters {{between two}} and seven meters deep near the shore and form beds in sandy areas. Scallops as a group are specially adapted to the temperature and salinity fluctuations {{that are part of}} life in the intertidal zone. Individuals bury themselves with sediment except for their tentacles, which project above the sediment and are usually {{the only part of the}} animal visible to observers. Their concave <b>upper</b> <b>valves</b> hold a thin layer of sediment that is thought to prevent fouling organisms from colonizing. Given the chance, a variety of fouling organisms will colonize scallop shells, including algae, barnacles, polychaete tube worms, sponges, hydrozoans, bryozoans, and even other molluscs.|$|R
2500|$|The {{shell of}} a scallop {{consists}} of two sides or valves, a left valve and a right one, divided by a plane of symmetry. [...] Most species of scallop rest on their right valve, and consequently this valve is often deeper and more rounded than the left (i.e., <b>upper)</b> <b>valve</b> which in many species is actually concave. [...] With the hinge of the two valves oriented towards the top, one side corresponds to the animal's morphological anterior or front, {{the other is the}} posterior or rear, the hinge is the dorsal or back/ top region, and the bottom corresponds to the ventral or (as it were) underside/ belly. [...] However, as many scallop shells are more or less bilaterally symmetrical ("equivalved") as well as symmetrical front/back ("equilateral"), determining which way a given animal is [...] "facing" [...] requires detailed information about its valves.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> {{is almost}} {{invariably}} wanting, though occasionally {{found in a}} perfect state of preservation in the white chalk at some distance. In this case, we see clearly that the sea-urchin first lived from youth to age, then died and lost its spines, which were carried away. Then the young Crania adhered to the bared shell, grew and perished in its turn; after which, the <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> was separated from the lower, before the Echinus [68] became enveloped in chalky mud." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{specimen}} in the Museum of Practical Geology, in London, {{still further}} prolongs the period {{which must have}} elapsed between {{the death of the}} sea- urchin, and its burial by the Globigerinoe. For the outward face of the valve of a Crania, which is attached to a sea-urchin, (Micraster), is itself overrun by an incrusting coralline, which spreads thence over more or less of the surface of the sea-urchin. It follows that, after the <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> of the Crania fell off, the surface of the attached valve must have remained exposed long enough to allow of the growth of the whole coralline, since corallines do not live embedded in mud.[4] ...|$|E
60|$|Capitulum with {{fourteen}} valves, {{consisting of}} a pair of scuta and of terga, a carina, (which five valves are much larger than the others,) a rostrum, sub-rostrum, sub-carina, and three pair of small latera. All the valves are covered by membrane, as are the calcareous scales on the peduncle; and this membrane everywhere is densely clothed with spines. The <b>upper</b> <b>valves</b> are not very thick; they stand rather close together. The eight valves of the lower whorl are more solid, and are placed far apart; they are small, tending to become rudimentary. None of the valves are added to at their upper ends, in which respect this species differs remarkably from the others of the genus, and approaches in character to Pollicipes.|$|R

I of course look, for this is an exciting moment. He then directs {{my attention}} to the fit and proportions of the netting. I find the gas, which was before cloudy and opaque, is now clear and transparent, so that I can look right up the balloon and see the meshes of the net-work showing through it, the <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> with its springs and line reaching to the car, and the geometrical form of the balloon itself. Nor is this an idle examination. I have already said that, in passing through the cloud, the netting would gather moisture, augmenting the weight of the balloon. If this should not all have evaporated, the net-work would have become frozen, and be a wire-rope; so that, if the diamond shape of the netting when under tension, and the form of the crown of the balloon, be not symmetrical, the weight might not be equally distributed, and there would be danger of it cutting the balloon. A sense of security therefore follows such an examination.|$|E
5000|$|Their [...] "classic" [...] {{morphology}} {{consisted of}} a lower, roughly conical valve that {{was attached to the}} seafloor or to neighboring rudists, and a smaller <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> that served as a kind of lid for the organism. The small <b>upper</b> <b>valve</b> could take a variety of interesting forms, including: a simple flat lid, a low cone, a spiral, and even a star-shaped form (Johnson, 2002).|$|E

5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the <b>upper</b> <b>valves</b> of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|R

50|$|The above {{description}} (referring to <b>upper</b> {{and lower}} <b>valves)</b> clearly relates to an engine with a vertical cylinder, {{such as a}} beam engine. Where the cylinders are horizontal, as in a steam locomotive, the valves would be side-by-side.|$|R
60|$|Capitulum formed of 13 valves; namely, two scuta, two terga, a carina and sub-carina, a rostrum, a pair {{of upper}} latera, and two pair of lower latera; these latter valves, with the sub-carina and the rostrum, make a whorl of six pieces. The {{upper part of the}} {{capitulum}} is, as usual, produced. The <b>upper</b> <b>valves</b> are separated (in specimens which have not been dried) by rather wide interspaces of membrane; they are covered (excepting, generally, their umbones,) by membrane, which in the interspaces is clothed with fine spines. The spines, or the marks where they were once articulated, are visible over nearly the entire surface of the membrane covering the valves. The spines are particularly numerous round the orifice of the sack. The whole capitulum, (in a dried condition), is coloured dull purplish-red, which is only in part due to the underlying corium, for the valves themselves are pale red. After having been long kept in spirits, the whole capitulum becomes colourless. The valves are smooth, faintly marked by lines of growth. The umbones of the lower valves project outwards, giving a denticulated appearance {{to the base of the}} capitulum.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{sophisticated}} surface tree {{will have}} at least four or five valves, normally arranged in a crucifix type pattern (hence the endurance of the term [...] "Christmas tree"). The two lower valves are called the master <b>valves</b> (<b>upper</b> and lower respectively). Master valves are normally in the fully open position and are never opened or closed when the well is flowing (except in an emergency) to prevent erosion of the valve sealing surfaces. The lower master valve will normally be manually operated, while the <b>upper</b> master <b>valve</b> is often hydraulically actuated, allowing it {{to be used as}} a means of remotely shutting in the well in the event of emergency. An actuated wing valve is normally used to shut in the well when flowing, thus preserving the master valves for positive shut off for maintenance purposes. Hydraulic operated wing valves are usually built to be fail safe closed, meaning they require active hydraulic pressure to stay open. This feature means that if control fluid fails the well will automatically shut itself in without operator action.|$|R

60|$|Pump.--An {{excellent}} and very simple pump {{is used by}} the Arabs in Algeria. A piece of leather or waxed canvas, is stretched round one or more hoops; it forms a hollow cylinder, that admits of being shut flat like an accordion. The top and bottom of the cylinder are secured round the edges of two discs of wood. Holes are bored in these discs and leather valves are fitted to them. The lower disc is nailed to the bottom of a tub; the hole in it corresponds with the feed-pipe, and the valve that covers the hole opens upwards. The upper disc Is attached to the pump handle; the valves that cover the holes in this disc, open upwards also. When the leather-pump barrel is pressed flat, water flows through the <b>upper</b> <b>valves</b> into the barrel around it; when it is pulled out, water is sucked up through the feed-pipe, and an equal quantity is displaced from the barrel. This flows out into the trough. A bag would do as well as a tub, to hold the water which surrounds the pump-barrel; but, without the water which it is the object of either the one or the other to contain, the pump-barrel must be air-proof as well as water-proof. The action of this pump is marvellously perfect. It attracted much attention in the French Exhibition of 1855.|$|R
