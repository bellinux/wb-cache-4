40|$|This work {{describes}} the fabrication of nanospheres {{from a range}} of novel polyhydroxyalkanoates supplied by Monsanto, St Louis, Missouri, USA for the delivery of selected actives of both pharmaceutical and agricultural interest. Initial evaluation of established microsphere and nanosphere fabrication techniques resulted in the adoption and optimisation of a double sonication solvent evaporation method involving the synperonic surfactant F 68. Nanospheres could be consistently generated with this method. Studies on the incorporation and release of the surrogate protein Bovine Serum Albumin V demonstrated that BSA could be loaded with between 10 - 40 % w/w BSA without nanosphere destabilisation. BSA release from nanospheres into Hanks Balanced Salts Solution, pH 7. 4, could be monitored for up to 28 days at 37 °C. The incorporation and release of the Monsanto actives - the insecticide Admire® ({ 1 -[(6 -chloro- 3 -pyridinyl) methyIJ-N-nitro- 2 -imidazolidinimine}) and the plant growth hormone potassium salt Gibberellic acid (GA 3 K) from physico-chemically characterised polymer nanospheres was monitored for up to 37 days and 28 days respectively, at both 4 °C and 23 °C. Release data was subsequently fitted to established kinetic models to elaborate the possible mechanisms of release of actives from the nanospheres. The exposure of unloaded nanospheres to a range of physiological media and rural rainwater has been used to investigate the role polymer biodegradation by enzymatic and chemical means might play in the in vivo release of actives and agricultural applications. The potential environmental biodegradation of Monsanto polymers has been investigated using a composting study (International Standard ISO/FDIS 14855) in which the <b>ultimate</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of the polymers has been monitored by the analysis of evolved carbon dioxide. These studies demonstrated the potential of the polymers for use in the environment, for example as a pesticide delivery system...|$|E
30|$|Taking {{into account}} that {{anaerobic}} biodegradation has or may become included as a pass/fail criterium in surfactant-specific regulations (e.g. EU Detergent Regulation, EU Ecolabel) {{there is a need}} for a test which reliably determines the anaerobic biodegradation of surfactants under relevant (use-related) conditions. Various methods for determining the anaerobic degradability of organic substances have been developed based on the <b>ultimate</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> screening tests which are summarized in the Fraunhofer Report on the “Anaerobic Degradation of Detergent Surfactants” to the EU Commission (2002) [1]. The methods can be divided in two groups, the composting test running at 52 °C (which are not relevant for waste water effluents), and the tests in aqueous media running at 35 °C (e.g. ISO 11734 and OECD 311). These test methods use sludge from the digestion tower of municipal sewage plants as the inoculum. A comparison of the prevailing biodegradation conditions in these tests (e.g. OECD 311) with those encountered in practice, i.e. the conditions that are found in the digestion tower of a municipal sewage plant, shows that sewage plants work with considerably higher mass concentrations both of sludge and of organic pollutants. The above-mentioned tests for determining the ultimate biodegradation under anaerobic conditions are therefore only suitable to a limited extent for making practice-related statements about the anaerobic biodegradation of substances. Much more practice-related mass concentrations are used in simulation tests, like OECD 314 [6] or in the test according to DIN 38414, part 8 [7]. When we started the project, we had also another aspect in mind, namely cost and time efficiency of the test system, so that ideally the test could be used for serial screening of research substances. Based on these considerations, we have chosen the method DIN 38414, part 8 as the starting point for the development of a new method for determining the ultimate anaerobic biodegradation of organic substances under sewage plant simulation conditions. The main difference between this test and that of the method given in DIN 38414, part 8 is that an accurately known amount of the test substance is added to the sludge inoculum. By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced in the sludge inoculum plus test substance and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this test ultimately allows the quantification of the anaerobic biodegradability of the test substance. This anaerobic biodegradation under sewage digester conditions test (AnBUSDiC test) is particularly suitable for testing chemicals used in consumer products which, if used in accordance with the relevant instructions, are found practically quantitatively in the wastewater and therefore also in the anaerobic treatment stage of municipal sewage plants. In order to be able to assess the potential risks involved in applying clarified sludge to the soil the ultimate anaerobic biodegradability under the conditions of a sewage plant simulation test is the method of choice. This test is carried out in order to investigate the degradation behavior of the test substance under conditions such as prevail in the anaerobic sludge treatment in municipal sewage plants. The result may also be used to demonstrate that the substance complies with the criteria for good anaerobic biodegradability demanded by surfactant-relevant environmental labels (particularly the EU Marguerite and the Nordic Swan).|$|E

40|$|Naphthenic acids (NAs) are carboxylated alkanes and cycloalkanes {{concentrated}} in wastewater during oil sands processing. The general chemical formula is C{n}H{n+Z}O{ 2 }, where n represents {{the number of}} carbon atoms and Z specifies a homologous family with 0 - 6 rings (Z= 0 to Z=- 12). The wastewater is acutely toxic to surface water organisms and is stored in tailings ponds with over 230 million m³ of fines tailings and free water. The purpose of this thesis {{was to provide a}} preliminary evaluation of the potential attenuation of NAs during groundwater flow from the ponds. Laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate possible attenuation mechanisms. Aerobes from aquifer material degraded 60 % of the NAs over 20 weeks in laboratory microcosms. The greatest decrease occurred in the low molecular weight bicyclic homologues with 12 to 16 carbons. The microbial activity confirms that aerobic naphthenate-degrading bacteria occur naturally in the glacial aquifer near Suncor's Pond 2 / 3. These results support the hypothesis that limited <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of the smaller components of NAs could occur relatively rapidly under field conditions. There was no measurable decrease in NA concentration over six months in anaerobic microcosms, although microbial activity did lead to sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. The theoretical retardation in glacio-fluvial sands was calculated using soil-water partitioning coefficients (K{d}) determined by batch equilibration experiments using a mixture of naturally occurring naphthenic acids as well as the nine surrogates. The retardation (porosity of 0. 3, bulk density of 1. 5 g/mL) ranged from 1. 2 to 2. 6. However, no measurable sorption was seen at the field sites. Detailed characterization allows us to examine how the proportions of homologue, or groups of molecules with the same molecular weight and number of cycloalkane rings, vary. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> favoured removal of low molecular weight NAs. A 15 % mass loss attributed to sorption caused no changes in the 3 D signature. Thus, changes in NA "signature" in groundwater systems were then attributed to <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation.</b> Three plumes were examined for evidence of attenuation of NAs via biodegradation. First, the individual samples were classified as background, possibly process-affected or process-affected using a combination of Piper diagrams, the stable isotopes oxygen- 18 and deuterium, dissolved chloride and sodium, as well as the total naphthenic acids concentration. Second, in order to estimate attenuation due to dispersive dilution, a linear correlation line was drawn between various conservative tracers and the naphthenic acids concentration. This allowed the identification of certain samples as possibly having a lower concentration of NAs than could be expected from simple dispersive dilution. Third, the 3 D signature of certain samples were examined for the presence of the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> 3 D signature. One site showed good evidence for <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of naphthenic acids. A second site showed some evidence for biodegradation under methanogenic conditions but the evidence was not definitive.

In single compound experiments with n -alkanes, the largest enrichment factor was obtained for propane (− 10. 8 ± 0. 7 ‰). The magnitude of the enrichment factor decreased with increasing number of carbon atoms from propane to n -decane (− 0. 2 ± 0. 1 ‰). This trend can partly {{be explained by the}} decreasing probability that a 13 C is located at the reacting site in the molecule with increasing chain length. After correcting for the presence of non-reacting positions, a chain length dependence of the calculated apparent isotope effect persisted.

Industrial strain improvement has currently moved from simple adaptation and selection to a targeted metabolic engineering (Zidkova et al. 2012).|$|R
