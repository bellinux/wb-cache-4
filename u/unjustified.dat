5|$|After Brokeback Mountain {{lost the}} Academy Award for Best Picture to Crash, many accused the Academy of {{homophobia}} and {{for making a}} non-groundbreaking choice, and commentators including Kenneth Turan and Nikki Finke derided the Academy's decision. However, Roger Ebert argued that claims of foul play were <b>unjustified</b> and that the better film won.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, {{work on the}} Princes Street section stopped due to {{contractual}} disagreements between TIE and BSC {{after the}} latter submitted a request for an additional £80 million of funding. Edinburgh Council believed the contractors' claims were <b>unjustified</b> as they had agreed to fixed-price contracts. After negotiations, BSC agreed to commence construction in March 2009 within the original budget, although disagreements remained. Work restarted and line construction went ahead.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from brackish water by Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that {{its status as a}} subspecies is <b>unjustified,</b> being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they are probably just ecomorphs.|$|E
5|$|By May 1985, {{three months}} behind schedule, the review board narrowed the tenders {{down to two}} contenders in each group: IKL/HDW and Kockums for the submarine, Rockwell and Signaal for the combat system. The Walrus and Type 2400submarine designs were {{considered}} to be too expensive to manufacture because of inefficient building practices, while the combat data system tenders had been narrowed down by <b>unjustified</b> development risk in the Plessey and Krupp/Ferranti proposals, and the dual problems in the Sintra Alcatel tender of excessive power usage and incompatibility with the proposed American weapons system. On 9 May, the Australian cabinet approved the selections for the funded studies and decided that six submarines would be built, with the option for two more, all in Australia.|$|E
5|$|In its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus {{estimated}} {{the demand for}} 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats : 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019. The market is estimated for two decades at more than 1,700 by Airbus and 700 by Boeing since 1999-2000, including freighters. In 2006, industry analysts Philip Lawrence of the Aerospace Research Centre in Bristol anticipated 880 sales by 2025 with Airbus having conducted the most extensive and thorough market analysis of commercial aviation ever undertaken, justifying its VLA plans to design the A380 by the spoke-hub distribution paradigm while Richard Aboulafia of the consulting Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia anticipated 400 {{with the rise of}} mid-size aircraft and market fragmentation reducing them to niche markets, making such plans <b>unjustified</b> in a point-to-point transit model.|$|E
5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are <b>unjustified,</b> or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|As life in Paris {{returned}} to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet {{was due to}} begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused {{to take up the}} position as a protest against what he thought was the director's <b>unjustified</b> closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} to Singapore the 8th Division was deployed {{to defend the}} island's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division's units were at half-strength. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector. The Japanese landing on 8 February {{took part in the}} Australian sector, however, and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. The division was also unable to turn back the Japanese landing at Kranji and withdrew to the centre of the island. After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore, Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February. Following the surrender 14,972Australians were taken prisoner, though some escaped on ships. These escapees included Major General Bennett, who was found by two post-war inquiries to have been <b>unjustified</b> in leaving his command. The loss of almost a quarter of Australia's overseas soldiers, and the failure of the Singapore Strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, stunned the country.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that the {{comments}} were <b>unjustified,</b> and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not make the effort to train for distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove <b>unjustified</b> inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan Drive was {{constructed}} during the early1920s as {{a town of}} Tonawanda project to help alleviate the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore. Despite its construction, the new road was not without controversy. During construction, new traffic lights were put in with concrete supports were opposed heavily by the town of Tonawanda and its residents, resulting in the traffic lights not having been built for many years. The town also felt that {{the construction of a}} superhighway {{in the middle of the}} country in Tonawanda was <b>unjustified</b> with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan Drive was completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan {{was constructed}} to commemorate the new road. However, the taxpayers feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed. In order to give the road a new look, the road had large trees planted throughout what was considered a desolate area at the time.|$|E
5|$|Suter even {{concludes that}} the peasant war of 1653 thwarted a further {{advancement}} of absolutist trends in Switzerland and prevented a development similar to that which occurred in France following the Fronde. The authorities of the Swiss cantons had to act much more carefully and were forced to respect their rural subjects. The Bernese for instance instructed their district sheriffs to employ a far less pompous and less authoritarian attitude to minimize the conflict potential. The city council even opened legal procedures against a few of its district sheriffs against whom there were many complaints from the rural population, accusing them of corruption, incompetence, and <b>unjustified</b> enrichment. The district sheriff of Trachselwald, the same Samuel Tribolet who had captured Niklaus Leuenberger, was dismissed, tried, and exiled in early 1654. Abraham Stanyan, who had been ambassador of England in Bern from 1705 to 1713, published in 1714 an extensive treatise entitled An account of Switzerland, in which he described the authorities' rule as particularly mild, mentioning explicitly the low taxation in comparison to other European states and giving {{as the reason for}} the comparatively soft-gloved government the fear of rebellions.|$|E
5|$|The Chamber of Deputies (1) expresses disapproval {{with the}} European Commission {{proposal}} {{to limit the}} possibility of acquisition and possession of firearms that are held legally in line with national laws of EU Member States, (2) refuses European Commission's infringement into a well established system of control, evidence, acquisition and possession of firearms and ammunition laid down by the Czech law, (3) expresses support for establishment of any and all functional measures to combat illegal trade, acquisition, possession and other illegal manipulation with firearms, ammunition and explosives, (4) refuses European Commission's persecution of Member States and their citizens through <b>unjustified</b> tightening of legal firearms possession {{as a reaction to}} terror attacks in Paris and (5) recommends the Prime Minister to conduct any and all legal and diplomatic steps to prevent enactment of a directive that would disrupt the Czech legal order in the area of trade, control, acquisition and possession of firearms and thus inappropriately infringe into the rights of the citizens of the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|In France, the Antoinist worship was {{classified}} as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary reports which considered {{it one of the}} oldest healer groups. Books published by Belgian and French anti-cult associations and activists sometimes included Antoinism in their lists of cults, such as Cults, State of Emergency—Better know them, better defend oneself in France and worldwide (Les Sectes, État d'urgence—Mieux les connaître, mieux s'en défendre en France et dans le monde), published by the Centre Roger Ikor, and others. However, on 27 May 2005, the 1995 annex of the French report and cult classifications in which the Antoinist worship was listed, were officially cancelled and invalidated by Jean-Pierre Raffarin's circulaire. In addition, in a 1984 letter, the French Minister of the Interior wrote that the movement was considered, from an administrative point of view, as having for exclusive purpose the exercise of a religion, thus complying with the 18th and 19th Articles of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. He added that antoinism had always been allowed to receive bequests or donations, which meant that its religious nature was never challenged. In the early 2000s, membership of an Antoinist mother in Valenciennes was used by her former husband to remove from her the custody of their son; the decision received attention from media and was criticized by the French sociologist Régis Dericquebourg as being <b>unjustified.</b>|$|E

25|$|In a 60-page report {{based on}} 50 {{interviews}} with victims and witnesses of the Andijan crackdown, Human Rights Watch said {{the killing of}} unarmed protesters by the Uzbek government on 13 May was so extensive and <b>unjustified</b> that it amounted to a massacre.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critics of}} the {{scientific}} consensus on global warming have argued that these issues should not be linked and that reference to them constitutes an <b>unjustified</b> ad hominem attack.

25|$|On the whole, few {{doubted that}} Carlsen {{would win the}} match. Sergey Karjakin noted that Anand was not in top form during the match.

25|$|Operation Restore Order, while {{purporting}} to target illegal dwellings and structures and to {{clamp down on}} alleged illicit activities, was carried out in an indiscriminate and <b>unjustified</b> manner, with indifference to human suffering, and, in repeated cases, with disregard to several provisions of national and international legal frameworks.|$|E
25|$|Evaluation of {{research}} quality {{can be a}} difficult task requiring meticulous reading {{of research}} reports and background information.
