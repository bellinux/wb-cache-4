40|$|We {{study the}} {{disposition}} decision for product returns in a closed-loop supply chain. Motivated by the asset recovery process at IBM, we consider two disposition alternatives. Returns may be either refurbished for reselling or dismantled for spare parts. Reselling a refurbished unit typically yields higher <b>unit</b> <b>margins.</b> However, demand is uncertain. A common policy in many firms is to rank disposition alternatives by <b>unit</b> <b>margins.</b> We {{show that a}} revenue management approach to the disposition decision which explicitly incorporates demand uncertainty can increase profits significantly. We discuss analogies between the disposition problem and the classical airline revenue management problem. We then develop single period and multi-period stochastic optimization models for the disposition problem. Analyzing these models, we show that the optimal allocation balances expected marginal profits across the disposition alternatives. A detailed numerical study reveals that a revenue management approach to the disposition problem significantly outperforms the current practice of focusing exclusively on high-margin options, and we identify conditions under which this improvement is the highest. We also show that the value recovered from the returned products critically depends on the coordination between forward and reverse supply chain decisions. remanufacturing;revenue management;onderdelen;revenues;spare parts inventory...|$|R
40|$|When {{should a}} firm {{introduce}} a line extension or improved product {{in order to}} maximize total profits from the original product and the line extension? We identify three critical issues which affect the answer to this question: the interrelationship of sales of the two products because of substitution and diffusion, the relative margins of the two products, and the relationship of the length of the firm's planning horizon to the original product's diffusion time. We develop a model in which the first product contributes a higher unit margin; however, sales develop slowly. The line extension contributes a lower <b>unit</b> <b>margin</b> and partially cannibalizes sales of the original product, but also broadens the market, causing sales to develop more rapidly. The timing of the introduction of the line extension affects the subsequent sales pattern for both products and the total profit to be made within the planning period. The optimal entry time depends upon the product pair's substitutability. We show that it is best either to introduce the line extension at a time early in the life cycle of the original product or not to introduce it at all. Consideration of dynamic phenomena can make a difference. For example, our results indicate that in some cases the line extension should be introduced early, whereas a simpler static analysis (which neglects diffusion and the implications of a finite planning horizon) would indicate that the line extension should never be introduced. product line, product development, product introduction, timing, optimal...|$|E

Outside-the-core innovation projects, which target new customers or non-consumers in new markets, can lead to high growth. However, they are also very risky: the odds of success for outside-the-core projects rapidly drop with each step outside the core. In a study of six outside-the-core projects using a business model perspective, we found that, contradictory to common wisdom, the likelihood of failure is not related to how many steps the project is outside the core.

40|$|Legs 127 and 128 of the Ocean Drilling Program cored {{basement}} {{samples from}} two {{sites in the}} Yamato Basin (Sites 794 and 797) and one site in the Japan Basin (Site 795) of the Japan Sea. These samples represent sills and lava flows erupted or shallowly intruded in a marine environment during backarc extension and spreading in the middle Miocene. In this paper, we describe the geochemical characteristics of these igneous units using 52 new instrumental neutron activation analyses (INAA), 8 new X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses, and previous shipboard XRF analyses. The sills intruded into soft sediment at Sites 794 and 797 were subject to extensive hydrothermal activity, estimated at < 230 ° C under subgreenschist facies conditions, which heavily to totally altered the fine-grained <b>unit</b> <b>margins</b> and moderately to heavily altered the coarse-grained unit interiors. Diagenesis further altered the composition of these igneous bodies and lava flows at Sites 794, 795, and 797, most intensely at <b>unit</b> <b>margins.</b> Our study of two well-sampled units shows that Mg, Ca, Sr, and the large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) mobilized during alteration, and that the concentrations of Y, Yb, and Lu decreased and Ce increased in the most severely altered samples. Nevertheless, our study shows that the rare-earth elements (REE) were relatively immobile {{in the majority of}} the samples, even where secondary mixed-layer clays comprised the great majority of the rock. Fresher Yamato Basin samples are compositionally heterogenous tholeiitic basalts and dolerites. At Site 794 in the north-central portion of the basin, Units 1 to 5 (upper basement) comprise mildly light rare-earth element (LREE) enriched basalts and dolerites (chondrite-normalized La/Sm of 1. 4 - 1. 8), while the stratigraphically lower Units 6 to 9 are less enriched dolerites with (La/Sm) N of 0. 7 - 1. 3. All Site 794 samples lack Nb and Ta depletions and LILE enrichments, lacking a strong subduction-related incompatible element geochemical signature. At Site 797 in the western margin of the basin, two stratigraphically-definable unit groups also occur. The upper nine units are incompatible-element depleted tholeiitic sills and flows with strong depletions of Nb and Ta relative to normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB). The lower twelve sills represent LREE-enriched tholeiites (normalized La/Sm ranges from 1. 1 to 1. 8), with distinctly higher LILE and high field-strength element (HFSE) contents. At Site 795 at the northern margin of the Japan Sea, three eruptive units consist of basaltic andesite to calc-alkaline basalt (normalized La/Sm of 1. 1 to 1. 5) containing moderate depletions of the HFSE relative to N-MORB. The LILE-depleted nature of these samples precludes their origin in a continental arc, indicating that they more likely erupted within a rifting oceanic arc system. The heterogenous nature of the Japan Sea rocks indicate that they were derived at each site from multiple parental magmas generated from a compositionally heterogenous mantle source. Their chemistry is intermediate in character between arc basalts, MORB, and intraplate basalts, and implies little involvement of continental crust at any point in their genesis. Their flat chondrite-normalized, medium-to-heavy rare earth patterns indicate that the primary magmas which produced them last equilibrated with and segregated from spinel lherzolite at shallow depths (< 30 kbar). In strong contrast to their isotopic compositional arrays, subduction-related geochemical signatures are usually poorly defined. No basin-wide temporal or geographic systematics of rock chemistry may be confidently detailed; instead, the data show both intimate (site-specific) and widespread backarc mantle heterogeneity over a narrow (2 Ma or so) range in time, with mantle heterogeneity most closely resembling a "plum-pudding" model...|$|R

With the explosion of continuous, high-resolution topography and digital elevation models, {{we have plenty of}} new basemaps in which these landforms are clearly visible, but very few examples of manual or automated classification of fluvial landforms. Fluvial landforms are the building blocks of a river and are variously referred to as geomorphic units, morphological units, habitat units, and channel units. We present a tiered framework for describing geomorphic units, with tier 1 differentiating units {{on the basis of their}} stage, tier 2 separating shape (e. g., concave, convex, or planar), tier 3 using particular key attributes to narrow in on the likely specific geomorphic unit type, and tier 4 differentiating those types on the basis of vegetative or roughness modifiers. Information on the assemblage and configuration of geomorphic units can be used to inform process-based interpretations of the range of river behavior. The accuracy and transferability of such analyses is fundamentally tied to the taxonomy we assign to these discrete building blocks.

40|$|In UK petrol retailing, the {{vertical}} relationship between manufacturer (refiner/wholesaler) and retailer {{is governed by}} a menu of possible contracts, characterized by different typical <b>unit</b> <b>margins.</b> In ‘agency’ terms, each contract type thus incorporates an implicit risk/incentives trade-off, with higher margins providing higher-powered incentives for retailer’s effort, but also increasing {{his share of the}} risk. At the same time, the difference in the margins also suggests a possible ‘strategic’ function of contracts: in an oligopolistic context, manufacturers might choose a particular contract type with the objective of indirectly influencing the final price set by the retailer, and possibly reduce the intensity of competition in the market game. This paper addresses the issue of contract-assignment, proposing a model where both ‘agency’ and ‘strategic’ considerations are featured in contract design. Agency considerations are explicitly incorporated in a simple duopoly, with manufacturers delegating the retail function to risk-averse retailers, and retailers competing against one another in prices. The manufacturers’ profits (payoffs) are thus obtained as the net result of two distinct influences: the agency costs of delegation, which are higher the more risk-averse (or less able) the retailer; and the strategic benefits from delegating to such a retailer, in the form of higher wholesale and retail prices. The key result of the model is that the net effect of these costs and benefits depends crucially on the intensity of local competition. Where competition is slack, the agency cost borne by the delegating manufacturer is not offset by the benefit to be gained by signalling his commitment to a less aggressive pricing strategy. The outcome is different, however, where competitive conditions are locally tight, i. e. final demand for each retailer is very sensitive to the other retailer’s price. In that case, the agency cost of employing a more risk-averse retailer is outweighed for the manufacturer by the strategic benefit from being able to commit to a higher retail price. This generates a series of testable propositions in the context of petrol retailing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper studies {{real-time}} {{estimation of}} stability margin {{of a power}} system under disturbances by continuous measurement data. The paper presents a ball-on-concave-surface (BOCS) mechanics system as a power system’s adaptive equivalent representing its real-time status and the stability region about a monitored variable. The parameters of the equivalent are adaptive to the operating condition and can online be identified from the phase-plane trajectories of the monitored variable. Accordingly, the stability margin and risk of instability can be estimated. Case studies on a two-generator system and a 179 -bus system show that the BOCS system can be applied either locally or for wide-area stability monitoring in real-time calculation of stability margin.
