5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the <b>urogenital</b> folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the <b>urogenital</b> sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The <b>urogenital</b> sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two <b>urogenital</b> folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single <b>urogenital</b> canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the <b>urogenital</b> sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central <b>urogenital</b> canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E
25|$|After the {{separation}} of the rectum from the dorsal part of the cloaca, the ventral part becomes the primary <b>urogenital</b> sinus. The <b>urogenital</b> sinus, in turn, divides into the superficial definitive <b>urogenital</b> sinus and the deeper anterior vesico-urethral portion.|$|E
25|$|In {{both sexes}} the phallic {{portion of the}} <b>urogenital</b> sinus extends on to the under surface of the cloacal {{tubercle}} as far forward as the apex. At the apex {{the walls of the}} phallic portion come together and fuse, obliterating the <b>urogenital</b> opening. Instead, a solid plate, the urethral plate, is formed. The remainder of the phallic portion is for a time tubular, and then, by the absorption of the <b>urogenital</b> membrane, it establishes a communication with the exterior. This opening is for a while the primitive <b>urogenital</b> opening, and it extends forward to the corona glandis.|$|E
25|$|During sexual {{differentiation}} of females, without testosterone, the <b>urogenital</b> sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina. The two <b>urogenital</b> folds (elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to}} the formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle) form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora.|$|E
25|$|Until {{about the}} ninth week of gestational age the {{external}} genitalia {{of males and}} females look the same, and follow a common development. This includes the development of a genital tubercle and a membrane dorsally to it, covering the developing <b>urogenital</b> opening, and the development of the labioscrotal fold, also called the <b>urogenital</b> fold, and the labioscrotal swelling.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} <b>urogenital</b> sinus {{consists of}} a caudal cephallic portion and an intermediate narrow channel, the pelvic portion.|$|E
25|$|The bulbourethral glands in the male, and Bartholin's gland in the female, also arise as diverticula {{from the}} {{epithelial}} {{lining of the}} <b>urogenital</b> sinus.|$|E
25|$|Supporting {{the vagina}} are its upper third, middle third and lower third muscles and ligaments. The upper third are the levator ani muscles (transcervical, pubocervical) and the sacrocervical ligaments; {{these areas are}} also {{described}} as the cardinal ligaments laterally and uterosacral ligaments posterolaterally. The middle third of the vagina concerns the <b>urogenital</b> diaphragm (also described as the paracolpos and pelvic diaphragm). The lower third is the perineal body; it may be described as containing the perineal body, pelvic diaphragm and <b>urogenital</b> diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|For {{teaching}} future {{healthcare professionals}} {{how to perform}} intimate examinations, a specially trained teaching associate may be used. Intimate examinations include breast and pelvic examination on females and <b>urogenital,</b> prostate and rectal examination on males. Such teaching associates are known by various names. A female associate may be called Gynecological Teaching Associate (GTA) or a Clinical Teaching Associate (CTA), while the male equivalent {{might be called a}} Male <b>Urogenital</b> (or Urological) Teaching Associate (MUTA) or a Male Clinical Teaching Associate (MCTA).|$|E
25|$|As in the female, the <b>urogenital</b> {{membrane}} undergoes absorption, {{forming a}} channel on the under {{surface of the}} phallus; this channel extends only as far forward as the corona glandis.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} {{part of the}} phallus, representing the future glans becomes solid. The remainder of the phallus, which remains hollow, is converted into a longitudinal groove by the absorption of the <b>urogenital</b> membrane.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are {{responsible}} for the maintenance of collagen, elastic fibers, and vasoculature of the <b>urogenital</b> tract, all of which are important in maintaining vaginal structure and functional integrity; they are also important for maintaining vaginal pH and moisture levels, both of which aid in keeping the tissues lubricated and protected. Prolonged estrogen deficiency leads to atrophy, fibrosis, and reduced blood flow to the <b>urogenital</b> tract, which is what causes menopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness and pain related to sexual activity and/or intercourse. It has been consistently demonstrated that women with lower sexual functioning have lower estradiol levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} {{presentation of}} the syndrome starts with urinary symptoms such as burning pain on urination (dysuria) or an increased frequency of urination. Other <b>urogenital</b> problems may arise such as prostatitis in men and cervicitis, salpingitis and/or vulvovaginitis in women.|$|E
25|$|Some {{degree of}} fusion of the labioscrotal folds and <b>urogenital</b> folds and {{clitoral}} enlargement can occur if exposure occurs from the 8th through the 12th week of gestation, but only clitoral enlargement can occur if exposure occurs after the 12th week.|$|E
25|$|Microorganisms like Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} colonize {{the skin}} surface. The density of skin flora depends on {{region of the}} skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from bacteria residing in the deeper areas of the hair follicle, gut and <b>urogenital</b> openings.|$|E
25|$|Studies are {{examining}} whether probiotics affect mechanisms of intestinal inflammation, diarrhea, or <b>urogenital</b> infections. , however, {{in all cases}} proposed as health claims to the European Food Safety Authority, the scientific evidence remains insufficient to prove a cause-and-effect relationship between consumption of probiotic products and any health benefit.|$|E
25|$|S. haematobium, the {{infectious}} agent responsible for <b>urogenital</b> schistosomiasis, infects over 112 million people annually in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. It {{is responsible for}} 32 million cases of dysuria, 10 million cases of hydronephrosis, and 150,000 deaths from renal failure annually, making S. haematobium the world’s deadliest schistosome.|$|E
25|$|Until {{about the}} ninth week of gestational age, the sex organs {{of males and}} females look the same, and follow a common development. This {{includes}} the development of a genital tubercle and a membrane dorsally to it, covering the developing <b>urogenital</b> opening, and the development of labioscrotal folds.|$|E
25|$|There is {{initially}} a cloacal membrane, composed of ectoderm and endoderm, reaching from {{the umbilical cord}} to the tail, separating the cloaca from the exterior. After {{the separation of the}} rectum from the dorsal part of the cloaca, the ventral part of the cloacal membrane becomes the <b>urogenital</b> membrane.|$|E
25|$|The main medical {{concern with}} this species {{is that it}} causes {{accidental}} enteric, urinary, auricular, and <b>urogenital</b> myiasis. Myiasis is the infestation of animals or humans, where dipterous fly larvae feed on the host's necrotic or living tissue. This is prevalent in small children and bedridden adults living in unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Between 1975 and 1990, Danocrines manufacturer, Winthrop Laboratories, {{received}} reports worldwide of 129 {{pregnant women}} exposed to danazol, with 94 completed pregnancies {{and the birth}} of 57 female infants — 23 (40%) of whom were virilized with a pattern of clitoromegaly, fused labia and <b>urogenital</b> sinus formation, with genital reconstructive surgery usually, but not always, required in childhood.|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{involvement}} (mild bilateral conjunctivitis) {{occurs in}} about 50% {{of men with}} <b>urogenital</b> reactive arthritis syndrome and about 75% of men with enteric reactive arthritis syndrome. Conjunctivitis and uveitis can include redness of the eyes, eye pain and irritation, or blurred vision. Eye involvement typically occurs early {{in the course of}} reactive arthritis, and symptoms may come and go.|$|E
25|$|The prostatic {{part of the}} urethra {{develops}} {{from the}} pelvic (middle) part of the <b>urogenital</b> sinus (endodermal origin). Endodermal outgrowths arise from the prostatic part of the urethra and grow into the surrounding mesenchyme. The glandular epithelium of the prostate differentiates from these endodermal cells, and the associated mesenchyme differentiates into the dense stroma and the smooth muscle of the prostate.|$|E
25|$|Adrenal glands {{of female}} fetuses with CAH begin {{producing}} excess testosterone by the 9th week of gestation. The most {{important aspects of}} virilization (<b>urogenital</b> closure and phallic urethra) occur between 8 and 12 weeks. Theoretically, if enough glucocorticoid could be supplied to the fetus to reduce adrenal testosterone production by the 9th week, virilization could be prevented and the difficult decision about timing of surgery avoided.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, colic refers only to signs {{originating}} from the gastrointestinal tract of the horse. Signs of colic {{may be caused}} by problems other than the GI-tract e.g. problems in the liver, ovaries, spleen, <b>urogenital</b> system, testicular torsion, pleuritis, and pleuropneumonia. Diseases which sometimes cause symptoms which appear similar to colic include uterine contractions, laminitis, and exertional rhabdomyolysis. Colic pain secondary to kidney disease is rare.|$|E
25|$|Mesoderm {{extends to}} the midventral line for some {{distance}} behind the umbilical cord, and forms {{the lower part of}} the abdominal wall; it ends below in a prominent swelling, the cloacal tubercle, which after the separation of the rectum becomes the genital tubercle. Dorsally to this tubercle the sides aren't really fused. Rather, the <b>urogenital</b> part of the cloacal membrane separates the ingrowing sheets of mesoderm.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of artery {{walls and}} tissue {{adjacent}} to nerves {{is common in}} tumors of abdominal and <b>urogenital</b> hollow organs. Infection or cancer may irritate the trigone of the urinary bladder, causing spasm of the detrusor urinae muscle (the muscle that squeezes urine from the urinary bladder), resulting in deep pain above the pubic bone, possibly referred {{to the tip of}} the penis, lasting from a few minutes to half an hour.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal microbiota {{of the male}} <b>urogenital</b> tract and prevent the recurrence of infection. However, a 2016 Cochrane review found high-quality evidence that treating the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis {{had no effect on}} symptoms, clinical outcomes, or recurrence in the affected women. It also found that such treatment may lead treated sexual partners to report increased adverse events.|$|E
25|$|A major {{challenge}} for medical training programs is recruitment of GTAs and MUTAs. It {{is not easy}} to find potential teaching assistants who are healthy, are capable of instructing students well, and are comfortable with having their breasts or genital areas palpated by medical students. A 2016 survey of Canadian medical schools found that only 65% of the students had performed a <b>urogenital</b> examination on a patient during their introductory clinical skills sessions.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden {{preparations}} of codeine {{are sold}} by prescription only. It is sold as pure codeine pills of 25mg in bottles of 100 pills approved {{for treatment of}} pain and cough. In combination tablets and suppositories, most commonly Paracetamol, ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid for pain. It is also available as parenteral solution in combination with morphine, papaverin, methylscopolamine and noscapine, approved for treatment against pain in gastrointestinal tract and <b>urogenital</b> tract. Most commonly used against pain from stones.|$|E
25|$|Even after {{differentiation}} {{can be seen}} {{between the}} sexes, some stages are common, e.g. the disappearing of the membrane. On the other hand, sex-dependent development include further protrusion of the genital tubercle in the male to form the glans of the penis and in the female, the clitoral glans. The <b>urogenital</b> fold evolves into the shaft of the penis in males and the Labia minora in females; the labioscrotal swelling evolves into the scrotum in males, and into the Labia majora in females.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} originally {{consists of}} two separate portions, each of which arises {{as a series of}} diverticular buds from the epithelial lining of the <b>urogenital</b> sinus and vesico-urethral part of the cloaca, between the third and fourth months. These buds become tubular, and form the glandular substance of the two lobes, which ultimately meet and fuse behind the urethra and also extend on to its ventral aspect. The median lobe of the prostate is formed {{as an extension of the}} lateral lobes between the common ejaculatory ducts and the bladder.|$|E
25|$|In the male, by {{the greater}} {{growth of the}} pelvic portion of the cloaca, a longer urethra is formed, and the {{primitive}} opening is carried forward with the phallus, but it still ends at the corona glandis. Later, this opening, which {{is located on the}} dorsal side of the penis, closes from behind forward. Meanwhile, the urethral plate of the glans breaks down centrally to form a median groove continuous with the primitive ostium. This groove also closes from behind forward, leaving only a small pipe running {{in the middle of the}} penis. Thus, the <b>urogenital</b> opening is shifted forward to the end of the glans.|$|E
25|$|There are two drugs available, {{praziquantel}} and oxamniquine, for {{the treatment}} of schistosomiasis. They are considered equivalent in relation to efficacy against S. mansoni and safety. Because of praziquantel's lower cost per treatment, and oxaminiquine's lack of efficacy against the <b>urogenital</b> form of the disease caused by S. haematobium, in general praziquantel is considered the first option for treatment. The treatment objective is to cure the disease and to prevent the evolution of the acute to the chronic form of the disease. All cases of suspected schistosomiasis should be treated regardless of presentation because the adult parasite can live in the host for years.|$|E
