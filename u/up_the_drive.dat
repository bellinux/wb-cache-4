25|$|In early 1918, the Germans {{launched}} their Spring Offensive {{during which the}} 1st Pioneer Battalion, which had spent the winter around Messines, supported the 1st Division's operations around Hazebrouck in April, establishing the division's trench systems. From April 1918 {{until the end of}} the war, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Murdoch. After the defeat of the German offensive, a lull period followed during which the Allied armies sought to regain the initiative through a series of small scale actions dubbed peaceful penetrations, which were carried out throughout June and July 1918. During the Allied Hundred Days Offensive that was launched in August, which finally brought about an end to the war in late 1918, the pioneers took part in the Allied offensive around Amiens, supporting the capture of Lihons and then the exploitation beyond Proyart, losing around 80 casualties during the month. The following month they followed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> through the Somme until the 1st Division was withdrawn from the line in late September 1918. They remained out of the line until the armistice in November 1918 and did not see any further action. After the war, the battalion was disbanded in May 1919 as part of the demobilisation of the AIF and its personnel were repatriated back to Australia.|$|E
500|$|The adaptations {{have had}} an {{influence}} {{on the work of}} the writer Mark Gatiss. Interviewed in 2008, Gatiss said that Lost Hearts is his favourite adaptation because it is the one that frightened him as a child and that [...] "I absolutely love The Treasure of Abbot Thomas. The moment when Michael Bryant has found the treasure and ... is obviously losing his wits. He just says, rationally, 'It is a thing of slime, I think. Darkness and slime ...' There's also the fantastic scene where he thinks he's got away with it by putting the treasure back. The doctor is heading <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> and he can't quite see him in the sunlight. Then it pauses to that amazing crane shot. ... Very spooky.|$|E
500|$|In November 2004, Minogue {{was invited}} to film a cameo {{appearance}} for the show's 20th anniversary the following year. A report then emerged that Minogue was willing to film an appearance as Charlene while she was on tour in the UK, but the producers had refused the offer. However, in a statement from production company Grundy Television, the producers said that they [...] "made every effort to accommodate Minogue", including filming the cameo anywhere in the world, but that their offer was turned down. In May 2010, Minogue pondered a return to Neighbours during an interview published in The Sun. Minogue commented on how fun {{it would be to}} appear as Charlene again, after years of saying no, and added [...] "I've decided how it would work. Charlene would screech <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> in her souped-up Mini which she's been working on all the time".|$|E

60|$|This occasioned him uneasiness {{because they}} would soon be down on a level, where palls of dust {{threatened}} to close over the whole valley, {{and it would be}} impossible to see any considerable distance. If the wild horses then took a notion to wheel and run back <b>up</b> <b>the</b> valley <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> would yield great results.|$|R
500|$|The elderly Ian Smith {{lived in}} an unassuming house in Harare where, {{according}} to David Blair, [...] "the front gate always stood open and virtually anyone who walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> would be invited in for tea". He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet's death in 1994. He insisted {{that he would never}} leave Zimbabwe. [...] "Don't get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, do not be afraid," [...] a friend reported him saying. [...] "Show you are not budging and the government will leave you alone." [...] He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, The Great Betrayal, to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as Prime Minister, and praised Nelson Mandela, calling him Africa's [...] "first black statesman". Smith's enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. [...] "They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their 'betrayal' for the evening news," [...] Josephine Fisher records. Not all of the country's whites admired Smith, however; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{desirable}} that the tool material be sufficiently strong, tough, and hard wearing at the welding temperature. Further {{it should have}} a good oxidation resistance and a low thermal conductivity to minimise heat loss and thermal damage to the machinery further <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> train. Hot-worked tool steel such as AISI H13 has proven perfectly acceptable for welding aluminium alloys within thickness ranges of 0.5 – 50mm [...] but more advanced tool materials are necessary for more demanding applications such as highly abrasive metal matrix composites or higher melting point materials such as steel or titanium.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E

60|$|A second {{automobile}} was whirring <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive.</b> There was a shout as it {{came within}} sight of us, and the chauffeur put on the brake. A man sprang from the tonneau. He jerked a word to the chauffeur, and the car went on <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E

60|$|Here was, indeed, a chance. Robert eagerly assented, {{and walked}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> winding <b>drive</b> amid <b>the</b> growing fir-trees.

5000|$|In the 21st century, the {{family-owned company}} {{primarily}} expanded {{by means of}} several takeovers. Through the acquisition of closure systems business from Robert Bosch GmbH in 2002, {{it was possible to}} venture into a new business segment. 2004 saw the takeover of the window regulator business of Maxion Sistemas in Brazil, followed by the acquisition of a 40 percent stake in the Turkish window regulator manufacturer Pressan A.S. one year later. In April 2008, Brose added electric drives for window regulators, sunroofs and [...] seat belt retractors to its portfolio by purchasing the electric motor business of Continental AG.

50|$|<b>The</b> Ocean <b>Drive</b> {{area was}} once farmland, {{distant from the}} center of town during the colonial era.

The area thus retains some of the character it originally had.|$|R
