25|$|The Pebbles were {{designed}} {{in such a}} way that autonomous operation, without further external guidance from planned SDI sensor systems, was possible.

Brilliant Pebbles later became the centerpiece of a revised architecture <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration SDIO.|$|E

25|$|Dwight Grotberg {{was very}} outspoken {{about keeping the}} current tax cuts made <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration and also {{supports}} abolition of the estate tax. On social issues, Grotberg claimed that his conservative viewpoints are more reflective of North Dakota than the views of incumbent Kent Conrad.

The lawsuit accused them of using uniforms, racial insults and a weapon to intimidate voters and those who were there to assist them. The case remained open when the Obama administration took office a few weeks later.|$|E
60|$|Curious {{as it may}} seem, none of the Baxter {{party had}} given a thought to the sled which Sam and Tom had had with them, and this had been left <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> at <b>the</b> spot where Husty had {{discovered}} the Rovers.|$|R

25|$|On 25 March 2010, iPlayer {{was added}} to TechniSat {{receivers}}, with an update for Harvard International receivers released on 31 March. However, the Harvard upgrade will not be available on early model standard definition Freesat receivers sold <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush,</b> Goodmans and Grundig brands. Harvard International is therefore offering a replacement high definition receiver to anyone affected. Panasonic had aimed to add iPlayer to all of its devices by October 2010, but support was only extended to the 2008 range in September 2011. LG {{have been unable to}} update their Freesat integrated LF7700 television and were offering a free Freesat set-top box, however this promotional goodwill gesture ended after a 6-month period. On 16 December 2010, BBC iPlayer was assigned to Freesat channel 901, in addition to access via the BBC Red Button.|$|E

2500|$|Some 70 U.S. {{cities have}} studied the idea of {{bringing}} back streetcars as transit, although to date the number {{that have come to}} fruition has been small.

However, under the Obama Administration, the FTA indicated it would provide funding for streetcar projects in cities interested in building new systems.|$|E
