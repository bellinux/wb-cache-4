40|$|In this paper, a multi-zone {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to predict the}} <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines. The boundaries of the <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> were determined by knock (presented by ringing intensity), partial burn (presented by combustion efficiency), and cycle-to-cycle variations (presented by the sensitivity of indicated mean effective pressure to initial temperature). By simulating an HCCI engine fueled with iso-octane, the knock and cycle-to-cycle variations predicted by the model showed satisfactory agreement with measurements made under different initial temperatures and equivalence ratios; the <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> was also well reproduced by the model. Furthermore, the model was applied to predict the <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> of the HCCI engine under different engine speeds by varying the intake temperatures and equivalence ratios. The potential to extend the <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> of the HCCI engine through two strategies, i. e., variable compression ratio and intake pressure boosting, was then investigated. Results indicate that the ignition point can be efficiently controlled by varying the compression ratio. A low load range can be extended by increasing the intake temperature while reducing the compression ratio. Higher intake temperatures and lower compression ratios can also extend the high load range. Boosting intake pressure is helpful in controlling the combustion of the HCCI engine, resulting in an extended high load range. ?? 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 45 - 54 With the {{continuing}} increase in energy demand, pipeline compressors are being challenged {{to cope with}} both large flow rates and broad <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> flexibility, driven by the local seasonal markets. Overall, high efficiency {{still needs to be}} maintained, as compressor efficiency will significantly impact on gas transportation cost. Those joint requirements call for significant improvements in pipeline compressor stage design. This intends to highlight the experience gained in the development of these challenging stages in a unique effort combining experimental and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies. In particular, the study started with the detailed testing of a conventionally designed stage. Careful comparison of CFD versus test results was followed by intensive activity coordinating between CFD and testing. The intent of those simulations was to identify the limits of this initial design and to indicate the guidelines for improvement. The massive use of state-of-the-art CFD allowed investigation on a large number of impeller configurations. Analysis of the numerical results suggested the possibility of significant <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> improvement with minimal penalty on efficiency and choke limit. An intensive experimental test campaign confirmed the validity of the new impeller design for improved <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> improvement but also highlighted the balance between efficiency and <b>operating</b> <b>range</b> requirements. A final optimization on a statoric component is then performed to get back to original efficiency while retaining increased <b>operating</b> <b>range...</b>|$|R
