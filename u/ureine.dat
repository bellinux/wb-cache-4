40|$|A quantitative, densitometric, {{thin layer}} chromatographic method has been {{developed}} for the determination of three clinically important monosaccharides in <b>ureine,</b> after desalting. The analysis of these monosaccharides in urine allows to observe the potential changes induced by antiinflammatories in human small intestine permeability. Xylose, 3 -O-methylglucose and rhamnose were estimated quantitatively in urine; arabinose was used as internal standard. The densitometry was performed at a wavelenght of 400 nm after a visualization reaction on HPTLC plates. In all cases, coefficients of variation of the method were less than 2. 7 %.
