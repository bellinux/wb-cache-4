40|$|Surfing Brilliant Corners details {{a decade}} of extreme global surf travel by {{professional}} longboarder Sam Bleakley, illustrated with stunning photographs by John Callahan. It takes surfing beyond the waves and packaged surf tourism to a wider sense of place and cultural identity. Sam travels from his birthplace in West Cornwall to Indonesia and the Philippines; through vibrant West African highlife in Ghana, to war-damaged Liberia; to Mauritania, where landmines litter access {{to some of the}} best waves on the planet; to a serene Buddhist oasis in Communist China; to Ecuador, Oman and Haiti, whose complex culture seeps into his psyche and captures his heart. He looks deep into the jet-black eye of a surfacing shark in Kenya, and faces a stacked set of foaming lips during typhoon surf in South Korea. Celebrating Thelonious Monk's 1950 s album Brilliant Corners, Sam explores how, like great jazz musicians, talented surfers <b>use</b> <b>invention,</b> complex rhythm, timing and spontaneity to turn impossible waves into beautiful and challenging music. 'Surfing,' he says, 'has opened me up, split my skin, widened my horizons, and closed me down, because any obsession restricts your involvement in other aspects of life. ...|$|E

50|$|In {{considering}} {{the requirement of}} utility for patents, there are three main factors to review: operability of the <b>invention,</b> a beneficial <b>use</b> of the <b>invention,</b> and practical <b>use</b> of the <b>invention.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cotton mills <b>used</b> <b>inventions</b> such as {{the steam}} engine and the power loom to pioneer the {{industrial}} factories of the 19th century, where precision machine tools and replaceable parts allowed greater efficiency and less waste. This experience {{formed the basis for}} the later studies of manufacturing engineering. Between 1820 and 1850, non-mechanized factories supplanted traditional artisan shops as the predominant form of manufacturing institution.|$|R

50|$|Although a {{prolific}} inventor, Gates considered {{himself to be}} a psychologist. He applied scientific experiment to introspection and <b>used</b> <b>invention</b> to examine the processes by which the mind discovers new knowledge. This study led him to “psychotaxis,” the integrated hierarchy of sensory discriminations required to create a valid and complete mental representation of a given part of the physical world. Psychotaxis is a major component of “psychurgy,” Gates's art of mind-using, which he regarded as an improved scientific method.|$|R

5000|$|Prior {{user rights}} defense: If an individual/entity begins <b>using</b> an <b>invention</b> ('user') {{more than a}} year before a {{subsequent}} inventor files for a patent on the same invention, then the user will have the right to continue <b>using</b> the <b>invention</b> in the same way after the subsequent inventor is granted a patent, as long as the user did not derive the invention from the subsequent inventor. These prior user rights are limited in scope and transferability, and have limited applicability to patents held by universities.|$|R

50|$|Existing invalidation {{mechanisms}} in the Patents Act 1990 seem to offer little {{assistance in the}} matter. Section 50(1)(a) of the Act gives the Commissioner of Patents the discretion to reject a patent application {{on the grounds that}} the <b>use</b> of the <b>invention</b> would be contrary to law. In deciding whether to exercise this discretionary power, an examiner must have close regard to whether an invention is primarily intended for an unlawful use. Gene patents are generally described to have a lawful <b>use</b> for their <b>invention,</b> thus they have not been excluded on this ground. As at May 2010, no Australian regulation makes the <b>use</b> of gene-related <b>inventions</b> unlawful.|$|R
