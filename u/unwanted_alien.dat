5000|$|Ravenor was {{a member}} of the Imperial Inquisition and part of the Ordo Xenos, tasked with keeping {{humanity}} safe from <b>unwanted</b> <b>alien</b> influences. Ravenor's body was woefully crippled, whilst he was still an Interrogator, during the atrocity of the Holy Novena on Thracian Primaris. He suffered 100% burns to his body among other injuries and the only way that medicaes could insert life-support equipment was to slice a hole in Ravenor's flesh where his mouth should have been. Ravenor now exists within the cocoon of a force chair where his already powerful psychic abilities (which became stronger to compensate for his crippled body), further boosted by built-in psi-amplifiers, allow him to function as a full Inquisitor, providing him with the ability to mind-speak to his agents as well as temporarily take control of their bodies, usually at the cost of rather painful and dizzying after-effects. In [...] "Ravenor", we learn that his Psychic capacity is between high-level delta and low-level gamma, this makes him one of the most potent psykers in the service of the Imperium. However, this is contradicted in [...] "Ravenor Rogue" [...] when Orfeo Culzean describes Ravenor as an [...] "Alpha plus psyker". This may be a typing mistake or Orfeo exaggerating Ravenor's abilities. Although in Ravenor it is mentioned that Ravenors force chair amplifies his already formidable powers. He also is able to read most people's minds as well as defeat all but the strongest psykers in single combat. He was an apprentice of the infamous Gregor Eisenhorn, who sponsored his promotion in 346.M41 ...|$|E

The last quarter of the nineteenth century was a turning point in which a more intervening alien policy took shape The seeds of the later protectionist policy were laid The workers protest of 1886 caused a regime crisis which stimulated the Catholic governments to intervene more strongly in society The interventionist state started a reorganisation of society on a national base Due to the deeper penetration of society by the state, Belgians increasingly came under the protection of the state, while foreigners were excluded from the state's benevolence. The new admission policy selected newcomers more thoroughly and the practice of border choice was abolished Expulsion mostly equalled repatriation For refugees, however, a very selective policy was developed The police had to verify systematically that an expellee was no refugee Several persecuted aliens were excluded from refugee protection because they adhered to subversive movements A refugee had to be respectable in order to be granted asylum in Belgium Only very few <b>unwanted</b> <b>aliens</b> were considered refugees As a minimal concession they had free border choice...|$|R

Specific TaqMan real-time PCR detection assays were designed to function under homogeneous conditions so that they may be used in 96 - or 384 -well plate format arrays for high-throughput testing of large numbers of samples against multiple targets. Assays were validated for 1) specificity, 2) sensitivity, 3) precision, and 4) robustness on environmental samples. All assays were highly specific when evaluated against a panel of pure cultures of target and phylogenetically closely-related species. Sensitivity, evaluated by assessing the limit of detection (with a threshold of 95 % of positive samples), was found to be between one and ten target gene region copies. Precision or repeatability of each assay revealed a mean coefficient of variation of 3. 4 %. All assays successfully allowed detection of target pathogen on positive environmental samples, without any non-specific amplification.

40|$|Between 1830 and 1952 alien {{legislation}} in Belgium {{changed from a}} liberal to a much more restrictive form of legislation. In 1939 a stricter 'decree-law on the alien police' replaced the liberal law of 1897, {{as a result of}} the pressure that had been accumulating since WW I from working class, middle class and government circles. It gave the executive power a large measure of authority over aliens staying in Belgium. After the war, the alien police remained in favour of the decree-law which was temporarily prolonged pending a new alien law. Only in march 195 1, the senate found the time to discuss alien legislation. The result of these discussions differed strongly from the project the government had originally drafted in December 1949. The Senate had taken into account not only the suggestions by the members of the executive power, but also those by Edmond Rouse, reporter of the senate committee of justice, who advocated alien rights against arbitrary governmental actions. Influenced by the administration, the Attorneys General of the Courts of Appeal and the Minister of Justice Pholien, the House of Representatives modified the bill in a restrictive way. After new delays, the Senate succeeded in cancelling some of the most restrictive articles, although overall the eventual Act remained very restrictive. This new alien law was clearly meant to protect the Belgian state against <b>unwanted</b> <b>aliens.</b> This can be explained by three contemporary phenomena: the predominant position of the executive power in the trias politica, the general mood of distrust because of the Cold War and the new guest worker policy, which consisted of treating aliens as purely economic assets. Equally important is the fact that the aliens themselves were not involved in the realization of the law and that only a few individuals were prepared to defend alien rights before parliament. Not until the 1970 s protest became strong enough to open up the possibility of change...|$|R
40|$|Background: The alien hand {{syndrome}} {{is a striking}} phenomenon characterized by purposeful and autonomous movements that are not voluntarily initiated. This study aimed to examine neural correlates of this rare neurological disorder in a patient with corticobasal degeneration and alien hand syndrome of the left hand. Methodology/Principal Findings: We employed {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to investigate brain responses associated with unwanted movements in a case study. Results revealed that alien hand movements involved a network of brain activations including the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, precuneus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. Conscious and voluntary movements of the alien hand elicited a similar network of brain responses but lacked an activation of the inferior frontal gyrus. The results demonstrate that <b>alien</b> and <b>unwanted</b> movements may engage similar brain networks than voluntary movements, but also imply different functional contributions of prefrontal areas. Since the inferior frontal gyrus was uniquely activated during alien movements, the results provide further support for a specific role of this brain region in inhibitory control over involuntary motor responses. Conclusions/Significance: We discuss the outcome of this study as providing evidence for a distributed neural network associated with <b>unwanted</b> movements in <b>alien</b> hand syndrome, including brain regions known to be related to movement execution and planning as well as areas that have been linked to inhibition control (inferior frontal gyrus) and experience of agency (precuneus) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The most {{widespread}} alien {{invasion in}} California are the non-native dominated an-nual grasslands that originated by both decimation of native perennial grasslands {{and the type}} con-version of native shrublands. This latter process continues today at an accelerating pace due to in-creasing fire frequency resulting largely from human carelessness. These alien dominated grasslands are in a quasi-equilibrium that is relatively resistant to recolonization by native shrubs but vulnerable to invasion by new noxious alien weeds. Prescription burning is widely considered an appropriate means of controlling new alien invasions in these annual grasslands, however, suc-cesses appear to be short-lived. It is argued that because the grasslands owe their origin to wide-spread disturbance, application of fire and other disturbances will never create equilibrium condi-tions necessary to keep <b>unwanted</b> <b>alien</b> species out. Eliminating noxious aliens targeted for removal will require {{an understanding of the}} ecological processes that created these communities that are so vulnerable to invasion. Limited use of disturbance that is applied in a manner that impacts target species more than potential competitors, coupled with active restoration of the native flora is hy-pothesized to be the only means of eliminating noxious species on a sustainable basis. ...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{assessment}} {{systems for}} introduced species {{are being developed}} and applied globally, but methods for rigorously evaluating them are still in their infancy. We explore {{classification and regression tree}} models {{as an alternative to the}} current Australian Weed Risk Assessment system, and demonstrate how the performance of screening tests for <b>unwanted</b> <b>alien</b> species may be quantitatively compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The optimal classification tree model for predicting weediness included just four out of a possible 44 attributes of introduced plants examined, namely: (i) intentional human dispersal of propagules; (ii) evidence of naturalization beyond native range; (iii) evidence of being a weed elsewhere; and (iv) a high level of domestication. Intentional human dispersal of propagules in combination with evidence of naturalization beyond a plants native range led to the strongest prediction of weediness. A high level of domestication in combination with no evidence of naturalization mitigated the likelihood of an introduced plant becoming a weed resulting from intentional human dispersal of propagules. Unlikely intentional human dispersal of propagules combined with no evidence of being a weed elsewhere led to the lowest predicted probability of weediness. The failure to include intrinsic plant attributes in the model suggests that either these attributes are not useful general predictors of weediness, or data and analysis were inadequate to elucidate the underlying relationship(s). This concurs with the historical pessimism that we will ever be able to accurately predict invasive plants. Given the apparent importance of propagule pressure (the number of individuals of an species released), future attempts at evaluating screening model performance for identifying unwanted plants need to account for propagule pressure when collating and/or analysing datasets. The classification tree had a cross-validated sensitivity of 93. 6 % and specificity of 36. 7 %. Based on the area under the ROC curve, the performance of the classification tree in correctly classifying plants as weeds or non-weeds was slightly inferior (Area under ROC curve = 0. 83 +/- 0. 021 (+/- SE)) to that of the current risk assessment system in use (Area under ROC curve = 0. 89 +/- 0. 018 (+/- SE)), although requires many fewer questions to be answered...|$|E
