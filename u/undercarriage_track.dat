5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and Spitfire, was a naval {{version of the}} Spitfire {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire. Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track,</b> which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E
2500|$|The M.52's design {{underwent}} {{many changes}} during development {{due to the}} uncertain nature of the task.

As the project progressed, an increase in total weight led to concerns that power would be insufficient; thus, the adoption of rocket assistance or extra fuel tanks were considered.

40|$|The {{point of}} the bachelor’s thesis is to recapitulate pieces of {{knowledge}} about types of crawler undercarriages to the weight of 10 tons, make survey of application various types of undercarriages for concrete types of machines, to give and confront properties of <b>undercarriages</b> and <b>tracks</b> {{in the light of}} weight of machine and operating specifications...|$|R
2500|$|Decking apart, the {{fuselage}} was a conventional spruce and plywood rectangular box structure, though wide at 42 in (1.066 m) {{even for a}} side-by-side seater. External longitudinal stiffeners ran along the sides. Access to the cabin was easy, with saloon car-type doors on either side and there was generous (10 cu ft or 0.92 m3) luggage space behind the seats. [...] Most flight controls were gathered on a central console, so that with double rudder bars and a T-shaped control column, the Bee could be flown from either seat. The cabin was glazed with Rhodoid (cellulose acetate). The main undercarriage wheels were {{in line with the}} wing leading edge, but largely within {{the fuselage}}, with only about 60% of the diameter showing below. Their shock-absorbing legs were also inside the fuselage. This arrangement had been used on very small aircraft such as the English Electric Wren, but it meant the Bee had a narrow <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> despite some toe-out. At the rear, the fuselage extended below the rudder for ease of handling. The tailplane and tabbed elevators were {{on the top of the}} fuselage proper, so the elevators were split to allow rudder movement. Control surfaces were not balanced.|$|E
50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was fixed and conventional, with mainwheels on split, cranked axles {{mounted on a}} central {{inverted}} strut-pyramid from the lower fuselage longerons. There were rearward drag struts to the longerons as well as rubber cord shock absorbing struts. The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> was 1.30 m. The PM X had a short, castering tailskid.|$|E
5000|$|The MiG-29K is {{drastically}} modified {{from the}} Mikoyan MiG-29M for naval operations. The airframe and undercarriage are reinforced {{to withstand the}} stress experienced upon landing. Folding wings, an arrestor hook, and catapult attachments were added for carrier operations; the aircraft's <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> was also widened. The MiG-29K, unlike the early MiG-29, can both conduct aerial refueling and [...] "buddy" [...] refuel other aircraft.|$|E

50|$|At 11:53 p.m., at the Mavis Road crossing, {{the damaged}} bogie (<b>undercarriage)</b> left the <b>track,</b> causing the {{remaining}} {{parts of the}} train to derail. The impact caused several tank cars filled with propane to burst into flames.|$|R
50|$|It was an amphibious aircraft; its {{landing gear}} had two {{retractable}} mainwheels {{and a small}} leaf spring tailskid. Two small, streamlined structures, each close to the fuselage side a little above the waterline and mounted {{on a pair of}} parallel struts from the forward wing spar, carried the undercarriage legs, a vertical shock absorber and a trailing arm meeting at the wheel axle, which could be rotated together to a horizontal position for touchdowns on water. The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> was 2.15 m. Fitting the wheeled undercarriage increased the weight by 155 kg and reduced maximum speeds by about 5 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The evenly-tapered wings had {{an aspect}} ratio of 7.2 with a gross area of 20 m² (215.28 ft²) and {{featured}} three spars; a Warren truss main spar and two auxiliary spars. The rear spar carried the split flaps and long, narrow-chord ailerons, while the front spar incorporated the undercarriage pivot points. The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> was relatively wide at 4 m (13 ft 1.5 in). Each wing had a partially self-sealing 190 L (50 US gal) fuel tank behind the main spar, just outboard of the fuselage. A single weapon (initially a 7.7 mm/0.303 in Type 89 machine gun) {{was able to}} be carried in a weapons bay located behind the main spar.|$|E
50|$|In landplane {{configuration}} the C.39 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. There were {{pairs of}} main wheels mounted on single axles attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine {{at each end}} on short, forward raked V-struts. To prevent nose-overs, there was a fifth wheel mounted under the nose. The wheels could be replaced by flat bottomed floats, each fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of inverted W-struts, one to {{each side of the}} float, assisted by an inverted V-strut from the inside edge to the wing root. Though in floatplane configuration the C.43 sat level over the water, the tailskid was joined by a small, cylindrical float to protect the tail at take-off. In either configuration the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> was 5.0 m.|$|E
50|$|La Mouette had a {{steel tube}} {{tailskid}} <b>undercarriage</b> with a <b>track</b> of 1.90 m. The mainwheels, enclosed by fairings {{were on a}} split axle from the fuselage centre, joined through rubber shock absorbers to faired-in V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons.|$|R
50|$|The DB-80 had a fixed, {{tailwheel}} <b>undercarriage</b> with <b>track</b> of 1.90 m.The mainwheels were independently mounted {{and fitted}} with brakes. Each axle was mounted {{at the lower}} vertex of a triangular box acting as a cantilever leg, with its upper side hinged from the fuselage longerons. The strengthened forward edge of the structure extended above the hinge and connected to an elastic block housed in a reinforced transverse beam which passed under the cockpit, incorporating shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|The MB.141 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} <b>undercarriage</b> with a <b>track</b> of 2.80 m; its main wheels were mounted on vertical, faired oleo struts and had brakes {{operated}} by a lever on the control column. Its small, castoring tail wheel also had a shock absorber.|$|R

50|$|The {{horizontal}} tail {{was mounted}} {{on top of}} the fuselage, braced from the lower fuselage longerons on each side with a pair of parallel struts. Its plan was similar to the wing and the elevators were split, with a cut-out for the deep, broad rudder. The tailplane angle of incidence could be trimmed in flight. The low area fin was broad but unusually low; its angle of incidence could only be adjusted on the ground. The H.28 had conventional, fixed, tailskid landing gear. Its mainwheels, half enclosed by individual semi-circular fairings, were on a single axle and rubber cord shock absorbers enclosed within a streamlined fairing mounted on the lower fuselage longerons by N-form struts and reinforced by the wing bracing struts. The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> was 3 m.|$|E

50|$|The Albatros L 59 was a single-seat German utility {{aircraft}} of the 1920s. It was a single-engine low-wing cantilever monoplane with large, spatted wide <b>track</b> <b>undercarriage</b> attached, unusually {{for the time}} not to the fuselage but to the wing roots. The whole aircraft was covered in 3-ply.|$|R
50|$|The NiD 740 had conventional, fixed, {{independent}} landing gear, {{with each}} wheel mounted at the vertex of a V-strut hinged {{on the central}} fuselage underside. These gave the <b>undercarriage</b> a <b>track</b> of 3.50 m and placed the wheels directly below the outer engines. Vertical sprung legs, fitted with Messier shock absorbers, joined wheels and the engine-bearing frames. The wheels had brakes (also by Messier) {{which could be used}} differentially for ground steering. There was a short tailskid below the rudderpost. A pair of searchlights were fitted close together below the nose to help with night landings.|$|R
5000|$|Excavators (Hydraulic Excavators) {{are heavy}} {{construction}} equipment {{consisting of a}} boom, dipper (or stick), bucket and cab on a rotating platform known as the [...] "house". The house sits atop an <b>undercarriage</b> with <b>tracks</b> or wheels. They are a natural progression from the steam shovels and often mistakenly called power shovels. All movement and functions of a hydraulic excavator are accomplished {{through the use of}} hydraulic fluid, with hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic motors. [...] Due to the linear actuation of hydraulic cylinders, their mode of operation is fundamentally different from cable-operated excavators which use winches and steel ropes to accomplish the movements.|$|R
50|$|The outer wings were mounted {{high on the}} {{fuselage}} sides, carried 3° of dihedral and were of parallel chord with rounded tips. Each was supported from below {{by a pair of}} struts mounted on the lower fuselage longeron. The fuselages were simple rectangular cross section structures, built around four longerons and tapering rearwards. They carried the horizontal tail surfaces, both between them and extending outwards. The angle of incidence of this 'fixed' tail could be adjusted in flight for trimming. It carried three linked and balanced elevators. Two rectangular fins carried balanced rudders. The DB-70 had a fixed conventional undercarriage with double mainwheels on V-shaped shock absorbing legs mounted on the lower longerons, with bracing struts to the centre of the centre section. This arrangement produced a wide <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> of 6.65 m (21 ft 10 in). Sprung tailskids were placed the extreme ends of each fuselage.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{powered by}} a nose mounted [...] Continental C90 {{air-cooled}} flat-four engine, driving a two blade, fixed pitch propeller. The forward and central sections of the fuselage were formed from a riveted light alloy girder frame with a metal skin. The centre section contained the fuel tank, which {{was an integral part}} of the structure supporting the seats and also, indirectly, the main wheel legs of the conventional, tail wheel undercarriage. Short, horizontal aerofoiled extensions from the front of the tank positioned these short, vertical legs safely beyond the cabin and tank, at the same time increasing the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track.</b> The two occupants sat side-by side under the wing leading edge with dual control columns unusually suspended from the roof for ease of access. The cabin had a single piece windscreen and three separate windows, decreasing in size rearwards, on each side; on the port side the forward window was part of a large door.|$|E
50|$|The MS.350 had a fixed {{tailskid}} <b>undercarriage</b> with a <b>track</b> of 2.50 m. Each mainwheel {{was mounted}} on a steel tube leg hinged on the lower fuselage longeron. Together with an oleo strut, each leg was enclosed in a fairing; the wheels also had fairings and were fitted with brakes. The tailskid was steerable.|$|R
50|$|The AL 3's elderly 1.3 m <b>track</b> <b>undercarriage</b> {{seen from}} ahead formed a splayed M-form set of rigid, {{longitudinally}} wire braced struts. The large diameter wheels were mounted on half axles, hinged at {{the centre of}} the M and joined to its outer members by rubber shock absorbers. A tall tailskid protected the rudder.|$|R
50|$|The Stomo 3 had a {{tailskid}} <b>undercarriage</b> with a <b>track</b> of 1.63 m, its vertical, bungee-damped main legs {{mounted on}} the wing centre section spar, close to the junction with the outer panels. The legs {{and much of the}} wheels were enclosed in fairings and a long, cantilever tailskid kept the rudder clear of the ground.|$|R
50|$|The Spitfire's {{original}} role, {{in which}} it proved formidable, was that of short-range land-based interceptor. As a carrier based fighter, the design was a compromise and suffered many losses through structural damage that was inflicted by heavy landings on carrier decks: a problem that continued even with the strengthening introduced by the Mk II. The Seafire had a narrow <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track,</b> which meant {{that it was not}} well suited to deck operations. The many modifications had shifted the centre-of-gravity aft, making low-speed control difficult and the aircraft's gradual stall characteristics meant that it was difficult to land accurately on the carrier, resulting in many accidents. Other problems included the basic Spitfire's short range and endurance (fine for an interceptor fighter but not for carrier operation), limited weapons load and that it was dangerous in ditching. The first Seafire variant to overcome many of these problems was the Mk XVII with its new undercarriage design, reinforced structure and extra fuel tanks, although there were still some compromises and it entered service well after the war was over.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{prototype}} of the Ki-60 emerged in March 1941 as a compact, all metal, stressed skin monoplane with a relatively deep fuselage (1.46 m) and tapered wings with rounded tips built around a system of three spars; a Warren truss main spar and two auxiliary spars. The rear spar carried the split flaps and long, narrow chord ailerons, while the front spar incorporated the undercarriage pivot points. The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>track</b> was 3 m. The pilot's seat was mounted high over the rear spar, giving the fuselage a distinctive [...] "humped" [...] profile; the hood featured a framed, rear sliding canopy and an elongated rear transparent section. The main coolant radiator was housed in a long ventral bath under the wing centre-section and central fuselage, while the oil cooler was mounted under the engine with a long air intake. The prototype was powered by an imported DB 601A as production of the Ha-40 had not yet started. A total fuel capacity of 410 l (90.2 Imp gallons)) was carried.|$|E
