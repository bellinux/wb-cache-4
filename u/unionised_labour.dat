The new party, whose leaders were of a lower class {{than those of the}} PNP, was supported by conservative businessmen and 60,000 dues-paying BITU members, who encompassed dock and sugar plantation workers and other unskilled urban labourers. On his release in 1943, Bustamante began building up the JLP. Meanwhile, several PNP leaders organised the leftist-oriented Trade Union Congress (TUC).

The annual number of man-days lost to labour disputes in early 1990s averaged around 27 million; by 2010, while Indian economy has grown significantly and Indian labour force has expanded, {{the average number of}} man-days lost has dropped by about 30%. The downward trend continues both in terms of number of disputes and lost man-days per dispute. For example, India experienced 249 disputes in the first 5 months of 2010, and 101 disputes in 2012 over the same period.|$|E
50|$|The Swiss {{economy is}} characterised by a skilled and {{generally}} 'peaceful' workforce. One {{quarter of the}} country's full-time workers are <b>unionised.</b> <b>Labour</b> and management relations are amicable, characterised by a willingness to settle disputes instead of resorting to labour action. They take place between trade unions and branch associations, that are themselves often grouped in Union of Employers, like the Fédération patronale vaudoise or the Fédération des Entreprises Romandes Genève. About 600 collective bargaining agreements exist today in Switzerland and are regularly renewed without major problems. However, there is no country-wide minimum wage across sectors, but some collective bargaining agreement may contain minimum wage requirements for specific sectors or employers. A May 2014 ballot initiative which would have required a Swiss minimum wage to 22 Swiss francs an hour (corresponding to a monthly income of about 4000 Swiss francs) failed to pass, gaining only 23.7% support on the ballot.|$|E
50|$|A {{distant cousin}} of Bustamante's, Norman W. Manley, {{concluded}} {{as a result}} of the 1938 riots that the real basis for national unity in Jamaica lay in the masses. Unlike the union-oriented Bustamante, however, Manley was more interested in access to control over state power and political rights for the masses. On 18 September 1938, he inaugurated the People's National Party (PNP), which had begun as a nationalist movement supported by the mixed-race middle class and the liberal sector of the business community with leaders who were highly educated members of the upper middle class. The 1938 riots spurred the PNP to <b>unionise</b> <b>labour,</b> although it would be several years before the PNP formed major labour unions. The party concentrated its earliest efforts on establishing a network both in urban areas and in banana-growing rural parishes, later working on building support among small farmers and in areas of bauxite mining.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of international trade on intermediate goods, the literature did not {{pay much attention to}} this aspect in determining the effects of trade liberalisation in the presence of labour unions. We take up this issue here and show the effects of trade liberalisation on the final goods and/or the intermediate goods, where the domestic firm pays unionised wage and imports intermediate goods from another country. We show that trade liberalisation on the intermediate goods (final goods) increases (reduces) the <b>unionised</b> wage, <b>labour</b> union’s utility and the domestic profit. Trade liberalisation on both the final goods and intermediate goods may either increase or reduce the domestic <b>unionised</b> wage, <b>labour</b> union’s utility and the domestic profit depending on the input coefficients and the initial tariff levels. Our qualitative results are robust with respect to the intermediate goods market structure, the pricing strategy of the intermediate goods producer, the union’s objective function and input substitution, yet they affect the results quantitatively.

We show that this conclusion does not hold for an economy with both competitive and unionised sectors, where the competitive wage rate provides the outside option for unionised workers. Even with non-distortionary profit taxation it is optimal for such an economy to tax capital if the revenue share of capital in the unionised sector is lower than the revenue share of capital in the competitive sector. This is because taxing capital income reduces employment and lowers the outside option of workers in the unionised sector with the latter effect being stronger. A capital subsidy should be granted if the opposite relationship in terms of revenue shares holds. optimal capital taxation, <b>unionised</b> and competitive <b>labour</b> markets, outside option...|$|R

40|$|In a {{model with}} a <b>unionised</b> {{immobile}} <b>labour</b> force we analyse how labour taxes and transfers towards unemployed workers are optimally cho- sen when a welfare maximising government faces oligopolistic and partly mobile firms. We consider two polar types of government: one whose objective consists of maximising the sum of domestic producer's and con- sumers' surplus and one that aims at maximising employed and unem- ployed workers' payoffs. We show that depending on the combination of foreign labour costs, the degree of domestic union bargaining power, and the sunk costs of relocation, the former type of government may choose to set taxes so as to induce an outward relocation of production.

Different societies have different labour market regimes or wage determination mechanisms.

40|$|Over the {{previous}} two decades, many OECD countries have lowered the degree of progressivity in their tax structures. In this paper, I investigate labour tax progression in a world characterised by a segmented labour market where the higher-paying jobs are rationed due to (i) oligopolistic market structures, (ii) insider-oriented unions and (iii) international offshoring. In this second-best world, a revenue-neutral decrease in the progressivity of the tax schedule promotes higher domestic (net-of-tax) wage inequality where a shrinking fraction of workers provides the tax revenue to finance the redistribution to an increasing share of lower-wage workers. However, as the tax reform involves {{an increase in the}} offshoring intensity, which may translate into a cost advantage for the domestic average consumer, the overall welfare effect is ambiguous. It is shown that the negative effects dominate if trade unions are sufficiently insider-oriented. relocation, <b>unionised</b> oligopoly, <b>labour</b> market segmentation, labour income tax progression, trade union preferences...|$|R

It has been highlighted in different literature that growth experience in the South Asian countries like India or Pakistan during liberalised regime have primarily been driven by the productivity take-off in the traded sectors. This theoretical analysis offers another attempt to predict the implications of technological progress in the traded formal sectors on informal wage, taking into consideration that real wage is a reasonable benchmark to measure the well-being of the economically marginalised people living under informal arrangements. The key model propositions are further exemplified by a sensitivity analysis using plausible ranges of parameter values for India. We also provide empirical evidence using data on twenty-seven Indian States (including one Union Territory) between 1989 and 2010 on informal wages, capital stocks in informal and formal zones and value-additions in the formal segment to substantiate the model prediction on informal wage depicted in our numerical exercise, which shows that the growth in informal wage could reasonably be linked to the productivity surge in the formal sectors, while greater capital accumulation in the informal units over the formal counterparts has further aggravated this upswing in informal wages. ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} labour markets, pension systems, {{and the interaction}} between the two. In the second chapter after the introduction we study the effects of fiscal changes in an overlapping-generations model. A labour tax increase reduces welfare more than a consumption tax increase and a tax swap makes all new-born generations better off. However, during transition it opens up a welfare gap between the retired (worse off) and the working (better off). In the third chapter we study the intergenerational effects of unemployment caused by wage rigidity on the accumulation of pension entitlements. We build an overlapping-generations model in which unions set the wages and firms pick employment. The pension system has an effect on steady state outcomes of labour market variables, but pension systems matter less for the transitional dynamics. The fourth chapter analyses euro area Beveridge curves over the past 25 years. We find an outward shift of the aggregate euro area, Spanish and French Beveridge curves since the onset of the crisis, but an inward shift for Germany. Examining the factors underlying the observed developments we find (tentative) evidence for skill, sectoral and geographical mismatch. In the fifth chapter we estimate wage equations to test for changes in the responsiveness of wages to unemployment using euro area panel estimates. Wages are less responsive at high levels of unemployment. Additionally, differences in bargaining position — in particularly differences between <b>unionised</b> vs. non-unionised <b>labour</b> and permanent vs. temporary jobs — explain {{a large part of the}} downward wage rigidity...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how foreign {{ownership}} of companies acting in Sweden has affected the employment and wage setup. Although Sweden has a tradition of labour market agreements such as collective bargaining between unions and employers, the assumption in the present paper is that foreign-owned firms are not as committed to this “social contract” as domestically owned firms are, which makes the threat of foreign-owned business activities moving out of Sweden credible. This line of reasoning reflects public debate on this issue. According to our hypothesis, then, foreign ownership will exert a downward pressure on wages in a <b>unionised</b> <b>labour</b> market.

In contrast, the union wage premium in open sectors and aggregate welfare are affected differently by {{the two types of}} globalisation.

Our results suggest that when working hours are endogenous, the relationship between the degree of centralisation and the labour tax rate is ambiguous. In particular, if the marginal utility from public provision is sufficiently low, centralised wage setting implies lower optimal tax rate on labour. This is due to a "budgetary discipline effect", which reduces the optimal tax rate preferred by the median voter under centralised wage setting. Taxation, wage setting, public expenditure. ...|$|E
