5|$|By {{the end of}} 1973, Sihanouk loyalists {{had been}} purged from all of GRUNK's {{ministries}} {{and all of the}} prince's supporters within the insurgent ranks were also eliminated. Shortly after Christmas, as the insurgents were gearing <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac'h. He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia's must now be totally dismissed. Stalinist Albania, he said, would be the model.|$|E
5|$|A Six Man Tag Team {{match between}} Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) {{and the team}} of Lance Hoyt and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart, was next. The match duration was 14 minutes and 44 seconds. Douglas scored a near-fall after Hoyt slammed Eric back-first to the mat. The Naturals set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> Natural Disaster tag team maneuver on Eric, however, Roode entered and bashed Douglas and Stevens with a megaphone. Eric then covered Douglas for the win.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Hokies's defeat, Virginia Tech chose to start a new quarterback and a new {{offensive}} plan. Behind freshman Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies rolled to five straight victories, including a win over No.22 Clemson by 18points. During the winning streak, Sean Glennon, who had started at quarterback for the Hokies during the first two games of the season, returned to alternate possessions with Taylor in an unusual two-quarterback system. On October 25, the Hokies had a chance to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> early-season loss to LSU when they faced No.2 Boston College on a Thursday night in Blacksburg, Virginia. Though the Hokies dominated for most of the game, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan managed a late-game comeback to win the game 1410 with 11seconds remaining.|$|E

5|$|Since it {{soon became}} obvious that the Japanese force had no air cover, the U.S. {{aircraft}} were able to set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> attacks without fear of opposition from Japanese aircraft. U.S. bomber and torpedo aircraft arriving over the Yamato group—after their two-hour flight from Okinawa—were thus able to circle the Japanese ship formation just out of anti-aircraft range in order to methodically set up their attacks on the warships below. The first wave of U.S. carrier planes were spotted by a Japanese lookout on the bridge at 12:32. Two minutes later, Yamato opened fire with her 460mm main batteries. The Japanese ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to , beginning evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their anti-aircraft guns. Yamato carried almost 150 anti-aircraft guns, including her massive 460mm guns.|$|E
5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind whipped up {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to pick it up. United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> team.|$|E

The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Jin {{had been}} afflicted by {{multiple}} revolts. In Manchuria, the Khitans, {{under the leadership}} of Yelü Liuge, declared their independence from the Jin and allied with the Mongols. Yelü was enthroned a puppet ruler subordinate to the Mongols in 1213, and given the title emperor of the Liao Dynasty. The Jurchen expedition sent against him commanded by Puxian Wannu was not successful. Wannu, realizing the Jin dynasty {{was on the verge of}} collapse, rebelled and declared himself king of Dazhen in 1215. Further south, rebellions had broken out in Shandong beginning with Yang Anguo's revolt in 1214. The rebels were known as Red Coats, from the color of the uniforms they wore starting in 1215. After the fall of Zhongdu in 1215, the Mongols downsized their war effort against the Jin, and shifted their resources in preparation for the invasion of Central Asia. The Jurchens tried to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> territorial losses to the Mongols by invading the Song in 1217. The invasion was fruitless, so the Jin wanted to negotiate for peace, but the Song rebuffed the offers. By 1218, Jurchen diplomats were prohibited from traveling to the Song. The Mongol war against the Jurchens had subsided, but not stopped, and went on through the early 1220s under the command of the general Muqali. Muqali died from sickness in 1223, and the Mongol campaigns against the Jin wound down. The Jin settled for peace with the Song, but the Song continued to assist the Red Coats insurgency against the Jin. Genghis Khan fell ill and died in 1227. Ögedei was his successor, and he renewed the war against the Jin in 1230.|$|E
