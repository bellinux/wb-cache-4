5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> but to many, {{it seemed as}} if it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 interview, Corey Taylor {{said that}} he only met Rubin four times during the entire {{recording}} process of Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses and that Rubin barely ever showed up to the studio: [...] "...we were being charged horrendous amounts of money. And for me, if you're going to produce something, you're fucking there. I don't care who you are." [...] He also added: [...] "He is overrated, he is overpaid, and I will never work with him again." [...] Conversely, Slipknot's guitarist Jim Root had said in that same interview that [...] "A lot of {{the guys in the}} band say Rick was unavailable. And yeah, he takes on a lot of projects at one time, but he also does things that are beneficial. He would listen to what we'd done, then have us retrack things that needed work. He's kind of like Big Brother <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Even though he wasn't there physically every day, he was. That's my favorite record we've done." ...|$|E
500|$|After six or so {{weeks on}} the trail, the brigades reached Saint Paul. There the carters camped on the bluff above the town growing on the riverfront. Not all was harmonious. To the locals, the swarthy-complected carters <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> had a [...] "devil-may-care" [...] aspect, with their [...] "curious {{commingling}} of civilized garments and barbaric adornments". [...] One trader from the north called his host city [...] "a wretched little village" [...] where [...] "drinking whisky seems to occupy {{at least half the}} time of the worth citizens", while the rest were [...] "employed in cheating each other or imposing upon strangers." [...] The economic benefits of trade, and the separation of the carters' camp from the village below, may have helped keep relations civil. After about three weeks of trading, the [...] "wild" [...] carters from the north, now laden with goods, took their leave of the [...] "den of blackguards" [...] that was Saint Paul, returning to what they felt was a more civilized world. Their erstwhile hosts, on the other hand, thought their visitors were returning to an uncivilized and frozen wilderness.|$|E

Go and observe the skies and see when the new moon will show her silver crescent"). The Druids pray that Norma will come and {{have the courage to}} broker peace with the Romans: (Druids and Oroveso: Dell'aura tua profetica / [...] "With thy prophetic aura, imbue her, O terrible God".) All leave to go to the temple.|$|E
2500|$|Some social {{conservative}} organizations, {{including the}} Family Research Council defended Akin. A {{spokesman for the}} Council said, [...] "We feel {{this is a case}} of gotcha politics...We know who Todd Akin is. We've worked with him <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> He's a defender of life." [...] A representative of the American Family Association cited Willke's 1999 article and said Akin [...] "was exactly right". In response to Republican demands that Akin resign, Personhood USA spokeswoman Jennifer Mason said that Akin's position [...] "is {{an integral part of the}} Republican Party platform, the same position that was held by President Ronald Reagan" [...] and that [...] " [...] are left with Reagan Republicans, who agree with the Republican Party platform on abortion, and Romney Republicans, a fringe group of liberals who compromise on human life." [...] Mike Huckabee supported Akin by soliciting donations for his Senate campaign and accused the Republican establishment of a [...] "carefully orchestrated and systematic attack." [...] He was also critical of the Republican Senatorial Committee for demanding Akin's resignation.|$|E

60|$|Weston said nothing, {{though he}} {{realized}} that the situation was becoming serious. They had had no more than one hasty meal since early morning, and they were worn out. It was also, as he knew, very cold <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> at night. While he considered the matter, Kinnaird stretched out a pointing hand.|$|R
2500|$|The Pontic forces, encamped in the valley, {{sent out}} {{numerous}} foraging parties which plundered and burned the countryside. Sulla {{was unable to}} defend the region with his far smaller force and instead was forced to stay camped <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Instead of remaining idle, Sulla ordered his men to dig entrenchments on the flanks to protect against possible envelopment by cavalry and also ordered the construction of palisades in the front to defend against the chariots. The exercise was twofold in intention, first Sulla sought to ensure the discipline of his soldiers and second, he hoped to tire the soldiers out so {{that they were more}} willing to battle. When his troops came to him requesting battle, Sulla challenged the men, citing that their new found will to fight was a response to inherent laziness to work, to occupy the hill of Parapotamii. The men agreed to this task, Archelaus had already marked the position for his own men and it became a race between Archelaus' and Sulla's men to occupy the position first. Baker describes this position as [...] "almost impregnable", the occupier {{had no choice but to}} turn eastward towards Chaeronea to advance and if action took place here, one army or the other would be fighting at an angle.|$|E

6000|$|... "Try and remember," [...] he said, [...] "how {{wonderful}} a {{day like}} this must seem to any one like myself, who has spent day after day for many months in Tooley Street.

60|$|And now, {{upon the}} left bank, they {{caught a glimpse}} of a white village, high <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> smothered among green trees.

Cold Branch had nothing in common with the frisky {{ambition}} of Okochee with its impertinent lake.|$|R

5000|$|When unarmed protesters {{crossed the}} {{perimeter}} fence {{to stop the}} bulldozers, the guards used pepper spray and guard dogs to attack. At least six protesters were treated for dog bites, and an estimated 30 were pepper-sprayed before the guards and their dogs left the scene in trucks.

2500|$|The {{vineyard}} soils of the Wachau are varied but consist {{primarily of}} rock outcrops with occasional layers of loess. The {{geography of the}} region is characterized by steep, rocky river banks (as steep as {{those found in the}} Mosel and CÃ´te-RÃ´tie) that have had vineyards terraced into <b>the</b> hillsides. Higher <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> <b>the</b> soils are rich in iron deposits and contain mixtures of gneiss, granite and slate. Closer to the river and in the flatter plains areas that dot the region, the soil is more alluvial with loess, sand and gravel. The heart of the Wachau district is the Vinea Wachau Nobilis Districtus which includes a strip of vineyard land that stretches [...] from the western extremity of Schwallenbach along the Danube through Spitz, Weissenkirchen, DÃ¼rnstein, Loiben and finally to Mautern. There are over 900 named vineyard sites in Wachau (known as Rieden). Among the sites that may appear on Wachau wine labels those of the Loibenberg, Kellerberg, Achleiten, Klaus and 'Singerriedel are the most noted.|$|R
