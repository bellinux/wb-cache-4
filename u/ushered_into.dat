5|$|On 23 June, Devitt, Taguchi and Hirooki Goto {{won their}} second J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament {{in a row}} by {{defeating}} the team of Giant Bernard, Jushin Thunder Liger and Karl Anderson in the finals of the three-day-long tournament. On 24 July, Devitt received his rematch for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship at a DDT event, {{but was unable to}} regain the title from Ibushi. This led to a match on 14 August, where Apollo 55 successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against the Golden☆Lovers. On 11 September, Apollo 55 defeated Taichi and Taka Michinoku to make their seventh successful IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship defense, breaking the record for most defenses during a single reign. When Kota Ibushi was forced to vacate the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship after dislocating his left shoulder, Devitt, as the previous champion, was <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> a decision match to determine a new champion. On 19 September, Devitt defeated Kushida to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. On 10 October at Destruction '11, Devitt and Taguchi lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to the No Remorse Corps (Davey Richards and Rocky Romero). Devitt made the first successful title defense of his second IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship reign on 12 November at Power Struggle, defeating Taka Michinoku, and followed that up by defeating the man who had pinned him for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, Davey Richards, in his second defense on 4 December. On 23 December, Devitt defeated the other half of No Remorse Corps, Rocky Romero, to make his third IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship defense. On 4 January 2012 at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, Devitt and Taguchi defeated Richards and Romero to once again regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, starting Devitt's record-breaking sixth reign as one half of the champions. On 12 February at The New Beginning, Apollo 55 lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship back to the No Remorse Corps in their first defense. This led to a match on 10 March, where Devitt defeated Davey Richards to make his fourth successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

25|$|The German {{officers}} {{returned the}} next day at 18:00 with an additional delegate, (Colonel Fritz Poleck) representing the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, (the German armed forces high command). Von Friedeburg was <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> Montgomery’s command caravan for confirmation that they were ready to sign. For the surrender ceremony Montgomery sat {{at the head of a}} table with an army blanket draped over it and two BBC microphones in front of him; he called on each delegate in turn to sign the instrument of surrender document at 18.30. The surrender ceremony was filmed by the British Pathé News and recorded for broadcast on radio by the BBC with a commentary by the Australian war correspondent Chester Wilmot.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony was celebrated {{with all due}} tradition in Esma Sultan Palace {{in the presence of}} Sultan's ministers in 1844. One week after that, she was <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> Esma Sultan's silver-lined carriage in her pearl-trimmed red dress, tiara and bridal veil and sent off to the palace. In those days Sultan Abdülmecid still resided in Topkapı Palace, and he greeted his bride at the main entrance gate into the harem, wearing a splendid uniform with an aigrette plump atop his fez. He took her by the arm and escorted her into the Sovereign's Hall in the palace harem, having her take a seat in the nook that had been prepared for the bride. Mahmud II's daughters and wives came in and joined in the ceremony, as did the wives of important personages.|$|E

25|$|The queue area {{winds through}} gardens filled with statues from many {{different}} countries up to the Hotel Hightower, where guests {{can see that the}} windows are almost completely shattered. Signs are posted all over the hotel front advertising the tour. Guests then enter the lobby, an elaborate and well-decorated room filled with plush furniture and beautiful art. On each ceiling arch is painted a mural of Hightower on one of his adventures, showing him escaping native people with a valuable artifact or item in his possession. At the end of the lobby is the elevator in its destroyed state, its doors left open with only a single plank of wood holding them together, a broken cable visible inside. Guests are then <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> a room filled with many pictures of Hightower, his expeditions, and his hotel.|$|E
25|$|Guests enter {{one of two}} rooms, {{either his}} office or the library, and in each room a large stained glass window depicts a {{confident}} Hightower with Shiriki Utundu sitting on a pedestal nearby. A tour guide talks about Hightower, then winds up an old gramophone that plays a recording of Hightower's last interview. At this point, the lights dim. Suddenly, the stained glass window changes to show a frightened Hightower holding the idol and then entering the elevator on that fateful night. It then shows {{the outside of the}} hotel as the elevator ascends. Suddenly, all the lights in the hotel go out, and there is a flash of green lightning, shattering the bottom of the window. At this point, Shiriki Utundu comes to life, looks around, laughs mischievously at the guests, and then vanishes into a star-field. A gray fog covers the window, which remains the same when the fog lifts. Guests are then <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> an enormous storage room where Hightower kept his treasures. There are multiple loading rooms on the second floor, each themed to a different type of item. One has swords, another has tapestries, the third has stone tablets and other valuable artifacts.|$|E
25|$|Heavensward {{opens with}} the Warrior of Light finally {{entering}} Ishgard proper. With Alphinaud and Tataru, they are <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> the manor of Count Fortemps, who impresses upon them his progressive {{views about the}} role of outsiders in turning the tide of the Dragonsong War. The hero begins by assisting Edmont's sons on missions in neighboring territories. Through these missions, the adventurer briefly chances upon Lady Iceheart, who appears remorseful for the heavy toll on Ishgardian lives in the latest attack, as well as the great flying whale Bismarck, the primal of the birdlike Vanu Vanu native to the Sea of Clouds. Upon returning to Ishgard, the Warrior of Light finds his fellow Scions accused of heresy by the Heavens' Ward, the Archbishop's honor guard. The player represents Tataru alongside Alphinaud in a trial by combat to prove their innocence. Victorious, they are invited to meet with the Archbishop who apologizes for his subordinates' lapse in judgment. In private, Thordan VII reveals that the Ascians offered him the power to continue the Dragonsong War, which he accepted, but that he also plans to betray them once he learns their secrets.|$|E
60|$|However, the Guiccioli book did {{not want}} for patrons in the high places of literature.

25|$|Fox Film {{songwriter}} Jay Gorney {{was walking}} out of the viewing of Temple's last Frolics of Youth picture when he saw her dancing in the movie theater lobby. Recognizing her from the screen, he arranged for her to have a screen test for the movie Stand Up and Cheer! Temple arrived for the audition on December 7, 1933; she won the part and was signed to a $150-per-week contract that was guaranteed for two weeks by Fox Film Corporation. The role was a breakthrough performance for Temple. Her charm was evident to Fox executives, and she was <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> corporate offices almost immediately after finishing Baby Take a Bow, a song and dance number she did with James Dunn. On December 21, 1933, her contract was extended to a year at the same $150/week with a seven-year option and her mother Gertrude was hired on at $25/week as her hairdresser and personal coach. Released in May 1934, Stand Up and Cheer! became Shirley's breakthrough film. Within months, she became the symbol of wholesome family entertainment. In June, her success continued when she was loaned out to Paramount for Little Miss Marker.|$|E
500|$|Riders {{are then}} <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> the {{pre-flight}} [...] "Funhouse" [...] room {{by a team}} member. Here, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a backstage area where Grampa and Maggie are told not to ride due to certain safety restrictions (Maggie doesn't meet the 40 inch height requirement, and Grampa has certain heart conditions that could be aggravated, which proves to be true as he suffers a heart attack, a stroke and a massive aneurysm while trying to deny that he has any heart conditions). Grampa suddenly falls asleep while Maggie crawls into a nuclear reactor room, causing her to grow larger. Meanwhile, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a ride room where he tells them to enjoy the ride, before Sideshow Bob appears, knocks Krusty out, and tells the Simpsons Family to enter the ride vehicle. Homer enters, followed {{by the rest of}} the family. Sideshow Bob then tells the Simpsons and the riders that they must watch a safety video from Itchy and Scratchy. The screen then displays a recap of the safety reminders (but showing Scratchy's attempts to follow the safety rules getting sabotaged by Itchy constantly), while riders are <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> the main ride room.|$|E
500|$|Guests {{are then}} <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> the {{building}} and into the retro-modern exhibit. The 1960s narration, however, is cut short by a MIB agent terminating the false program and issuing the [...] "recruits" [...] into Men in Black Headquarters. One of {{the walls of the}} exhibit splits, opening up into an elevator, which travels deep into the Earth. Guests who have an Express Pass and use it for this ride takes another entrance which, instead of riding the elevator, walk up a long hallway and meets the guests with no Express Passes after they have walked through the hallway. Single riders follow a third queue.|$|E
50|$|Al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din (1820 - June 8, 1890) was a {{claimant}} for the Zaidi imamate of Yemen in {{the years}} 1878-1890, acting {{in opposition to the}} Ottoman occupiers of the country. His period saw a tribal embryo of a state taking form in the highlands of Yemen, which would be strengthened by his successors as imams, and eventually <b>usher</b> <b>into</b> the expulsion of the Ottoman Turks in the early 20th century.|$|R
40|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, American {{wholesalers}} began increasingly {{to rely on}} credit-reporting agencies {{to provide information about}} customers in distant localities.

500|$|Six {{weeks after}} the birth, Rowe saw her son {{for the first time}} since his arrival into the world. She had met with Jackson to pose for {{photographs}} with their newborn son at a hotel. Upon arriving, Rowe was <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> the hotel room, where she was given the infant to hold and told to smile for the camera with Michael. Afterward, she was sent on her way. Rowe did not want to become too attached to Prince, as she felt it would make her situation harder to deal with. At Neverland, Prince was cared for by a team of six nannies and six nurses during his first few months. According to one nanny who worked at the Californian ranch, Prince Michael's mother was not a significant presence in the child's early life. [...] "I saw her maybe three times and she seemed very sullen." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{accompanied}} Lennon to America on {{the first}} Beatles' tour there, with Lennon allowing the press to photograph them together, which infuriated Epstein, as {{he had wanted to}} keep their marriage a secret. On the tour, she was left behind in New York when Lennon and the other Beatles were quickly <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> a car, and in Miami she had to ask the help of fans to convince a security guard who she was. Lennon's response was, [...] "Don't be so bloody slow next time—they could have killed you". It would be the only time Cynthia would go on tour with them. [...] At the Emperor's Gate address the situation grew worse, with fans sticking chewing gum in the lock of the flat and tearing at any article of clothing when she or Lennon were leaving or arriving. American girls would write her letters proclaiming their desperate love for John; the women {{in the lives of the}} other Beatles received equivalent missives. As late as 1967, Beatles' wives were still dealing with occasional physical danger from female Beatles' fans, with Cynthia being kicked in the legs by one who demanded she [...] "leave John alone!" ...|$|E
500|$|She is set {{firmly in}} the imperialist {{literature}} of the late-Victorian period. The so-called [...] "New Imperialism" [...] marking {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century witnessed a further expansion of British power, particularly on the African continent, and was characterised by a seemingly confident sentiment in the merits of empire and English civilisation. Thus She [...] "invokes a particularly British view of the world" [...] as Rider Haggard projects concepts of the English self against the foreign otherness of Africa. One such example occurs when Holly is first <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> the presence of Ayesha, walking into the chamber behind a grovelling Billali who warns Holly to follow his example, or [...] "a surety she will blast thee where thou standest". Indeed, She is preoccupied with stressing quintessential British qualities through the [...] "adventure" [...] of empire, usually in contrast to foreign barbarism. However, the notion of imperialism is further compounded by the figure of She, who is herself a foreign colonising force. [...] "In a sense then", writes Stauffer, [...] "a single property line divides the realm of Queen Victoria and that of She-who-must-be-obeyed, two white queens who rule dark-skinned natives of the African continent".|$|E
60|$|A negro {{answered}} the summons, and <b>ushered</b> him <b>into</b> a dingy parlor. Soon Dr. Karley, a dried-up, bald-headed, old man appeared.|$|R

60|$|As I {{could never}} hope to write any thing my self, worthy {{to be laid}} before YOUR MAJESTY; I think it a very great happiness, {{that it should be}} my lot to <b>usher</b> <b>into</b> the world, under Your Sacred Name, the last work of as great a Genius as any Age ever produced: an Offering of such value in its self, as to be in no danger of {{suffering}} from the meanness of the hand that presents it.|$|R
500|$|The 1934 film, Fashions of 1934 {{featured}} chorus girls wearing two-piece outfits which look {{identical to}} modern bikinis. In 1934, a National Recreation Association {{study on the}} use of leisure time found that swimming, encouraged by the freedom of movement the new swimwear designs provided, was second only to movies in popularity as free time activity out of a list of 94 activities. In 1935 American designer Claire McCardell cut out the side panels of a maillot-style bathing suit, the bikini's forerunner. The 1938 invention of the Telescopic Watersuit in shirred elastic cotton <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> the end the era of wool. Cotton sun-tops, printed with palm trees, and silk or rayon pyjamas, usually with a blouse top, became popular by 1939. Wartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942 the United States [...] War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction in the amount of fabric in women's beachwear. To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers produced two-piece suits with bare midriffs.|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to get to that place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I think with these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being <b>ushered</b> <b>into</b> a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E
