25|$|Mike Rawlins was a full-on Trotskyite in Till Death <b>Us</b> <b>Do</b> Part.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the spin-off In Sickness and in Health, Till Death <b>Us</b> <b>Do</b> Part was remade in many countries including Brazil, Germany (Ein Herz und eine Seele), the Netherlands (In Voor- En Tegenspoed), and is known to the United States as the show that inspired All in the Family.|$|E

25|$|Till Death <b>Us</b> <b>Do</b> Part is a British {{television}} sitcom that {{aired on}} BBC1 from 1965 to 1975. The show was first broadcast as a Comedy Playhouse pilot, then in seven series until 1975. Six {{years later in}} 1981, ITV continued the sitcom for six episodes, calling it Till Death.... The BBC produced a sequel from 1985 until 1992, In Sickness and in Health.|$|E
25|$|On All in the Family, Mike Stivic and Archie Bunker {{were always}} at odds and rarely got along. In Till Death <b>Us</b> <b>Do</b> Part, Alf and Mike, while never agreeing with each other, were civil {{to each other}} for the most part and often went to the pub together. Alf and Mike also {{attended}} the World Cup together and Mike was protective of his father-in-law.|$|E

Many productions, including those made in the <b>US,</b> <b>do</b> not advise AHA or SAG of animal use in films, {{so there is no}} oversight.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} BBC sitcoms Till Death <b>Us</b> <b>Do</b> Part was {{recorded}} before a live studio audience. The programmes were recorded onto 2-inch Quadruplex videotape. From 1966 to 1968 {{the show was}} transmitted in black and white. When the series returned in 1972, it was transmitted in colour. The opening titles/end credits of the first colour episodes originally used the b/w sequence from the '60s tinted in red, as seen on UKTV Gold repeats in 2006.|$|E

30|$|Second, the US {{unsuccessful}} {{intervention in}} Middle East affairs cannot {{be a strong}} evidence of US waning influence in the world.

The <b>US</b> power presence <b>did</b> contribute to the stability in Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait and South China Sea over the last few decades.|$|R

25|$|The United States and Israel do {{not have}} a formal treaty of alliance, as the <b>US</b> <b>does</b> with other nations, and it is under no {{obligation}} to come to Israel’s defense. However, the <b>US</b> <b>does</b> refer to Israel and other nations without treaties as allies. The US has supported Israel with foreign aid, providing nearly $3 billion in grants annually to Israel since 1985; Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid since World War II.|$|R
25|$|Most {{companies}} in Europe and the <b>US</b> <b>do</b> not use petroleum-powered forklifts, as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts.

Fuel cell-powered forklifts {{can be used in}} refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The FC units are often designed as drop-in replacements.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{his senior}} status in the CIA, Gates was close to many figures who played {{significant}} roles in the Iran-Contra Affair and {{was in a position}} to have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>do</b> everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the Sandinista government. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment of Gates for his Iran-Contra activities or his responses to official inquiries.|$|E
