50|$|At this point, most (if not all) {{districts in}} the region will have one <b>unassigned</b> <b>seat.</b> Each of these {{unfilled}} seats must be awarded {{to one of the}} remaining party-affiliated candidates. Each party's remaining candidates are sorted from most popular to least popular according to the percentage of votes they received in their districts. Seats are then tentatively assigned to the most popular candidates in each party. The number of seats assigned in this manner is the number of seats initially allocated to each party in Step 1, minus the seats each party received in Step 2.|$|E
5000|$|KTX fares were {{designed}} to be about halfway between those for conventional trains and airline tickets. The fare system implemented {{at the start of}} service in April 2004 deviated from prices proportional with distance, to favour long-distance trips. On April 25, 2005, fares were selectively reduced for relations under-performing most.From November 1, 2006, due to rising energy prices, Korail applied an 8-10% fare hike for various train services, including 9.5% for KTX. [...] The price of a Seoul-Busan Standard Class ticket increased to 48,100 won. [...] From July 1, 2007, KTX fares were hiked another 6.5%, while those for the slower Saemaeul and Mugunghwa services on the parallel conventional route were raised by 3.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. [...] However, new reduced weekday and <b>unassigned</b> <b>seat</b> fares were also introduced.|$|E

50|$|The December 3, 1979, {{concert at}} the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati was the 14th stop during The Who's 1979 world tour. Of the 18,348 tickets sold for the concert, 14,770 were for <b>unassigned</b> <b>seats</b> known as festival seating, {{obtained}} on a first-come, first-served basis. City officials had objected {{to the use of}} festival seating at the facility as early as October 1976.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, {{the city}} of Cincinnati {{permanently}} repealed its long-standing ban on <b>unassigned</b> <b>seating,</b> a move which has been criticized by some. The goal of lifting the ban was to attract more big-name acts. However, the city now mandates there must be nine square feet per person at a venue, {{and the number of}} tickets sold for each event is adjusted accordingly.|$|R
50|$|The {{families}} of the victims sued the band, concert promoter Electric Factory Concerts, and the city of Cincinnati. The suits were settled in 1983, awarding each of the {{families of}} the deceased approximately $150,000 ($ today), and approximately $750,000 ($ today) to be divided among the 23 injured. The city of Cincinnati also imposed a ban on <b>unassigned</b> <b>seating</b> on December 27, 1979, with minor exceptions, for the next 25 years.|$|R
5000|$|KTX {{offers two}} classes: First Class and Standard Class. Tickets also specify whether a seat is {{forward-facing}} or backward-facing {{according to the}} direction of travel. There are special reserved Family seats, which are grouped in four, including 2 forward-facing and 2 backward-facing seats. There are reserved <b>seats</b> and <b>unassigned</b> <b>seats.</b> [...] KTX trains have no restaurant cars or bars, only seat service. From 2006, one car of selected KTX services functions as a moving cinema.|$|R
50|$|Hoteling (also hotelling {{or office}} hoteling) {{is a method}} of office {{management}} in which workers dynamically schedule their use of workspaces such as desks, cubicles, and offices. It is an alternative approach to the more traditional method of permanently assigned seating. Hoteling is reservation-based unassigned seating; employees reserve a workspace before they come {{to work in an}} office. An alternate method of handling <b>unassigned</b> <b>seating</b> is hot desking, which does not involve reservations; with hot desking, a worker chooses a workspace upon arrival, rather than reserving it in advance.|$|R
5000|$|Franklin {{introduced}} more {{changes over}} the next few years, including holding services on Sunday morning (in addition to Saturday morning), <b>unassigned</b> <b>seating,</b> and an exchange of pulpits with out-of-town rabbis. He reached out to Orthodox and Conservative congregations, instituted an interdenominational community Thanksgiving service, and spoke often at church groups to attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} Jews and non-Jews. [...] Franklin was a popular Rabbi, the Temple congregation increased from 136 members in 1899 (Franklin's first year in the pulpit) to 422 in 1910. [...] In 1917, Beth El was the third largest Reform congregation in the country.|$|R
50|$|Rabbi Samuel H. Goldenson came to Rodef Shalom in 1918, a {{year after}} Rabbi Levyâ€™s {{untimely}} death. He instituted further reform, persuading members {{to give up their}} privately owned pews in favor of a more democratic system of <b>unassigned</b> <b>seats,</b> a decision that attracted many more members. After 16 years at Rodef Shalom, Rabbi Goldenson went to Congregation Emanu-El in New York.In 1934, Dr. Solomon B. Freehof became Rabbi of Rodef Shalom. In addition to regular preaching, Dr. Freehof wrote extensively on Jewish law and ritual and chaired the group that updated the Union Prayer Book. For more than 35 years, Dr. Freehofs weekly book review series attracted audiences of more than 1,500 Christians and Jews. He {{served as president of the}} Central Conference of American and the World Union for Progressive Judaism. His wife Lillian wrote many plays and novels and organized a Braille service group at Temple.|$|R
40|$|The midwestern synagogue is an {{evolving}} institution, reflecting the religious, aesthetic, economic, sociological, and philosophical metamorphosis of Jews in the American heartland. To understand the institution, we must investigate {{the nexus of}} architectural and social history, reading the synagogue as material culture. Drawing upon art historical and sociological models of change, this thesis employs tools from both approaches to determine that convergence between vastly different subgroups {{led to the formation}} of a cohesive American Jewry by 1945. Primary sources such as minutebooks, oral histories, photographs and blueprints were used, and extensive fieldwork in the Midwest revealed a wealth of building styles hitherto neglected. Between 1860 and 1880, Reform Judaism introduced innovations, like mixed seating, organs, and Sunday services, that shaped the concept of American Judaism for East Europeans who emigrated in the 1880 s and 1890 s. Architecturally and functionally, the immigrants' landsmenschaft shuls of 1880 - 1900 were re-creations of East European institutions. In the next generation, Conservative Judaism diffused to the Midwest and by the 1930 s there were a number of "synagogue centers. " To document stylistic and denominational variations, three case studies of Detroit area congregations, Beth El, Shaarey Zedek, and Bnai David, constitute an important part of this dissertation, supplementing and reifying more general observations on trends and revivals. Synagogue forms changed as synagogue functions, both latent and overt, changed between 1865 and 1945. American synagogues became family oriented, and hence spaces for all clienteles and types of activities were required. Some reforms, like <b>unassigned</b> <b>seats,</b> a new bimah-aron kodesh arrangement, and a pulpit, were gradually adopted by the more observant, even as Reform temples began retraditionalizing in the 1930 s. Consequently, by the 1940 s, there was a similarity in plan that transcended denomination. Buildings expressed the patriotism and prosperity of the congregants; they also reflected the competition between congregations to attract members by providing the most appealing facilities. While it had been easy to distinguish Reform temples from Orthodox shuls in the nineteenth century, it was much more difficult to do so by the 1940 s, after the extremes of both Radical Reform and landsmanschaften Orthodoxy had been eroded away by the moderating forces of American culture.
