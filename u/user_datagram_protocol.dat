5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the <b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E

However, {{it has also been}} implemented with datagram-oriented transport protocols, such as the <b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (UDP) and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), usage of which has been standardized independently using the term Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).|$|E

30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{numerical}} {{approach is}} to analyse the multi-layered and real-time properties of the coding schemes described in Section “Forward error correcting coding schemes for safety data dissemination”. The transport protocol used for the safety messages is the <b>user</b> <b>datagram</b> <b>protocols</b> (UDP) that has minimal latency as compared to normal data transfer using transmission control protocol (TCP). In TCP, reliability is usually provided by retransmission and congestion control mechanisms. However in safety broadcast applications using UDP transport, reliability {{is measured by the}} average frame (source block) packet reception rate pSB, which is an estimate of the probability that a vehicle will successfully receive at least one ACN safety message. Latency is measured by average end-to-end source block delay, τSB which is defined as the total time from when the ACN packet is generated by the tagged vehicle until it is successfully received at the receiver. Measurements in [37] show that the processing delay from raptor encoding and decoding procedure is no longer than 1 ms and fast implementations of raptor codes chipsets are readily available on the market. Thus, this processing delay is not taken into consideration for the raptor codes end-to-end delay calculation. Throughput is not of primary importance for short length VANETs safety messages and therefore it is not used as a performance metric in this analysis.|$|R
25|$|The {{protocol}} {{is usually}} {{described in terms}} of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive timestamps using the <b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (UDP) on port number 123. They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} streaming applications require timely {{delivery of}} information and often can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal. For example, loss of a packet in audio application may result in loss of {{a fraction of a}} second of audio data, which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness. Instead the majority of the RTP implementations are built on the <b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (UDP). Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP, although, , they are not in widespread use.|$|E

40|$|Datagram Retransmission (DGR) is a {{computer}} program that, within certain limits, ensures the reception of each datagram transmitted under the <b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> Protocol/Internet <b>Protocol.</b> [User <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (UDP) is considered unreliable {{because it does not}} involve a reliability-ensuring connection-initiation dialogue between sender and receiver. UDP is well suited to issuing of many small messages to many different receivers. ] Unlike prior software for ensuring reception of UDP datagrams, DGR does not contribute to network congestion by retransmitting data more frequently as an ever-increasing number of messages and acknowledgements is lost. Instead, DGR does just the opposite: DGR includes an adaptive timeout-interval- computing component that provides maximum opportunity for reception of acknowledgements, minimizing retransmission. By monitoring changes in the rate at which message-transmission transactions are completed, DGR detects changes in the level of congestion and responds by imposing varying degrees of delay on the transmission of new messages. In addition, DGR maximizes throughput by not waiting for acknowledgement of a message before sending the next message. All DGR communication is asynchronous, to maximize efficient utilization of network connections. DGR manages multiple concurrent datagram transmission and acknowledgement conversations...|$|R
40|$|A decoder was {{developed}} that decodes a serial concatenated pulse position modulation (SCPPM) encoded information sequence. The decoder takes as input {{a sequence of}} four bit log-likelihood ratios (LLR) for each PPM slot in a codeword via a XAUI 10 -Gb/s quad optical fiber interface. If the decoder is unavailable, it passes the LLRs {{on to the next}} decoder via a XAUI 10 -Gb/s quad optical fiber interface. Otherwise, it decodes the sequence and outputs information bits through a 1 -GB/s Ethernet UDP/IP (<b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> Protocol/Internet <b>Protocol)</b> interface. The throughput for a single decoder unit is 150 -Mb/s at an average of four decoding iterations; by connecting a number of decoder units in series, a decoding rate equal to that of the aggregate rate is achieved. The unit is controlled through a 1 -GB/s Ethernet UDP/IP interface.

2500|$|The <b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> is a {{connectionless}} datagram protocol. Like IP, it is a best effort, [...] "unreliable" [...] protocol.

2500|$|The Internet {{protocol}} suite does not presume any specific hardware or software environment. [...] It only requires that hardware and a software layer exists that {{is capable of}} sending and receiving packets on a computer network. As a result, the suite has been implemented on essentially every computing platform. A minimal implementation of TCP/IP includes the following: Internet Protocol (IP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), <b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (UDP), and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). In addition to IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Internet Protocol version 6 requires Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), ICMPv6, and IGMPv6 and is often accompanied by an integrated IPSec security layer.|$|E
30|$|AAL 2 /ATM (ATM Adaptation Layer 2) or UDP/IP (<b>User</b> <b>Datagram</b> Protocol/Internet <b>Protocol)</b> {{are used}} as {{transport}} protocols; in Figure 1 the UDP/IP/Ethernet solution is depicted as an example. In case of the AAL 2 /ATM transport solution, the DFs are segmented to AAL 2 Common Part Sublayer (CPS) PDUs. These CPS PDUs are then fit into one or two ATM cells. There is no early packet discard for AAL 2 queues, consequently {{the end of the}} DFs can be lost, while the beginning of the DF is still using the TN capacity. We call these DFs destroyed frames. This behavior can be disadvantageous in case of system overload. Detailed description of AAL 2 /ATM can be found in [21]. In case of UDP/IP, the DFs to be transmitted can be larger than the maximum transfer unit (MTU) of the system, especially in case of high throughput. In this case IP fragmentation is needed and DFs might be destroyed like in case of AAL 2 /ATM. In most of the cases, however the size of the DF is smaller than the MTU and then a DF is either completely lost or transmitted. In case of UDP/IP the most commonly used Layer 2 protocol is Ethernet, but other L 2 protocols are possible, for example, Multi-Link Point-to-Point Protocol (MLPPP).|$|R
