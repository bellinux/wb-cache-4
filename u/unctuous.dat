Five years later Eckhart made a debut as an <b>unctuous,</b> sociopathic ladies' man in LaBute's black comedy film In the Company of Men (1997). Under LaBute's guidance {{he worked in the}} director's films Your Friends & Neighbors (1998), Nurse Betty (2000), and Possession (2002).|$|E

Initially Lara is repelled by the thought, but she finally accepts and eventually uses her sexual power to seduce and ultimately control him.|$|E
500|$|But Charles Stinson of the Los Angeles Times was notably unimpressed by the film: [...] "The uncredited [...] {{scenario}} violates Poe's gothic {{style with}} passages of flat, modernized dialogue…But the [...] {{of the script}} pale beside the acting…Price mugs, rolls his eyes continuously, and delivers his lines in such an <b>unctuous</b> tone that he comes near to burlesquing the role. His mad scenes are just ludicrous. The audience almost died laughing." ...|$|E
500|$|After this failure, Gasper {{returned}} to her blog to argue there were [...] "far too many homosexual comedians on TV", focusing her criticism on Graham Norton, [...] "the horrid little Alan Carr", and [...] "the <b>unctuous</b> Stephen Fry [...] portly, preening and self-satisfied." [...] She also posted that homosexuals were not persecuted {{anywhere in the world}} and that claims to the contrary, such as those regarding the murders of Matthew Shepard and David Kato, were [...] "fraudulent". Pink News, she said, operated as a [...] "mafia" [...] and had placed the actor Rupert Everett on its [...] "hit list", forcing him to obtain police protection. In October 2014, Pink News founder Benjamin Cohen claimed this constituted libel and threatened legal action against her. Gasper responded that she did not simply stand by what she had said, but that she was [...] "proud of it and I have morality on my side".|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{prominence}} as a statesman, Hay has had {{a number}} of biographers in the century since his death. [...] Sloane suggested that early biographers, aware {{of the nature of the}} novel's themes, were defensive in their treatment of it. [...] Lorenzo Sears, for example, who wrote of Hay in 1915, called The Bread-Winners one of several [...] "waifs and strays" [...] of Hay's literary career. Dennett, writing in 1933, deemed the book Hay's honest effort to set forth a problem he could not solve. Other historians were more hostile: Vernon L. Parrington in 1930 called it a [...] "dishonest book" [...] and [...] "a grotesque fabric smeared with <b>unctuous</b> morality". More recently, Gale (writing in 1978) described it as [...] "a timely, popular and controversial novel that still rewards the sympathetic reader", while Hay's most recent biographer, John Taliaferro (2013) deemed it [...] "certainly no love letter to [...] ".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, McCormack co-starred in the A {{television}} miniseries The Andromeda Strain, {{a remake}} of the 1971 movie {{based on the novel}} by Michael Crichton. In the miniseries, he played Jack Nash, a television reporter who battles an addiction to cocaine. The Andromeda Strain received mixed reviews, and McCormack's performance was criticized. Joanna Weiss of the Boston Globe wrote, [...] "The presence of Eric McCormack, as an intrepid TV reporter, is especially extraneous (no disrespect to intrepid reporters)." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented, [...] "The central cast is completed by... poor Eric McCormack as a crusading, coke-addicted journalist who spends {{the second half of the}} movie playing Rambo in the desert. Let's just say McCormack does the best he can with what he's given, and leave it at that." [...] On September 5, 2008, McCormack made a guest appearance in the seventh season and 100th episode of the television series Monk, where he played an <b>unctuous</b> host of a television crime docudrama.|$|E
500|$|McDiarmid's {{performance}} as Palpatine was generally well received by critics. Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "Entertaining {{from start to}} finish and even enthralling at times, 'Sith' has some acting worth writing home about, specifically McDiarmid's dominant turn as the mastermind of the evil empire." [...] A reviewer for The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Ian McDiarmid's <b>unctuous</b> Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life." [...] Still, his performance was not without detractors; David Edelstein of Slate critiqued, [...] "McDiarmid isn't the subtlest of satanic tempters. With his lisp and his clammy little leer, he looks like an old queen keen on trading an aging butt-boy (Count Dooku) for fresh meat [...] which leaves Anakin looking more and more like a 15-watt bulb." [...] McDiarmid had expressed interest in reprising the role of Palpatine in the planned [...] TV series, which remains unproduced.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt's Shakespearean {{criticism}} {{continued to}} find some acceptance from then on, yet a stigma still hung about his character, and his criticism was often judged to be overly emotional and [...] "impressionistic". This attitude changed only gradually. In 1955, René Wellek, in his history of literary criticism in all Western culture for the previous two centuries, largely supported these earlier views. Characters, to him, centres excessively on Shakespeare's characters and, worse, Hazlitt [...] "confuses fiction and reality" [...] and discusses fictional characters {{as though they were}} real people. Yet he also notes, a half-century after Saintsbury, and following Schneider's lead, that for all of Hazlitt's impressionism, [...] "there is more theory in Hazlitt than is generally realised." [...] He also thought that Hazlitt shows considerable [...] "psychological acumen" [...] in explaining certain types of characters, such as Iago, and that Hazlitt's [...] "character sketch of Iago is superior to Coleridge's". He also praises Hazlitt's freedom, in Characters and elsewhere, from [...] "the defects which infected his nearest critical rivals, Johnson and Coleridge: chauvinism, prudery, and <b>unctuous</b> sermonising. [...] He is free of the prudery which in his day pervaded English culture." ...|$|E

2500|$|This [...] "all-over" [...] glazing {{technique}} {{seems to}} have been invented at the Ru kilns, and increased the resemblance of the wares to jade, always the most prestigious material in Chinese art. Another element in this resemblance was the [...] "thick <b>unctuous</b> glaze texture", which has been described as [...] "like lard dissolving not flowing", [...] The most admired type of jade was known as [...] "mutton fat".|$|E
2500|$|Buechner has {{occasionally}} {{been accused}} of being too [...] "preachy;" [...] a 1984 review by Anna Shapiro in the New York Times notes [...] "But for all the colloquialism, there is something, well, preachy and a little <b>unctuous</b> about making yourself an exemplar of faith. Insights that would do for a paragraph are dragged out with a doggedness that will presumably bring the idea home to even the most resistant and inattentive." [...] The sentiments expressed by Cecelia Holland's 1987 Washington Post review of Buechner's novel, Brendan, are far more common. She writes,"In our own time, when religion is debased, an electronic game show, an insult to the thirsty soul, Buechner's novel proves again the power of faith, to lift us up, to hold us straight, to send us on again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dearth's {{works from}} the 1890s to the early 1900s show {{him to be the}} {{landscape}} painter of considerable delicacy, refinement, and imaginative feeling. Paintings such as Springtme Montigny (1899) and Montigny (1898) exemplify his conscientious regard for the facts of nature, combined with a notable faculty for their poetic interpretation in artistic terms. His pictures are full of light and atmosphere, and no matter how brilliant his color schemes, the result is a subtle depth of tone instead of hardness. When Boulogne Harbor was exchanged for Cornelia in Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Times critic commented that [...] "the two pictures seen together would have formed an extraordinary commentary on the completeness and rapidity of a style change possible to an impressionable painter". [...] In the works dating from 1912 and beyond, he freely used pure color spots and splashes in order to render what he saw so that the paintings display great harmony and are pervaded with a rich, <b>unctuous</b> feeling.|$|E
2500|$|Pliny also {{cites the}} opinion of Nicias, {{according}} to whom amber:is a liquid produced by the rays of the sun; and that these rays, {{at the moment of}} the sun's setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an <b>unctuous</b> sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of Germany. Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is [...] "produced by the Sun", Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of succinum (sūcinum, from sucus [...] "juice"). He writes: Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, and is gradually hardened [...] Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of [...] "succinum" [...] and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, {{is the fact that it}} emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood.He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber, by saying that [...] "in Syria the women make the whorls of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of harpax [...] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues." ...|$|E
