40|$|Control over {{structural}} and electronic properties of graphene samples {{is necessary for}} the fabrication of nano-electronic devices. Here we report the results of first-principles quantum-mechanical studies on the growth and doping of graphene nanoribbons (GNR). We find that hydrogenation of open-ended carbon nanotubes (CNT) can lead to successive breaking of tip C-C bonds. If enough hydrogen atoms are supplied then the CNTs <b>unzip</b> <b>to</b> GNRs with specific widths and edge morphologies. We also examine the possibilities that ammonia-related species can inject carriers in graphene. We show that NH 3 molecules have a complex dynamics on graphene. Annealing in ammonia can result in the formation of donors on the graphene basal plane, or the de-activation of dopants on graphene and at GNR edges. The results explain available experimental data and suggest new ways to optimize the properties and performance of GNR-based systems. ©The Electrochemical Society...|$|E

40|$|A new {{route for}} the {{synthesis}} of high glass transition temperature, thermally stable polymer foams with pore sizes in the nanometre regime has been developed, using compositionally asymmetric microphase-separated block copolymers where the minor component (poly(α-methylstyrene)) is thermally labile and the major component (polyimide) is thermally stable. The minor component can <b>unzip</b> <b>to</b> its monomer upon heating, and the decomposition products can diffuse out of the film, leaving behind pores embedded in a matrix of the thermally stable component. In this study, the polyimide block was crosslinked with ethynyl functionalities to obtain a stable porous structure. The decomposition of the α-methylstyrene in the block copolymer was studied by thermogravimetric, dynamic mechanical and thermomechanical analyses. Mild conditions were required to avoid rapid depolymerization of the α-methylstyrene and plasticization of the polyimide matrix.

40|$|A new {{route to}} high-Tg, {{thermally}} stable polyimide foams has been developed. Foams were prepared by casting microphase-separated graft copolymers comprising a thermally stable main chain, polyimide, and a thermally labile graft, poly(α-methylstyrene).

This can <b>unzip</b> <b>to</b> its monomer upon heating, and the decomposition product diffuses out of the film, leaving pores embedded in a matrix of the thermally stable component.

The decomposition of the α-methylstyrene in the block copolymer was studied by thermogravimetric, dynamic mechanical and thermomechanical analyses.

40|$|New routes for the {{synthesis}} of high T-g thermally stable polymer foams with pore sizes in the nanometre regime have been developed. Foams were prepared by casting well-defined microphase-separated block copolymers comprising a thermally stable block and a thermally labile material. At properly designed volume fractions, the morphology provides a matrix of the thermally stable material with the thermally labile material as the dispersed phase. Upon thermal treatment, the thermally unstable block undergoes thermolysis generating pores, {{the size and shape}} of which are dictated by the initial copolymer morphology. Several labile blocks were surveyed including polystyrene, poly(alpha-methylstyrene) and several alpha-methylstyrene/styrene copolymers. Each of these polymers can <b>unzip</b> <b>to</b> its monomer upon heating; however, the rate is substantially slower for polystyrene. The copolymers were synthesized through either the poly(amic acid) precursor, followed by chemical imidization to the polyimide form, or the poly(amic alkyl ester) precursor followed by thermal imidization.

Elsewhere, Miocene arc-related calc-alkaline andesite dikes which intrude the ophiolitic rocks contain zircons which yield mean 206 Pb/ 238 U ages of 20. 1 ± 0. 2 and 19. 8 ± 0. 2  Ma. The ophiolite gabbro and the andesites both contain rare inherited zircons ranging from 122 - 104  Ma. The Early Cretaceous zircons in the arc andesites are interpreted as xenocrysts from the Mt. Camel basement terrane through which magmas of the Northland Miocene arc lavas erupted. The inherited zircons in the ophiolite gabbros suggest that {{a small fraction of}} this basement was introduced into the suboceanic mantle by subduction and mixed with mantle melts during ophiolite formation. We postulate that the tholeiitic suite of the ophiolite represents the crustal segment of SSZ lithosphere (SSZL) generated in the southern South Fiji Basin (SFB) at a northeast-dipping subduction zone that was initiated at about 35  Ma. The subduction zone nucleated along a pre-existing transform boundary separating circa 45 - 20  Ma oceanic lithosphere to the north and west of the Northland Peninsula from nascent back arc basin lithosphere of the SFB. Construction of the SSZL propagated southward along the transform boundary as the SFB continued to <b>unzip</b> <b>to</b> the southeast. After subduction of a large portion of oceanic lithosphere by about 26  Ma and collision of the SSZL with New Zealand, compression between the Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate was taken up along a new southwest-dipping subduction zone behind the SSZL. Renewed volcanism began in the oceanic forearc at 25  Ma producing boninitic-like, SSZ and within-plate alkalic and calc-alkaline rocks. Rocks of these types temporally overlap ophiolite emplacement and subsequent Miocene continental arc construction. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|The BNNRs were arduously {{produced}} by these methods which have certain disadvantages, {{such as the}} presence of complicate pre-production step, the necessity of special equipment, and skill. For example, in case of plasma etching method with alkali metal intercalation [10], the BNNTs should be embedded into polymer matrix on a Si substrate. For expanding intercalated potassium method, high temperature furnace above 1500  °C is required [16]. Several researchers including our group have studied simple ways of producing BNNRs without using pre-production step, special treatment, and equipment. Our group discovered that longitudinally unzipped BNNTs can be produced via alcoholysis using alcohol with long alkyl chains under sonication because the chemical interaction between boron atom of BNNTs and oxygen atoms of alcohol lead to generation of alkyl chain-connected BNNRs [17]. However, alkyl chains attached on BNNR edges largely deteriorate their chemical reactivity. Thus, a more desirable method of producing chemically active BNNRs should be developed.
