5|$|Coming {{into his}} sophomore season, Stastny {{admitted}} the pressure would increase during the year. He continued the strong finish of his rookie year, by scoring his first career hat-trick against Marty Turco of the Dallas Stars in the season's first game and scoring five {{points for the}} first time four days later, against the San Jose Sharks. He scored 15 goals and had 28 assists in his first 34 games of the season, and had his 100th NHL point in his 99th NHL game. At the same time, Stastny hit a slump, during which he had one point in eight games. With the Avalanche having lost top players Joe Sakic and Ryan Smyth to injuries, Ryan Kennedy of The Hockey News pointed to Stastny's inconsistency and wrote it was time for Stastny to step <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> a leader in all aspects. Despite being on the longest scoreless streak of his career, which lasted 10games, on January 11, 2008, the NHL announced Stastny would play at the 56th National Hockey League All-Star Game. He scored two goals and three assists in three games before the Colorado Avalanche announced six days later that Stastny would miss approximately 2–3 weeks, including his first All-Star Game to have his appendix removed. After recovering from the surgery and returning to skating, he suffered a groin injury during a practice, delaying his return. Stastny ended up missing 15 games, but he scored a goal on his comeback against the Phoenix Coyotes on February 22. He scored seven goals and had 15 assists {{until the end of the}} regular season, missing a game due to flu on March 20. With 71 points scored, he finished the regular season as the team's scoring leader and the Avalanche finished 6th in the West, progressing to the playoffs to play against the Minnesota Wild. Stastny failed to score a point until the fifth game, when his game-winning goal gave the Avalanche the lead in the series. Colorado ended the series by winning the sixth game and progressed to meet the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Semifinals. Stastny scored a goal and an assist in the first game of the series, but a depleted Avalanche team was swept in four games. Stastny missed the last game of the series after he injured his knee during the first period of the third game.|$|E

Enrollment protects the softer body parts below the exoskeleton, while the spherical shape offers the least resistance to wave action.|$|E
25|$|Dana X. Bible became Texas A's {{head coach}} in 1919, leaving LSU, and under his tutelage the Aggies {{compiled}} a record of 72–19–9 in ten seasons. Bible's 1919 Texas A Aggies football team, which was undefeated, untied, and outscored its opposition 275–0, was retroactively named a national champion by the Billingsley Report and the National Championship Foundation. In the 1922 Dixie Classic, Bible made his most visible and lasting impression in his A career when he began the Twelfth Man Tradition. Bible had a roster of only eighteen players, who had to play both offense and defense against the heavily favored Centre College. He lost three players to injuries early in the game, but the Aggies took the lead. Fearing more injuries and a possibility of having to forfeit the game for lack of men, Bible called upon a reserve halfback, E. King Gill, {{who was in the}} press box running stats for the team, to suit <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> ready if needed. The Aggies wouldn't need Gill's help to win, but since then A students stand throughout football games to show their willingness to play if needed. Bible departed the Aggies after the 1928 season to accept the Nebraska head coaching position. After Bible's departure, A brought in Matty Bell from TCU to lead the Aggies football program. Under Bell's tutelage, the Aggies compiled a record of 24–21–3. However, the Aggies did not play up to the standards set by Dana Bible's tenure, and Bell had left for SMU after five seasons.|$|E

Kendrick mentioned that he wanted a song to be at the end credits of a movie and that [...] "lit [...] up".|$|E

[...] The two named the studio [...] "Stankonia", a word created by André 3000 as a combination of the words [...] "stank", a slang synonym for [...] "funky", and [...] "Plutonia", the title of a poster in his bedroom depicting a futuristic city.

500|$|After Till went missing, a three-paragraph {{story was}} {{printed in the}} Greenwood Commonwealth and quickly picked up by other Mississippi newspapers. They {{reported}} on his death when the body was found. The next day, when {{a picture of him}} his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them smiling together appeared in the Jackson Daily News and Vicksburg Evening Post, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame at the people who had caused Till's death. One read, [...] "Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> counted' before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction." [...] The letter said that Negroes were not the downfall of Mississippi society, but whites like those in White Citizens' Councils that condoned violence.|$|E

I started getting records immediately after that." [...] By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as [...] "mesmerizing... like someone from another planet." [...] After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School.|$|E

500|$|... "Til It Happens to You" [...] is {{a somber}} tune {{featuring}} orchestral production and soaring strings. The pop ballad delivers an empowering message: [...] "Hold your head <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> strong / When you fall you gotta get up", {{and has been}} described as [...] "stirring and emotional". Featuring a classical production, the song emphasizes Gaga's vocals, keeping focus on the lyrics, which clarifies that one cannot understand the feelings of a victim unless they have been in similar situation. The first verse is sung by Gaga in a vulnerable voice, which gradually changes into an aggressive tone, and finally a joyous one during the final lyrics. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] is set in the time signature common for a slow tempo of 59 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor with Gaga's vocals spanning from E3 to D5. The song follows a basic sequence of Am–C–Fmaj7–C–G/B as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|The Mansion Of Happiness was {{designed}} by George Fox, a children's author and game designer in England. The first edition, printed in gold ink [...] "containing real gold" [...] using one copper plate engraving and black ink using a second copper plate engraving, produced a few hundred copies. Water coloring was used to complete the game board, making a brilliant, colorful, and expensive product fit for the nobility. Later in 1800, a second edition was printed, probably for rich but common folk. Only one copper plate was used to print black ink and no water coloring was used. The game must have become quite popular in England as a third edition was printed using two copper plates, one for black, and the second for green lines to indicate blank spaces. Water colors were added to make a beautiful product. Laurie and Whittle published all three editions in 1800. On all three editions George Fox was listed as the inventor and the game honored the Duchess of York. In the first edition, gold not only added color and price but homage to royalty. In all three editions, the paper was glued to linen so it could fold <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> inserted into a heavy attractively labeled cardboard case.|$|E
500|$|Darren's ex-girlfriend, Suzanne, returns, {{pregnant}} by Darren with twins. Dawson said, [...] "At first [...] doesn’t {{believe her}} and he thinks it's a wind-up. When she threatens {{to go back to}} Spain he realises it's not what he wants and he stops her. He decides to man <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> a dad to his kids". A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and it gives him a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for [...] "Father of the year". The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne £200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself. Suzanne accepts the money and leaves, taking Francine and Jack with her and leaving Darren heartbroken.|$|E

500|$|Series writer Brian Peterson {{discusses}} how {{the writing}} staff chose {{to develop the}} character: [...] "In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which is, to me, {{one of the best}} aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but as the one who is constantly going to butt heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later." [...] For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White—an additional character established in season three's [...] "Perry"—then they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming [...] "the reporter we all know and love". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the [...] "black and white" [...] mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to realize that there is sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to [...] "step it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> more involved". In this case, Lois is acting more mature, taking charge in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he wants to have a life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois. As Durance explains, [...] " [...] got her confidence as a journalist and on the inside, she's going oh my god I'm truly in love with , more in love than I've ever been with anyone." ...|$|E
