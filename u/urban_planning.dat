5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and <b>urban</b> <b>planning.</b> Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{approaches}} {{the importance and}} role of <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> in spatial planning. Generally, these plans have {{the character of a}} specific regulation, establishing rules and outlining directives for the development of localities, determining the areas to be built and the areas with no constructions in a certain locality, assigning the functions in localities, thus influencing the development and organization of the territory. Any construction or any investment is {{made on the basis of}} such a <b>plan</b> (General <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan,</b> Zonal <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan,</b> and Detailed <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan)</b> following the legislation and the plans for that specific territory at that moment. The wider territorial plans (plans made for the national territory or at a county scale) and the present urban legislation regulate the manner of intervention on a territory through <b>urban</b> <b>plans.</b> However, the <b>urban</b> regulations apply differently according to the specificity of the rural area, taking into account the cultural influences, the traditions, customs, the relief forms, population, etc. (i. e. the General <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> for Săvădisla – Hungarian influences in land <b>planning,</b> the General <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> of Râşca, the General <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> of Unguraş – planning influenced by the landscape). The Zonal <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> and the Detailed <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> are documents that have the role of modifying the regulations of the general <b>urban</b> <b>plan,</b> establishing new requirements for building regime and spatial arrangement (ex. Zonal <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> of Călăţele holiday village - planning of a tourist area), taking into account the area’s specificity and the needs of the community, the territorial offer etc. The <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> can contribute to the spatial development of a locality by setting the functions and facilities, yet they can also restrict and limit the way in which a rural locality develops...|$|R

40|$|Traditional <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> have {{definitive}} design systems, {{without the}} flexibility required {{to deal with}} the complexity and change that characterise  contemporary urban societies. To provide <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> with increased flexibility, it is proposed a design methodology capable of producing various design solutions instead of a specific definitive design. The methodology uses shape grammars as a process for generating urban design. In this approach, design becomes a system of solutions rather than a specific one.   Through the analyses of a group of <b>urban</b> <b>plans,</b> a design methodology was sketched in which rules are used to enable more flexibility. These plans where chosen for their perceived qualities in terms of language, planning efficiency, and latent flexibility. As a result, a four-phased methodology was identified and thus, proposed for designing <b>urban</b> <b>plans.</b> This methodology was then combined with shape grammars and tested in a design studio setting. Students were asked to use the methodology and shape grammars as auxiliary instruments in the design of a flexible plan for a new town. In the following year, to simulate real-world conditions and oblige students to consider urban ordering and scale, work was structured differently. First, students were asked to develop a rule-based <b>urban</b> <b>plan</b> as in the previous year. Second, they were asked to conceive a detail plan for a sector of an <b>urban</b> <b>plan</b> defined by another group of students following its rules. The plans were then analysed with the goal of refining the methodology.   Results show that shape grammars produce <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> with non-definitive formal solutions, while keeping a consistent spatial language. They also provide plans with explicit and implicit flexibility, thereby giving future designers a wider degree of freedom. Finally, they provide students with a concrete methodology for approaching urban design and foster the development of additional designing skills...|$|R
5|$|Due to the Soviet {{principles}} of <b>urban</b> <b>planning,</b> Žirmūnai, {{according to the}} 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates (the other two being Karoliniškės and Viršuliškės) with the lowest percentage of single-family housing in the city (0.1%). Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments. The scarcity of lots means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, {{there were only a few}} modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.|$|E

Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today.

5|$|Kolkata is {{administered}} by several government agencies. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation, or KMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 15boroughs, which together encompass 141wards. Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets. As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC. The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.|$|E
