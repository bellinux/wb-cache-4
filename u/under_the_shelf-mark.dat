40|$|This article {{examines}} an Arabic {{version of the}} Tale on Macarius the Roman, the well-known apocryphal writing which belongs, according to its contents, not only to hagiographic literature, {{but also to the}} genre of itineraries. It was identifi ed for the fi rst time in the manuscript collection of lives of saints, kept in the Library of the Academia Romana in Bucharest <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf-mark</b> B. A. R. Mss orientale 365 and dated from the late 18 th century AD. A possibility of existence of one more copy of that work in the Monastery of Balamand is pointed out, but the details of its description given in the relevant catalogue are not enough for a well-founded conclusion on that matter. The article makes a comparison of the Arabic version with the Greek original and the Slavonic version and demonstrated some specifi c features of the translation from Greek into Arabic, in particular frequent transitions from literal rendering to free retelling of the contents. An assumption is made that the scene of the appearance of Christ in glory to the saint, which occupies the central place in the text, was composed under the infl uence of the tendency towards exaggerations, proper to the Orient, which was revealed by Boris A. Turayev in Coptic and Ethiopian literatures. In its fi nal part the article gives a brief survey of spelling peculiarities, typical of Middle Arabic (in the first instance, Christian Arabic) texts. They are connected with some changes both in phonology, fi rst of all with the disappearance of interdental consonants, and in morphology (the loss of case endings) ...|$|E
40|$|Stephen Bing (1610 - 1681) {{has been}} {{established}} {{as one of the}} most prolific music copyists of the seventeenth century. His career as a cathedral musician stretched from his training as a chorister in Canterbury Cathedral to his death while working as a lay vicar at Westminster Abbey, a span of sixty-three years encompassing the Laudian Revival, the Interregnum, and the Restoration. He worked with many of the important musicians in English cathedral music during this time, including George Jeffreys, John Barnard, William Turner, William Tucker, John Blow, and Henry Purcell. During the last thirteen years of his life, Bing was engaged in a unique copying project, now known as the 'Bing-Gostling Part books', housed at York Minster Library <b>under</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>shelf-mark</b> M. 1. S. This complete set of eight books represents a personal collection of the music Bing had access to as a copyist during those years. Researchers have previously used the Bing-Gostling Part books as a source of specific and isolated anthems and as a way to date Purcell's early works, or mentioned them in a few paragraphs as part of the story of Bing's life. This study investigates the set of part books as an entity in their own right. It contextualises the part books in light of contemporary surviving sources, and in relation to Bing's life as a working cathedral musician. Bing's detailed marginalia are explored as the basis for a study of the transmission of cathedral repertoire during the Restoration...|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} now, the National Library of Serbia {{is dealing with}} the problem of storage {{capacity}} of its Holdings. As the additions to the stack-room are still representing an uncertain and long-lasting project Experts of the National Library of Serbia were forced to find a solution which will, in relatively short time, give more free space available within the stack-room. The expert working group has prepared the Project for solving this problem of storage capacity of Funds of the National Library of Serbia. At the meetings of the Expert-Scientific Council of the NLS, several decisions were made regarding the solving of this problem. This Paper gives the analysis of the current state and the overview of the project realization through several phases: 1. The verification of signature marks of the primary fund of monographic publications at the level one of the main stack-room; 2. The decision about the rectification of the current way of allotting <b>the</b> <b>shelf-marks</b> to <b>the</b> coherent application of the numerus currens storage system; 3. The decision about decreasing the number of needed publications copies within the Holdings; 4. The decision about automatic allotting of the call-numbers within the electronic catalogue of the National Library of Serbia; 5. The decision about the "compression" of the primary fund of monographic publications at the level one of the main stack-room; 6. The decision about borrowing publications to employees of the National Library of Serbia for internal purposes; 7 The decision about managing the topographic catalogue in the future; 8. The analysis of the reference fund at the third level of the stack-room. The experts evaluation is that after the realization of this Project and due to the "compression" of the fund, will be obtained about 30 % of free storage space. In addition to this Paper are given the "Rules for allotting call-numbers and the organization of the Fund of monographic publications within the National Library of Serbia", which were adopted at the Expert-Scientific Council of the NLS, in May 2005...|$|R

6000|$|For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> LAW, OR <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, {{where the}} Apostle, {{speaking}} before of sins against the law, {{and of the}} denunciations thereof against those that are in that condition, he saith, [...] "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law"; mark, [...] "it saith to them who are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God" [...] (Rom 3:19). That is, all those that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again he saith, [...] "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law" [...] (Gal 5:18). Implying again, that those which are for sinning against the law, or {{the works of the}} law, either as it is the old covenant, these are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, and not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace. Again he saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of <b>the</b> law are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse" [...] (Gal 3:10). That is, they that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse; for mark, they that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace are not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse. Now, there are but two covenants, therefore, it must needs be that they that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, seeing those that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> other covenant are not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse, but <b>under</b> <b>the</b> blessing. [...] "So, then, they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," [...] but <b>the</b> rest are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law (Gal 3:9).|$|R
