40|$|Hollow axles, widely {{employed}} in High Speed and Very High Speed railways applications, are typically inspected by the ultrasonic testing method applied using a suitable boreprobe roto-translating along the longitudinal bore. Different ultrasonic transducers, emitting shear waves at 2 - 4 MHz and at different refraction angles in steel, {{are used to}} inspect the whole external surface of the axle in order to individuate cracks and defects at press-fit seats and at the body, especially along geometrical transitions. The structural integrity of the wheel-set is then based, together with other factors, on the efficient and reliable determination of the Probability of Detection (POD) curve of the boreprobe. For a given probes configuration, the POD curve is function of <b>UT</b> <b>equipment,</b> its calibration and its inspection parameters, therefore the same <b>UT</b> <b>equipment</b> could develop different POD curves {{as a function of}} the operating procedure normally defined by wheel-set manufacturers or end users. It is then important to split the absolute performances of the <b>UT</b> <b>equipment</b> by the different performances obtainable with different calibration and operation procedures. In order to derive such curves, a statistically representative sample of natural defects is needed. For this purpose, ten full-scale hollow axles, made of a quenched and tempered alloyed railway steel, were fatigue tested using a dedicated bench in order to develop two natural fatigue cracks in each of them. Different artificial defects were also introduced on the external surface on one of the axles by EDM. A total set of 28 semi-circular defects (17 natural and 11 artificial) was then obtained in a range of depths from 0. 4 mm to 12 mm. Such a set allowed the experimental derivation of the POD curve of the boreprobe following the “signal response” approach. A general analysis of different calibration method leads to a comparison between different POD obtainable with the same UT inspecting device. A final part of the research consisted in the optimization of the boreprobe itself, by means of suitable numerical simulations, in terms of frequency, dimension of the transducer, angle of refraction and location of the defect/crack...|$|E
40|$|Inserve Inspections (ISI) {{of primary}} {{components}} are {{of great importance}} in the safety concept for German LWRs. Mechanized ultrasonic inspections {{play a major role}} within the ISI framework. Requirements in terms of scope and experience with ISI have been reported earlier. The ultrasonic techniques that had been used for many years utilized multichannel <b>UT</b> <b>equipment,</b> recording maximum amplitudes and corresponding time-of-flight gates. The measured data were presented in computer processed C-Scans with additional time-of-flight evaluations of indications in B-Scan representations (TIM-LOK techniques). The defect classification capabilities of our UT ISI technique have been proven in PISC I, PISC II and other round robin tests...|$|E
40|$|In metals {{ultrasonic}} waves attenuate {{in different}} ways. The attenuation {{can be divided}} in different categories: geometrical attenuation due to beam spreading due to the finite aperture of the transducer, scattering, and absorption. The scattering is caused mainly by grain boundary scattering and thus the grain size affects strongly the attenuation. Both the average grain size {{and the distribution of}} grain size have to be taken into account. Additionally the surface finish of the component affects amplitude variations in ultrasonic inspections. Not only the RMS-value of the surface roughness does play a role but also the form of roughness. This is not often recognized in inspections. Also the stress state of the component will affect the attenuation of ultrasonic waves mainly via the absorptive part (i. e. internal friction) of the material. In the copper components examined here, the grain size can vary locally between 50 µm to 2000 µm. Due to this large variation in the grain size distribution, the ultrasonic testing demands greater efforts than in normal polycrystalline materials, where the grain size is small compared to the ultrasonic wavelength. The used frequencies for copper in ultrasonic inspections vary between 1 MHz to 5 MHz and the corresponding wavelengths between 4. 70 mm and 0. 94 mm for longitudinal waves and between 2. 26 mm and 0. 45 mm for shear waves. This means that {{at least part of the}} grain sizes in the copper components examined are comparable to the ultrasonic wavelengths. Rarely higher frequencies than 5 MHz are used in thick copper component inspections because of their high attenuation. The attenuation in the copper components follows two regimes: Rayleigh scattering and resonance scattering, which both have different functional dependencies. The thickness calibration of the ultrasonic equipment is carried out with reference specimens. The time-of-flight is only little affected by the attenuation of the reference specimen, and hence they may serve well for the calibration of the time scale of the <b>UT</b> <b>equipment,</b> but the sensitivity calibration for the inspection is as important as the time-scale calibration. To get comparable inspection quality, the reference specimen should have similar attenuation than the component under test. Eight standard reference specimen made from copper were measured and the attenuation in these specimen were compared to each other. Additional nine reference specimens with variable grain size were also manufactured to study the effect of grain size on the attenuation. The grain size variation in these specimens was between 60 µm to 800 µm. The initial structure of the grain size of oxygen free copper after hot rolling was modified with variable hot pressing reduction from 20 % to 61 %. The evaluation of the average grain size is according to ASTM standards. The manufacturing goal was to produce a grain-size distribution as homogenous as possible. Studies of the attenuation of these samples are reported in this paper. The measured attenuation is compared to theories known in the literature. The attenuation is evaluated to optimize the ultrasonic inspection of copper components including their electron-beam welds (EB-welds) using phased array techniques. Similar copper samples have been studied by Stepinski...|$|E
50|$|Vision - The {{successor}} to the Export and Session series drums. Vision drums originally came in 2 varieties: the VLX Lacquer finish drums and the VSX wrapped drums. Over time, the VBX (Vision Birch), VMX (Vision Maple), and VX series drums {{were added to the}} line, with the VLX being the only discontinued line. VSX and above drums feature two-ply heads and Uni-Lock tom holders (VSX and VBX drums are 900 Series, while VMX drums are 1000 Series). These drums feature new lugs and the new 900 Series hardware as standard equipment,except the vmx, which only ships with tom arms and floor tom legs. For 2011, the Vision line receives new badges and the VX, VSX, VBX, and VMX lines are succeeded by the VB (Vision Birch), VBA (Vision Birch Artisan), VBL (Vision Birch Lacquer), and VML (Vision Maple Lacquer) lines, respectively. Also, all Vision drums are now 6-ply drums, dropping the 6/8 formula from the previous lineup. For 2012, all Vision series drums (VB, VBA, and VBL) now come with Remo heads as standard <b>equipment</b> (<b>UT</b> Pinstripe on toms, UT Powerstroke on bass drums). These are made in China. The VML line was discontinued for 2013, making the VBL the highest-end of the Vision series.|$|R
