2500|$|There was a {{shift in}} {{emphasis}} in treatment over several centuries. A section of the Neijing Suwen including Chapter 74 was added by Wang Bing [...] in his 765 edition. In which it says: 主病之謂君，佐君之謂臣，應臣之謂使，非上下三品之謂也。 [...] "Ruler of disease it called Sovereign, aid to Sovereign it called Minister, comply with Minister it called Envoy (Assistant), not <b>upper</b> <b>lower</b> three classes (qualities) it called." [...] The last part is interpreted as stating that these three rulers are not the three classes of Shénnóng mentioned previously. This chapter in particular outlines a more forceful approach.

60|$|Section 2. Comparing {{the general}} build, of a dog-fish {{with that of}} a rabbit, we notice the absence of a {{distinct}} neck, and the general conical form; the presence of a large tail, as considerable, at first, in diameter as the hind portion of the body, and of the first importance in progression, in which function the four paddle-shaped limbs, the lateral fins, simply co-operate with the median fin along the back for the purpose of steering; and, {{as a consequence of the}} size of the tail, we note also the ventral position of the apertures of the body. The anus, and urinary and genital ducts unite in one common chamber, the cloaca. Behind the head, and in front of the fore fin (pectoral fin), are five gill slits (g.s.) leading from the pharynx to the exterior. Just behind the eye is a smaller and more dorsal opening of the same kind, the spiracle (sp.). On the under side of the head, in front of the mouth, is the nasal aperture (olf.), the opening of the nasal sac, which, unlike the corresponding organ of the air-frequenting vertebrata, has no internal narial opening. There is, however, a groove running from olf. to the corner of the mouth, and this, closing, in the vertebrate types that live in air and are exposed to incessant evaporation of their lubricating secretions, constitutes the primitive nasal passage. The limbs are undifferentiated into <b>upper,</b> <b>lower,</b> and digital portions, and are simply jointed, flattened expansions.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{possible}} {{effect of}} the various meteorological variables on the incidence of <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> respiratory tract infections (RTIs) has intrigued the scientific community for decades. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis regarding the association between meteorological variables and clinical data for <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> RTIs {{in the area of}} Attica, Greece. ResultsThere was a statistically significant (P< 0. 001) negative correlation between weekly average temperature with the proportion of weekly house call visits resulting in a diagnosis of <b>upper</b> or <b>lower</b> RTIs 4 days later (R=− 0. 56 and − 0. 71 for <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> RTIs, respectively) as well as 7 days later (R=− 0. 57 and − 0. 71 for <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> RTIs, respectively) and during the same day (R=− 0. 55 and − 0. 68 for <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> RTIs, respectively). In addition, there was a negative correlation between weekly wind chill average (and minimum) temperature as well as a positive correlation of relative humidity with <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> RTIs. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between wind speed and <b>upper</b> or <b>lower</b> RTIs. ConclusionsThe findings suggest that house call visits due to <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> RTIs increased as the average temperature in the area of Attica decreased...|$|R
