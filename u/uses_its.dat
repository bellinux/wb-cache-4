5|$|Despite Winmark's {{specializing in}} used goods, its stores sell new goods too. Through its many stores, Winmark <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> buying power to {{negotiate}} competitive {{prices for the}} stores' new goods. It also teaches franchisees about the used goods industry and offers pricing software to establish standards for the used goods they purchase.|$|E

5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> truthful historical backdrop to tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Rowling {{established}} the Volant Charitable Trust, which <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> {{annual budget of}} £5.1million to combat poverty and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one parent families, and multiple sclerosis research.|$|E
5|$|Larger elasmobranchs, such as hammerhead sharks, prey on the bluespotted stingray. The rays {{coloration}} is {{a warning}} for the highly venomous barbs, thus few animals attempt to overpower this ray. The hammerhead shark <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> head to pin down the bluespotted stingray, while it is in shock and much weaker.|$|E

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture forages {{using its}} keen {{eyesight}} to locate carrion on the ground, but also <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> sense of smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting {{the scent of}} ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.|$|E
5|$|An insect <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E

5|$|Kratos gains {{control of}} Danaus' head and <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> power against Alrik, who is {{torn apart by}} rocs. Having also been covered with the Ambrosia, Alrik is revived only to be killed once again until the Ambrosia is spent. Kratos then escapes and returns to Sparta with the Ambrosia, saving his daughter, and giving the King of Sparta {{the rest of the}} elixir, who then officially awards Kratos the rank of Captain in the Spartan Army. Bitter at having lost the wager, Hades resurrects Alrik, who becomes King after his father dies and swears vengeance against Kratos.|$|E
5|$|Manchester's civic {{leadership}} {{has a reputation}} for business acumen. It owns two of the country's four busiest airports and <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> earnings to fund local projects. Meanwhile, KPMG's competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world, and fiscal devolution has come earlier to Manchester than to any other British city: it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, TSN {{parent company}} Bell Media {{announced}} that it had acquired exclusive Canadian rights to The Masters beginning 2016 under a multi-year deal. Broadcast television coverage will move to co-owned broadcast network CTV, while TSN <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> expanded five-channel service to carry supplemental feeds (including the Amen Corner feed and early coverage of each round) that were previously exclusive to digital platforms.|$|E

50|$|While {{swimming}} about reefs, {{this fish}} will <b>use</b> only <b>its</b> pectoral fins. Only when requiring a sudden burst of speed will it <b>use</b> <b>its</b> tail.|$|R
5|$|Several of the animal's {{physical}} features are adaptions to climbing through trees. It <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey. It has semiplantigrade feet, switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when arboreal) and a digitigrade-like one (when terrestrial). The soles of its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads. The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree. Captive juveniles {{have been known to}} swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E
5|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E

2500|$|Lingham-Soliar {{hypothesized}} that Plioplatecarpus marshi [...] "flew" [...] underwater primarily <b>using</b> <b>its</b> powerful fore-flippers rather than <b>using</b> <b>its</b> tail like other mosasaurs due to [...] P. marshis well-developed shoulder region. He {{argued that this}} unusual style of swimming increased its maneuverability, allowing this species to flourish in shallow habitats.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, KHBC-TV's digital signal {{remained}} on its pre-transition UHF channel 22 (<b>using</b> <b>its</b> former analog channel 2 as its virtual channel), while KOGG's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 16 (<b>using</b> <b>its</b> former analog channel 15 as its virtual channel) for post-transition digital operations.|$|R
5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> feet {{extensively in}} feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|When eating snails, this rail will hammer at {{the shells}} to extract them. For berries, it will jump high {{to break off}} {{clusters}} of this fruit. After doing this, it will pick off the berries {{one by one and}} eat them. It <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> partially open bill to probe and move aside debris like leaf litter. It is generally wary and secretive, and selfish when mated. This manifests in warning its partner with threat displays to keep it at a distance. Even so, it has occasionally been seen to openly forage in short grass near thickets and in streams or muddy tracks.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and <b>uses</b> <b>its</b> proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
