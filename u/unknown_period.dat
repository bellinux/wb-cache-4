5|$|Western {{observers}} such as James Emerson Tennent (1858) and Charles Gabriel Seligman (1911) have {{termed the}} social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas. Anthropologists have considered {{them to be}} at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some <b>unknown</b> <b>period</b> in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils. Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either Sinhalese, Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also depends on whether these clans are hunter-gatherers or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended {{over a period of time}} to assume Sinhalese or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then they are by far the largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people. Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.|$|E

25|$|Attempts to date {{domestication}} by genetic {{study or}} analysis of physical remains {{rests on the}} assumption that there was a separation of the genotypes of domesticated and wild populations.

Further, all modern horse populations retain the ability to revert to a feral state, and all feral horses are of domestic types; that is, they descend from ancestors that escaped from captivity.|$|E
25|$|In circa 1193 (or {{possibly}} 1190), however, Basil Vatatzes, the doux of the Thracesian {{theme and}} megas domestikos of the Byzantine army, {{forced him to}} flee {{to the court of}} the Seljuk Turks at Iconium. There, the Sultan Ghīyāth al-Dīn Kaykhusraw (r. 1192–1196 and 1205–1211) allowed Theodore to enroll troops among the nomadic tribes, and with these bands he ravaged the frontier lands of the Byzantine Empire in 1195–1196. In late 1196, the new emperor, Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203), bought Mangaphas from the sultan, on condition that his life was to be spared, and that he would not {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison.

Caesar broke off this engagement and married her to Pompey in April 59 BC, with whom Caesar sought a strong political alliance in forming the First Triumvirate.

Yaroslav I the Wise, Prince of Kiev, invaded the region that year, built his own fort there, and named it Yuryev (literally [...] "Yury's" [...] – Yury (a Russified form of George) being Yaroslav's Christian name). Kievan rulers then collected tribute from the surrounding ancient Estonian county of Ugaunia, possibly until 1061, when, according to chronicles, Yuryev was burned down by Estonian tribe called Sosols.

2500|$|At an <b>unknown</b> <b>period,</b> {{probably}} in the later 14th century or early 15th century, the outer wall was abandoned in favour of a smaller defensive enclosure, around [...] square. The entrance to this smaller courtyard was from the east. The reasons for this change are unclear, though {{it is suggested that}} the smaller area would have been easier to defend. During the 16th century, two buildings were added to the southern periphery of the enclosure. A small house was constructed within the south-east angle of the wall, with a circular stair-tower on its northern side giving access to the walkway along the eastern curtain wall. Located just inside the gate, this is likely to have served as a house for the castle's constable or keeper, and is the only building shown with a roof on Petit's survey. At the south-west corner of the enclosure, an L-plan block was put up, possibly as late as the early 17th century. The southern part is sited outside the line of the inner curtain wall, with a northern wing, which may have been a slightly later addition, inside the wall.|$|E

40|$|The {{reasons for}} the highly {{efficient}} market outcomes observed under the double auction remain unclear. This paper presents a series of experimental financial markets designed to investigate the importance of <b>unknown</b> trading <b>period</b> duration on trading behavior and the convergence tendencies of such markets. Using panel data techniques the results support the conclusions that individuals generally display more aggressive trading strategies, trading earlier in a period, and that markets exhibit reduced levels of informational efficiency when unknown duration is present. Markets with imperfect information structures are also studied and, in a unique result, are associated with significantly slower rates of trade, as traders become more cautious over their trading strategies. Investigation of the price formation process provides evidence that the pricing error varies over time and the estimation of a fixed effects model provides unique support that learning effects and <b>unknown</b> trading <b>period</b> duration influence the price formation process. Future refinement of theoretical models of the price formation process or institutions of exchange should recognize the effect of <b>unknown</b> trading <b>period</b> duration on market behavior, along with potential learning effects.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{difference}} of the phase dynamics between El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Monsoon on inter-annual time scales.

We also detect so far <b>unknown</b> <b>periods</b> of coupling which are invisible to linear methods. These findings suggest that the decreasing correlation between ENSO and Indian monsoon during the last decades might be partly inherent to the ENSO/Monsoon system.
