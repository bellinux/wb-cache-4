However, all physical devices are connected to a circuit through conductive leads and paths, which contain inherent, usually <b>unwanted,</b> <b>inductance.</b> This means that physical components contain some inductance {{in addition to their}} other properties.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} a {{graphical}} computer-aided design (CAD) environment for the design, analysis and layout of printed electronic batteries {{in the first phase}} and the parasitic extraction of the connecting wires in the second phase. The primary motivation of our work is that this prototyping software tool so far does not exist. Our tool has been integrated within the existing CAD tool which allows quick prototyping and simplifies the interface between the system designer and the device manufacturer. This tools supports the schematic and layout entry, rule checking and netlist generation. The first phase of the device synthesis modelling is based on Enfucell printed batteries, by which using the CAD tool, the shape of the battery is optimized and designed to fit the product and is able to simulate the performance during the optimization, whereas the second phase is the parasitic extraction using an extracting tool named fasthenry, which is integrated to our CAD tool to extract <b>unwanted</b> resistance and <b>inductance</b> within the shared wires between the battery and other devices. We believe that the availability of this tool is useful to the CAD community for novel ideas in the circuit design for flexible hybrid electronics. + 46764354255, + 4672269494...|$|R

Two proton beams each accelerated to 2 OTevl collide with each other in the interaction region producing large number of subatomic particles. The tracks of these particles can be detected by scintillating optic fiber setup. When these particles cut across the scintillating fibers, they are excited. The light output of these fibers is converted into voltage pulses using photodetectors. The output of the photodetectors are used for track detection and identification. The collision takes place every 132 ns. A new integrated circuit packaging structure coupled with a purely hardware system was needed to meet the high speed and best performance requirements for track detection of subatomic particles. Microprocessors cannot be used for this kind of problem, because a processor typically has to execute several instructions before it can do a particular task i. e a sequential operation. Even if a highly parallel approach is used with processors we have the problem of magnanimity. Due to the high 1 / 0 requirement and low complexity of computation involved in track detection, a processor is not the right choice. Hence a purely and highly parallel hardware approach is investigated. The structure developed eliminates one level of packaging and allows upto nine 'Trillion electron volts MCM' modules to be plugged into a large multilayer printed-circuit board using a zero-insertion-force connector system. The 1800 pins on the module, i. e 16200 pins per board and 32 such boards, will be the complete system. The delays, which are the niain performance issue, are given utmost care by eliminating all the <b>unwanted</b> capacitances and <b>inductances.</b> This research details the design and outlines the packaging for the track detection system. This approach {{can be used as a}} model for any other high speed applications which involves low computational complexity but high 1 / 0 requirements...|$|R
