Tae et al. (2001) discussed tooth modification for minimizing the vibration exiting force and noise in helical gears. Beghini et al. (2004) proposed a method to reduce the transmission error of spur gear at the normal torque through profile modification parameters. Satoshi et al. (1988) studied the effect of <b>standard</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> on the bending strength of helical gears by using the approximate equation to a considerable extent. Satoshi et al. (1986) analyzed the tooth deflection and bending moment at the root fillet in helical gear for various <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> by finite difference method. Shan Chang et al. (2005) used tip relief and root relief to reduce the high contact stresses occur at the root corners in the entering and exiting regions. Alexander et al. (2003) presented a novel method for bending stress balance using one-hundred-year-old Lewis equation suggesting an approach to the tooth parameter’s tolerance and tooth profile definition.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{to evaluate the}} power dissipation of gears was performed. Three low-loss gear models were manufactured using <b>standard</b> 20 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> tools. Austempered ductile iron (ADI) and 20 MnCr 5 carburized steel gears were tested in an FZG gear test machine using mineral, ester and polyalphaolephine (PAO) -based oils. The results compare power dissipation, the influence of different tooth flank geometries, materials and lubricants. This work concludes that conventional power-transmission gears can be replaced by these improved and more efficient low–loss models, which can be produced using common tools and that steel gears can be successfully replaced by austempered ductile iron gears...|$|R

This force has components along the pitch line and the other along the line perpendicular to the pitch line. The force along the pitch line which is responsible for power transmission is proportional to the cosine of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> The one which exerts thrust(perpendicular to the pitch line) is proportional to the sine of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> So it is advised to keep the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> low. <b>Standard</b> <b>pressure</b> values are 14.5 and 20 degrees.|$|R
40|$|Low-loss power {{transmission}} gears operate at lower temperature than conventional ones because their teeth geometry is optimized to reduce friction. The main {{objective of this}} work is to compare the operating stabilization temperature and efficiency of low-loss austempered ductile iron (ADI) and carburized steel gears. Three different low-loss tooth geometries were adopted (types 311, 411 and 611, all produced using <b>standard</b> 20 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> tools) and corresponding steel and ADI gears were tested in a FZG machine. The results obtained showed that low-loss geometries had a significant influence on power loss, gears 611 generating lower power loss than gears 311. At low speeds (500 and 1000 rpm) and high torque ADI gears generated lower power loss than steel gears. However, at high speed and high torque (high input power and high stabilization temperature) steel gears had better efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Just {{as there}} are three types of profile angle, there are three types of {{corresponding}} pressure angle: the transverse <b>pressure</b> <b>angle,</b> the normal <b>pressure</b> <b>angle,</b> and the axial <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R
30|$|It {{is obvious}} from Table  7 {{that only the}} pinions having 15 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> with 0.002 mm tip relief and 20 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> with 0.002 mm tip relief are {{experiencing}} lesser bending stress than Lewis maximum bending stress. Among the two models, low <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> helical pinion (15 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> with 0.002 mm tip relief) running at slow speed(509.2 rpm) provide improved performance with lesser bending stress (145.588 N/mm 2) over more traditional 20 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> pinion (236.606 N/mm 2). This was verified through ANSYS analysis.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>angle</b> in {{relation}} to gear teeth, {{also known as the}} angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> gives the direction normal to the tooth profile. The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is equal to the profile angle at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the [...] "standard" [...] <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> at that point. Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing; however, teeth with smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> are weaker. To run gears together properly their <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> must be matched.|$|R

30|$|This result {{indicates}} that a large load surface <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is good for low-strength materials and a small <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is good for high-strength materials.

30|$|An ISO {{standard}} {{tooth profile}} has a symmetric <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of 20 °. However, the load capacity {{can be increased}} with respect to bending and contact pressure by increasing the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> on the meshing side of an asymmetric tooth.

50|$|In {{spur gears}} and {{straight}} bevel gears, tooth profiles are considered {{only in a}} transverse plane, and the general terms profile <b>angle</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> are customarily used rather than transverse profile <b>angle</b> and transverse <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> In helical teeth, the profiles may be considered in different planes, and in specifications {{it is essential to}} use terms that indicate the direction of the plane in which the profile <b>angle</b> or the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> lies, such as transverse profile <b>angle,</b> normal <b>pressure</b> <b>angle,</b> axial profile angle.|$|R
30|$|Bending stress {{analysis}} was also performed by FEM analysis. The root stress in higher <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> teeth against unit load decreased {{because of the}} thick root of the tooth. However, the highest torque capacity for bending was expected for the tooth profile with a 30 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> because an increase of the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> leads to a smaller base circle.|$|R

40|$|Spur Gear {{vibration}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} indispensable parameter in Maintenance division of an operating plant. Many methods have been adopted to control the vibration in gears. An approach of understanding the influence of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> in spur gear vibration is required in the modern trends. <b>Pressure</b> <b>angle</b> influence in root stress has been analyzed earlier by some of the researchers, but may not be in vibration. Three steel spur gears having the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of 140, 200 and 250 with the same face width, pitch circle diameter and number of teeth are selected for this analysis. The gears are loaded with a torque of 6. 25, 12. 5, 18. 75, 25, 38 and 50 Nm respectively. Loads are given as a transmitted and radial force on the gear tooth. A frequency response analysis has been done on the above gear using FEA Software. The result shows that gear having 200 <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is more effective in controlling the vibration than the other two <b>pressure</b> <b>angles.</b> Also gear having 250 is also being effective in controlling the vibration than the gear having 140.

40|$|Advanced in {{engineering}} technology {{have resulted in}} increased gearing performances. The use of high power density transmission systems such as epicyclic gear trains {{is the way to}} achieve the goal reducing the overall volume and mass compared with traditional configurations. Gears are the main component of the transmissions because they play the crucial role of transmitting the power from the input to the output with a defined ratio. In terms of gear performances, tooth geometry has a direct influence on load carrying capacity: increase the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> modifies the tooth profile with a direct influence on bending and contact stress. To test the benefits of high <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> gears in epicyclic transmissions, four different epicyclic systems with same boundary design conditions have been modelled. The reference <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> have been varied from 20 ° to 35 ° and other gear parameters such as profile shift coefficient, addendum and dedendum length have been modified consequently to match the design requirements. The results show that increasing the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> has a reductive effect on contact and bending stresses. Using high <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> gears in epicyclic transmissions has a beneficial effect on tensile stresses but is unfavourable for the compressive ones. Moreover, it has been seen that <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> effect might be enhanced or nullified if other modifications such as profile shift are used concurrently...|$|R

30|$|A high <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> {{means that}} higher ratio of teeth {{are not in}} contact. However, this allows (i) the teeth to have higher load {{carrying}} capacity (ii) allows less number of teeth without undercutting (iii) tooth flank becomes more curved and hence relative sliding velocity is reduced (iv) the tooth pressure and axial pressure is increased. (v) Increase of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> results in a stronger teeth, because the tooth acting as a beam is wider at the root (Sankar and Nataraj 2010).

30|$|Reduced {{bending stress}} {{because of an}} {{increase}} in tooth thickness and decreased transmission torque because of a reduction in the base circle radius work together to maximize the load capacity for bending at a <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of around 30 °.
