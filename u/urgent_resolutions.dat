40|$|Higher {{education}} in music suffered a profound change {{due to the}} entry of the LOGSE, (Education Law introduced in 2001 – 2002 at high grade). This Research analyzes upper division courses in the conservatories of A Coruña and Vigo from different perspectives. The methodology is descriptive, with a mixed approach, using quantitative and qualitative information gathering techniques. The main conclusions from the results show a profile of students mostly between 19 and 25, 35 % of them attend or have attended college, and 51 % work. Among the elements most valued by teachers are the entrance exam, the students' performance, and finalyear concerts or theses. Students value positively instrumental and theoretical training. Among the least appreciated are material resources and infrastructures, orchestral training, {{and the existence of}} a gap between pedagogic issues and research fields.

40|$|AbstractAddressing {{emergency}} cardiac pathology {{is an area}} studied {{very little}} by students of the fourth year of study at the University of Medicine during the cardiology module. The {{aim of this study}} is to optimize the relationship between theoretical knowledge they obtain from the cardiology course and their application in the emergency room for <b>urgent</b> <b>resolution</b> of pathology. We used statistical methods for processing the database used in this study. We have also used direct interview method with the patient or his entourage, when vital status did not permit examination of the patient, investigation and therapeutic application of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures in an emergency. The results were included in statistically processed data sets, individualized by characteristics of the type pursued. We also appreciated the speed, efficiency and accuracy of medical gestures performed in emergency conditions, in correlation with the theoretical information presented in class. Among the important conclusions we mention: the holding of solid theoretical knowledge offers safety and speed in addressing the practice of cardiac emergencies; for further development of personal research papers based on processed data, besides the theoretical knowledge acquired in courses is useful attending conferences and symposiums approaching the topic to be explored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The authors {{examined}} {{factors associated}} with nutritional resilience/vulnerability among preschoolers in the Gaza Strip in 2007, where political violence and deprivation are widespread. Methods This cross-sectional study {{was carried out in}} 2007 using random sampling of kindergartens in order to select 350 preschoolers. Binary logistic regression was used to compare resilient (adequate nutrition) and vulnerable (stunted) groups with those with moderate nutrition. Results Approximately 37 % of the subjects demonstrated nutritional resilience and 15 % were vulnerable. Factors associated with nutritional resilience were child younger age, normal birth weight, actively hand- or spoon-feeding when the child was below two years, and residential stability in the past two years. The only factor associated with nutritional vulnerability was lower total score on the mother's General Health Questionnaire, which we interpret as a marker of maternal mental health. Conclusions Children with low-birth weight and older children had worse nutritional resiliency outcomes. Further, poorer outcomes for children were associated with lower maternal mental health status, as well as increased family residential instability. Our results add to the large literature on the pervasive effects of violence and instability on children and underscore the need for resources for early intervention and for the <b>urgent</b> <b>resolution</b> of the Palestinian and other armed conflicts. </p...|$|R
50|$|Deputy Vernon Perez Rubio made an {{accusation}} against the Sonora Government on a fraud {{attempt on the}} official bidding processes of a lower bridge {{in the city of}} Hermosillo, during an ordinary session of the LX Congress Legislature of the Sonora State, on September 24, 2013. The alleged fraud consist, initially, on the construction tender, which was made for trimmings, sidewalks, and asphalt pavement construction on the city of San Luis Río Colorado, on the Quintana Roo Avenue, beginning in 26th street, and ending on 12th street. Three days later, the Department of Infrastructure and Urban Development of Sonora State announced the alleged mistake, changing the type of construction work as well as the ubication, calling for a bidding of a lower bridge in the intersection of Navarrete Boulevard and Luis Encinas Boulevard in the City of Hermosillo. Based on this mistake, from which a series of irregularities came up, Deputy Vernon Perez Rubio proposed that the case should have an obvious and <b>urgent</b> <b>resolution</b> on the Local Congress, trying to speed up these case; nevertheless, the National Action Party parliamentary section did not approved the action, turning the case to the Public Building Commission, headed by the Deputy Ignacio Garcia Fierros.|$|R

50|$|The Chilobwe murders were {{a series}} of murders, {{numbering}} at least thirty killings, which took place over several months starting in November 1968 {{in the suburbs of}} Blantyre, Malawi, particularly in Chilobwe. A number of rumours grew up around these murders, and many blamed them on the South African Government which, according to various popular accounts, wanted repayment of loans it had given to the Malawi Government, either in human blood or by the enslavement of Malawians to work in South Africa. These rumours were politically damaging to the government of Hastings Banda, which cultivated friendly relations with South Africa's white minority government, and he treated the murders as a serious issue requiring <b>urgent</b> <b>resolution.</b> The murders were never fully solved. Several men were arrested in connection with the murders in 1969, but acquitted for lack of evidence. This caused popular outrage at the criminal justice system which, at that time, was still based on English law and practice. In 1970 another man, Walla Kawisa, made several confessions admitting to some of the murders. He was condemned to death and probably executed in May 1972. It is unlikely that the murders were the work of a single individual, and various theories have been proposed, some linking them to opposition to Banda. Banda himself blamed the murders on ex-ministers involved in the Cabinet Crisis of 1964, and removed Gomile Kumtumanji, a Member of Parliament cabinet minister for the Southern Region from office and had him tried for treason, allegedly for complicity in them.|$|R
40|$|Current {{circumstances}} {{demand that}} university graduates become change agents who pursue social justice by being knowledgeable critical thinkers, able to skillfully negotiate culture and diversity issues. These matters are core business in university cultures and curricula, and health systems embrace them too. Yet {{much of our}} work is blind to the assumptions and privilege underlying practice. This paper extends {{a body of work}} which considers cultural safety’s potential to challenge culturalist responses to power imbalances, racisms and white dominance in educational, research and clinical practices. It advances three central arguments in advocating for the consistent uptake of the model as a philosophical foundation and practice by nursing’s regulatory bodies and university faculty. Currently {{we have an opportunity to}} overcome the racist ghettoizing of cultural safety, which positions it as relevant only to Indigenous contexts or to those otherwise conceptualised as ‘diverse’. It is precisely this disavowal of culture and diversity on behalf of dominant cultures that the model sought to overcome. So firstly we argue that the model is applicable in any context. Secondly we argue to better equip students for the real world, the conceptual confusion surrounding culture and diversity evident throughout faculty of health, in nursing standards and curricular, and in clinical and research practice, needs <b>urgent</b> <b>resolution.</b> A coherent approach can be achieved by abandoning attempts to learn others’ cultures and by sustained effort to come to grips with the impact of our own cultures and those of the systems and society we work within. Thirdly we argue therefore, that the model’s potential to challenge established ways of doing business can be realised more fully. This outcome relies on nursing, a profession embodying white privilege, rising to the challenge to acknowledge and negotiate power imbalances to address racism, stigma and discrimination in society and our everyday lives...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Troncular pylephlebitis, {{defined as}} septic {{thrombophlebitis}} of the portal vein, is usually secondary to suppurative infection from the regions drained by the portal system. Therefore, pylephlebitis can occur from the portal vein main tributaries. The occurrence of mesenteric pylephlebitis in Crohn’s disease is extremely rare. Presentation of case: We describe {{a case of}} septic shock due to mesenteric pylephlebitis in a 47 years old male affected with Crohn’s disease. The patient {{was admitted to the}} emergency department after he had been complained from 3  h of a peri-umbilical abdominal pain associated to fever and shivering quickly followed by a severe hypotension. His medical history included histologically confirmed ileal Crohn’s disease diagnosed 4 years before and treated with mesalamine only. Computed tomography scan confirmed the mesenteric pylephlebitis diagnosis. After medical therapy with antibiotics and systemic nutrition, the patient was successfully operated to treat his ileal Crohn’s disease. Discussion: In our case, the quick onset of a septic shock was not due to a peritonitis complicating a Crohn’s disease, but to a rare condition not needing an <b>urgent</b> surgical <b>resolution.</b> This report shows that, even in Crohn’s disease, once diagnosis is performed, antibiotic therapy associated to enteral and parenteral nutrition can lead to a complete clinical remission of mesenteric pylephlebitis, mandatory to perform an elective surgery. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of promptly considerate and treat mesenteric pylephlebitis in presence of a septic shock in a Crohn’s disease patient who is not showing clinical signs of peritonitis...|$|R
40|$|This feature {{article is}} aimed to {{showcase}} advanced soft and radiationless nanotools for the morphological characterization {{and for the}} preparation/modification of molecular surfaces, namely solid supported ultrathin films not exceeding 1 – 2 molecular layers. As to the characterization, the development of dynamic scanning force microscopy in attractive regime is presented as an important progress {{at least as far}} as it concerns imaging of nanoscale features of molecular surfaces with minimal probe–sample physical interaction. To date, this tool has been applied only by a few groups in spite of its larger resolution and image quality than the conventional scanning probe methods. As to the preparation/modification, the realization of ultrathin nanoscale patterns is reviewed by highlighting at first some recent approaches in the field of molecular self-assembly on solid substrates including the possibility to induce order under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. Secondly, the area of nanoscale man-made fabrication is featured by choosing some of those techniques of <b>urgent</b> need (high <b>resolution,</b> low cost, potentially of simple use) like scanning probe lithographies and nanodispensing tools...|$|R
30|$|The {{supremacy}} {{exerted by}} the dominating group over other social groups is achieved mainly through economic, political, military, and religious avenues (Domhoff 2009). The concrete extent and approach {{through which the}} economic power is translated to political power {{has been the focus}} of social science in discussing the power structure of modern society. This transformation and its effects are configured by both the polity itself and the characteristics of the economy (Salamon and Siegfried 1977). In the context of transitional and developing countries, the relationship between political elites and economic elites is the key to understanding political reform and social change. Thus the relationship between the government and emerging private entrepreneurs in China has been the central concern of political science, sociology, and even economics when it displays important significance in the developing market economy, the improving governance structure, and the changing social structure. Hitherto academic research has reached the consensus that the state-business relationship in China is characterized by the link between officials and private entrepreneurs though intense social networks, the clientelist essence of the relationship, and the co-optation facilitated by formal institutions (Huang 2014 a). Public opinion also agrees that the high risk of corruption in the official-merchant relationship demands <b>urgent</b> systematic <b>resolutions.</b> However, the above perspective has neglected the fact that the current state-business relationship in China is changing. Existing research thus fails to capture the complexity of recent empirical development. On the one hand, a group of major private entrepreneurs has attempted to exercise influence on government policies through building “online think tanks”. 1 On the other hand, a number of cases in which private entrepreneurs have joined together to sue the local government clearly display a turn from clientelism to confrontation (Lu 2016). 2 Obviously, large enterprises and small- and medium-sized enterprises should not be combined into one single position. In short, the current state-business relationship in China displays diversity and complexity beyond the scope of one single theoretical mode.|$|R
