40|$|The {{reality of}} the global-scale {{sedimentation}} breaks remains controversial.

40|$|ABSTRACT - In the {{geological}} record a drowning process is documented by {{various types of}} shallow water-to-pelagic or shallow water to mixed benthic/pelagic carbonate transitions. Drowning <b>unconformities</b> are paraconformities, to disconformities, to angular <b>unconformities,</b> and their drowning surfaces range from planar to highly irregular morphologies. Drowning successions display a mix of products of both the benthic and pelagic carbonate factories. These successions can be also bounded by <b>unconformities.</b> Drowning <b>unconformities</b> and drowning successions are contrasted through a description and discussion of examples of escarpment-bounded platforms from the Jurassic of the Northern Apennines and, subordinately, from Sicily and other Tethyan sectors. The areal distribution of drowning <b>unconformities</b> and successions is discussed with reference to a complex depositional system whose architecture {{was the product of}} the riftinduced fragmentation of a regional Hettangian carbonate megabank. The examples in this study show drowning <b>unconformities</b> to be exclusive to intrabasinal highs, while drowning successions are found both on highs and in hangingwall basins. Drowning <b>unconformities,</b> with their long associated hiatuses, and drowning successions are often seen to merge laterally into one another over very short distances on the same intrabasinal high. The deposits of the drowning succession are sometimes missing {{on the top of the}} platform, while they are found forming clinoforms along its flanks, evidence that sediment could be permanently swept from the highs in these depositional systems at this stage...|$|R
5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} geologic record, a major <b>unconformity,</b> affected the region. Geologists {{do not know what}} happened to the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they do know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally below the surface of a shallow sea.|$|E
5|$|No record {{exists for}} the next 1.2billion years of Jerome's {{geologic}} history. Evidence from the Grand Canyon, further north in Arizona, suggests that thick layers of sediment may have been laid down atop the ore bodies and later eroded away.

5|$|Visiting in 1787, the {{geologist}} James Hutton {{found his}} first {{example of an}} <b>unconformity</b> {{to the north of}} Newton Point near Lochranza, which provided evidence for his Plutonist theories of uniformitarianism and about the age of the Earth.

25|$|The passive margin {{phase was}} characterised by the {{deposition}} of shallow marine sediments in three periods, divided by <b>unconformities.</b> The <b>unconformities</b> have been dated to the Ordovician-Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian respectively.

Foraminiferal, lithic, and isotopic analyses demonstrate that environments began to shift prior to periods of marine erosion, and that sedimentation resumed {{in the form}} of turbidites derived from nearby upper-slope sources.

The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.|$|E
5|$|Nankoweap Formation {{is around}} 1050million {{years old and}} {{is not part of}} a group. This rock unit is made of {{coarse-grained}} sandstone, and was deposited in a shallow sea on top of the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt.

5|$|Those Famennian strata {{represent}} {{the top of}} the Paleozoic series pleated with north dipping. Above, the transgressive Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with <b>unconformity.</b> It includes from the bottom to the top a paleozoic boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix, coarse clayey and glauconitic sands, containing Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana, Praeactinocamax plenus and finally marl with Terebratulina gracilis. These strata belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a transgressive phase.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major <b>unconformity.</b> Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E
5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation of the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular <b>unconformity</b> (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E

50|$|In geology and geomorphology, {{an erosion}} surface is a surface of rock or {{regolith}} that {{was formed by}} erosion and not by construction (e.g. lava flows, sediment deposition) nor fault displacement. Erosional surfaces within the stratigraphic record are known as <b>unconformities,</b> but not all <b>unconformities</b> are buried erosion surfaces. Erosion surfaces can be either small or large. Particularly large and flat erosion surfaces receive the names of peneplain, , planation surface or pediplain.|$|R
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional <b>unconformity.</b> Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much {{the lower half of the}} Navajo Formation.|$|E
5|$|The Union Springs is an organic-rich, pyritiferous, thinly bedded, blackish gray {{to black}} shale with {{mudstone}} concretionary layers, and thin silt bands at the bottom. To the east, {{it becomes the}} Bakoven Member, a darker, less organic shale with fewer limestone layers. To the west the Union Springs beds thin, with its upper limestones merging with the overlying calcareous Cherry Valley Member. A regional <b>unconformity</b> appears in western New York, as the Union Springs lenses in and out, and then reappears in northwest Pennsylvania and northeast Ohio between the Onondaga and Cherry Valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{next two}} periods of {{geologic}} history, the Ordovician and the Silurian, are {{missing from the}} Grand Canyon sequence. Geologists {{do not know if}} sediments were deposited in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if they were never deposited in the first place. Either way, this break in the geologic history of the area spans about 65million years. A type of <b>unconformity</b> called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.|$|E

40|$|Intermediate {{resolution}} seismic {{data were}} used to investigate the glacial history of the Pacific-Antarctic continental shelf. The objective {{was to determine the}} nature of ice sheet erosion and deposition on the continental shelf and to use these observations to reconstruct the glacial history of the region. Forearc regions underwent compression and vertical uplift during the convergence and collision of the several segments of the Aluk-Antarctic spreading center and Antarctic Peninsula plate causing development of collision-related <b>unconformities</b> whose ages are derived from paleomagnetic data from the adjacent ocean floor. These surfaces provide the chronostratigraphic framework for interpreting the age of glacial features on the shelf. Glacial delta foresets downlap glacial <b>unconformities</b> eroded during previous glacial periods. The oldest glacial <b>unconformities</b> on the shelf occur in middle Miocene strata. Seismic stratigraphic analysis of the outer-shelf demonstrates that there were at over thirty glacial cycles...|$|R
5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The {{average age of the}} rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An <b>unconformity</b> marks the top of this formation.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} {{component of}} the Mendips is Carboniferous Limestone. It represents {{the remnants of a}} much higher range of hills that existed hundreds of millions years ago. This has allowed the formation of features such as Cheddar Gorge, Ebbor Gorge and Burrington Combe. There are a wide variety of caves and swallet holes caused by dissolution of the rock by water. Further east there are Silurian volcanoes, Carboniferous Limestone outcrops, Variscan thrust tectonics, Permo-Triassic conglomerates, sediment-filled fissures, a classic <b>unconformity,</b> Jurassic clays and limestones, Cretaceous Greensand and chalk topped with Tertiary remnants including Sarsen Stones. These sediments have yielded a fairly rich fossil fauna of brachiopods and trilobites indicating that they were deposited in a shallow marine sea into which the lavas were extruded. The rocks are quarried at Moons Hill near Stoke St Michael for aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{caused by}} a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70mya to the early Paleocene. This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying basins between them {{gradually}} subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land {{in the area to}} form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline. All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An angular <b>unconformity</b> therefore exists along the anticline's crest. The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed {{as a result of the}} Laramide.|$|E
40|$|A contourite drift from {{offshore}} Brazil {{is mapped}} in detail and investigated using state-of-the-art 3 -D seismic data. The {{aim was to}} review the relevance of erosional features in contourite drifts accumulated on continental slopes. Topographically confined by growing salt diapirs, the mapped contourite ridge is limited by two erosional features, a contourite moat and a turbidite channel, showing multiple slide scars on it flanks. Associated with the latter features are thick accumulations of high-amplitude strata, probably comprising sandy/silty sediment of Miocene to Holocene age. The erosional <b>unconformities</b> are mostly observed in a region averaging 3. 75 km away from the axes of a channel and a moat, whose deposits interfinger with continuous strata in central parts of the contourite drift. The multiple <b>unconformities</b> observed are mostly related to slide scars and local erosion on the flanks of the drift. This work demonstrates {{that the existence of}} widespread <b>unconformities</b> within contourite drifts on continental slopes: (1) may not be as prominent as often documented, (2) are often diachronic and interfinger with correlative hiatuses or aggraded strata in axial regions of contourite drifts. Although less widespread than regional, or ocean-scale <b>unconformities,</b> these diachronous features result in significant hiatuses within contourite drifts and are, therefore, potentially mappable as relevant (regional-scale) <b>unconformities</b> on 2 -D/ 3 -D seismic data. Thus, without a full 3 -D morphometric analysis of contourite drifts, significant errors may occur when estimating major changes in the dynamics of principal geostrophic currents based on single-site core data, or on direct correlations between stratigraphic surfaces of distinct contourite bodies...|$|R
40|$|Episodic {{growth and}} decay of the Cordilleran ice sheet during the Pleistocene has imposed order on Quaternary stratigraphies in British Columbia and {{southern}} Yukon Territory. Although Quaternary deposits {{in this region}} are inherently complex, thick valley and lowland "lls consist of discrete packages of glacial sediments separated by <b>unconformities</b> or by generally thin, patchy interglacial deposits. Some <b>unconformities</b> de"ne former valley and lowland landscapes of similar relief to the present. Each package of glacial sediments displays stratigraphic order: distinctive #uvial and lacustrine units, deposited during the early stage of a glaciation and later overridden and eroded by glaciers, are overlain by retreat phase and interglacial #uvial, lacustrine, and marine sediments. Packages of glacial sediments contain one or more <b>unconformities</b> produced by glacial erosion; commonly the <b>unconformities</b> are better stratigraphic markers than tills, which are not always present, especially in valleys. The Quaternary stratigraphic record in the Canadian Cordillera becomes less complete with age, owing to repeated erosion during both interglaciations and glaciations. The most complete glacial sequence is the youngest, deposited during the late Wisconsin Fraser Glaciation. Deposits of the penultimate glaciation are common but generally incomplete. Only sporadic remnants of older, apparently Middle and Early Pleistocene glacial deposits {{are present in the}} Cordillera. (2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We use {{high-resolution}} ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{to assess}} {{the continuity of the}} Blue Ice Area (BIA) horizontal climate record at Patriot Hills, Horseshoe Valley, West Antarctica. The sequence contains three pronounced changes in deuterium isotopic values at ~ 18 [*]cal[*]ka, ~ 12 [*]cal[*]ka, and ~ 8 [*]cal[*]ka. GPR surveys along the climate sequence reveal continuous, conformable dipping isochrones, separated by two <b>unconformities</b> in the isochrone layers, which correlate with the two older deuterium shifts. We interpret these <b>unconformities</b> as discontinuities in the sequence, rather than direct measures of climate change. Ice sheet models and Internal Layer Continuity Index plots suggest that the <b>unconformities</b> represent periods of erosion occurring, as the former ice surface was scoured by katabatic winds in front of mountains at the head of Horseshoe Valley.
