5|$|As their {{relationship}} had become increasingly strained, {{his wife had}} left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed to take <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, {{on the condition that}} he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E

In 1935 he left Uppsala to take <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> of Comparative Religion of Indo-European Peoples at {{the prestigious}} École Pratique des Hautes Études.

25|$|Another {{controversy}} was {{occasioned by}} the terms of Koestler's will. With the exception of some minor bequests, Koestler left the residue of his estate, about one million pounds, to the promotion of research into the paranormal through the founding of a chair in parapsychology at a university in Britain. The trustees of the estate had great difficulty finding a university willing to establish such a chair. Oxford, Cambridge, King's College London and University College London were approached, and all refused. Eventually the trustees reached agreement with Edinburgh University to set <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> in accordance with Koestler's request.|$|E

[...] Extending a warm, energetic invitation towards Belle, the first verse {{of the song}} is preceded by a spoken introduction.

2500|$|Common {{positions}} include {{lying on}} back or face down, sitting, squatting, kneeling or standing. In a bath or shower a female may direct tap water at her clitoris and vulva. Lying face down one {{may use the}} hands, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and [...] "hump" [...] the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing <b>up,</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine {{can be used to}} stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing. [...] Some masturbate only using pressure applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing. In the 1920s, Havelock Ellis reported that turn-of-the-century seamstresses using treadle-operated sewing machines could achieve orgasm by sitting near the edge of their chairs.|$|E
2500|$|Foucault {{desired to}} leave Vincennes {{and become a}} fellow of the prestigious Collège de France. He {{requested}} to join, taking <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> in what he called the [...] "history of systems of thought," [...] and his request was championed by members Dumézil, Hyppolite, and Vuillemin. In November 1969, when an opening became available, Foucault was elected to the Collège, though with opposition by a large minority. He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970, which was subsequently published as L'Ordre du discours (The Discourse of Language). He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a year—and did so {{for the rest of his}} life—covering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became [...] "one of the events of Parisian intellectual life" [...] and were repeatedly packed out events. On Mondays, he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a [...] "Foulcauldian tribe" [...] who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and collective research, and together they would publish a number of short books. Working at the Collège allowed him to travel widely, giving lectures in Brazil, Japan, Canada, and the United States over the next 14 years. [...] In 1970 and 1972, Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.|$|E
