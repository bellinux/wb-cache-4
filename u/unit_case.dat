40|$|BACKGROUND: Invasive {{pulmonary}} aspergillosis (IPA) is {{a life-threatening}} infection that occurs predominantly in severely immunocompromised patients. Recently, IPA is also increasingly seen in less severely immunocompromised patients, such as patients with COPD receiving glucocorticoids and patients on ventilation in an IC <b>unit.</b> <b>CASE</b> DESCRIPTION: Here we present {{the case of}} a 59 -year-old male who died of influenza complicated by a superinfection with Aspergillus fumigatus. This patient had no known previous medical history, except schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: Since the 2009 influenza pandemic, IPA has been increasingly reported as a superinfection in patients with a severe influenza virus infection. This combined Aspergillus and influenza infection often has a fatal outcome. An Aspergillus sputum culture should be taken seriously in patients with severe influenza pneumonia, and treatment should be considered early in the disease course...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of bidder ring {{formation}} in single and multi-unit Vickrey auctions. We address this issue in a bargaining game set up under the assumption that valuation of bidders is commonly known only amongst themselves. In the single <b>unit</b> <b>case,</b> we show that the equilibrium coalition structure can only be an order preserving r-ring, that includes the winner and the top (r- 1) losers. In the multiple units case, we specify sufficient conditions for formation of an interesting class of equilibrium coalition structures, which we call single winner ring with free riding, where exactly one winner colludes with all the losers and generates maximum possible bidders' surplus, and, depending on the protocol, the remaining winners free ride either by staying alone or by colluding in pairs...|$|E
40|$|Bidders {{in online}} multi-unit {{combinatorial}} auctions face the acute problem of estimating the valuations of an immense number of packages.

In the single <b>unit</b> <b>case,</b> fast methods are now available for incrementally computing, for each package at each time instant, the recommended lower bound (Deadness Level) and upper bound (Winning Level) on the next bid. But when there are multiple units of items, it becomes difficult to compute the Deadness Level of a package accurately. An upper bound on this quantity can be derived however, and a bid that stays within this bound and the Winning Level is “safe”, {{in the sense that}} it is not wasted and has the potential to become a winning bid. What is now needed is an incremental procedure for speeding up the computation of thi...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{sheds light}} on a {{phenomenon}} which is not much investigated, but that involves {{almost half of the}} Italian large companies, the dispersion of workers. In fact, in today’s global economy, much of the economic activity in and between firms is based on dispersed knowledge workers (DWs). Therefore, developing tools to support knowledge management (KM) in distributed environments is becoming a major challenge. This paper, which is part of a research project aims at supporting managers in the implementation of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) for dispersed workers, reports the results of a survey on large Italian companies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a case study carried out to assess the application of the methods FMEA and DRBFM in the new product development of an automotive parts manufacturer, which is regarded as a reference in the use of these methods. Both the process quality and the output quality of the application were assessed. The findings suggest that the successful execution of the FMEA and DRBFM methods, in the business <b>unit</b> <b>case,</b> is due to the combination of provision of resources, employment of multi-disciplinary teams, competence development (training), definition and documentation of the process of application, and integration of the application of these methods with other NPD methods/tools, and, mainly, it results from not considering their application as a perfunctory task. Despite the result generalization constraints, the main limitation of this study was using questionnaires as the only source of data collection. It can be said that the knowledge resulting from this research can assist companies to benefit from applying these methods in the new product development process...|$|E
40|$|In the {{software}} development life cycle, unit testing {{is an important}} phase that helps in early detection of bugs. A <b>unit</b> test <b>case</b> consists of two parts: a test input, which is often a sequence of method calls, and a test oracle, which is often {{in the form of}} assertions. The effectiveness of a <b>unit</b> test <b>case</b> depends on its test input as well as its test oracle because the test oracle helps in exposing bugs during the execution of the test input. The task of writing effective test oracles is not trivial as this task requires domain or application knowledge and also needs knowledge of the intricate details of the class under test. In addition, when developers write new <b>unit</b> test <b>cases,</b> much test code (including code in test inputs or oracles) such as method argument values is the same as some previously written test code. To assist developers in writing test code in <b>unit</b> test <b>cases</b> more efficiently, we have developed an Eclipse plugin for JUnit test cases, called UnitPlus, that runs in the background and recommends test-code pieces for developers to choose (and revise when needed) to put in test oracles or test inputs.

Baseline data were available on 18  patients, in whom SO occurred after surgery in 11  patients, after retinal surgery alone in six patients, and after accidental trauma in seven patients. 12  of the 16  patients with 1  year follow up had a visual acuity of 6 / 12 or better. Good visual outcome was related to prompt and adequate systemic immunosuppressive therapy.  CONCLUSIONS—The incidence of sympathetic ophthalmia is very low. The main current risk is surgery, particularly retinal surgery, but visual prognosis is good if early diagnosis is made and rapid, adequate immunotherapy is commenced. ...|$|E
