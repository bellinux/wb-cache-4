40|$|A {{key problem}} for {{effective}} unit testing is {{the difficulty of}} partitioning large software systems into appropriate units that can be tested in isolation. We present an approach that identifies control and data inter-dependencies between software components using static program analysis, and divides the source code into units where highly-intertwined components are grouped together. Those units can then be tested in isolation using automated test generation techniques and tools, such as dynamic software model checkers. We discuss preliminary experimental results showing that automatic software partitioning can significantly increase test coverage without generating too many false alarms caused by unrealistic inputs being injected at interfaces between <b>units.</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptor...|$|E
40|$|In a {{systolic}} array, the {{maximum operating speed}} {{is determined by the}} most complex op eration performed. In {{a systolic}} army graphics engine, capable of generating high quality images, one has to perform complex operations at a very high speed. We propose to use pipelined functional units in systolic army graphics engines as they can perform complex operations at high speeds. Due to time-varying discontinuities of operations performed by systolic army graphics engines, introduction of pipelined functional units is a complex problem. In this paper we present a methodology which solves this problem by a graph theoretic approach. Furthermore, we characttTize the architectures which can be improved by pipelined functional <b>units.</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptors...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} extracting and fairing surfaces from segmented volumes composed of multiple materials. In a first pass, the material boundaries {{in the volume}} are smoothed considering signed distance functions for the individual materials. Second, we apply a marching-cubes-like contouring method providing initial meshes defining material boundaries. Non-manifold features emerge along lines where more than two materials encounter. Finally, the mesh geometry is relaxed in a constrained fairing process. We use our algorithm to construct a heart model from segmented time-varying magnetic resonance images.

40|$|Dissertation thesis {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} of incremental compiler construction. It represents the compiler construction possibilities for languages with a fixed set of lexical units and for languages with a variable set of lexical units, too. The methodology {{design for the}} incremental compiler construction {{is based on the}} known algorithms for standard compiler construction and derived for both groups of languages. The part focused on incremental compiling of common programming languages is based on a published methodology of incremental parser construction. The method uses syntax-directed translation scheme. The part focused on incremental compiling of languages with a variable set of lexical units is engaged in incremental compiler construction for on of the typical representantives, typographic system TeX. Unline the frontal compilation it is necessary to adapt the semantic actions to the incremental environment and bring additional information for their links to the appropriate location in the grammar rules. The thesis discusses the problem of the storage of information about current lexical <b>units</b> <b>categories</b> during the repeated compilation and it offers solutions.

40|$|Abstract. Information {{of speech}} units like vowels, consonants and syllables {{can be a}} kind of {{knowledge}} used in text-independent Short Utterance Speaker Recognition (SUSR) in a similar way as in text-dependent speaker recognition. In such tasks, data for each speech unit, especially at the time of recognition, is often not enough. Hence, it is not practical to use the full set of speech units because some of the units might not be well trained. To solve this problem, a method of using speech <b>unit</b> <b>categories</b> rather than individual phones is proposed for SUSR, wherein similar speech units are put together, hence solving the problem of sparse data. We define Vowel, Consonant, and Syllable Categories (VC, CC and SC) with Standard Chinese (Putonghua) as a reference. A speech utterance is recognized into VC, CC ad SC sequences which are used to train Universal Background Models (UBM) for each speech <b>unit</b> <b>category</b> in the training procedure, and to perfor...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUNDRed {{blood cell}} (RBC) alloimmunization occurs {{at a high}} {{frequency}} in sickle cell anemia (SCA) despite serologic matching for Rh (C/c, E/e) and K antigens. RBC minor antigen genotyping allows for prediction of antigens and RH variants {{that may lead to}} alloimmunization. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSRBC antigen genotyping was performed on chronically transfused pediatric SCA patients, using PreciseType Human Erythrocyte Antigen (HEA), RHCE, and RHD BeadChip arrays. All patients received C/c, E/e, and K serologically matched <b>units</b> (<b>category</b> 1); patients with prior RBC antibodies were also matched for Fya, Jkb, and any antibodies (category 2). The RBC genotypes of all leukoreduced (LR) units transfused over a 12 -month period were determined by the prototype HEA-LR BeadChip assay. RESULTSThere were 2320 RBC units transfused to 90 patients in 1135 transfusion episodes. Thirty-five (38. 9 %) patients had homozygous or compound heterozygous RH variants. Seven new alloantibodies were detected, with alloantibody incidence of 0. 706 / 100 <b>units</b> for <b>category</b> 2 transfusions and 0. 068 / 100 <b>units</b> for <b>category</b> 1 (p= 0. 02). Three patients on category 2 transfusions formed new anti-Jsa and had a higher rate of exposure to Jsa {{than those who did not}} form anti-Jsa (20. 4 vs. 8. 33 exposures/ 100 units, p= 0. 02). The most frequent mismatches were S (43. 9 %), Doa (43. 9 %), Fya (29. 2 %), M (28. 4 %), Jkb (28. 1 %). CONCLUSIONSAlloimmunization incidence was higher in those with prior RBC antibodies, suggesting that past immunologic responders are at higher risk for future alloimmunization and therefore may benefit from more extensive antigen matching beyond C/c, E/e, K, Fya and Jkb.

5000|$|There are ten {{different}} {{races in the}} game: Knights, Empire, Elves, Dark Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, Undead, Demons, Orcs and Ogres. Each of these races has six types of units, {{each of which has}} a counterpart with the other races. These <b>unit</b> <b>categories</b> could be classed as: Infantry, Archer, Cavalry, Siege, Creature, and Hero, in order of how many turns it takes to produce them. Infantry are typically the cheap, weak units. Archer units can fire projectiles, and are best used as backup for other units, as they can still fire arrows as support even when they are not the active unit. Cavalry units are mounted riders who have a good range of movement out of battle, and are more powerful than infantry in battle. Siege units are most useful when attacking a city; they can stay in the [...] "back row" [...] (i.e. not active units) and fire projectiles at a city's walls in order to destroy them and prevent them from firing arrows at the active unit. Creature units are generally large and/or powerful fantasy creatures which are more powerful than cavalry units; they are also often flying units, which have the best range of movement on the map. Hero units are powerful units which can make use of magic items found in ruins to increase their skills. They also have a special [...] "leadership" [...] ability which can increase the power of other <b>units.</b> These <b>categories</b> are loose, however. While all units correspond to each other, some races have units in these slots which deviate from these <b>categories.</b> <b>Units</b> can gain experience points, and thus can gain levels, making them more powerful and allowing them to increase their special abilities.
