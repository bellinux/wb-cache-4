If a fridge or freezer is driven from a higher voltage the result is also heat however this is not helpful in its intended purpose (cooling). The compressor motor power output is reduced slightly by voltage optimisation so the fridge/freezer thermostat will keep the motor on a little longer however overall the effect is for the motor to run slightly longer at much lower losses.

40|$|Variable speed drives {{employing}} induction motors {{have been}} widely used in industry for decades. Today there is a continually increasing demand for more precise and flexible speed control usually with close attention to energy efficiency. The inverter is used because of its reliability, flexibility and relatively low cost. However its output a. c. voltage is not sinusoidal so the core losses in the induction motors consequently increase. This research is centred on the design and testing of the stator winding configuration of three phase induction motors with various coil pitches and measure the dynamic performance under sinusoidal and PWM supplies. Measurements were carried out to determine the behavior of harmonic losses and the efficiency of four identical three-phase 746 W induction motors with stator coil pitches of 180, 160, 140 and 120. The motors were fed from either a three-phase inverter or a three-phase sinusoidal voltage supply. The switching frequency was varied from 4 kHz to 16 kHz and the modulation frequency was varied between 30 Hz to 60 Hz. Simulations were carried out using OPERA 2 D software <b>under</b> sinusoidal <b>voltage</b> supply. The phenomenon of chording by l/n* of pole pitch to suppress the n* harmonic was particularly followed by motors with 120 and 160 coil pitches <b>under</b> sinusoidal <b>voltage</b> supply. This phenomenon was also followed by 120, 140 and 160 coil pitch motors <b>under</b> PWM <b>voltage</b> supply at all the switching frequencies and modulation * frequencies. The motor with 120 coil pitch showed a drastical increase in the lower order voltage harmonic components with simulation under sinusoidal supply when compared to full pitch motor.

The efficiency of the same motor was higher at full load and over loads under all the switching frequencies and modulation frequencies.
