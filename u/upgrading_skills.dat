I start by documenting a series of facts to shed light on the determinants of a steep increase in the relative demand of skilled labor in a panel of Argentinean industrial firms covering the trade liberalization period. First, this is not explained by labor reallocation across industries or firms but by <b>skill</b> <b>upgrading</b> within firms. Second, exporters <b>upgrade</b> <b>skill</b> faster than non exporters. Third, firms <b>upgrading</b> <b>skill</b> also <b>upgrade</b> technology. These findings are consistent with a model where a reduction in trading partner’s tariffs induces the most productive firms (exporters) to adopt skill-intensive production technologies. Indeed, I find that the reduction in Brazil’s tariffs induces the most productive Argentinean firms to <b>upgrade</b> <b>skill,</b> while the least productive ones downgrade.

5000|$|Marvel: Future Fight {{has been}} {{described}} as a dungeon crawler. Players have the option to use either virtual joystick and button controls or tap-based controls. The player plays with a maximum team of 3 characters in a team on a level. The player controls one of the characters and may interchange with the other team members. A character swap will incur a cool down before the player can swap back to the previously used character.Each mission uses energy to play. Energy is gained by leveling up your SHIELD base with SHIELD XP, through in game rewards and achievements. There are over 135 different playable characters. The player's character has a default attack mode which does substantial damage involving repetitive melee/weapon attacks based on the character type chosen. The active character will lock onto a target and continue moving toward it to attack it unless input to behave otherwise. Apart from the default attack mode each character has additional special skills these may be directed attacks,AOE attacks or induce application of buffs or shields and are unique to each character. Each skill comes with a cool down. Skills are either active or passive. An active skill is initiated by the user, while passive skills will trigger on specific conditions met during game play. A character will start out with 2 skills initially and gain upto 6 skills as it is ranked up.Apart from the 6 skills each character has an additional Leadership skill unlocked through mastery of the character. This skill is active when the character is in the leadership position of the team. All team members will receive the benefits of the leadership skill for the entire duration of the level.Another skill type called tier-2 skill is unlocked when the character attains tier-2 status. Certain characters start out as automatic tier-2 charactersThe player can have a maximum of 5 teams set up. There are also team bonuses, for certain sets of character team combinations. Characters are unlocked and ranked up by obtaining Biometrics, which can be found in certain missions as well as the Game store. Characters can get better upgrade options at higher levels and can be leveled up through character XP. Players are able to customize heroes to their play style through upgrades, such as <b>upgrading</b> <b>skills,</b> gear, and equipping ISO-8. <b>Upgrading</b> <b>skills</b> increases their damage level, upgrading gear improves a specific trait of the hero, like HP or Attack Speed, and equipping ISO-8 sets provides varying buffs and traits. In the various stores, in addition to Biometrics, players can also buy chests, energy, clear tickets, ISO-8, Biometric packages, and other supplies. Certain stores require tokens while the Game store require either gems or real currency the uniform store and SHIELD lab mini-store require gems and gold.|$|E

Survey was done in a sample consisted of 23 establishments, 630 workers, and 47 supervisors, meanwhile 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) for workers, and 5 FGDs for supervisors. Workers and supervisors alike reported illnesses and job dissatisfaction. Survey showed that the most prevalent issues among workers were: the need to <b>upgrade</b> <b>skills</b> (76. 3 %), pressured in doing work (60. 5 %), fast paced work (60. 5 %), repetitive work (63 %), and that work is both physically and mentally tiring (59. 7 %). On the other hand, supervisors described their work as challenging and stimulating (66 %), needed regular <b>upgrading</b> of <b>skills</b> (46. 8 %), and needed literacy on information technology (31. 9 %). Focus group discussions showed that workers and supervisors were confronted with stress, fast-paced work, the need to <b>upgrade</b> <b>skills</b> due to accommodation of information technology into the work production, fatigue, re-engineering and downsizing by management, low job control and difficult worker-supervisor relationship.

40|$|Knowledge-transfer {{relationships}} {{have become an}} increasingly important issue for firms in emerging economies; they offer a means of <b>upgrading</b> <b>skills</b> {{in the face of}} growing international competition. Knowledge-transfer relationships also are very difficult. Firms face uncertainties about both the types of knowledge needed, and the ability of potential partners to supply necessary knowledge (Easterby-Smith et al., 2008). Research on the knowledge-based view of the firm, reputation and status can provide insight into these problems. We use concepts from these areas of work to analyze knowledge-transfer in a sample of Chinese SMEs. We find that the status of partner firms provides an indicator of possessing valuable knowledge. This information can reduce some of the uncertainties of knowledge-transfer faced by managers. The research also addresses a gap in the work on knowledge-transfer.
