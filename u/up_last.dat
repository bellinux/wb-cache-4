5|$|On March 3, Michigan tied {{a school}} record with its fifth {{overtime}} {{game of the season}} (the first multiple overtime game since March 20, 2006) against Northwestern on Northwestern's Senior night. Michigan gave <b>up</b> <b>last</b> second game-tying three-point shots by Tre Demps in both regulation and the first overtime before losing in double overtime, despite career-high 28-point and 21-point performances by Irvin and Dawkins, respectively. Irvin posted his own and the team's second double-double of the season. On March 7, Michigan won its Big Ten Conference finale against Rutgers to finish the regular season at 15–15 (8–10 Big Ten). The game marked career-high scoring efforts by Dawkins (31) and Chatman (13), career-high assist efforts by Bielfeldt (3) and Albrecht (9) and a career-high rebounding effort by Bielfeldt (13). Bielfeldt made his first career start on this Senior night effort. Freshmen team managers Jon Rubenstein and Ryan Kapustka played in the game. Dawkins' 31 points was the most by a Michigan freshman since Trey Burke had 32 in 2012 and his 8 three pointers was the second most in school history, the most by a Wolverine since Glen Rice posted 8 in the 1989 NCAA Tournament and the most by a Big Ten player during the season, earning Dawkins the final Big Ten Freshman of the Week honor. In {{the second round of the}} 2015 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament on March 12, Michigan defeated Illinois after splitting a pair of overtime games won by the home teams during the regular season. The game marked Michigan's ninth consecutive win in its opening round of the Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament and Michigan's largest margin of victory over a conference opponent this season. In the quarterfinals of the Big Ten Tournament on March 13, Michigan lost to No. 1 seeded Wisconsin, despite a double-double and game-high 21 points and 11 rebounds by Irvin.|$|E

The team also set a BCJHL record for fewest goals scored in a 56-game season with 166. The record still stands as the fourth fewest goals scored in any season in BCJHL history.

25|$|However, Aquino {{proved to}} be a {{successful}} owner, helped in part by the inclusion of yet another controversial (and very vocal) baseball executive, Carlos Pieve, to his management team (this time as general manager). Aquino's first year as owner had the Indios win a league championship (2003), only to have them end <b>up</b> <b>last</b> the following year (2004), and subsequently win yet another championship the next year (2005). The team lost the 2006 final series against the Gigantes de Carolina and lost again against the team in the semifinal round of the 2007 playoffs.|$|E

Middlesex won their first domestic title in 15 years in the Twenty20 Cup with a 3 run win over reigning champions Kent.|$|E
500|$|The BCHR {{accused the}} {{government}} of using [...] "large amounts of tear gas ... to disperse anyone gathering on the streets". [...] "t has been very difficult for protesters to move from their villages onto the main streets because of the barbed wires that were set <b>up</b> <b>last</b> night," [...] al-Khawaja said. The BCHR also accused {{the government of}} dispatching mercenaries from Pakistan and Jordan to aid security forces in the crackdown, however an opposition figure said this claim was hard to prove, because security forces wear masks. The Associated Press and AFP reported that the heavy deployment of security forces have succeeded in preventing large-scale protests in Manama, instead protesters were confined to neighborhoods around the city.|$|E

Leslie decides not to attend the commendation ceremony so she can drive Ann home that night, cheering her up during the trip by telling her all the numerous embarrassing ways she has been dumped over the years.

500|$|In September 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell explained how the season would interact with Agent Carter saying, [...] "Agent Carter {{seems to be}} about SSR pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown <b>up</b> <b>last</b> year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that SSR stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we’re {{going to try to do}} it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{is written}} in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th century sentimental novels and {{domestic}} fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion. Even though Stowe's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers. The power {{in this type of}} writing {{can be seen in the}} reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: [...] "I was <b>up</b> <b>last</b> night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child." [...] Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva. Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.|$|E

500|$|Talking on how {{the season}} would {{interact}} with Agent Carter, Bell said, [...] "Here's what I think is interesting. Agent Carter seems to be about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown <b>up</b> <b>last</b> year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that S.S.R. stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we're {{going to try to do}} it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Several scenes in [...] "Shadows" [...] and [...] "The Things We Bury" [...] are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The episode [...] "Making Friends and Influencing People" [...] names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in Agent Carter, played by Ralph Brown.|$|E

The Buccaneers' rushing attack struggled, {{although}} Jerry Eckwood had an apparent 39-yard touchdown run that was called back due to penalty. Williams was held to 8 completions on 22 attempts for only 108 yards, but was able to lead a 76-yard scoring drive in the fourth quarter, after the Vikings had closed to within 7–6 {{on a pair of}} Rick Danmeier field goals. The Vikings answered with a 72-yard drive of their own that ended in a 4-yard Steve Dils touchdown pass to Joe Senser.
