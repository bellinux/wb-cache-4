40|$|Brittle {{fracture}} of large forging equipment usually leads to catastrophic consequences. To avoid {{this kind of}} accident, the brittle fracture behaviors of a large <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> were studied by simulating the practical application. The <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> is used on the large die forging press, and it is made of 55 NiCrMoV 7 hot-work tool steel. Detailed investigations including mechanical properties analysis, metallographic observation, fractography, transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis and {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED) were conducted. The results reveal that the material generated a large quantity of large size polyhedral M 23 C 6 (M: Fe and Cr mainly) and elongated M 3 C (M: Fe mainly) carbides along the martensitic lath boundaries when the <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> was recurrently tempered and water-cooled at 250 °C during the service. The large size carbides lead to the material embrittlement and impact toughness degradation, and further resulted in the brittle {{fracture of}} the <b>die</b> <b>holder.</b> Therefore, the operation specification must be emphasized to avoid the <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> being cooled by using water, which is aimed at accelerating the cooling...|$|R

50|$|The {{electricity}} and district heating were often stopped {{in order to}} save energy, leading to unbearable winters. Availability of hot water was also restricted to one day per week in most apartments.

Street lighting was often turned off and generally reduced to a bare minimum.|$|R
