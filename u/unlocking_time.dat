40|$|The {{results of}} {{dislocation}} unlocking experiments are reported. The stress required to unpin a dislocation from nitrogen impurities in nitrogen-doped float-zone silicon (NFZ-Si) and from oxygen impurities in Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) is measured, {{as a function}} of the unlocking duration. It is found that unlocking stress drops with increasing <b>unlocking</b> <b>time</b> in all materials tested. Analysis of these results indicates that dislocation locking by nitrogen in NFZ-Si is by an atomic species, with a similar locking strength per atom to that previously deduced for oxygen atoms in Cz-Si. Other experiments measure dislocation unlocking stress at 550 [*]°C in NFZ-Si annealed at 500 – 1050 [*]°C. The results allow an effective diffusivity of nitrogen in silicon at 500 – 750 [*]°C to be inferred, with an activation energy of 3. 24 eV and a diffusivity prefactor of approximately 200 [*] 000  cm 2 [*]s− 1. This effective diffusivity is consistent with previous measurements made at higher temperatures using secondary ion mass spectrometry. When the results are analyzed in terms of a monomer-dimer dissociative mechanism, a nitrogen monomer diffusivity with an activation energy in the range of 1. 1 – 1. 4 eV is inferred. The data also show that the saturation dislocation unlocking stress measured at 550 [*]°C in NFZ-Si is dependent on the anneal temperature, peaking at 600 – 700 [*]°C and falling toward zero at 1000 [*]°C...|$|E

50|$|The game's main mode, {{which allows}} Pac-Man to equip {{up to three}} power-ups, {{requires}} credits which are replenished over time (the player can purchase unlimited credits with real money). Alternatively, the player can use Free Play, which can be played at any time without power-ups. Credits {{can also be used}} to revive the player once per game.

5|$|The game's fifteen tracks—four {{of which}} are {{available}} immediately—are based on conventional video game environments such as jungles, volcanoes, and cities. After completing a track for the first <b>time,</b> the player <b>unlocks</b> a <b>time</b> trial mode for this track, and a boss battle. The action-oriented boss battles involve defeating a generally static Digimon using items scattered throughout the areas, which are not designed as race tracks. The player can also compete in single races unrelated to the story in any unlocked tracks. The game uses the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter or Game Link Cable accessories for a multiplayer racing mode supporting up to four players.|$|R

50|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} primarily for multiplayer gameplay {{and allows for}} a maximum of 64 players on a server or a maximum of 16 players in single player mode against bots on Conquest mode. It has its own ranking system {{to keep track of}} the user's statistics similar to the one used in its predecessor, Battlefield 2. It opens up new categories of vehicles and weapons not seen in Battlefield 2. Battlefield 2142 has an unlock system that allows the player to choose a new <b>unlock</b> every <b>time</b> they achieve a new rank instead of forcing the player to purchase items. A booster pack called Northern Strike contains new maps, unlocks, and vehicles; a deluxe edition was released that contains Battlefield 2142 and Northern Strike.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explains}} when, and why, solder-based {{phase change}} materials (PCMs) are best-suited {{as a means}} to modify a robotic mechanism's kinematic and elastomechanic behavior. The preceding refers to mechanisms that possess joints which may be thermally locked and unlocked via a material phase change within the joint. Different combinations of locked and unlocked joints yield different one-DOF mechanisms states. A single actuator is used to control motion allowed by the different states. By reducing the number of required actuators, solderlocking joints enable the creation of compliant centimeter-scale mechanisms that can perform a multiplicity of tasks. Herein, this thesis presents physics-based design insights that provide understanding of how solder-based material properties and joint design dominate joint performance characteristics. First order models are used to demonstrate selection of suitable PCMs and how to set initial joint geometry prior to fine tuning via detailed FEA models and experiments. The first order models result in order-of-magnitude estimates of the locking and <b>unlocking</b> <b>times</b> for the joints. The insights and models are discussed in the context of two case studies. Squishbot 1 is a crawling robot that uses a single spooler motor and three solder-locking joints to crawl and steer. Squishbot 1 is able to reconfigure its joints in approximately 10 seconds. SquishTendons utilizes solder-locking joints to actuate a compliant structure with a single motor. The second robot used the complete set of models and rules to improve on the performance of Squishbotl. SquishTendons can unlock and lock its joints in less than 6 seconds. by Maria J. Telleria.

5|$|Like {{the first}} Ridge Racer, the player {{normally}} starts with four cars. The remaining eight are selectable on winning the mini game before the title screen (the mini game is Galaga '88 {{instead of the}} original game's Galaxian). They are mostly unchanged; their names (certain cars are named after other Namco titles) and specifications {{are similar to the}} first game. After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are <b>unlocked,</b> and <b>Time</b> Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of the Novice course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course). These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the dynamics of}} a quantum-dash Fabry-Pérot passively mode-locked laser diode is presented. Firstly, the switching on and off characteristic times of the mode-locking mechanism with pulsed biasing current are assessed. Secondly, the locking and <b>unlocking</b> characteristic <b>times</b> to the injection of a 10 -Gbps pseudo-random binary sequence of nonreturn-to-zero data are determined. The dynamics is analysed through the instantaneous frequency of the $sim hbox{ 40 ~GHz}$ beat-tone signal measured at the output of the laser under investigation, which after a frequency down-conversion stage, is recorded by a real-time oscilloscope. Experimental results indicate that a time of 5 ns characterizes the establishment of the passive mode-locking mechanism for a pulsed biasing current. A time of 20 ns has been measured for the synchronization of the quantum-dash laser diode to the injected 10 Gbps data sequence. In addition, the mode-locked laser diode de-synchronizes and switches to the free-running condition in also 20 ns after a holding time of $sim 100 ~hbox{ns}$...|$|R

40|$|Runic {{abbreviations}} appear sporadically in {{a number}} of Old English manuscripts, including three of the four major poetic codices. A convincing rational for the apparently erratic deployment of these unusual abbreviations has yet to be proposed. In this article I identify the immediate literary context as an important factor influencing the distribution of Anglo-Saxon runic abbreviations, noting in particular that the runic brevigraphs often appear in passages which deal with unlocking. To illuminate this association, I turn to Bede’s story of the prisoner Imma, whose chains become <b>unlocked</b> each <b>time</b> he is bound. His credulous captors believe this miracle to be the work of litteras solutorias, or ‘releasing letters’, the Old English translation of Bede’s work referring explicitly to the alysendlic, or ‘unlocking’, rune. This episode may help to explain why runes appear in a riddle about a lock and key, in the context of Elene’s prayer to open a hoard, and in a passage in which Saturn asks how he may unlock the doors of heaven. If such an association indeed exists, it has implications for our understanding of the perception of the runic script in late Anglo-Saxon England, and it also suggests that the rationale for the use of runes in the Exeter Book riddles may be connected with revealing rather than concealing information...|$|R
