Hence, common ostriches drink relatively large volumes of water daily, and excrete generous quantities of highly concentrated urine.

Though {{there have been no}} official detailed renal studies conducted on the flow rate (Poiseuille's Law) and composition of the ureteral urine in the ostrich, knowledge of renal function has been based on samples of cloacal urine, and samples or quantitative collections of voided urine. Studies have shown that the amount of water intake, and dehydration impacts the plasma osmolality and <b>urine</b> <b>osmolality</b> within various sized ostriches.

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} the molecular basis and clinical characteristics of X-linked congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) presenting {{with an unusual}} phenotype characterized by partial resistance to AVP. Subjects The proband was admitted {{at the age of}} 4 years with a history of polydipsia and polyuria since infancy. Initial clinical testing confirmed a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI). Urine osmolarity rose during fluid deprivation and after 20 microg of intranasal desmopressin [1 -deamino- 8 -d-arginine-vasopressin (dDAVP) ]. A similar DI phenotype was found in his brother. Methods The coding regions of the AVP gene and the AVP receptor 2 (AVPR 2) genes were sequenced in two affected and three unaffected family members. Clinical studies included a fluid deprivation test, intranasal dDAVP challenge, infusion of graded doses of dDAVP and AVP, and measurements of 24 -h urine output before {{and at the end of}} a 7 -day therapeutic trial of intranasal dDAVP. Results A novel missense mutation (1454 C > A) in exon 3 of the AVPR 2 gene predicting a Ser 329 Arg substitution was identified in the X-chromosome of the two affected brothers and in one of the X-chromosomes in the mother. The AVPR 2 gene was normal in two unaffected siblings. Under basal conditions, the 24 -h urine volumes of the two affected boys were 5. 5 l (229 ml/kg) and 3. 5 l (192 ml/kg), the <b>urine</b> <b>osmolalities</b> were 78 and 90 mosm/kg, and plasma AVP 13. 5 and 19. 0 pg/ml. <b>Urine</b> <b>osmolalities</b> increased to 573 and 720 mosm/kg while plasma AVP levels were practically unchanged, 13. 6 and 8. 8 pg/ml, during fluid deprivation. Infusion of AVP resulted in <b>urine</b> <b>osmolalities</b> of 523 and 623 mosm/kg at plasma AVP levels of 58 and 42 pg/ml. Infusion of dDAVP had a similar effect, while treatment with standard doses of intranasal dDAVP had no effect on urine output. Discussion The affected members of this Belgian kindred have CNDI with partial resistance to AVP caused by a mutation in the AVPR 2 gene that differs from any of the six mutations reported previously to produce this phenotype. Because the resistance to AVP is partial, this form of CNDI can be difficult to distinguish by indirect diagnostic tests from partial pituitary and dipsogenic DI. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Mammals {{adapted to}} {{a great variety of}} {{habitats}} with different accessibility to water. In addition to changes in kidney morphology, e. g. the length of the loops of Henle, several hormone systems are involved in adaptation to limited water supply, among them the renal-neurohypophysial vasopressin/vasopressin receptor system. Comparison of over 80 mammalian V 2 vasopressin receptor (V 2 R) orthologs revealed high structural and functional conservation of this key component involved in renal water reabsorption. Although many mammalian species have unlimited access to water there is no evidence for complete loss of V 2 R function indicating an essential role of V 2 R activity for survival even of those species. In contrast, several marsupial V 2 R orthologs show a significant increase in basal receptor activity. An increased vasopressin-independent V 2 R activity can be interpreted as a shift in the set point of the renal-neurohypophysial hormone circuit to realize sufficient water reabsorption already at low hormone levels. As found in other desert mammals arid-adapted marsupials show high <b>urine</b> <b>osmolalities.</b> The gain of basal V 2 R function in several marsupials may contribute to the increased urine concentration abilities and, therefore, provide an advantage to maintain water and electrolyte homeostasis under limited water supply conditions...|$|R

Rats were given indomethacin before and during the obstructive phase of kidney infection and were sacrificed at different times thereafter. Although renal infection (as defined by bacterial counts) was equally frequent (76 %) and severe in indomethacin-treated and control rats sacrificed at the end of the obstructive period, it was found that the incidence of AEP (as defined by the inflammatory response of the kidney elicited by bacteria) 2 days after removal of the obstruction was significantly reduced from 74 % in controls given water to 48 % in indomethacin-treated animals (P = 0. 02).

In salt intoxication, the urine sodium concentrations are very high and fractional excretion of sodium is greater than 1%. Initial test results may be suggestive of diabetes insipidus.

Using these methods, 97. 3 % of all rats studied achieved stable levels of severe hyponatremia (plasma [Na+] = 111. 6 ± 0. 5 mEq/liter, N = 213), which was sustained for periods of time ranging from two to five weeks. Mortality was low (1. 8 %) and observable morbidity was not noted over {{a series of studies}} encompassing 4, 628 rat days of sustained hypoosmolality. Analysis of food intake and body weight revealed no evidence of tissue catabolism at any time with the lower (1 ng/hr) DDAVP infusion rate, and only during the first week with the higher (5 ng/hr) rate. Metabolic balance studies during 13 days of sustained hypoosmolality demonstrated the dilutional nature of the hypoosmolality, and only a limited degree of renal escape from the antidiuretic effects of DDAVP (<b>urine</b> <b>osmolalities</b> 800 to 1200 mOsm/kg H 20). Studies of brain water and electrolyte contents demonstrated complete normalization of brain volume after 14 to 28 days of sustained hypoosmolality, the major part of which (70 %) could be accounted for by loss of brain electrolytes. Both natriuresis and kaliuresis occurred during the first five days of hypoosmolality, and were of sufficient magnitude to suggest some degree of adaptation of other body fluid compartments via electrolyte losses as well. These results indicate that rats have substantial capacity to tolerate prolonged severe hypoosmolality with little morbidity and mortality as long as proper attention is paid to their nutritional requirements, and provide further evidence that brain volume regulation likely represents the major adaptive mechanism that allows survival despite sustained hypoosmolality...|$|R

Patient was evaluated every month with fluid balance, <b>urine</b> volume, <b>osmolality,</b> and serum elec-trolytes. Daily dosage of desmopressin was 40 mg/nostril for all the duration of pregnancy according to a trend of an adequate fluid and electrolytes balance and in absence of symptoms. Mean blood Pressure was 100 / 60 mmHg; coagu-lation, liver, renal function were normal. Fetal monitoring with periodic ultrasound detected a normal intrauterine growth.

40|$|Objective: 1. To {{investigate}} {{the amount of}} citrate and tartrate in aloe gel, and in the urine of healthy normal volunteers, before and after consuming fresh aloe gel. 2. To evaluate {{the changes in the}} chemical composition of urine among subjects after taking aloe gel. 3. To determine the value of consuming aloe gel for prevention of renal stone formation. Designs: Experimental study; before and after experiment with no control group Material and Method: Thirty one healthy male medical students between 18 and 23 years of age were enrolled (with informed consent) in the clinical trial. Subjects ingested 100 g of fresh aloe gel twice a day for seven consecutive days. The 24 -hr urine was collected one day prior to taking the gel (Day 0), Days 2 and 5 of consumption, and Day 8 (one day after completion).
