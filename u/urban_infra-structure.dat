As an important component and critical technology in IOT, radio frequency identification (RFID) system provides an effective method to detect, moni-tor or control the object and is composed of tag, reader and antenna. At last we design a compact microstrip antenna with low cost and small weight for a RFID system in IOT which can also be used in narrow-band wireless communication. 1. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{infrastructure}} of the future provides the opportu-nity for new innovations to meet the constantly chang-ing and diversified needs of cities. Some of the relatively more recent needs are using renewable resources, pro-tecting infrastructure and its users against natural haz-ards, reducing environmental threats including global warming, enhancing safety and security, and providing an overall high-performing service for infrastructure users. Given that resources to support these additional financial needs and services are limited, this article will examine ways in which cities can address the demands of these new emerging areas synergistically {{as well as through}} more traditional investments. In particular, traditional investment areas for upgrading <b>urban</b> <b>infra-structure</b> to meet “state-of-good-repair ” benchmarks are presented for energy, transportation, and water as a foundation for conceptualizing how these new demands might alter, yet dovetail with, traditional investment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pension funds {{may be one}} of the few avenues {{now open}} for {{financing}} new <b>urban</b> <b>infra-structure</b> and development projects. But convention dominates pension fund trustees ' investment decisions, so it is difficult to see how the ambitions of advocates of pension fund investment can be squared with trustees ' behaviour. The question is: why does convention dominate? Drawing on previously reported interviews and case studies, I propose a framework through which to understand the dominance of convention. In doing so, I identify a set of behavioural traits that structure decisions. This framework is inspired by the contributions of Kahneman and Tversky and their colleagues for understanding the economic psychology of individual decisionmaking. The paper is intended to be a realistic account of the attributes of trustee decisionmaking, recognising the ingrained and systematic nature of the identified habits, rules, and norms. The paper is also inspired by Keynes's work on risk and uncertainty. In combination, I assess the potential for investment innovation by pension fund trustees, noting the importance of analogical reasoning in extending the range of pension funds investments. The paper closes with a comparison of the proposed framework with standard treatments of decisionmaking, including reference to the robustness of psychological models of habit...|$|E
40|$|This article {{suggests}} that “Cosmopolitanism ” {{was not merely}} a distinctive feature of Medi-terranean ports between the mid-nineteenth century and {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century, but also a specific cultural phenomenon that characterized commercial diasporas. The latter have played key roles in international trade and proved to be basic agents of change in the urban and civic development of Mediterranean cities. I use the two examples of Odessa and Alexandria to support my hypothesis that “Cosmopolitanism ” may be described as a distinctive cultural worldview and a set of publicly oriented practices that drew inspiration from Western European progressive Enlightenment. It characterized the activities of a segment of the Greek (and other) commercial diasporas in the Eastern Mediterranean, and was inextricably linked with an increasing internationalization of trade in the early indus-trial period. It comprised certain skills and qualities developed by merchants of family and kinship-embedded international trading houses. It was also accompanied by a wider civic-oriented philanthropy for regional or local development, often outside national borders. These not only facilitated commerce, but also contributed to the development of <b>urban</b> <b>infra-structures</b> and the embellishment of towns through giving them a common “European...|$|R
40|$|A gradual generalização da utilização da eletricidade nos espaços urbanos, verificada a partir da década de 1880, foi favorecida pelas ideias urbanísticas que marcaram a época e que se traduziram por uma maior preocupação com a organização espacial das cidades, com criação e modernização das redes de abastecimento de água ou de esgotos, com a iluminação do espaço público e com o estabelecimento de parques e jardins, medidas que procuravam garantir a segurança e o bem-estar das populações ao mesmo tempo que permitiam pôr em prática as ideias higienistas que conheciam uma difusão cada vez maior. A introdução da eletricidade na iluminação das cidades e nos transportes urbanos, tal como a implantação de outras infraestruturas urbanas, exigiu soluções técnicas, por vezes complexas, que obrigaram a recorrer à engenharia e à transferência de tecnologia. Por outro lado, a utilização da eletricidade nas cidades permitiu uma utilização mais intensa do espaço público, iluminado a luz elétrica durante a noite, e, graças às novas facilidades de transporte possibilitadas pela utilização dos “carros elétricos”, um alargamento do espaço urbano para as suas zonas marginais. Neste texto procura-se analisar: a difusão de conhecimentos científicos e técnicos; a transferência da tecnologia na criação das redes elétricas de iluminação e transporte das cidades de Lisboa e Porto; a ação que tiveram os engenheiros na transferência de tecnologia e no estabelecimento dessas redes; a forma como a introdução da eletricidade na iluminação e transporte alterou a vida e o espaço dessas duas cidades. ******************* The gradual {{generalization}} of {{the usage of}} electricity in urban spaces, that can be verified from the 1880 s onwards, was facilitated by the urbanistic ideas of those times, characterized by a greater concern with the spatial organization of the cities, the creation and modernization of networks of water supply or sewerage, the lighting of public spaces {{and the creation of}} parks and gardens, measures that aimed to ensure the security and well-being of local populations while allowing to implement the ideas about hygiene that were then widespread. The introduction of electricity in the illumination of cities and in public transportation, as well as the implantation of other <b>urban</b> <b>infra-structures,</b> demanded technical solutions, sometimes quite complex, which compelled to resort to engineering and to the transfer of technologies. On the other hand, the use of electricity in the cities allowed for a more intense usage of public spaces, illuminated by electric light during the night and, thanks to the new facilities in transportation made possible by the use of tramways to an enlargement of the urban space towards its more marginal zones. In this text we aim to analyse: the transfer of technology in the creation of electrical networks of illumination and transportation in the cities of Lisbon and Oporto; the role played by engineers in the transfer of technology and in the establishment of these networks; {{the ways in which the}} introduction of electricity in the illumination and transportation altered the life and the space in these two cities...|$|R
40|$|The Amazon region {{presents}} {{a gap in}} its topographic knowledge. An alternative way for cartographic mapping at semi-detailed scale (1 : 100. 000) {{is the use of}} complementary information generated from distinct orbital SAR programs. Planimetric and altimetric information can be provided from the combination of data extracted from the high-resolution ALOS-PALSAR (planimetry) and SRTM (altimetry) programs. This study analyzed the potential of planimetric information provided by dual-polarized PALSAR (FDB) images acquired under distinct look-azimuth (ascending and descending passes) and variable incidence over the Serra dos Carajás region, easternmost border of the Brazilian Amazon Region. The study area is characterized by a mountainous relief with altitude varying from 150 to 800 meters. Dense equatorial forest, type-savanna vegetation and various anthropogenic activities related to large mining exploration and exploitation programs (<b>infra-structures,</b> <b>urban</b> nucleus, etc.) are the main thematic classes for planimetric mapping in the study area. The methodological approach combined distinct techniques of digital image processing such as arithmetic operations, principal component transformation and decorrelation stretch aiming at the extraction of thematic information for cartographic mapping purposes. The analysis has shown that when only one look-azimuth is considered the best results were obtained from ascending pass. However, the combination of information extracted from both passes has also improved the overall quality of the results. The usage of similar approach in distinct areas of the Brazilian Amazon is considered relevant due to a critical lack of reliable planialtimetric information and to the expensive costs of cartographic mapping.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} part of a study carried out by {{researchers}} from the group of studies on environmental, gender and poverty issues, which is linked to the Applied Social Sciences Masters and Doctorate Program at Ponta Grossa State University. This is a qualitativequantitative study with characteristics of exploratory research, which addresses the social consequences of the use of fertilizers/pesticides to poor families living in the periphery of the city of Ponta Grossa in the South of Brazil. Triangulated data, obtained through field trips, interviews and participant observation, demonstrated the seriousness of the population contact with fertilizers. Theoretical studies on the theme identified {{that one of the most}} remarkable phenomena in the current Brazilian society is the speed of the urbanization process. Historically, the expansion of cities has been marked by the logics center-periphery, and in the last decades the transfer of groups of people has been noticed from the most central areas (due to economical and estate interests) to the most peripheral ones. It is important to consider the consequences of this phenomenon and how it is foreseen in the municipal planning, once it is in the rural-urban where the most significant natural resources are found, those which are vital to both the environmental balance and <b>urban</b> <b>infra-structure</b> systems. In the region of Ponta Grossa, Paraná State, South of Brazil, a process of strong junction between rural and urban has been observed. The evidence is that several areas and entire communities have developed very close to large areas of soybean, corn, wheat and other crops and thus, are totally exposed to the fertilizers used in those areas. Data collected also shows that the families living in those areas experience a routine of severe environmental, social and health problems without really understanding how serious this problem is.
