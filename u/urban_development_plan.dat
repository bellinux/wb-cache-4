Among the attendees was the Governor Jaime Rodríguez Calderón. Grupo Garza Ponce stated that Nuevo León needed an <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plan</b> that was uniform throughout all of its municipalities. Under this proposed plan, municipalities had to work in conjunction with the state government and other municipalities to guarantee uniformity; municipalities would be allowed to exercise certain authorities and regulations without approvals from the state. Grupo Garza Ponce stated that the problem was that each municipality in the state had their own agenda for urban planning.|$|E

A survey by Veja magazine found that 80% of drivers are against congestion pricing, and another survey by Exame magazine found that only 1% of São Paulo's residents support the initiative, while 30% find that extending the metro system is a better solution to reduce traffic congestion. São Paulo's strategic <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plan</b> [...] "SP 2040", approved in November 2012, proposes the implementation of congestion pricing by 2025, when the density of metro and bus corridors is expected to reach 1.25km/km2.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the conceptual requirements in preparing an evaluation {{framework for the}} <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> in Iran as well as modifies the evaluation criteria proposed in previous studies. Although applying a highly refined evaluation framework for assessing the quality of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> can increase {{the efficiency of the}} development process, employing an unmodified framework in a specific urban context may negatively affect the development process because of exclusive conditions. An evaluation framework based on the worldwide experiences cannot normally be employed in the evaluation of the <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> of Iran. Hence, this research contributes to the advancement of a more adaptable evaluation framework for evaluation in four parts. These parts include (i) the examination of the <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> process of Iran; (ii) the extraction of a general evaluation framework from different studies and worldwide experiences; (iii) the analysis of the effective elements for the <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> of Iran through SWOT analysis; and (iv) the generation of an evaluation framework based on a preliminary analysis of the specific situation of the <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> of Iran...|$|R

Tourism, though a contributor to the economy, is strictly regulated, maintaining a balance between the traditional, development and modernization. Thimphu contains most of the important political buildings in Bhutan, including the National Assembly of the newly formed parliamentary democracy and Dechencholing Palace, the official residence of the King, located {{to the north of the}} city. As a metropolis and capital city, Thimphu is coordinated by the [...] "Thimphu Structure Plan", an <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Plan</b> which evolved in 1998 with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley.

2500|$|The Thimphu Structure Plan is {{a modern}} <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plan</b> for the Thimphu city, evolved in 1998, with the {{objective}} of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley, including its rivers and forests. This planning was necessitated due to growth of automobiles and pressure on the public health infrastructure in the town centre, restrictions imposed on plot coverage and building heights. The plan was approved by the Council of Ministers in 2003. An elected body, the Thimphu Municipal Corporation, is implementing the plan, drawn up by the American architect Christopher Charles Benninger. This plan is estimated to cost more than $1 billion when completed. Funds for implementation of the plan are being provided by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. [...] There are some disputed areas between land owners and stakeholders, which has resulted in the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank requesting the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MOWHS) to resolve the issues through a process of the agreement, before further funds are released.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{urbanization}} process {{all over the}} world has raised the need to employ more satisfactory <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> approaches; these are especially recognized and declared in developing countries. This paper attempts to indicate what achievable ways may improve the current <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> based on the comprehensive planning method in Iran. In order to achieve this objective, this paper reviews qualitatively the urban planning in Iran and assesses its <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans.</b> Ultimately, appropriate measures are presented in order to suggest how the defects found in the current Iranian <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> may be corrected by employing the lessons learned from practical examples recorded in other selected countries. The primary data was collected by means of semi-structured interviews from decision making and decision taking processes in Iran. In conclusion, this article suggests that the identified defects of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> in Iran may be improved by adapting to the most recent universal concepts of urban planning. In other words, Iranian urban planning should be distanced from political decisions and instead motivated as a technical process in the government structure...|$|R
