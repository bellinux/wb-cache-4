5000|$|The lozenge (technically a mascle) {{can be used}} {{on public}} roadways in the United States and Canada to mark a {{specific}} lane for a particular use. The lane will usually be painted with a lozenge at a regular interval, and signage will be installed to indicate the restrictions on using the lane. This marking is most often used to denote high-occupancy vehicle lanes or bus lanes, with accompanying signage reading [...] "◊ HOV LANE" [...] or [...] "◊ BUS LANE" [...] and giving the requirements for a vehicle to be accepted. Prior to 17 January 2006, lozenges could also be used to mark bicycle-only lanes, often in conjunction with a bicycle icon. [...] In New Zealand and Japan, a lozenge marked in white paint on the road indicates an upcoming <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing.</b>|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} a procedure {{for the evaluation}} of <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> locations that takes into account accepted practice, safety and delay. Safety considerations have been paramount to the analysis of crossings but delay is often not considered. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) {{provides a}} methodology for determining delay that can be included in the analysis of a crossing location. The analysis procedure takes into account previous research procedures and adds in delay considerations to develop a methodology appropriate for use by jurisdictional agencies in the evaluation of what is needed for treatments at uncontrolled pedestrian crossings. The evaluation procedure developed runs through a multi-step process from field data review through the consideration of appropriate treatment options. The evaluation procedure takes into account field data collection; safety/crash history; stopping sight distance; HCM Level of Service (LOS); pedestrian sight distance; origins and destinations/alternate routes; access spacing and functional classification; roadway speed and pedestrian use; FHWA guidance for placement based on safety considerations; school crossings; and appropriate treatment options. Treatment options include four different classes: Signing and Marking Treatments; Traffic Calming Treatments; Uncontrolled Crossing Treatments; and High Level Treatments...|$|E

2500|$|In May 1987, {{as part of}} the 50th anniversary celebration, the Golden Gate Bridge {{district}} again {{closed the}} bridge to automobile traffic and allowed <b>pedestrians</b> to <b>cross</b> the bridge. However, this celebration attracted 750,000 to 1,000,000 people, and ineffective crowd control meant the bridge became congested with roughly 300,000 people, causing the center span of the bridge to flatten out under the weight. Although the bridge is designed to flex in that way under heavy loads, and was estimated not to have exceeded 40% of the yielding stress of the suspension cables, bridge officials stated that <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>pedestrian</b> access was not being considered {{as part of the}} 75th anniversary on Sunday, May 27, 2012, because of the additional law enforcement costs required [...] "since 9/11".|$|R
40|$|<b>Pedestrian</b> <b>crossing,</b> as an {{important}} part of transportation infrastructures, serves to secure pedestrians’ lives and possessions and keep traffic flow in order. As a prominent feature in the street scene, detection of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> contributes to 3 D road marking reconstruction and diminishing the adverse impact of outliers in 3 D street scene reconstruction. Since <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> is subject to wearing and tearing from heavy traffic flow, it is of great imperative to monitor its status quo. On this account, an approach of automatic <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> detection using images from vehicle-based Mobile Mapping System is put forward and its defilement and impairment are analyzed in this paper. Firstly, <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> classifier is trained with low recall rate. Then initial detections are refined by utilizing projection filtering, contour information analysis, and monocular vision. Finally, a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> detection and analysis system with high recall rate, precision and robustness will be achieved. This system works for <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> detection under different situations and light conditions. It can recognize defiled and impaired crossings automatically in the meanwhile, which facilitates monitoring and maintenance of traffic facilities, so as to reduce potential traffic safety problems and secure lives and property...|$|R

40|$|In India {{pedestrian}} crashes mostly {{occurs when}} <b>pedestrians</b> <b>cross</b> the road, especially at signalized intersections. This study examines various factors affecting <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> behaviours at signalized intersections under mixed traffic conditions. The <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> movements were captured throughvideographic survey conducted at selected 8 signalized intersections in Mumbai, India The captured data consisting of around 2476 pedestrians and {{observed that the}} rate of pedestrian compliance with traffic signal was 53 %. This study is oriented towards various levels of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> behaviour such as <b>pedestrian</b> arrival pattern, <b>crossing</b> speed, compliance behaviour and pedestrian-vehicular interaction at signalized intersections. In first level, the pedestrian arrival pattern was analysed to find best fit. In second level, the factors affecting <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> speed were identified by suitable statistical test with respect to pedestrian and traffic characteristics. The third level involves the analysis of pedestrian compliance behaviour with respect to pedestrian gender, age, platoon, crossing type, crosswalk marking, crossing direction and crossing speed based on various statistical tests. The fourth level comprises of pedestrian-vehicular interactions in detail,based on conducted statistical test. The pedestrian-vehicular interaction was modelled by using binary logit model. Study results indicate that approaching vehicle direction and gap sizewere the highly influencing factors for interactions. Findings from this study will help to understand the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> behaviour at signalized intersections where the pedestrians noncompliance are predominant and recommends for adequate facilities to be provided to all <b>pedestrians</b> to <b>cross</b> the street with utmost safe, comfort and convenience...|$|R

However, the understanding of the sequence of event in the pedestrian accident process is still less clear. It acquires the definition of event in the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> scenario at signalised intersections as an operational event that may lead to pedestrian accident. Thus, this paper gives an insight view of translating the sequence of event to model <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> scenarios using Petri Nets approach. Qualitative data from site observation was extracted to draw the flow of events for the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> scenario.

The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the work of <b>pedestrians</b> <b>crossing</b> facility, that is zebra cross from the side of analysis on critical gap for finding out the opportunity in cossing the street safety and donot disturb the passing vehicles. This analisys method of critical gap is used for searching the minimum gap among vehicle passing through location in order that the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> the street may cross safety. Primary data taking is carried out throung field survey using handycam for watching the conflict point and time gap between vehicles passing throung the street and pefestrian who cross the street to the conflict point. From the data analisys result, the writer obtains that critical gap in study location is 2, 62 second and the opportunity degree for crossing the street safety is only 11 persons on 6. 30 to 7. 30 WIB and 7. 30 to 8. 30 as much as 29 persons. Thus, we may conclude that <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> facility, namely zebra cross is not effective and for the further is that <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> should not be in the same field.

40|$|Pedestrian {{crossings}} are {{the critical}} {{points in the}} traffic network that need to enable <b>pedestrians</b> to safely <b>cross</b> the road. The safety level depends {{on the type of}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing.</b> The differences between individual types of pedestrian crossings can be noted also in relation to other criteria such as the price, energy, environmental impact, accessibility, etc. Besides, various groups of users assess the quality service differently, even when this refers to the same type of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing.</b> Therefore, optimal solution of a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> has to be selected based on a comprehensive and rational analysis and application of adequate software tools. The selection methodology of an optimal <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> is defined using a multi-criteria analysis. In order to view the problem as a whole, four scenarios of evaluating alternatives are foreseen. Four different groups of stakeholders: traffic experts, investors, groups of persons with disabilities and healthy persons (persons not included in the previous three stakeholder groups), who use a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> (according to different age, disability, perception of personal safety, etc.), assessed the importance of the offered criteria. Different groups of users have different preferences in relation to individual groups of criteria, depending on their interests and needs. One group finds the criterion of pedestrian safety the most important one, others think that finances are most important (the cost of construction), some think that accessibility is the most important issue, etc. The solutions obtained in this manner provide insight into the advantages and drawbacks of individual versions. This makes it easier for the decision-makers to select only one variant / alternative from a group of the offered solutions in compliance with the defined criteria and sub-criteria with the aim of defining an optimal <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> for a certain spatial and traffic location.
