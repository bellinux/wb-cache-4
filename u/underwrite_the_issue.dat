The relational analysis has been limited {{to the case of}} the syndicate issuances that took place between 2002 and 2015 and the process whereby lead manager banks choose their partners to <b>underwrite</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The main contribution of this paper is the identification of social tie patterns between market participants and their structural equivalence in the market. Furthermore, it reveals how status operates in the market, conferring advantages on those actors with optimum positioning...|$|E

Unlike death benefits, which the contractholder generally cannot time, living benefits pose significant risk for insurance companies as contractholders will likely exercise these benefits when they are worth the most.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} securities <b>issues</b> where <b>the</b> quality of securities is private information to the issuer, and firms of higher quality are more reluctant to issue securities than low quality firms. We show that, when the issuer directly trades with investors, market breakdown may occur. This {{is caused by the}} issuer’s attempts to signal his type through the offering price. Things change if we introduce a financial intermediary which: i) <b>underwrites</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> ii) influences <b>the</b> offering price. <b>Underwriting</b> creates a wedge between the interests of the intermediary and those of the issuer, which allows trade with investors to be restored. A by-product of this conflict of interest is that trade is characterized by underpricing. Another implication is that the intermediary may act as a reliable screening device when she possesses private information about the firm’s quality. In general, our analysis suggests that collusion between the intermediary and the issuer hinders trade, whereas collusion between the intermediary an...|$|R

The results report {{a positive relationship between}} relative flotation costs and <b>the</b> <b>underwriting</b> of an <b>issue,</b> and a negative relationship between such costs and ownership concentration. Fixed flotation costs and a negative relationship with the gross offer proceeds are also observed. On average, there is a negative share price reaction on the date of the 'previous communication' to the "Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores". The different sub-samples analysed according to <b>the</b> <b>underwriting</b> of <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> and <b>the</b> discount offered reveal no statistical differences.

50|$|Gardner Ross {{is a small}} Canadian {{investment}} bank that is somewhat profitable, but often faces a takeover by a larger institution due to its inability {{to compete in a}} global marketplace. Crisis strikes when senior partner Cedric Ross is jailed after money goes missing from an initial public offering. Fearing that his partner Adam Cunningham will take advantage of his absence to agree to a friendly takeover by a larger bank, he calls on his only child, Sally, {{to take care of his}} interests in his absence. Meanwhile, hotshot trader Jack Larkin is looking to break into {{investment bank}}ing and approaches Adam, who agrees to allow Larkin to join the firm if he can land another IPO. Jack undercuts a rival bank and wins the IPO, but as the investment syndicate falls through, Gardner Ross finds itself responsible for most of <b>the</b> <b>underwriting</b> of <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> and if <b>the</b> sale goes poorly, faces the loss of all of its investment capital. Luckily, head trader Marty Stephens saves the day by making a large profit for the bank selling <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> into a cool market.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the effect of {{volatility}} estimates in <b>the</b> valuation of <b>underwritten</b> rights issues. Previous studies on the valuation of rights issues found that underwriters overpriced <b>the</b> risk of <b>underwriting</b> that they provide to companies for rights issues. This paper, in its examination of Australian rights issues from 1987 to 1993, provides evidence that the degree of overpricing, if any, is dependent on the volatility that is used in the option model to value <b>the</b> <b>underwritten</b> rights <b>issue.</b> This paper shows that if the volatility is adjusted for the problem of thin trading, then the volatility in the pre-announcement period is significantly different from the volatility in <b>the</b> <b>underwriting</b> period. If previous studies used a pre-announcement volatility as the volatility in <b>the</b> <b>underwriting</b> period, <b>the</b> model used for valuation would be underpricing <b>the</b> actual <b>underwritten</b> rights <b>issue</b> or overpricing <b>the</b> returns earned by the underwriters. This result of underpricing of the option model when a historical volatility was used is consistent with that found by other researchers with regard to the valuation of exchange-traded options using a historical volatility estimate. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of venture {{capital in the}} ownership structure of U. S. firms going public {{has been associated with}} both improved long-term performance and lower underpricing {{at the time of the}} IPOs. In Japan, we find the long-run performance of venture capital-backed IPOs to be no better than that of other IPOs, with the exception of firms backed by foreign owned or independent venture capitalists. Many of the major venture capital firms in Japan are subsidiaries of securities firms that may face a conflict of interest when <b>underwriting</b> <b>the</b> venture capital-backed <b>issue.</b> When venture capital holdings are broken down by their institutional affiliation, we find that firms with venture backing from securities company subsidiaries do not perform significantly worse over a three-year time horizon than other IPOs. On the other hand, we find that IPOs in which the lead venture capitalist is also the lead underwriter have higher initial returns than other venture capital-backed IPOs. The latter result suggests that conflicts of interest influence the initial pricing, but not the long-term performance, of initial public offerings in Japan. Venture capital; Japan...|$|R

Clearing firms, as full participants with DTC, handle the DTC eligibility submissions to DTC. Transfer agents were responsible for eligibility coordination years ago.

The Decree-Law required People's Bank with more than €8 billion total assets, had to registered as limited company instead. Veneto also bought back €14,725,910.40 shares (€7.3 per share) {{as part of the}} demutualization.The bank also planned to recapitalize €1 billion in early 2016 (due to CET1 ratio was below ECB requirement, set at 10.25%% after 2015 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)), as well as planning to list in the Borsa Italiana in mid-2016. As at 31 March 2016 the bank had a net assets per share of about €15.5, or €3 in nominal value. However, due to low demand of the new shares, the bank priced the new share at €0.5 to €0.1 per share. The stock market listing failed to generate interest, with only one institutional investor taking up the offer and existing shareholders buying just 2.2% (some of them excised rights of withdrew at a later time). As a result, the newly created bail-out fund (created by banking sector in voluntary basis), Atlante, which had <b>underwritten</b> <b>the</b> share <b>issue</b> (previously <b>underwritten</b> by Intesa Sanpaolo), became the majority shareholder, which subscribed €988,582,329.50 out of €1 billion new shares of the bank, making the private sector led bail out fund owned 97.64% shares of the bank.

40|$|In {{the early}} 21 st century, an {{expansion}} of educational markets implies automation, social polarization or stratification, and corporatization. These processes, among others, govern initiatives to exploit {{the economics of the}} corporate university. Within are three compelling issues facing higher education: academic freedom, intellectual property rights (IPRs), and revenues. In Digital Diploma Mills, David Noble describes two practices <b>underwriting</b> these <b>issues.</b> <b>The</b> first is commercialization via corporate exploitation of research, licensing and the reassignment of IPRs (i. e., copyrights, patents and trade secrets). The second is commodification via the automation of curriculum and instruction (C&I) and the unbundling of IPRs (i. e., copyrights). The automation of C&I draws faculty and students into market forces of e-commerce through the consumption and production of digital commodities, generating conflict and disputes among capital, labor and management (de Castell, Bryson & Jenson, 2002). For faculty, this involves deskilling, displacement, erosion of academic freedom, and the reassignment o...|$|R
