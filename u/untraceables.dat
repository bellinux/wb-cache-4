40|$|AbstractEslami and Talebi (2011) [25] {{proposed}} an <b>untraceable</b> electronic cash scheme {{and claimed that}} their scheme protects the anonymity of customers, detects the identity of double spenders and provides the date attachability of coins to manage the bank database. In this paper, illustrating Eslami and Talebi’s scheme, {{as one of the}} latest <b>untraceable</b> electronic cash schemes, and showing its weaknesses (in fulfilling the properties of perceptibility of double spender, unforgeability and date attainability of coins) and its faults (related to exchange protocol), we propose a new <b>untraceable</b> electronic cash scheme which is immune to the weaknesses of the former. Our scheme contains anonymity, double-spending detection, unforgeability and date attachability properties and prevents forging. To do this, we described a special construction which injects the expiration date and the identity of the customer onto the coin and detects the identity in the case of double spending. Lastly, we show that the efficiency of our scheme is comparable with other schemes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Untraceable</b> {{communication}} {{for services}} like telephony is often considered infeasible {{in the near}} future because of bandwidth limitations. We present a technique, called ISDN-MIXes, which shows {{that this is not the}} case. As little changes as possible are made to the narrowband-ISDN planned by the PTTs. In particular, we assume the same subscriber lines with the same bit rate, and the same long-distance network between local exchanges, and we offer the same services. ISDN-MIXes are a combination of a new variant of CHAUM's MIXes, dummy traffic on the subscriber lines (where this needs no additional bandwidth), and broadcast of incoming-call messages in the subscriber-area. 1 Introduction The need to keep communication <b>untraceable,</b> i. e. to keep secret who communicates with whom, has been discussed, e. g., in [Chau_ 81, Cha 8 _ 85, PfWa_ 86, PfPW_ 88]. <b>Untraceable</b> communication for services like telephony is often considered infeasible {{in the near future}} because of bandwidth limitations.

40|$|We {{have built}} and {{deployed}} a system called Folklore that implements a new property called data untraceability through a proactive migratory replication protocol in a large-scale distributed setting. A data <b>untraceable</b> object, i. e., an object whose replicas cannot be located, is probabilistically difficult to delete from the network. Folklore is a proof-of-concept {{system that allows}} data untraceability to be provided hand-in-hand with data availability, updatability, integrity, and scalability. Folklore consists of two subsystems - a pure "Proactive Folklore" system, and a "Reactive Folklore" system (R-Folklore). R-Folklore is a distributed file storage system that makes files <b>untraceable</b> on-demand at run-time, e. g., when a file is sensed to be under attack through intrusions. Intuitively, R-Folklore stealthily turns vulnerable files into an <b>untraceable</b> form. We have deployed Folklore on the CSIL cluster at UIUC (our undergraduate laboratory). We present experimental results from the deployment, as well as simulation experiments that match deployment results but extend to larger system sizes...|$|R

40|$|RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is {{recently}} becoming popular, {{and plays}} definitely {{an important role}} in moving to ubiquitous society due to deploying its convenience and economic efficiency. Furthermore, RFID nowadays comes into the spotlight as a technology to substitute the barcode system. RFID is expected to achieve unlimited economic gain. RFID technology, on the other hand, is jeopardized from various attacks and problems preventing widespread RFID deployment. The focus is on designing a secure and efficient system for authentication between tag and reader in a RFID system. The reason is mentioned why untraceability and scalability is important to deploy RFID widely. There must be a trade-off between scalability and untraceability. However, we try to keep the constant computational time in back-end server regardless of the number of tags when designing an <b>untraceable</b> protocol. The earlier designed hash lock schemes are scalable, but traceable and randomized hash lock schemes are <b>untraceable,</b> but unscalable. Therefore, we designed a scalable and <b>untraceable</b> protocol. First protocol without proxies (1) supports ownership transfer, (2) considers multi-tag-reader environment, (3) receives messages from the tags, what a reader wants...|$|R
