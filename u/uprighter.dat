40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that, after bed rest, maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂max) decreases more <b>upright</b> than supine, because of adequate cardiovascular response supine, but not <b>upright.</b> On 9 subjects, we determined VO₂max and maximal cardiac output (Q) <b>upright</b> and supine, {{before and after}} (reambulation day <b>upright,</b> the following day supine) 35 -day bed rest, by classical steady state protocol. Oxygen consumption, heart rate (f(H)) and stroke volume (Q(st)) were measured by a metabolic cart, electrocardiography and Modelflow from pulse pressure profiles, respectively. We computed Q as f(H) times Q(st), and systemic oxygen flow (QaO₂) as Q. times arterial oxygen concentration, obtained after haemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation measurements. Before bed rest, all parameters at maximal exercise were similar <b>upright</b> and supine. After bed rest, VO₂max was lower (p< 0. 05) than before, both <b>upright</b> (- 38. 6 %) and supine (- 17. 0 %), being 30. 8 % higher supine than <b>upright.</b> Maximal Q(st) decreased <b>upright</b> (- 44. 3 %), but not supine (+ 3. 7 %), being 98. 9 % higher supine than <b>upright.</b> Maximal Q decreased <b>upright</b> (- 45. 1 %), but not supine (+ 9. 0 %), being higher supine than <b>upright</b> (+ 98. 4 %). Maximal QaO₂ decreased <b>upright</b> (- 37. 8 %), but not supine (+ 14. 8 %), being higher (+ 74. 8 %) <b>upright</b> than supine. After bed rest, the cardiovascular response (i) did not affect VO₂max supine, (ii) partially explained the VO₂max decrease <b>upright,</b> and (iii) caused the VO₂max differences between postures. We speculate that impaired peripheral oxygen transfer and/or utilisation may explain the VO₂max decrease supine and the fraction of VO₂max decrease <b>upright</b> unexplained by cardiovascular responses...|$|R

40|$|<b>Upright</b> {{flanking}} faces have stronger {{detrimental effects}} on the recognition of <b>upright</b> target face, than inverted flanking faces. One possible explanation for this “flanker- inversion effect” was that the more holistically processed <b>upright</b> flanking faces allowed for more erroneous feature integration. Alternatively, crowding was known to be stronger when target and flankers were more similar. Here we investigate flanker-inversion effect on crowding in Chinese character identification. Five normally-sighted young adults participated. Targets of size 1. 2 ° were presented at 5 ° in the lower visual field. Four flankers with center-to-center distance of 1. 8 ° were presented in the crowded condition. Three types of flankers were used, <b>upright</b> or inverted Chinese and <b>upright</b> Korean characters. The identification contrast thresholds were estimated by QUEST and crowding strength was measured through threshold elevation (TE). Crowding on <b>upright</b> Chinese target was significantly stronger with inverted Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 59 ± 0. 32) than with <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 47 ± 0. 29). No inversion effect was observed for inverted Chinese target. Korean flankers produced similar crowding as <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers. Our results go against the similarity rule that predicts <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers would produce stronger crowding for <b>upright</b> Chinese target. Holistic processing preferred for inverted Chinese characters may account for the findings...|$|R

40|$|Cranberry tipworm, Dasineura oxycoccana Johnson (a gall‐making fly), {{disrupts}} normal {{growth of}} cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton) by injuring the apical meristem of shoots or <b>uprights.</b> The impact of larval feeding injury on reproductive parameters of cranberry was determined, from one growing season to next, at <b>upright</b> (Maine and Massachusetts, 2008 ‐ 2009) and plot levels (Massachusetts, 2009 – 2010 and 2010 ‐ 2011). I also estimated {{the proportions of}} <b>uprights</b> injured because of tipworm feeding at several cranberry production sites (Massachusetts and Maine) and the proportions of <b>uprights</b> that produced flowers and fruits in the next growing season. Tipworm‐injured <b>uprights</b> tagged {{at the end of}} the growing season did not produce floral‐units (following year) across sites in both Massachusetts and Maine. There was significant variation among the sampled sites in the proportions of tipworm‐injured <b>uprights</b> and also in the proportions of <b>uprights</b> with flowers in the next growing season (Massachusetts and Maine). A trend was apparent wherein sites with higher tipworm injury levels had relatively lower flowering proportions in the next growing season. However, sites in Massachusetts did not differ in the proportions of <b>uprights</b> that set fruit and in a replicated study, significant reduction in tipworm injury at plot level (using insecticide) did not impact flower and fruit production in the next growing season. A two‐year field study was carried out at three different locations to determine the impact of tipworm feeding injury on the reproductive and vegetative growth of two cranberry cultivars (‘Howes’ and ‘Stevens’) in Massachusetts. Individual <b>uprights</b> of cranberry exhibited tolerance to natural (tipworm) and simulated apical meristem injury in the current growing season (fruit production) and results were corroborated by a greenhouse study. In the field study, weight of fruit was higher intipworm‐injured <b>uprights</b> as compared with intact control <b>uprights</b> at the sites with Howes. However, majority of injured <b>uprights</b> (tipworm and simulated) did not produce new growth from lateral buds (side‐shoots) before the onset of dormancy.

50|$|Short, <b>upright</b> pasterns {{are often}} seen in draft horses. This is because draft horses bred for pulling rather than riding (and so they were not {{selected}} for smooth gaits of a saddle horse), and because <b>upright</b> pasterns give more leverage to dig into the ground as the horse pulls a heavy load. Short, <b>upright</b> pasterns are also commonly seen in Quarter Horses, Warmbloods, and Paint Horses. However, riding horses {{are more likely to}} have problems with <b>upright</b> pasterns than draft horses because they tend to work at faster speeds. Due to the lack of shock absorption, horses that have <b>upright</b> pasterns should be kept off hard surfaces whenever possible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Upright</b> pianos, {{also called}} {{vertical}} pianos, are more compact because {{the frame and}} strings are vertical. <b>Upright</b> pianos are generally less expensive than grand pianos. <b>Upright</b> pianos are widely used in churches, community centers, schools, music conservatories and university music programs as rehearsal and practice instruments, and they are popular models for in-home purchase.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{investigation}} {{of the problem of}} visual direction has been more or less restricted to the problem of how we perceive the <b>upright</b> and horizontal directions of space (1, 2, 3, 4).

On the other hand it has been shown that the direction of the <b>upright</b> is still perceived fairly accurately even where no visual scene is present at all, as for example in a completely darkened room (5). It is true that if 0 is tilted in this situation, judgments of the <b>upright</b> are no longer quite so accurate.
