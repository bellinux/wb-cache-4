5|$|On February 19, 1904, a Baltimore and Ohio train accidentally {{crossed the}} Big Four Bridge, due to {{engineer}} Dick Foreman falling asleep and going {{the wrong way}} at Otisco, Indiana. The fireman kept shoveling coal and did not pay attention. It was the conductor that finally noticed the error midway across the Big Four Bridge. The wayward train had to back <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back to Otisco.|$|E
25|$|Cedar Creek Lake is {{a fourth}} water source for Tarrant Regional Water District's water supply. Its normal system {{capacity}} is 322.00ft(98.15m) above sea level. When the lake gets over that point, gates from the spillway are opened, releasing water; 2005 and 2006 were dry years, sending {{the lake to}} a record low on December 12, 2006. The lake fell to 8.04ft(2.45m) below normal, at 313.96ft(95.7m). This passed the old record of 6.22ft(2m) low set on May 8, 1981. That afternoon, the lake received over 4in(102mm) of rain, causing the lake to rise about 6in(152mm). This was the first significant rainfall since April 2006. It was the big turning point for the drought in North Texas, as more rain continued through the month. By January 1, the lake was only a little over 6 feet (2 m) low. Huge rainstorms throughout January brought the lake to only 2 feet (0.6 m) low. A bit of a break came in February, as mainly snow and ice added to the lake rising. By March 31, 2007, the lake was at 322.12ft(98.18m) and the flood gates were open {{for the first time}} since April 20, 2005. Lake Benbrook, Lake Worth, and Lake Arlington also filled up in these rains. Later on, Richland-Chambers Reservoir filled <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> then Eagle Mountain, and then on June 30, 2007, Lake Bridgeport was full {{for the first time since}} May 15, 2001, more than six years since the flood gates had been open. It was a milestone for Tarrant regional water district having all seven of their lakes full. On the night of July 5, more than 5in(127mm) of rain fell, sending Cedar Creek lake from a half foot (15cm) over to 1.5 feet (45cm) over, beating the old 1.47ft(0m) set in November 2001.|$|E

[...] In the evening, the captain backed the ship out of the slip and continued backing <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the Maritime History Museum, where a fireworks display was presented before Queen Mary 2 sailed away. After a night and day at sea, the vessel entered New York Harbor early the morning of 14 July and docked at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal.

2500|$|On one of {{his first}} starts on June 5 after {{becoming}} the Giants' new starting catcher, Landrith was involved in a bizarre play against Cincinnati Reds runner Pete Whisenant. Whisenant was caught in a rundown between Giants second basmean Daryl Spencer and third baseman Jim Davenport, with the fielders continually playing a game of catch in an effort to tag the runner out. Unknown to Whisenant, Landrith had suddenly rushed <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from behind home plate, chest protector and all. Davenport flipped the ball to Landrith and he tagged the runner out. Giants beat writers with combined experience of over 100 years covering the club remarked that it was a dazzling play they had never seen before in professional baseball. Landrith had the best season of his career in 1959. Although he only hit [...]251 with 29 RBI and 71 hits in 109 games, Giant management was very pleased with Landrith's performance for the season. What was once considered a throw-in player in a trade that was centered on reliever Billy Muffett for the Giants, club President Horace Stoneham said it was a very lucky deal for them, referring to Landrith. He threw out 24 runners attempting to steal a base, which ranked 5th in the National League. Landrith was also 5th in assists and 4th in putouts for National League catchers.|$|E

Last Monday morning, at nine o'clock, an hour before Peytel's breakfast, the Greffier of Assize Court, in company with the Curé of Bourg, waited on him, and informed him that he had only three hours to live. At twelve o'clock, Peytel's head was off his body: an executioner from Lyons had come over the night before, to assist the professional throat-cutter of Bourg.|$|E

6000|$|She was a wonder. Small and half-way pretty, {{and as much}} at her ease in that cheap café {{as though}} she were only in the Palmer House, Chicago, with a {{souvenir}} spoon already safely hidden in her shirt waist.

Her belt buckle was exactly {{in the middle of her}} back, and she didn't tell us that a large man with a ruby stick-pin had followed her <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from Fourteenth Street. Was Kerner such a fool? I wondered. And then I thought of the quantity of striped cuffs and blue glass beads that $2,000,000 can buy for the heathen, and I said to myself that he was. And then Elise--certainly that was her name-- told us, merrily, that the brown spot on her waist was caused by her landlady knocking at the door while she (the girl--confound the English language) was heating an iron over the gas jet, and she hid the iron under the bedclothes until the coast was clear, and there was the piece of chewing gum stuck to it when she began to iron the waist, and--well, I wondered how in the world the chewing gum came to be there--don't they ever stop chewing it? ...|$|E
6000|$|Verena Tarrant came in {{the very}} next day from Cambridge to Charles Street; that quarter of Boston is in direct {{communication}} with the academic suburb. It hardly seemed direct to poor Verena, perhaps, who, in the crowded street-car which deposited her finally at Miss Chancellor's door, had to stand <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> half suspended by a leathern strap from the glazed roof of the stifling vehicle, like some blooming cluster dangling in a hothouse. She was used, however, to these perpendicular journeys, and though, as we have seen, she was not inclined to accept without question the social arrangements of her time, it never would have occurred to her to criticise the railways of her native land. The promptness of her visit to Olive Chancellor had been an idea of her mother's, and Verena listened open-eyed while this lady, in the seclusion of the little house in Cambridge, while Selah Tarrant was [...] "off," [...] as they said, with his patients, sketched out a line of conduct for her. The girl was both submissive and unworldly, and she listened to her mother's enumeration of the possible advantages of an intimacy with Miss Chancellor as she would have listened to any other fairy-tale. It was still a part of the fairy-tale when this zealous parent put on with her own hands Verena's smart hat and feather, buttoned her little jacket (the buttons were immense and gilt), and presented her with twenty cents to pay her car-fare.|$|E
60|$|We were a {{mile from}} shore; a little steam-tug put out from the land; she was an object of thrilling interest; she would climb to the summit of a billow, reel drunkenly there a moment, dim and gray in the driving storm of spindrift, then make a plunge like a diver and remain out of sight until one had given her up, then up she would dart again, on a steep slant toward the sky, {{shedding}} Niagaras of water from her forecastle--and this she kept <b>up,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> out to us. She brought twenty-five passengers in her stomach--men and women--mainly a traveling dramatic company. In sight on deck were the crew, in sou'westers, yellow waterproof canvas suits, and boots to the thigh. The deck was never quiet for a moment, and seldom nearer level than a ladder, and noble were the seas which leapt aboard and went flooding aft. We rove a long line to the yard-arm, hung a most primitive basketchair to it and swung it out into the spacious air of heaven, and there it swayed, pendulum-fashion, waiting for its chance--then down it shot, skillfully aimed, and was grabbed by the two men on the forecastle. A young fellow belonging to our crew was in the chair, to be a protection to the lady-comers. At once a couple of ladies appeared from below, took seats in his lap, we hoisted them into the sky, waited a moment till the roll of the ship brought them in overhead, then we lowered suddenly away, and seized the chair as it struck the deck. We took the twenty-five aboard, and delivered twenty-five into the tug--among them several aged ladies, and one blind one--and all without accident. It was a fine piece of work.|$|E
