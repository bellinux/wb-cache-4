40|$|Motivation: High-throughput {{cell-based}} phenotypic screening {{has become}} an increasingly important technology for discovering new drug targets and assigning gene functions. Such experiments use hundreds of 96 -well or 384 -well plates, to cover whole-genome RNAi collections and/or chemical compound files, and often collect measurements that are sensitive to spatial background noise whose patterns can vary across individual plates. Correcting these position effects can substantially improve measurement accuracy and screen-ing success. Result: We developed SbacHTS (Spatial background noise correction for High-Throughput RNAi Screening) software for visualization, esti-mation and correction of spatial background noise in high-throughput RNAi screens. SbacHTS is supported on the Galaxy open-source framework with a <b>user-friendly</b> open <b>access</b> web interface. We find that SbacHTS software can effectively detect and correct spatial background noise, increase {{signal to noise ratio}} and enhance statis-tical detection power in high-throughput RNAi screening experiments...|$|R
