5000|$|Constructivism is {{a theory}} of {{knowledge}} which argues that humans generate knowledge and meaning through world interactions and ideas. Constructivists argue that international life is social, resulting from the ways people {{interact with each other}} (i.e. talk, follow norms, create rules, etc.). While there are similarities, feminist constructivists view relationships of power differently than traditional constructivists. Power and gender are considered [...] "integral elements in processes of construction," [...] where as traditionalists believe power to be external. Feminist constructivists argue that the lack of problematization research as a social process of construction is logically inconsistent [...] "with an ontology of becoming." [...] They also believe that differences between men and women, other than anatomical differences, were constructed due to socialization and cultural training. However, there are criticisms that take place between interactions of feminism with constructivism. Many feminists don't agree with constructivism as an alternative middle ground due to most constructivists ignoring feminist literature and gender analysis. It's also pointed out that constructivism lacks the tools to explain how gender and power in politics influence each other, due to the social construction of power being <b>under</b> <b>theorized.</b>|$|E

The author challenges the orthodoxy that performance (and live art) is somehow more immediate – more real – than theatre. The essay employs Žižek’s work to challenge the hierarchized ‘performance versus theatre’ binary by relating his theories of the oscillation of the real and virtual to the author’s own theory of ‘mimetic shimmering’ (2013), and to an analysis of the various theatrical devices used in the production of Normal to facilitate such an oscillation in performance.

The mode of inquiry proposed here contributes to a body of scholarship interested in exploring the multiple ways cities “speak” by forwarding a reading of space as text.

If resources are endogenously selected, regression based methods that examine their connection to firm performance will be mis-estimated. We show that traditional remedies for endogeneity do not resolve this problem when returns to resources are heterogeneous (as <b>theorized</b> <b>under</b> RBV) and when managers act with at least partial knowledge of the expected, idiosyncratic return (as <b>theorized</b> <b>under</b> the strategic factor market hypotheses). As such, we develop a Bayesian approach that solves this endogeneity problem by directly incorporating resource picking into the modeling framework. We illustrate the validity of our approach {{through the use of a}} comprehensive simulation study and show that our proposed approach outperforms traditional linear models (including traditional cures of endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity) under a variety of conditions.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that understanding {{questions such as}} those related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) re- quires economic theorizing to include in its explanatory models {{the very fact that}} (economic) agents have their own distinctive conception of how reality ought to be (which implies making judgments of value). <b>Under</b> standard economic <b>theorizing,</b> the relationship between social or ethical values and economics is one of mere juxtaposition. Ethical and economic issues are being put together side by side {{in such a way that}} the anomalies pointed out by economics, which refer to the presence of goal paradoxes and the problem of altruism, etc., denote the presence of ethical issues within the processes of valuation and choice by agents. To surpass this relationship a change of perspective by means of the agents’ action plans approach is proposed. The action plan approach allows to pass from a conception of economics understood as a technology-of-choice to economics understood as a theory of production-of-action. In particular, it is shown that the ethical dynamics of agents are capable of generating “ethical novelties”, which consequently alter the agents’ space of goals. Insofar as this is heavily influenced by CSR, the consequence is that CSR is neither strange to Economics nor a concept juxtaposed with the analysis of autonomous economic processes...|$|R

Feminist scholarship critiques women?s lives, experiences and gender inequality in a variety of contexts.

40|$|The role {{of policy}} {{integration}} in the governance of cross-cutting policy problems has attracted increasing scholarly attention in recent years. Nevertheless, the concept of policy (dis) integration is still <b>under</b> <b>theorized,</b> particularly regarding its inherent processual nature. The main argument {{of this paper is}} that policy integration should be understood as a process that entails various elements that do not necessarily move in a concerted manner but may develop at different paces or even in opposite directions. To study such dynamic integration pathways, the paper proposes a multi-dimensional framework. Drawing on existing literature, the framework distinguishes four dimensions of integration: (1) policy frame, (2), subsystem involvement, (3) policy goals, and (4) policy instruments. For each of these dimensions, we describe different manifestations that are associated with lesser or more advanced degrees of policy integration within a governance system. Apart from offering an innovative theoretical approach that does justice to the dynamic and oftentimes asynchronous nature of integration processes, the framework allows for holding decision-makers accountable for promises they make about enhancing policy integration. Simultaneously, it is argued that the merit of lower degrees of integration should not be underestimated, as these may sometimes be the most feasible or appropriate for the governance of a cross-cutting problem. </p...|$|E
40|$|In the {{interest}} of providing an economically sensible use for the copious small-diameter wood in Northern New Mexico, an economic study is performed focused on mobile pyrolysis. Mobile pyrolysis was selected for the study because transportation costs limit the viability of a dedicated pyrolysis plant, and the relative simplicity of pyrolysis compared to other technology solutions lends itself to mobile reactor design. A bench-scale pyrolysis system was used to study the wood pyrolysis process and to obtain performance data that was otherwise unavailable <b>under</b> conditions <b>theorized</b> to be optimal given the regional problem. Pyrolysis can convert wood to three main products: fixed gases, liquid pyrolysis oil and char. The fixed gases are useful as low-quality fuel, and may have sufficient chemical energy to power a mobile system, {{eliminating the need for}} an external power source. The majority of the energy content of the pyrolysis gas is associated with carbon monoxide, followed by light hydrocarbons. The liquids are well characterized in the historical literature, and have slightly lower heating values comparable to the feedstock. They consist of water and a mix of hundreds of hydrocarbons, and are acidic. They are also unstable, increasing in viscosity with time stored. Up to 60 % of the biomass in bench-scale testing was converted to liquids. Lower ({approx} 550 C) furnace temperatures are preferred because of the decreased propensity for deposits and the high liquid yields. A mobile pyrolysis system would be designed with low maintenance requirements, should be able to access wilderness areas, and should not require {{more than one or two}} people to operate the system. The techno-economic analysis assesses fixed and variable costs. It suggests that the economy of scale is an important factor, as higher throughput directly leads to improved system economic viability. Labor and capital equipment are the driving factors in the viability of the system. The break-even selling price for the baseline assumption is about $ 11 /GJ, however it may be possible to reduce this value by 20 - 30 % depending on other factors evaluated in the non-baseline scenarios. Assuming a value for the char co-product improves the analysis. Significantly lower break-even costs are possible in an international setting, as labor is the dominant production cost...|$|R
40|$|In {{theories}} that idealize {{the object of}} study, falsity is inserted somehow. However, the actual propositions by which the idealization takes place need not be false at all. An example from physics illustrates that the Ideal Gas Law and Boyle's Law are respective idealizations of the van der Waals Law. The idealizational procedures involved in reasoning from the latter to the former can be repeated {{at a higher level}} of abstraction than that of the laws as we know these from physics textbooks. Thus, idealization and abstraction can be seen as relatively independent methods of reasoning, the one to be carried out with or without the other at the same time. This underlines Uskali Maki's taxonomy, which shows that horizontal isolations in economic reasoning form a procedure completely different from vertical isolations. In contrast, however, to his taxonomy, I propose to define idealization as horizontal isolation. The lessons for the policy relevance of science - and of economics in particular - are that the use of ideal models does not necessarily imply a total lack of their external validity. Further, I show that abstraction in <b>theorizing,</b> <b>under</b> certain conditions, may increase the policy relevance of theories, rather than that it is decreased. Abstract theories tend to count the actual social world - where policymakers try to intervene - among their models more easily than concrete theories. Finally, this paper also deals with one very problematic aspect of the common use of clauses in order to hedge economics hypotheses. Many idealizational clauses have a propensity for imprecise reference, due to which it is impossible to judge the external validity of economic models.

CBRs claims to egalitarian, emancipatory research relations and outcomes remain largely uninterrogated and the participative practices and collaborative relations <b>under</b> documented and <b>theorized.</b> This study of the social relations of CBR theorizes participatory research as a site of governance. Specifically, I inquire into how the social relations of CBR are governed through affect, participatory practices, colonial processes of subjectification, institutional arrangements, as well as resisted as counter governmental practices. I draw on poststructural, postcolonial and affect theories in dialogue with the critical reflections of twenty-nine academic, community-based professionals, and peer CBR collaborators to bring forth the complexity of governmental practices. I develop a methodology of Dialogic Theoretical Pluralism to produce five distinct strands of theoretical analyses, which trouble the discursive and material practices of collaborative research, while not foreclosing on its possibilities. 	I argue that conversants desires to do socially transformative research are unmet and reconfigure CBR as a site of scaffolding community collaborators toward social mobility. These desires activate participative practices of access to and appropriation of community knowledges and labour to produce a tertiary, low cost and precarious knowledge work force. Colonial subject-making practices of CBR, which are raced, gendered and classed, secure the benevolence and expertise of academe against community subjects Othered as lacking beneficiaries in need of capacity building. Institutional arrangements coordinate time, authorize who is a legitimate knower, and consign community collaborators and community benefit to the margins. These governmental practices are not total and institutionalized norms of CBR are resisted through unsettling affect, strategic subjectivities, dissent and distance, and revitalized commitments to social and epistemic transformation.
