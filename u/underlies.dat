40|$|Abstract—In an <b>underlay</b> {{cognitive}} radio network, the sec-ondary (<b>underlay)</b> transmitters generate interference to a pri-mary receiver, while an <b>underlay</b> receiver {{is subject to}} interfer-ence from both the primary transmitters and other <b>underlay</b> transmitters not associated with it. Although guard regions, maximum allowable <b>underlay</b> transmit powers, and contention distances help guarantee a minimum performance to the primary network, no such safeguard exists for the <b>underlay</b> network. To this end, this paper characterizes the aggregate interference on an <b>underlay</b> receiver while considering power control and receiver association schemes for both networks. Transmitters and receivers of both networks {{are assumed to be}} distributed as independent Poisson fields in the 2 -D plane, and all links undergo exponential path loss and Rayleigh fading. We derive the moment generating function of the aggregate interference on an <b>underlay</b> receiver and its outage probability. We show that the interference from the primary network does not depend on any node density, and that it dominates the aggregate interference. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing primary and <b>underlay</b> receiver densities reduce the outage probability under lower required power thresholds for the primary receivers. I...|$|R

Fresh water saturated the limestone that <b>underlies</b> the Everglades, eroding some of it away, and created springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.|$|E

Here we discuss {{the relationship between the}} <b>underlying</b> topological space of a hybrid system, its <b>underlying</b> graph and Zeno behavior. When each domain is contractible and the reset maps are homotopic to the identity map, the homology of the <b>underlying</b> topological space is isomorphic to the homology of the <b>underlying</b> graph; the nonexistence of Zeno is implied when the first homology is trivial. Moreover, the first homology is trivial when the null space of the incidence matrix is trivial. The result is an easy way to verify the nonexistence of Zeno behavior. I...|$|R

5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, <b>underlies</b> the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt <b>underlies</b> {{much of the}} watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are {{relatively}} free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms.

For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E

This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E

An <b>underlay</b> lies in between overlay operations (e. g., data indexing, multicast, etc.) and the sensor network itself.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of <b>underlying</b> {{inflation}} and the properties of various measures of <b>underlying</b> inflation in the Australian context. <b>Underlying</b> inflation measures are routinely calculated and monitored by central banks in many countries, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. Alternative measurement concepts are explored, {{and a range of}} measures that have been calculated for Australia are discussed and evaluated on the basis of statistical criteria. These criteria capture the intuition that a good measure of <b>underlying</b> inflation should be less volatile than CPI (or headline) inflation, be unbiased with respect to CPI inflation, and capture the ‘trend’ in CPI inflation so that, on average, CPI inflation will tend to adjust towards the measure of <b>underlying</b> inflation. In the Australian context, statistical measures of <b>underlying</b> inflation, such as the trimmed mean or weighted median, perform fairly satisfactorily against these criteria. The performance of these measures can be further improved by seasonally adjusting prices at the CPI component level. Although <b>underlying</b> inflation measures have become less necessary in the past decade as inflation itself has become less volatile, these findings suggest that <b>underlying</b> inflation measures can still add value to the analysis of inflationary trends. <b>underlying</b> inflation; core inflation; trimmed mean; weighted median; volatility-weighted measures...|$|R
