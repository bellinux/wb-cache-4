40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been much {{interest}} in modulation techniques to achieve transmit diversity motivated by the increased capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. To achieve transmit diversity the transmitter needs to be equipped with more than one antenna. The antennas should be well separated to have <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>fading</b> among the different antennas; hence, higher diversity orders and higher coding gains are achievable. It is affordable to equip base stations with more than one antenna, {{but it is difficult to}} equip the small mobile units with more than one antenna with <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>fading.</b> In such a case, transmit diversity can only be achieved through user cooperation leading to what is known as cooperative diversity. Cooperative diversity provides a new dimension over which higher diversity orders can be achieved. In this thesis, we consider the design of protocols that allow several terminals to cooperate via forwarding each others’ data, which can increase the system reliability by achieving spatial cooperative diversity. We consider the problem of “how to achieve and where to exploit diversity in cooperative networks?” We firs...|$|E

The simulations were carried out over Rayleigh correlated and <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>fading</b> channels. The simulation results reveal that over <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>fading</b> channel the best choice is bit-level interleaver in case of the classic uncoded packets, whereas over correlated fading channel, the convolutional interleaver is efficient. Also, {{the effectiveness of the}} interleaving techniques is inefficient with audio file that has higher bit rate than 64 kbps. The ACL link is an efficient for carrying voice unless {{there is a need for}} high-quality voice. Using this link for carrying voice also leads to improving the throughput. ACL link is a suitable choice for carrying voice specially with using interleaving technique. The article proposes a novel data randomizing tool for enhance the quality of the audio signal transmission over ACL link. The proposed chaotic technique performs better than the traditional interleaver over the mobile channel. It can be then applied on the EV packets and on the mobile Ad hoc network. It reduces the packet loss of the transmitted audio file and also it is an efficient tool for decreasing the mobility bad effects on the transmitted audio signals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} case of {{so-called}} diago-nally correlated MIMO channels. This particular type of corre-lated channels, which cannot result from the popular Kronecker assumption, are shown to provide higher ergodic capacity than <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>fading</b> channels. Interestingly, such channels present a specific symmetry of the channel matrix element amplitudes: their rows are either cyclically right- or left-shifted versions of each other, so that the absolute value of the channel matrix is circulant. The proposed analysis details exemplary physical scenarios leading to high diagonal correlations, first for the simple case of 2 × 2 channels, and then for arbitrary array size n. An analytical expression for capacity is also derived. It demonstrates that the ergodic capacity of diagonally correlated channels grows exactly linearly {{with the number of}} antennas. I...|$|E

Other key statistics of the new simulator approach the desired ones of Clarke’s reference model as the number of sinusoids approaches infinity, while good convergence is achieved when the number of sinusoids is small. Moreover, the new simulator can be directly used to generate multiple <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>fading</b> waveforms; it is also pointed out that a class of 16 different simulators, which have identical statistical properties, can be developed for Rayleigh fading channels.

40|$|Actual {{systems for}} {{broadband}} wireless access adopt multi-carrier signals based on OFDM and OFDMA formats. These systems are practically deployed as traditional cellular networks, i. e. their planning is based on classical single carrier based strategies. However, these methodologies do {{not account for the}} features of a multicarrier systems in which coded bits in a block are transmitted over M spared sub-carriers undergoing (possibly) <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>fading</b> and interference effects. In this case the decoder in the receiver can be able to mitigate the detrimental channel effects even when some sub-carriers are received with individual SINR below the specified target quality level. In order to account for this aspect, network planning based on single SINR needs to be extended to multi-carrier. As shown in this work, this extension can be achieved by reformulating the planning procedure in terms of the effective SINR which, in general, is a combination of the SINRs received on the M sub-carriers. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
