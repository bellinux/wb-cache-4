50|$|Shortly before 2 a.m. on November 11, 2015, X'Trapolis train 927M-1664T-928M derailed, {{following}} an <b>unauthorised</b> <b>movement</b> from the yard, resulting in several collisions with various infrastructure and another train. On June 1, 2016, a former Metro Trains worker {{pleaded guilty to}} causing the incident, along with lighting two fires at Newport Workshops in 2015, which damaged or destroyed heritage train carriages, including a historical Swing Door EMU.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 15 May 1879 {{with the name}} of Drewitz. It was a freight border {{crossing}} point from East Germany to West Berlin from 1949 to 1990. Numerous safety devices were installed for this purpose such as special points that would prevent an <b>unauthorised</b> <b>movement</b> of a locomotive towards Berlin-Wannsee in the American sector of Berlin. This meant that some sets of points would cause trains making unauthorised movements to derail.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to using derailers in Depot Personnel Protection Systems is to equip the system with TPWS. This equipment safeguards staff from <b>unauthorised</b> <b>movements</b> {{by using the}} TPWS equipment. Any unplanned movement will cause the train to automatically come to a stand when it has passed the relevant signal set at danger. This has {{the added benefit of}} preventing damage to the infrastructure and traction and rolling stock that a derailer system causes. The first known installation of such a system is at Ilford Depot. TPWS equipped depot protection systems are suitable only for locations where vehicles are driven {{in and out of the}} maintenance building from a leading driving cab - they are not suitable for use with loose coaching stock or wagon maintenance, where vehicle movements are undertaken by a propelling shunting loco (in this case the lead vehicles would not be equipped with the relevant TPWS safety equipment), nor will it prevent a run-away vehicle from entering a protected work area.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to using derailers is to equip the system with TPWS. This equipment safeguards staff from <b>unauthorised</b> <b>movements</b> {{by using the}} automatic safety equipment fitted to the driving cabs of all main-line registered traction and rolling stock in the UK. Any unplanned movement will cause the train to automatically come to a stand when it has passed the relevant signal set at 'danger'.

The first known installation of such an equipped system is at Ilford Depot. Note: TPWS equipped depot protection systems would only be suitable for locations where vehicles are driven {{in and out of the}} maintenance building by a leading driving cab - they would not be suitable for use at a maintenance building that undertakes largely loose coaching stock or wagon maintenance, where vehicle movements are undertaken by a propelling shunting loco (in this case the lead vehicles would not be equipped with the relevant TPWS safety equipment).|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to explore the role that {{informal}} organisations play in the legitimisation of regime change and the failure of key modern theories of globalisation and international relations (I. R.) to fully accredit the centrality of civic groups as agents of change. Following this, we use constructivist methodology in explaining gradual shifts in ideological mindsets and the socio-political aspirations. Briefly reviewing current events, this paper appraises the significance of <b>unauthorised</b> dissident <b>movements,</b> and their involvement in the proliferation of prominent trends, such as democratisation and terrorism...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>unauthorised</b> <b>movement</b> {{may be due}} to {{a runaway}} wagon, or may be a train passing a signal at danger. When a signal {{controlling}} passage onto a main line is set to [...] "danger", the trap points are set to derail any vehicle passing that signal. Interlocking is used {{to make sure that the}} signal cannot be set to allow passage onto the main line until the trap points have been aligned to ensure this movement can take place.|$|E
50|$|Trap {{points are}} {{found at the}} exit from a siding or where a {{secondary}} track joins a main line. A facing turnout is used to prevent any <b>unauthorised</b> <b>movement</b> that may otherwise obstruct the main line. The trap points also prevent any damage that may be done by a vehicle passing over points not set for traffic joining the main line. In the United Kingdom, the use of trap points at siding exits is required by government legislation.|$|E
50|$|Trap {{points or}} catch points are {{designed}} to intentionally derail vehicles making an <b>unauthorised</b> <b>movement.</b> When a vehicle derails completely, its wheels cease to shunt the track circuit. Since the vehicle might still be foul of the track, {{it is important to}} maintain the track circuit in the 'occupied' state. To achieve this, a cast iron interrupter is fitted to one of the run-off rails such that it will be struck by the wheels of a vehicle that is about to be derailed. Since the track circuit is bonded via the interrupter, it is proved to be intact when the track circuit relay is energised.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two parties}} were urged {{to put an}} end to the laying of land mines and to report <b>unauthorised</b> troop <b>movements.</b> It was also equally {{important}} for the population to be disarmed, the dissemination of objective information through Radio UNAVEM and the need to reach the full strength of UNAVEM III as soon as possible. Concern was expressed at violence by unaffiliated groups and called for measures to disarm them. The parties were called upon to allow access to all military facilities by UNAVEM III, and the Angolan government and UNITA also had to ensure that relief supplies could travel freely throughout the country.|$|R
25|$|The army {{declared}} {{martial law}} nationwide, ordered all soldiers {{to report to}} their barracks and banned troop <b>movements</b> <b>unauthorised</b> by the CDR. Television footage showed heavily armed troops in M113 armored personnel carriers and M998 HMMWV vehicles {{on the streets of}} the city. Many soldiers and military vehicles wore strips of yellow cloth as a symbol of loyalty to the king, whose royal color is yellow.|$|R
40|$|This guide {{contains}} {{statistics on}} the number of asylum seekers at Offshore Processing Centres, the number who are children, the number who are found to refugees, and more. Introduction On 8 February 2008, some seven months after Kevin Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister, the former Labor Government announced that the last remaining asylum seekers on Nauru had been transferred to Australia ending the Howard Government’s controversial so-called ‘Pacific Solution’, which had begun in 2001 in response to rising numbers of asylum seekers arriving by boat. However, by July 2010, then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard announced in her first major policy speech that the Government had begun having discussions with regional neighbours about the possibility of establishing a regional processing centre for the purpose of receiving and processing irregular entrants to the region. Whilst only 25 asylum seekers had travelled by boat to Australia to seek asylum in the 2007 – 08 financial year by the time Gillard made her announcement in July 2010, more than 5, 000 people had travelled by boat to Australia to seek asylum. Whilst Gillard acknowledged that the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat to Australia was ‘very, very minor’ and that at the current rate of arrival it would take about 20 years to fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) with asylum seekers, she identified a number of reasons why the processing of asylum seekers in other countries was again considered necessary: 	to ensure that people smugglers have no product to sell 	to remove the financial incentive for the people smugglers to send boats to Australia 	to ensure that those arriving by boat do not get an unfair advantage over others 	to secure Australia’s borders and create a fair and orderly migration 	to prevent people embarking on a voyage across dangerous seas with the ever present risk of death 	to ensure that everyone is subject to a consistent, fair assessment process 	to improve the protection outcomes for refugees by establishing a framework for orderly migration within the region 	to prevent the piling up of unauthorised arrivals in detention in Australia 	in response to increased numbers of <b>unauthorised</b> people <b>movements</b> in the region and around the world and 	in acknowledgment that irregular migration is a global challenge that can only be tackled by nations working together. Though it took another two years for her Government to secure the statutory and practical arrangements for asylum seekers to be sent to third countries, people began to be transferred to Nauru on 14 September 2012 and to PNG on 21 November 2012. It was not until two months before the 2013 federal election and in the wake of growing support for the Opposition’s tougher border protection policies, newly appointed Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd made a surprise announcement on 19 July 2013 that Australia had entered into a Regional Resettlement Arrangement with Papua New Guinea (PNG). Under the Arrangement, all (not just some) asylum seekers that arrive by boat would be transferred to PNG for processing and resettlement in PNG and in any other participating regional State. He subsequently made a similar Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Nauru. Notwithstanding Prime Minister Rudd’s announcement, the Australian Labor Party was unable to secure another term in office and on 7 September 2013, the Liberal and National parties were voted in to form a Coalition Government, led by Tony Abbott. The current Coalition Government continues to implement the former Government’s offshore processing arrangements. However, the offshore processing of asylum seekers in Nauru and PNG has in due course proved contentious for a number of reasons, including: 	the financial cost (see statistics below) 	ongoing concerns about the safety and security of asylum seekers in the Processing Centres and in the broader community 	ongoing concerns about the sustainability of involuntary settlement (currently in Nauru, PNG and Cambodia) 	prolonged duration of detention and harsh living conditions are seen by some as punitive which is said to be causing or exacerbating psychological harm and 	inadequate independent oversight of the Processing Centres to ensure relevant international standards are being met (see Annex for further information about these concerns).

40|$|To {{prevent the}} <b>unauthorised</b> <b>movement</b> of {{radioactive}} material, radiation monitors are installed at checkpoints like road and rail border crossings, at airports or seaports and nuclear facilities. Trucks, trains, cars and persons pass through portal monitors that quickly measure radiation levels and issue an alarm if a certain investigation or alarm threshold is exceeded. Depending on the required probability of detecting a specified source, the threshold settings and performance tests can be tedious and time-consuming. We developed {{a prototype of}} a radiation source {{that can be used}} as a tool to facilitate such tests. In this work, we present the prototype and demonstrate its effectiveness. JRC. DDG.
