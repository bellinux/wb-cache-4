5000|$|The BIOS selects {{candidate}} boot devices {{using information}} collected by POST and configuration information from EEPROM, CMOS RAM or, {{in the earliest}} PCs, DIP switches. Following the boot priority sequence in effect, BIOS checks each device {{in order to see}} if it is bootable. For a disk drive or a device that logically emulates a disk drive, such as a USB flash drive or perhaps a tape drive, to perform this check the BIOS attempts to load the first sector (boot sector) from the disk into RAM at memory address [...] If the sector cannot be read (due to a missing or <b>unformatted</b> <b>disk,</b> or due to a hardware failure), the BIOS considers the device unbootable and proceeds to check the next device. If the sector is read successfully, some BIOSes will also check for the boot sector signature 0x55 0xAA in the last two bytes of the sector (which is 512 bytes long), before accepting a boot sector and considering the device bootable.|$|E
40|$|This report {{includes}} the documentation and source listing of an user friendly interactive computer program that generates the element connectivity and nodal point coordinates for two dimensional isoparametric finite elements using {{techniques such as}} nested menus, keyboard filtering, dynamic memory allocation, graphics support, preparation of screen output in RAM memory and module communications via <b>unformatted</b> <b>disk</b> files {{in order to take}} full advantage small machines with limited RAM memory. The maximum number of finite elements is limited only by the available disk space. [URL]...|$|E
2500|$|The DEC Rainbow 100 (all variations) {{supported}} one FAT12 format on 80-track, single-sided, quad-density 5.25" [...] drives. The {{first two}} tracks were {{reserved for the}} boot loader, but didn't contain an MBR nor a BPB (MS-DOS used a static in-memory BPB instead). The boot sector (track 0, side 0, sector 1) was Z80 code beginning with DI 0xF3. The 8088 bootstrap was loaded by the Z80. Track 1, side 0, sector 2 starts with the Media/FAT ID byte 0xFA. <b>Unformatted</b> <b>disks</b> use 0xE5 instead. The file system starts on track 2, side 0, sector 1. There are 2 copies of the FAT and 96 entries in the root directory. In addition, there is a physical to logical track mapping to effect a 2:1 sector interleaving. The disks were formatted with the physical sectors in order numbered 1 to 10 on each track after the reserved tracks, but the logical sectors from 1 to 10 were stored in physical sectors 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9, 5, 10.|$|R

This makes is hard to create Rainbow disk images since all existing tools assumes {{there will be an}} MBR with a BPB, and required various hacks {{to make up for the}} lack of on-disk BPB.|$|R
5000|$|Storage Module Drive (SMD) is {{a family}} of storage devices (hard disk drives) that were first shipped by Control Data Corporation in December 1973 as the CDC 9760 40 MB (<b>unformatted)</b> storage module <b>disk</b> drive. [...] The CDC 9762 80 MB variant was {{announced}} in June 1974 and the CDC 9764 150 MB and the CDC 9766 300 MB variants were announced in 1975 (all capacities unformatted). A non-removable media variant family of 12, 24 and 48 MB capacity, the MMD, was then announced in 1976. This family's interface, SMD, derived from the earlier Digital RP0x interface, was documented as ANSI Standard X3.91M - 1982, Storage Module Interfaces with Extensions for Enhanced Storage Module Interfaces.|$|R
