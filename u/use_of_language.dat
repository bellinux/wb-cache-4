5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS), {{also known}} as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.|$|E
5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir {{shows an}} {{affinity}} for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E
50|$|The {{first law}} on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> was voted on in 1873, perhaps {{influenced}} by growing public dissent occasioned by cases such as the 1872 case of Jozef Schoep. He refused to pay a fine of 50 francs for not wanting to declare {{the birth of his}} son to the municipal administration of Molenbeek in French only to be convicted after an appeal in Cassation. This and other cases provoked discussions about the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages,</b> and the first {{law on the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages,</b> supported by Edward Coremans, regulated the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> in the courts in Flanders.|$|R

5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Tolkien's books {{has had a}} small but lasting effect on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings dwarves and dwarvish (alongside dwarfs and dwarfish), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier.

He also coined the term eucatastrophe, though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.|$|E
5|$|Whorf's views {{have been}} {{compared}} to those of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and the late Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also {{been compared to}} the views of psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, whose social constructivism considers the cognitive development of children to be mediated by the social <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.|$|E

5|$|Human {{language}} has {{the properties of}} productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language {{is thought to have}} originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 1986 ruling of the Constitutional Court, the {{division}} in language regions entails [...] "a restriction {{on the ability}} of legislators to regulate the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> and so forms the constitutional guarantee of the priority <b>of</b> the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the unilingual area". The 1988 revision of the constitution (art. 129, §1) confirms that the parliaments of the French Community and the Flemish Community determine through decrees, each for their respective territory, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> in administrative matters, the education system, for social contacts between the employer and his employees, and for official documents in business. However, the constitution (art. 129, §2) makes an exception for municipalities with language facilities, stating that in those municipalities the law on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> for situations listed in [...] §1 can only be changed by a law adopted by a majority in both language groups.|$|R

40|$|The period {{since the}} {{independence}} of the Republic of Macedonia in 1991 has shown the political importance <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> as well as the political tensions that can arise over language-related issues. For a long time, multilingualism in Macedonia was a problem that threatened the unity and stability of the country. In 2001 the armed conflict in Macedonia showed that governmental policies of ignoring certain issues fueled ethnic divisions and facilitated a climate of insecurity. In order to terminate the armed conflict, Macedonia has since introduced constitutional changes relevant to linguistic diversity. The constitutional amendment regulating the official <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> in Macedonia was {{as a result of a}} necessary compromise to terminate the armed conflict. The amendment is formulated in a vague and contradictory manner; full of loopholes, views provided on official languages leads to different interpretations and is still subject to disputes between experts, as well as party leaders in Macedonia. This vagueness led to politicians <b>using</b> the topic <b>of</b> the official <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> as a talking point in every electoral campaign since 2001. This article will examine the challenges and possibilities that came from the constitutional amendment on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> in Macedonia.
