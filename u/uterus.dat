5|$|Cervical {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} congenital {{condition in}} which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop. Other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and <b>uterus.</b> The cervix may be duplicated in situations such as bicornuate <b>uterus</b> and uterine didelphys.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and <b>uterus.</b> The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the <b>uterus,</b> so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the <b>uterus</b> in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the <b>uterus,</b> after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
5|$|Barrier {{contraceptives}} are {{devices that}} attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the <b>uterus.</b> They include male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges with spermicide.|$|E
50|$|In Uzbekistan the {{government}} has pushed for <b>uteruses</b> {{to be removed from}} women in order to forcibly sterilize them.|$|R
3000|$|The {{other woman}} with a score of 7 and the woman scoring 5 had {{completely}} normal, anteverted <b>uteruses,</b> {{and there were no}} problems in placing the intramyometrial injections. They both completed the ablation procedure without needing rescue anaesthesia, and their vital functions did not change during the active ablation.|$|R
50|$|According {{to popular}} legend, Arab traders {{inserted}} small stones into the <b>uteruses</b> of their camels to prevent pregnancy during long desert treks. The story was originally a tall tale to entertain delegates at a scientific conference on family planning; {{although it was}} later repeated as truth, it has no known historical basis.|$|R
5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} <b>uterus,</b> and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the <b>uterus.</b> The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E
5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate <b>uterus.</b> Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex <b>uterus</b> and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular <b>uterus.</b> A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the <b>uterus.</b> The eggs are then laid.|$|E
30|$|We also {{gained the}} {{subjective}} impression that {{working with the}} bipolar coagulation forceps in the restricted anatomical conditions posed by vaginal surgery was easier than the conventional vaginal approach. The surgery was therefore also not just easier in general; it was also possible to remove larger <b>uteruses</b> via the vagina than was previously routinely possible.|$|R
5000|$|An intrauterine {{pressure}} catheter (IUPC) is {{a catheter}} used during induction of labor {{to measure the}} amount of the <b>uterus's</b> contractions by taking into account intrauterine pressure and contraction frequency, duration, and strength. [...] This is mainly of use for an obstetrician or midwife who wants to determine the amount of oxytocin (labor-inducing medication) to use.|$|R
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the whitetip reef shark is viviparous; once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment {{for the remainder of}} gestation. Mature females have a single functional ovary, on the left side, and two functional <b>uteruses.</b> The reproductive cycle is biennial.|$|R
5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's <b>uterus</b> was taken; Eddowes had her <b>uterus</b> and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the <b>uterus</b> and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the <b>uterus</b> for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of the <b>uterus</b> to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the <b>uterus,</b> histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} no {{specific}} symptoms for this condition, common complains include progressively increasing pelvic pain during menstruation and haematocolpos due to the buildup {{of blood in the}} body. Other symptoms may include swelling of the abdomen, nausea and vomiting during menstruation, and pelvic pain. Fertility may also be affected.The condition often leads to an increased need for C-sections due to the smaller <b>uteruses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tumblety {{appeared}} {{to revel in}} denouncing all women, but reserved a special hatred for prostitutes; he blamed his misogyny on a failed marriage to a prostitute. In Washington, D.C., he displayed a collection of <b>uteruses</b> preserved in jars, which he kept in his study, to his guests at an all-male dinner party, and proudly boasted that they came from [...] "every class of woman".|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, Khamenei {{issued a}} fatwa stating {{that it was}} {{permitted}} to use a third-party (donor sperm, ova or surrogacy) in fertility treatments. This was different in [...] "both style and substance" [...] to the fatwa on ART by Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak of Egypt's Al-Azhar University in the late 1980s which permitted ART (IVF and similar technologies) as long there is no third-party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or <b>uteruses).</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the <b>uterus</b> against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E
5|$|Blood is {{supplied}} to the cervix by the descending {{branch of the}} uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein. The pelvic splanchnic nerves, emerging as S2S3, transmit the sensation of pain from the cervix to the brain. These nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the <b>uterus</b> to the anterior sacrum.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), digestive tract (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (<b>uterus,</b> vagina, vulva), and soft tissues.|$|E
50|$|IVF {{and similar}} {{technologies}} are permissible {{as long as}} they do not involve any form of third-party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or <b>uteruses).</b> Regarding third-party donation there is a debate between the Sunni and Shia streams of Islam. The Sunni community, following the Al-Azhar fatwa, does not allow third-party donations. In 1999, Ayatollah Khamenei, the authority for the Shi'a Muslims, issued a fatwa stating that it was permitted to use third-party donors.|$|R

It is established that a sheep two- and three-pedigree hybrids are superior to the parent rock. These options are simple and complex industrial crossing are promising and can be implemented and used in the breeding of Merino sheep farms area...|$|R
5000|$|... "Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina": The newly sex-changed Mrs. Garrison becomes {{convinced}} she is pregnant because she doesn't start menstruating. She asks the doctor {{whether he would}} [...] "vacuum it (the fetus) out or scramble its brains" [...] because [...] "a woman can do whatever she wants with her body," [...] {{only to find out}} at the abortion clinic that <b>uteruses</b> are not created in sex change operations; therefore she cannot get pregnant.|$|R
5|$|Contact {{brachytherapy}} involves {{placement of}} the radiation source in a space next to the target tissue. This space may be a body cavity (intracavitary brachytherapy) such as the cervix, <b>uterus</b> or vagina; a body lumen (intraluminal brachytherapy) such as the trachea or oesophagus; or externally (surface brachytherapy) such as the skin. A radiation source can also be placed in blood vessels (intravascular brachytherapy) {{for the treatment of}} coronary in-stent restenosis.|$|E
5|$|Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, {{usually takes}} place in the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg {{immediately}} begins the process of embryogenesis, or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the <b>uterus</b> and another three days to implant into the endometrium. It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation.|$|E
5|$|Great feats {{were made}} during the third century in both the {{digestive}} and reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver. He showed that the <b>uterus</b> is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. He recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes {{and was the first}} to identify the prostate gland.|$|E

25|$|Progesterone {{is used in}} {{combination}} with estrogen {{as a component of}} HRT for menopausal symptoms. A progestogen is needed to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and increased risk of endometrial cancer caused by unopposed estrogen in women with intact <b>uteruses.</b> In addition, progestogens, including progesterone, are able to treat and improve hot flashes. Progesterone, both alone and {{in combination}} with estrogen, also has beneficial effects on skin health and is able to slow the rate of skin aging in postmenopausal women.|$|R
40|$|To assess {{prenatal}} and postnatal developmental {{status in}} the offspring {{of a group of}} animals, it is typical to examine fetuses from some of the dams as well as infants born to the remaining dams. Statistical limitations often arise, particularly when the animals are rare or especially precious, because all offspring of the dam represent only a single statistical observation; littermates are not independent observations (biologically or statistically). We describe a study in which pregnant laboratory rats were laparotomized on day 7 of gestation (GD 7) to ascertain the number and distribution of uterine implantation sites and were subjected to a simulated experience on a 10 -day space shuttle flight. After the simulated landing on GD 18, rats were unilaterally hysterectomized, thus providing a sample of fetuses from 10 independent <b>uteruses,</b> followed by successful vaginal delivery on GD 22, yielding postnatal samples from 10 <b>uteruses.</b> A broad profile of maternal and offspring morphologic and physiologic measures indicated that these novel sampling procedures did not compromise maternal well-being and maintained normal offspring development and function. Measures included maternal organ weights and hormone concentrations, offspring body size, growth, organ weights, sexual differentiation, and catecholamine concentrations...|$|R
5|$|In 1997, Ruby became pregnant. Near {{the end of}} her 22-month pregnancy, veterinarians {{discovered}} that the calf was dead. Ruby's <b>uterus</b> had ruptured, and the calf had slipped out and into Ruby's abdomen. Due to complications during the surgery to remove the 320-pound fetus, Ruby had to be euthanized.|$|E
5|$|In August 1955 Beryl felt unwell {{and went}} for tests: she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer of the <b>uterus</b> and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to the news in different ways, and while Beryl began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began to work harder, and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.|$|E
5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus. Examples include the removal of a fallopian tube {{in the case of an}} ectopic pregnancy, removal of a pregnant cancerous <b>uterus,</b> or an appendectomy.|$|E
5|$|German doctors {{performed}} {{a wide variety}} of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of X-rays as a sterilization device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's <b>uteruses</b> in an effort to glue them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as research subjects for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects.|$|R
25|$|Ultimately {{he wanted}} to study human organs. He {{was able to get}} some donated <b>uteruses</b> and ovaries from the bodies of {{accident}} victims, or from surgeons who'd removed them. However, one of the best historical sources of organs for research, the bodies of executed criminals, had not been available {{during the early years of}} his research as the Weimar government made very minimal use of the death penalty, and did not execute any women. In a 1931 letter Stieve complained that it was difficult to get a set of ovaries from a healthy woman.|$|R
2500|$|A new tragic {{experience}} persuaded me {{that air}} could also carry decaying organic matter. In November {{of the same}} year, an individual was admitted with a discharging carious left knee. [...] the ichorous exhalations of the carious knee completely saturated the air of her ward. In this way the other patients were exposed and nearly all the patients in that room died. [...] The ichorous particles that saturated {{the air of the}} maternity ward penetrated the <b>uteruses</b> already lacerated in the birth process. The particles were resorbed, and childbed fever resulted.|$|R
