5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eruptions of silica-rich {{rhyolite}} from 40,000 to 600 {{years ago}} built the Mono Craters. Black Point, {{today on the}} north shore of Mono Lake, is a flattened volcanic cone of basaltic debris that formed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a much deeper Mono Lake about 13,300 years ago, during the most-recent glacial period. Several eruptive episodes from 1,600 to 270 years before present in Mono Lake formed Negit Island. The magma reservoir feeding the Mono Lake Volcanic Field is unrelated to the Mono Craters magma reservoir.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the defence further, by 1881, mines were {{laid in the}} waters between the two forts and the eastern entrance of the harbour. The mines were tethered to the seabed but floated dangerously <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the water unseen to any enemy marine vessels. To enable safe passage of ships, a 'friendly safe channel' was created through the minefields. The work involved in the laying of minefields under the narrow channel (just 240 m apart) had actually led to rumours that tunnels running under the channels were constructed to link the two forts. There are, however, no archival records to prove that these tunnels were ever constructed.|$|E

25|$|Jupiter's {{atmospheric}} composition and ammonia clouds were recorded, the clouds possibly created by outflows {{from the lower}} depths of the atmosphere. Io's volcanism and plasma interactions with Jupiter's atmosphere were also recorded. The data Galileo collected supported the theory of a liquid ocean <b>under</b> <b>the</b> icy <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Europa, and there were indications of similar liquid-saltwater layers <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> Ganymede and Callisto. Ganymede was shown to possess a magnetic field and the spacecraft found new evidence for exospheres around Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo also discovered that Jupiter's faint ring system consists of dust from impacts on the four small inner moons. The extent and structure of Jupiter's magnetosphere was also mapped.|$|R

5|$|Radar {{results from}} SHARAD {{suggested}} that features termed lobate debris aprons (LDAs) contain {{large amounts of}} water ice. Of interest {{from the days of}} the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies of the Mars Odyssey from orbit, water ice is known to exist just <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. The {{last line of}} defense for the planet is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans to the surface of Reach to protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Reach.|$|E

5|$|The portal {{takes the}} marine {{directly}} into Hell, where he proceeds to fight {{his way through}} the large number of demons to the Soul Cube, defeating its demonic guardian. The marine is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons. Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Mars and assures him that he will try to make {{his way out of the}} base alone.|$|E
5|$|On {{the way to}} the Delta Labs, {{the marine}} is {{contacted}} by Betruger, who is now clearly shown to be working in cooperation with Hell in order to invade Earth. If the marine did not send the distress call to Earth, Betruger does so himself, hoping to use the ships bringing reinforcements to transport the demons to Earth. Betruger then unsuccessfully attempts to kill the marine using the toxic gases in the base's recycling facilities. Upon arriving at the Delta Labs, the marine learns of the details behind the teleportation experiments, expeditions into Hell to retrieve specimens and Betruger's increasing obsession with the tests, as well as of an archaeological dig <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Mars. The dig is excavating the ruins of an ancient civilization discovered on Mars, and has produced a relic known as the Soul Cube. According to a scientist the marine finds alive in the labs, the Soul Cube is a weapon created by the ancient civilization to defend against the forces of Hell. The scientist also reveals that the invasion began when Betruger took the Soul Cube into the portal {{at the beginning of the}} game, depositing it in Hell. The marine pursues Betruger through the labs, but is pulled into the main teleportation portal after being lured into a trap by Betruger.|$|E
5|$|The {{demersal}} zone supports {{many animals}} that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators. The seabed provides {{a range of}} habitats on or <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs, and crustaceans. The neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones, and other invertebrates live among algal-encrusted rocks. Corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a diverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life {{on the floor of}} deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live demersal fish that largely feed on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously expected. Some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep-sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialized bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and fish. A dead whale sinking {{to the bottom of the}} ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.|$|E

Similarly, not since the Viking missions of the mid- 1970 s has there been as great an appreciation for the potential for Earth life to contaminate other worlds. Current plans for the exploration of the solar system include constraints intended to prevent biological contamination from being spread by solar-system exploration missions...|$|R

25|$|Natural gas is a {{naturally}} occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, {{and sometimes a}} small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the Earth over millions of years.

25|$|When {{foraging}} {{for food}} they will hang on branches suspended over the water, dipping their head <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the water, until they encounter a fish or other prey. They are frequently found basking on these branches over water, and when approached, they will quickly {{drop into the}} water and swim away. If cornered, they will often hiss, and flatten their head or body to appear larger. They only typically resort to biting if physically harassed or handled. Its bite is known to be quite painful due to its sharp teeth meant to keep hold of slippery fish. Unfortunately, this defensive behavior is frequently misinterpreted as aggression and often leads to their being mistaken for the venomous cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), with whom they do share habitat in some places. The brown/tan coloration and diamond-shaped pattern also causes these snakes to be mistaken for rattlesnakes, especially when encountered on land by individuals unfamiliar with snakes.|$|E
25|$|Beta {{hemolysis}} (β-hemolysis), {{sometimes called}} complete hemolysis, {{is a complete}} lysis of red cells in the media around and under the colonies: the area appears lightened (yellow) and transparent. Streptolysin, an exotoxin, is the enzyme produced by the bacteria which causes the complete lysis of red blood cells. There {{are two types of}} streptolysin: Streptolysin O (SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). Streptolysin O is an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin, secreted by most Group A streptococcus (GAS), and interacts with cholesterol in the membrane of eukaryotic cells (mainly red and white blood cells, macrophages, and platelets), and usually results in β-hemolysis <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> blood agar. Streptolysin S is an oxygen-stable cytotoxin also produced by most GAS strains which results in clearing on the surface of blood agar. SLS affects immune cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, and is thought to prevent the host immune system from clearing infection. Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), displays beta hemolysis.|$|E

In a laboratory analog experiment the circular and linear polarizations were measured in light scattered from a suspension of polystyrene spheres in water illuminated by laser. Results confirm that coherent backscatter from particle media reproduces the large intensity and unusual polarizations observed in the radar data.
