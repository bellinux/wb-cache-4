5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled {{step in the}} diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold <b>unset</b> ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut and polished, US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E
25|$|Diamond {{color is}} graded by {{comparing}} a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone {{is known to}} exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where {{in the range of}} color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond <b>unset,</b> as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards. When color grading is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of color. Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.|$|E

Moissanite is superior to cubic zirconia in two ways: its hardness (8.5–9.25) and low SG (3.2). The former property results in facets that are sometimes as crisp as a diamond's, while the latter property makes simulated moissanite somewhat harder to spot when <b>unset</b> (although still disparate enough to detect). However, unlike diamond and cubic zirconia, moissanite is strongly birefringent. This manifests as the same [...] "drunken vision" [...] effect seen in synthetic rutile, although to a lesser degree. All moissanite is cut with the table perpendicular to the optic axis in order to hide this property from above, but when viewed under magnification at only a slight tilt the doubling of facets (and any inclusions) is readily apparent.|$|E

40|$|Alarm {{systems with}} keypads, sensors and sirens protect our homes and {{commercial}} premises from intruders. The reliability {{of these systems}} has improved {{over the past years}} but the technology has remained largely as it was 3 decades ago. With simple keypads and generally 4 digit PIN codes used for setting and <b>unsetting</b> the alarms, the main protection against a determined intruder is the necessity to choose robust PIN codes. However, with PIN codes chosen that are generally easy to remember and therefore relatively easy to guess, or numbers chosen to follow a pattern on the keypad, the main protection from these systems lies in the ability to detect an intruder as they approach the keypad. This gives the intruder very little time to try multiple codes meaning the systems are secure because the intruder is detected quickly. This research looks at the choices of PIN codes and the patterns that they often follow, and sets out the forthcoming research that will look at circumventing the safeguards by performing computer driven attacks against the codes when access to the device is possible and when remote access to the device can be made over the telephone system. Additionally, the forensic evidence left behind by an attacker is discussed and how simple enhancements to systems can have significant advantages in enhancing the amount of evidence that can be found.

40|$|The degration in {{the modern}} pattern of heroism during the 20 th century America started {{with the advent of}} science and materialistic look of life. Modern {{scientific}} studies proposed that "man is alone, absolutely alone in a universe in which his very appearance is a cosmic accident" tending, at his best, towards an animal ancestor. Man was not cared for by spiritual or moral providence. The over soul, which the American hero was supposed to melt in, was replaced by the machine which ironically metamorphosed his significance. Modern American's pursuit of worldly gains was ultimately made at the expense of his essential spiritual and moral priorities as any material gain must be balanced against a spiritual loss. This fact is made concrete in the dehumanized character of Joe, the protagonist of Clifford Odets's Golden Boy (1937), through his aggressive anti-social behaviour. He is characterized by a lack of community. Golden Boy shows how the Americans are increasingly enervated by economic strains, racist tensions and political intimidation. Almost everywhere was the lost sense of community, a sense of inner defeat and lost self-esteem. The lost sense of community was very harmful as the Americans started looking for survival at the expense of society itself; social and economic injustices arose. Odets introduces such a motif in the character of Joe. Edward Albee (1928) is one of the significant American dramatists of the 20 th century, uses the dramatic forms that were prominent on the postwar European stage to articulate an <b>unsetting</b> vision of the United States. He wrote about the emptiness of American cultures and the uncertainties of human existence. His work castigated what he sees as a blindly materialistic society devoid of any real sense of values and national purpose. He is against the materialism in the society which goes along with consumerism. The characters in The American Dream (1961) are materialistic. Mommy represents women's addiction to shopping.

On sites of isolation such as embryo, umbilical cord and other body tissues stem cells are named embnyonic, cord blood, and adult stem cells.
