5000|$|The Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) is {{projected}} to generate approximately $254 million in the 2004-2005 fiscal year, $683 million in 2005-06 fiscal year, and then increasing amounts subsequently. Much of the funding will provide county mental health programs funds for programs consistent with their local plans. Furthermore, <b>uncommitted</b> <b>funds</b> during FY 2005-06 {{will be used to}} establish county reserve accounts as required by the MHSA.|$|E
40|$|The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) is Chicago's {{primary source}} of funds to redevelop neighborhoods devastated by the home {{foreclosure}} crisis. Yet NSP is able to fund a minute fraction of the resources needed to effectively address the crisis. The city of Chicago has another available resource, Tax Increment Financing (TIF), {{which could be used}} in a similar way to the way NSP dollars are used, though they are not currently being allocated for this purpose. Of the city's 159 TIF districts, all but three allow TIF funds to be used to purchase and rehabilitate properties. The Sweet Home Chicago ordinance, now pending before the Chicago City Council, would designate a yearly share of TIF funds to build and rehabilitate affordable housing, including foreclosed houses and apartment buildings. If enacted, TIF funds would complement the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, allowing the city to more significantly impact the continuing foreclosure crisis. This report examines the current impact of NSP, the extent to which TIF resources can be used to address foreclosures, and the resources available in TIF funds within neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosures. Key findings include: The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), launched in 2009, has already depleted 28 percent of its funding through the purchase and rehab of only 83 properties. These properties comprise less than 1 percent {{of the total number of}} foreclosures completed in Chicago during 2009 alone. The maximum number of foreclosed properties acquired in any of 27 NSP communities as of July 30, 2010 is 11. 32 % of home foreclosures in NSP communities occurred within TIF districts. These properties could be rehabilitated as affordable housing using TIF dollars. In 2009, 507 foreclosures were completed and 1, 415 foreclosures were filed within TIF districts in communities that were ineligible for NSP. Communities reporting more than 50 foreclosures within a TIF district have <b>uncommitted</b> <b>funds</b> available in the TIFs within their boundaries. Estimates of <b>uncommitted</b> <b>funds</b> that will be available over the life of these TIF districts range from $ 19 million to $ 761 million...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (Trust Fund), and the excise taxes that support the Trust Fund are scheduled for reauthorization {{at the end of}} fiscal year 2007. FAA is primarily supported by the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from a series of excise taxes paid by users of the national airspace system (NAS). The Trust <b>Fund's</b> <b>uncommitted</b> balance decreased by more than 70 percent from the end of fiscal year 2001 through the end of fiscal year 2005. The remaining funding is derived from the General Fund. This report focuses on the portion of revenues generated from users of the NAS and addresses the following key questions: (1) What advantages and concerns have been raised about the current approach to collecting revenues from NAS users to fund FAA, and to what extent does available evidence support the concerns? (2) What are the implications of adopting alternative funding options to collect the revenues contributed by users that fund FAA's budget? (3) What are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} authorizing FAA to use debt financing for capital projects? This report is based on interviews with relevant federal agencies, including FAA, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congressional Budget Office. GAO also obtained relevant documents from these agencies, other key stakeholders, and academic and financial experts. ...|$|R
