40|$|Rheology {{properties}} are sensitive indicators of molecular structure and dynamics. The relationship between rheology and polymer dynamics is {{captured in the}} constitutive model, which, if accurate and robust, would greatly aid molecular design and polymer processing. This dissertation is thus focused on building accurate and quantitative constitutive models that can help predict linear and non-linear viscoelasticity. In this work, {{we have used a}} multi-pronged approach based on the tube theory, coarse-grained slip-link simulations, and advanced polymeric synthetic and characterization techniques, to confront some of the outstanding problems in entangled polymer rheology. First, we modified simple tube based constitutive equations in extensional rheology and developed functional forms to test the effect of Kuhn segment alignment on a) tube diameter enlargement and b) monomeric friction reduction between subchains. We, then, used these functional forms to model extensional viscosity data for polystyrene (PS) melts and solutions. We demonstrated that the idea of reduction in segmental friction due to Kuhn alignment is successful in explaining the qualitative difference between melts and solutions in extension as revealed by recent experiments on PS. Second, we compiled literature data and used it to develop a <b>universal</b> <b>tube</b> model parameter set and prescribed their values and uncertainties for 1, 4 -PBd by comparing linear viscoelastic G’ and G” mastercurves for 1, 4 -PBds of various branching architectures. The high frequency transition region of the mastercurves superposed very well for all the 1, 4 -PBds irrespective of their molecular weight and architecture, indicating universality in high frequency behavior. Therefore, all three parameters of the tube model were extracted from this high frequency transition region alone. Third, we compared predictions of two versions of the tube model, Hierarchical model and BoB model against linear viscoelastic data of blends of 1, 4 -PBd star and linear melts. The star was carefully synthesized and characterized. We found massive failures of tube models to predict the terminal relaxation behavior of the star/linear blends. In addition, these blends were also tested against a coarse-grained slip-link model, the “Cluster Fixed Slip-link Model (CFSM) ” of Schieber and coworkers. The CFSM with only two parameters gave excellent agreement with all experimental data for the blends...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} to {{calculate}} the static electric polarization of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) is obtained within the second-order perturbation approximation. The results are {{in agreement with the}} previous calculation within the random-phase approximation. We also find that the low energy electronic band structure of SWNT can be affected by an external electric field perpendicular to the axis of the tube. The field-induced energy gap shows strong dependence on the electric field {{and the size of the}} tubes, and a metal-insulator transition is predicted for all (n, n) <b>tubes.</b> <b>Universal</b> scaling is found for the gap as function of the electric field and the radius of SWNTs. The fact that the external field required to induce a 0. 1 eV gap in SWNTs can be reached under the currently available experimental conditions indicates a possibility of further applying nanotubes to electric signal-controlled nanoscale switching devices.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} community health agents (CHAs) to instruct women living in poor rural areas in obtaining self-collected cervical samples and compare the high-risk HPV (hrHPV) hybrid capture (HC) results obtained to those for gynecologist-collected samples. Methods: After a one-day training, CHAs visited sexually active women, instructing each {{in the use of}} collection brush and the <b>Universal</b> Collection Medium <b>tube.</b> One week thereafter, a gynecologist collected cervical samples from, and performed colposcopies on, the same women. A single reference Lab performed all HCs. Results: 878 women (Age: 15 - 69 years) participated. Among self-collected samples, hrHPV prevalence was 33. 9 % (95 % CI: 30. 8 %- 37 %), compared with 28. 6 % (95 % CI: 27 %- 30 %) among gynecologist-collected samples. However, 9. 3 % of the patients were HPV HC II-positive in the seff-collected sample and HPV HC II-negative in the gynecologist-collected samples (95 % CI: 7. 38 %- 11. 22 %), whereas 4 % tested positive in gynecologist-collected samples and negative in self-collected samples (95 % CI: 2. 7 %- 5. 3 %) (P < 0. 01; kappa= 0. 7). of 9 cases of histologically-confirmed, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, self-collected and provider-collected samples missed one each. Conclusion: Self-collected vaginal. sampling could be made an additional CHA function under existing program conditions, improving access to cervical cancer screening in poor rural settings.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} the {{electronic}} properties of carbon nanotubes and of generic nanotubes in magnetic fields. Carbon nanotubes are highly symmetric objects on the nanometer scale which show an interesting interplay of their geometry with electronic properties. The geometry is entirely defined by two integer numbers that specify a chiral vector. This vector in turn determines the main electronic properties of a given tube, which can be theoretically understood in terms of a simple tight-binding model. After reviewing these basic facts we move on to use these straight-forward theoretical tools in order to establish a number of fundamental and sometimes surprising properties of nanotubes, such as the effects of the small intrinsic curvature, rehybridization, structural deformations and magnetic fields. Interestingly, rehybridization of the &# 960;-orbitals always takes place. As a result, the &# 960; orbitals are not oriented along the normal to the surface but rather tilt, with an angle which {{is a function of the}} radius and the chiral angle. Consequently, we predict a radial charge redistribution and a small distortion of STM images. The gaps of semi-conducting and primary metallic tubes are determined by an interplay of deformation, curvature, and field effects that can lead to interesting experimental signatures, which have in fact been tested recently. The possibility of <b>universal</b> behavior of <b>tubes</b> with similar radius, but different chiralities under doping is proposed. Following carbon nanotubes, we discuss carbon nanotori and show that in an ensemble of perfect nanotori, the ratio of primary-metallic to semiconducting tori should be almost reversed compared to the one-third to two-thirds in nanotubes. Finally we consider the effects of perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields in nanotubes. Already for generic tubes, i. e. a cylindrical two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field interesting spin- and charge effects can be observed, such as chiral spin currents. At a certain filling, the current is confined to flow only at the sides of the tube, like the edge states in the Hall bar, giving rise to an integer quantum Hall effect. We then show that some of these effects can also be seen in a curved, not necessary cylindrical, two-dimensional electron gas. The possible experimental realizations of these predictions are discussed...|$|R
