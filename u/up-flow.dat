This study is to determine the efficiency of bio-waste filter to remove the heavy metals and the efficiency between <b>up-flow</b> and gravity flow method in the treatment process. The phosphorylated orange adsorption gel (POAG) is chemically modified orange waste which consisted of orange peels and pulps. Besides cotton, glass beads, and glass filter, POAG is also part of the reactor for both <b>up-flow</b> and gravity flow method. The wastewater treatment is run for 7 hours time of interval. The wastewater samples are taken from the automotive service and repair shop at Gambang. The concentration of heavy metals and oil and grease of the samples are measured for each hour. From the data analysis, the average percentage removals of Copper using gravity flow and <b>up-flow</b> method are 94. 12 % and 96. 57 % respectively. The average percentage removals of Lead using gravity flow and <b>up-flow</b> method are 162. 42 % and 188. 51 % respectively. The average percentage removals of Nickel using gravity flow and <b>up-flow</b> method are 126. 79 % and 139. 29 % respectively. The average percentage removals of Zinc using gravity flow and <b>up-flow</b> method are 88. 13 % and 88. 44 % respectively. The average percentage removals of oil and grease using gravity flow and <b>up-flow</b> method are 99. 02 % and 97. 61 % respectively. Based on statistical analysis, both contact time and treatment methods are significant. By comparing the P-value of contact time and treatment methods, contact time is more significant than treatment methods because lower P-value of contact time. In conclusion, POAG has high ability to remove the heavy metals and oil and grease which contain in the samples. <b>Up-flow</b> method bas the higher efficiency for removing heavy metals compare to gravity flow method.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the present paper is to study by large-eddy simulation (LES) the dynamics of a fountain created by a turbu-lent vertical jet flow penetrating a pycnocline (a sharp density interface) in a density-stratified fluid.

At a certain height the jet fluid stagnates and flows down under gravity around the <b>up-flowing</b> core thus creating a fountain. The LES results show that if the Froude number Fr (defined by the jet flow velocity and diameter at injection and the buoyancy frequency in the pycnocline) is large enough, the fountain top collapses periodically and generates circular internal waves.

40|$|Anammox (Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation) is a {{significant}} biogeochemical process carried out by certain bacteria, generally referred to as anammox bacteria.

40|$|The {{two phase flow}} {{characteristics}} of helium I are of interest since under most operational scenarios this cryogenic fluid exists in both liquid and vapor form because of its extremely low boiling point and latent heat of vaporization. There is a significant knowledge gap in the flow boiling parameters of helium (heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop and dryout heat flux) for high Reynolds number vertical <b>up-flows</b> (Re = 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 6). This dissertation fills this gap and helps to expand the use of helium as an inert simulant for hydrogen. Since no prior correlations for the flow boiling parameters existed for vertical <b>up-flows</b> of helium at these Reynolds numbers, any predictions of these parameters were dependent on correlations that were tested at lower Reynolds numbers, or correlations based on other fluids. The thermophysical properties of helium I are significantly different from most other fluids; therefore the capability of prior correlations in predicting experimental observations was limited. As part of this research new correlations are proposed for the flow boiling parameters. This research begins the investigation of a new regime for two-phase helium I flows at Reynolds numbers above 3 e 5. The techniques described will enable future work to address other gaps in knowledge for helium I flows that still remain. The prior heat transfer coefficient correlation over-predicted the data that was collected for this research. The new correlation improves the agreement with data {{by a factor of}} 98. Two prior models for pressure drop, the separated flow model and the homogeneous flow model, under-predict the observed pressure drop. The newer versions of the separated flow and the homogeneous flow correlations improve agreement with the data by about a factor of 3 and by more than a factor of 2 respectively. The previous dryout heat flux correlation considerably over predicts the observed dryout heat flux. The new correlation improves agreement with the data by a factor of 21. Significant cryogenic challenges were overcome to collect the research data. The strategies described for surmounting the diverse challenges such as thermal acoustic oscillations and low dryout heat flux could be used by future two-phase cryogenic flow researchers...|$|R

40|$|In the {{standard}} model of solar flares, energy deposition by a beam of electrons drives strong chromospheric evaporation leading to a significantly denser corona and much brighter emission across the spectrum. Chromospheric evaporation was examined in great detail by Fisher, Canfield, & McClymont (1985 a,b,c), who described a distinction between two different regimes, termed explosive and gentle evaporation. In this work, we examine the importance of electron energy and stopping depths on the two regimes and on the atmospheric response. We find that with explosive evaporation, the atmospheric response does not depend strongly on electron energy. In the case of gentle evaporation, lower energy electrons are significantly more efficient at heating the atmosphere and driving <b>up-flows</b> sooner than higher energy electrons. We also find that the threshold between explosive and gentle evaporation is not fixed at a given beam energy flux, but also depends strongly on the electron energy and duration of heating.

The removal percentage of sulfide was approximately 95. 2 % and elemental sulfur conversion percentage was above 90. 3 %. These results demonstrated that the novel <b>up-flow</b> in-cycle bioreactor had a potential value for the enhanced treatment of sulfide wastewater from biogas purification...|$|E

Flocs size is an {{important}} parameter in the blanket clarifier process, hence, {{it is necessary to}} investigate flocs average diameter in different blanket height to achieve optimum operation parameters of the process. To investigate the flocs size under different operational conditions，flocs were sampled from different locations of the blanket in various operating stages to analyze its size. Experimental works with water plant wastes flocculated with polyacrylamide (PAM) suspended in a pilot-scale blanket confirmed the theoretical predictions. Change in operational conditions such as raw water concentration and <b>up-flow</b> rate would affect the blanket flocs size, there exists a linear relationship between <b>up-flow</b> rate and flocs average size, and flocs size were improved along with the increase of raw sludge concentration. The experimental results identified an inverse proportion between flocs average size and the blanket depth, the average flocs diameter increased along with the depth of the blanket...|$|E

40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{a series of}} non-rotating quasi-hydrostatic evolutionary models for the M 2 Iab supergiant Betelgeuse (α Orionis). Our models are constrained by multiple observed values for the temperature, luminosity, surface composition and mass loss for this star, along with the parallax distance and high resolution imagery that determines its radius. We have then applied our best-fit models to analyze the observed variations in surface luminosity {{and the size of}} detected surface bright spots as the result of <b>up-flowing</b> convective material from regions of high temperature in the surface convective zone. We also attempt to explain the intermittently observed periodic variability in a simple radial linear adiabatic pulsation model. Based upon the best fit to all observed data, we suggest a best progenitor mass estimate of 20 ^+ 5 _- 3 M_ and a current age {{from the start of the}} zero-age main sequence of 8. 0 - 8. 5 Myr based upon the observed ejected mass while on the giant branch.

40|$|Solar cycle {{variations}} of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) observed by the Akebono satellite have been {{compared with the}} {{variations of}} F 10. 7 and solar wind dynamic pressure. F 10. 7 and solar wind dynamic pressure show different solar cycle variations: F 10. 7 increases during solar maximum and decreases during solar minimum. Solar wind dynamic pressure suddenly increases in the declining phase of solar activity and gradually decreases. The pressure minimum occurs during solar maximum. Statistical analysis of the Akebono data has shown that AKR occurrence minimum occurs during solar maximum, however AKR occurrence maximum coincides not with solar wind dynamic pressure peak but with F 10. 7 minimum. <b>Up-flowing</b> ion (UFI) events and ambient plasma density, which are associated with generation conditions of AKR, also show similar behavior. They are dependent not on solar wind dynamic pressure but on F 10. 7. These results suggest the anti-correlation between discrete aurora and solar activities, which has been never recognized through the studies on secular variations of auroral phenomena mainly based on old auroral records obtained in mid-latitude regions...|$|R
40|$|Water is a {{strategic}} material. Recycling {{is an important}} component of balancing its use. Deep-bed filtration is an inexpensive purification method and seems to be very effective in spreading water recovery. Good filter designs, such as the fibrous filter, have high separation efficiency, low resistance for the <b>up-flowing</b> fluid and high retention capacity. However, one of the substantial problems of this process is the biofouling of the filter. Biofouling causes clogging and greatly reduces the life of the filter. Therefore, the melt-blown technique was used for the formation of novel antibacterial fibrous filters. Such filters are made of polypropylene composites with zinc oxide and silver nanoparticles on the fiber surface. These components act as inhibitors of bacterial growth in the filter and were tested in laboratory and full scale experiments. Antibacterial/bacteriostatic tests were performed on Petri dishes with E. coli and B. subtilis. Full scale experiments were performed on natural river water, which contained abiotic particles and mutualistic bacteria. The filter performance at industrial scale conditions was measured using a particle counter, a flow cytometer and a confocal microscope. The results of the experiments indicate a significant improvement of the composite filter performance compared to the regular fibrous filter. The differences were mostly due to a reduction in the biofouling effect...|$|R
