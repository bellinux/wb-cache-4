According to such a model, the boundaries of cognitive processes are not always inside the skin. “Minds are composed of tools for thinking” (Dennett 2000, p. 21). According to Andy Clark, “cognition leaks out into body and world”.

25|$|The PS3 {{supports}} numerous SDTV and HDTV resolutions (from 480i/576i up to 1080p) and connectivity options (such as HDMI 1.3a and component video). In {{terms of}} audio, the PS3 supports {{a number of}} formats, including 7.1 digital audio, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio and others; audio output is possible over stereo RCA cables (analog), optical digital cables, or HDMI. The PS3 slim features an upgraded HDMI chip that allows bitstreaming of lossless audio codecs to an external receiver (earlier versions had to decode the signal internally before outputting it via LPCM). For the optical disc drive, {{a wide variety of}} DVD and CD formats are supported, as well as Blu-ray Discs. A 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, or 500GB 2.5-inch SATA 150 hard disk is preinstalled. In the early 60GB and 80GB configurations, flash memory can also be used, either Memory Sticks; CompactFlash cards; or SD/MMC cards. All models support <b>USB</b> <b>memory</b> devices; flash drives and external hard drives are both automatically recognized. However, they must be formatted with the FAT32 file system. For communication, the system sported four USB 2.0 ports at the front on the 20 and 60GB models as well as the NTSC 80GB model, but the 40GB and 80GB PAL models only have two USB ports. All models (80 and 160GB) released after August 2008 have been reduced to two USB ports, as well as dropping CompactFlash and SD card support. One Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0 support, and built-in Wi-Fi (except CECHBxx).|$|E

40|$|Securely erasing data is of key {{importance}} to anyone that {{is concerned with}} the security of their sensitive information, whether an individual or an organization. Simply deleting the data in question or formatting the storage device is not enough to ensure that the data cannot be recovered. Furthermore, with the uptake of Universal Serial Bus drives (<b>USBs)</b> flash <b>memory</b> based storage devices have replaced previous portable secondary storage media. Therefore, it is of a major concern whether these tools and products developed for securely erasing data secondary storage Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) would be as efficient when targeting the <b>USB</b> flash <b>memory</b> storage devices.
