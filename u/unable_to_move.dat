5|$|Buffalo {{began the}} final quarter with the ball in a 2nd-and-11 {{situation}} and were unable to convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls. On their next possession Buffalo {{managed to get a}} first down off of a Drew Willy pass to tight end Jesse Rack, but were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the ball further than UConn's 49-yard line and punted again.|$|E
5|$|A king is {{in check}} {{when it is}} under attack {{by at least one}} enemy piece. A piece <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the {{opposing}} player.|$|E
5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid would be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E

5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|The Hydrophiinae, {{commonly}} known as sea snakes or coral reef snakes, are a subfamily of venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for {{most or all of}} their lives. Most are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on land, except for the genus Laticauda, which has limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and are closely related to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.|$|E

60|$|Norgate for {{a moment}} was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> speak or <b>move.</b> He was {{struggling}} {{with a sort of}} blind fury.|$|R
60|$|He {{tapped his}} leg. She was past {{the stage of}} shudders now. Stiff all over, <b>unable</b> even <b>to</b> <b>move</b> her eyes, she felt an awful mental tension which was like blank forgetfulness. Ricardo tried to {{influence}} her in his own way.|$|R
5|$|The Rasenshuriken creates countless {{microscopic}} wind-blades that severely {{damage the}} body on a cellular level. It produces so many individual strikes that even Kakashi Hatake {{is unable to}} count them all with his Sharingan. The wind-blades sever all nerve channels in the body, leaving the target <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> after being struck. They also attack the entire chakra circulatory system, which cannot be repaired by any form of medical ninjutsu.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{took over}} {{at their own}} 19-yard line and {{promptly}} earned their 1stfirstdown of the game on a 10-yardpass from quarterback Drew Willy to wide receiver Naaman Roosevelt. The Bulls' drive stalled from there, forcing them to punt. The punt struck the ground and hit UConn's Jonathan Jean-Louis, who was attempting to block for the punt return; Buffalo recovered the loose ball, giving them back possession at the Connecticut 23-yard line. The Bulls were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the ball any closer to the end zone, and settled for a 38-yard field goal by kicker A. J. Principe, giving them a 3â€“0 lead with 4:26 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} timed runs in Q2, Lewis Hamilton was seven-tenths {{of a second}} quicker than {{teammate}} Rosberg, while the Ferrari cars split the pair to place provisional second and third. Nevertheless, both Mercedes drivers did not go out again. Sebastian Vettel set a second timed lap to improve his time, now {{a little more than}} a tenth behind Hamilton. Many drivers only set one timed lap towards the end of the session, with Pastor Maldonado, Felipe Nasr, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on into Q3, while Ricciardo did not set a time, leaving him fifteenth for the time being.|$|E
60|$|Her heart failed {{her and her}} {{resolution}} became water. She {{remained standing}} stiffly, <b>unable</b> even <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> She could not look at him through an interval that seemed to her a vast gulf of time. But she felt his lax figure become rigid.|$|R
60|$|He paused, as if endeavouring {{to recall}} the past, and Betty sat with her hands clasped, gazing in Paul's face like a fascinated creature, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> speak or <b>move.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{family lived}} in a home near the new lighthouse, and Abbie became {{concerned}} that if a gale came, that the home could be damaged, and her mother would be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> be <b>moved.</b> In December 1855 she transferred her mother's bedroom to a small room in the lighthouse itself. Less than a month later a devastating gale struck.|$|R
5|$|In the First Test {{against the}} West Indies cricket team in Brisbane, Davidson showed his all round skills {{as well as}} stamina in {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} take ten wickets and accumulate more than a hundred runs in a match. On the eve of the match, Davidson broke the little finger on his bowling hand during catching practice and was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> it. However, he decided to play after Bradman gave a motivational speech to the team ahead of the match.|$|E
5|$|In these {{extremely}} tough conditions, the British infantry were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> effectively {{against the}} retreating German and Turkish {{force in the}} following days. Alone, the Anzac Mounted Division was unable to stop the retreating force withdrawing to Katia and eventually back to their base at Bir el Abd. This base was abandoned the day after it was attacked by the Anzac Mounted Division, on 12 August 1916, ending any threat to the Suez Canal {{for the remainder of}} the war. The battle cost the Allies 1,202 casualties of which 222 were killed, 71 died of wounds and 909 were wounded; half of these were Australians.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
50|$|While Scrooge is away, the Beagle Boys {{sneak into}} the Money Bin using Blackheart's plan. However, by twists of fate - mostly caused by the Beagle Boys' {{personal}} lust for treasure, prunes, or personal fame - they get caught in situations where they're mostly <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> even <b>move,</b> without risking alerting the police, or personal injury.|$|R
50|$|A K*bot is {{considered}} eliminated {{as soon as}} any of its wheels are fully off the table. K*bots can also be eliminated if they are flipped completely over during a match, {{in such a way}} that they are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>move</b> independently.|$|R
50|$|Bringing {{supplies}} with him, Royce lands {{near the}} wreckage and finds Averyanov (Aleksandr Potapov), a Soviet navigator, the sole survivor who is injured and <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> be <b>moved.</b> Intending <b>to</b> wait until further help arrives, Royce makes repairs on the shattered aircraft, but soon realizes help is not coming, as the aircraft is far off course. The ice shifts below the wreckage, further complicating their survival.|$|R
5|$|Reverend Norman Balthus is Brother Justin's mentor. He rescued {{and raised}} young Justin and Iris {{after he had}} found them alone in the wilderness. Late in the first season, Norman grows {{suspicious}} of Brother Justin's inner motivations. He confronts his foster son but does not carry out Brother Justin's plea to kill him. At the beginning of season 2, Norman suffers a stroke leaving him <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> or speak. He remains {{in the care of}} Brother Justin and Iris until the carnival sets up near Brother Justin's {{home at the end of}} the series. Ben heals Norman, but the reverend is fatally lacerated by Brother Justin seconds later.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of {{construction}} (Phase II) had been contracted {{to be completed by}} March 2008. This would enable Morningstar, Inc. to move before its early 2009 lease expiration at its present location, 225 W. Wacker Drive. However, financial troubles have caused delays that have necessitated that Morningstar who had intended to occupy over half of the building seek lease proposals from other downtown office towers. Morningstar would suffer holdover penalties and other damages if it were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> before its lease expires. Morningstar is hesitant to pursue other opportunities because their lease at 108 North State Street is at a below market price in the low $20s/square foot.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> or dead).|$|E
50|$|Five other clubs had applied: Boronia, Chelsea, Frankston, Keilor and Ringwood. The Association {{had also}} been in favour of admitting Frankston, but the club failed to get a {{clearance}} from the Mornington Peninsula Football League, so was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> make the <b>move.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In fall 1906, a {{few months}} after the birth of his son Eldridge, Douglass had a nervous {{breakdown}} followed by other health problems and became <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> work. He <b>moved</b> his family from Philadelphia to San Rafael, California. He wrote in his autobiography: ...|$|R
60|$|Under {{the command}} of the Duke of Cumberland the column crossed the ravine in front of Fontenoy. The ground was so broken that the troops were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> deploy, but <b>moved</b> forward in a solid mass with a front of only forty men.|$|R
5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball first {{to begin the}} game, and returned the opening kickoff to their own 24-yard line. They were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the ball in threeplays, and punted the ball to Connecticut. The Huskies took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by running back Donald Brown and quarterback Tyler Lorenzen, earning two first downs. On 2nddownand5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was sacked by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott and fumbled; the ball was recovered by UConn right tackle Mike Hicks, allowing the Huskies to retain possession. A holding penalty on the next play called on UConn left tackle William Beatty set up 3rd-and-24. Donald Brown rushed for fifteenyards {{but was unable to}} reach the first-down marker, forcing UConn to punt.|$|E
5|$|His neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and Prince Philip commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite being <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> his head, {{and went to}} bed expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> or talk.|$|E
5000|$|The {{location}} of the restart after a try had been scored, either a place-kick if the try had been converted or a drop-kick if the try-scoring team was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> convert, was <b>moved</b> from the 25-yard line of the non-scoring team to the halfway line.|$|R
6000|$|Three {{days after}} Parracombe was dead. Once in camp he seemed <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> eat or <b>move,</b> and having {{received}} absolution and communion from good Sir John, faded away without disease or pain, [...] "babbling of green fields," [...] and murmuring {{the name of}} his lost Indian bride.|$|R
40|$|Architects for Social Housing {{were asked}} by the {{residents}} of Knights Walk - a low rise part of a housing estate in Kennington, South London - {{to come up with}} alternatives to the demolition of their homes. Demolition for many of these residents - many go home were elderly - would mean they would be forcibly removed from their homes, committees and support networks as they would be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into the redeveloped estate. Although Lambeth council didn't pursue our design proposal, the project was a success, resulting {{as it did in the}} retention of half of the homes on the estate, enabling the residents who campaigned against the demolition of their homes to stay in their homes...|$|R
