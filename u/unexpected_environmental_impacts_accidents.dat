40|$|For {{many years}} Thailand has faced <b>unexpected</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> and risks from (industrial) development. In {{spreading}} {{over the country}} these impacts and risks have caused growing social conflicts around resident communities in rural areas. In investigating the (un) sustainability of agro-food processing industries in Thailand, this study developed a methodology to analyze and assess the potential contributions of core actors in stimulating industrial performance into more environmentally sound directions. A quartet-network methodology, based on the Ecological Modernization Theory, was {{used to analyze the}} institutions and actors involved in three key industrial food-processing sectors: fruit and vegetable processing, animal and meat processing, and fruit wine processing. In these sectors 15 case study companies in Northern Thailand have been studied in-depth, in order to clarify how and to what extent small and medium-sized agro-food processing industries could improve their environmental performance. T hese case studies reveal the opportunities and constraints in applying strategies and options to green the food-processing industrial sector in Northern Thailand, and the role of various actors and institutions in moving along such a trajectory...|$|R
50|$|The {{applications}} of technology often result in unavoidable and <b>unexpected</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts,</b> {{which according to}} the I = PAT equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit GDP. <b>Environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons. First, given {{that the purpose of}} many technologies is to exploit, control, or otherwise “improve” upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity {{while at the same time}} the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences. Second, the conservation of mass principle and the first law of thermodynamics (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental consequences are inescapable. Third, according to the second law of thermodynamics, order can be increased within a system (such as the human economy) only by increasing disorder or entropy outside the system (i.e., the environment). Thus, technologies can create “order” in the human economy (i.e., order as manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at the expense of increasing “disorder” in the environment. According to a number of studies, increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b>|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{eutectic}} Pb 17 Li {{is part of}} {{the blanket}} studies carried out in Europe for fusion power reactors. The use of this breeder makes easier some safety problems as compared to the case of lithium {{as a consequence of the}} lower chemical reactivity of Pb 17 Li. On the other hand, it increases the radioactivity problems due to the neutron activation of lead and impurities. This paper presents both short-term (accidents) and long-term (waste disposal and recycling) aspects of the Pb 17 Li activation products. They include the production, mobilization, release and <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> Concerning <b>accidents,</b> a particular attention is given to Po- 210 and Hg- 203.

40|$|The use of {{the crude}} oil as primary source of energy has {{significant}} social and <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts,</b> from <b>accidents</b> and routine activities such as seismic exploration, drilling, and generation of polluting wastes. Crude oil is subject to certain degradation processes: biotic and abiotic degradation. The fate of crude oil under UV and solar irradiation was studied. Compositions of the original and irradiated samples have been characterized by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR/MS) 7 T ThermoElectron {{that is capable of}} achieving the peak capacity needed to resolve individual components of a complex data matrix. Conversion of measured masses from the IUPAC mass scale (12 C = 12. 00000 Da) to the Kendrick mass scale (CH 2 = 14. 00000 instead of 14. 01565 Da) was performed to facilitate identification of homologous series.

25|$|Rogaland was {{a heavily}} trafficked sea lanes in the country, with about 300,000 annual sailings and about ten annual accidents. The decisive reason for {{establishing}} a VTS {{in the area}} was {{the establishment of a}} gas terminal at Kårstø. It receives about six hundred annual gas tankers. The <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of an <b>accident</b> was considered so high that increased precautions were needed. VTSes are cover their operating expenses entirely through charging a safety fee on all commercial ships docking in the jurisdiction. Half the operating costs of Kvitsøy were placed on gas tankers to Kårstø, initially 74 øre per gross tonnage. All other ships were charged 19 øre per gross tonne. There were local reactions to this, as Rogaland ports would have a charge which for instance Bergen Port would not receive, as Fedje VTS was entirely financed through fees levied on tankers.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} awareness of the adverse impact of human activity on the natural environment. Fears of global warming have escalated and the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of industrial <b>accidents</b> has been generally widely publicized. As a result, businesses have been subject to both government and market pressures to adopt a corporate environmental strategy that will minimize damage to the environment in the future, and help in rectifying legacies from the past. Despite a diversity of literature addressing the issues of environmental management, managers often remain sceptical as to the importance of environmental considerations within corporate strategy. However, the economic reality of environmental management and its failure has not gone unaccounted. For example, Union Carbide faced claims of over US$ 3 billion after a chemical leak at Bhopal, and Exxon has spent over US$ 2 billion cleaning up after an Alaskan oil spill. Closer to home, Shell was fined a record £ 1 million for a crude oil spill into the Mersey and charged £ 1. 4 million for clean-u...|$|R
40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) {{needs to}} provide radiologically, and industrially safe and {{cost-effective}} {{management of the}} non-defense production reactor spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at the Hanford Site. The proposed action would place the Hanford Site`s non-defense production reactor SNF in a radiologically- and industrially-safe, and passive storage condition pending final disposition. The proposed action would also reduce operational costs associated with storage of the non-defense production reactor SNF through consolidation of the SNF and through use of passive rather than active storage systems. Environmental, safety and health vulnerabilities associated with existing non-defense production reactor SNF storage facilities have been identified. DOE has determined that additional activities are required to consolidate non-defense production reactor SNF management activities at the Hanford Site, including cost-effective and safe interim storage, prior to final disposition, to enable deactivation of facilities where the SNF is now stored. Cost-effectiveness would be realized: through reduced operational costs associated with passive rather than active storage systems; removal of SNF from areas undergoing deactivation {{as part of the}} Hanford Site remediation effort; and eliminating the need to duplicate future transloading facilities at the 200 and 400 Areas. Radiologically- and industrially-safe storage would be enhanced through: (1) removal from aging facilities requiring substantial upgrades to continue safe storage; (2) utilization of passive rather than active storage systems for SNF; and (3) removal of SNF from some storage containers which have a limited remaining design life. No substantial increase in Hanford Site <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> would be expected from the proposed action. <b>Environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> from postulated <b>accident</b> scenarios also were evaluated, and indicated that the risks associated with the proposed action would be small...|$|R
40|$|In <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> {{assessment}} (EIA), <b>accident</b> risk {{should be}} considered as one impact. However, few studies have compared assessed risk levels with documented accidents. There is thus a need for assessing accuracy of risk assessment methodologies. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and examine a risk assessment guideline based on environmental assessment. The guideline examination was carried out along the railway and the road between Kiruna and Narvik, Northern Scandinavia. The examined hazards were avalanches, debris flows, rock falls, slush flows, torrents, moose and reindeer. Documented accidents were quantified into an accident level. For each hazard type, six sections/sites were assessed. The propensities of these hazards were analysed through environmental assessments, especially by utilising geomorphology. Then, the accident densities along the sections/sites were compared with assessed accident phase indices describing risk and hazard in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The average uncertainty factors for both the risk and the hazard indices were about 5. This implies a fairly good precision. Risk and hazard indices were also rated and compared to the accident density rates. Thereafter, railway and road information was split up as different proposal alternatives in an EIA context. The total risk for each proposal was compared with the total accident density. The risk assessment guideline proved to be cost-efficient, rapid and relatively reliable in comparing accident risk...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the spatial}} {{variation}} of potential <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of bioenergy crops is quantitatively assessed. The cultivation of sugar beet and Miscanthus for bioethanol {{production in the}} North of the Netherlands {{is used as a}} case study. The <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> included are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (during lifecycle and related to direct land use change), soil quality, water quantity and quality, and biodiversity. Suitable methods are selected and adapted based on an extensive literature review. The spatial variation in <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> related to the spatial heterogeneity of the physical context is assessed using Geographical Information System (GIS). The case study shows that there are large spatial variations in <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of the introduction of bioenergy crops. Land use change (LUC) to sugar beet generally causes more negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> than LUC to Miscanthus. LUC to Miscanthus could have positive <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> in some areas. The most negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of a shift towards sugar beet and Miscanthus occur in the western wet pasture areas. The spatially combined results of the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> illustrate that there are several trade offs between environmental impacts: there are no areas were no negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> occur.
