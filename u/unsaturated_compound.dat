50|$|In organic chemistry, a {{saturated}} compound is {{a chemical}} compound {{that has a}} chain of carbon atoms linked together by single bonds. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. An <b>unsaturated</b> <b>compound</b> is a chemical compound that contains carbon-carbon double bonds or triple bonds, such as those found in alkenes or alkynes, respectively. Saturated and unsaturated compounds need not consist only of a carbon atom chain. They can form straight chain, branched chain, or ring arrangements. They can have functional groups, as well. It is in this sense that fatty acids are classified as saturated or unsaturated. The amount of unsaturation of a fatty acid can be determined by finding its iodine number.|$|E

5000|$|IPT {{works by}} {{increasing}} the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. [...] It has been proposed that insulin potentiates chemotherapeutic drugs in two ways: {{by increasing the}} permeability of tumor cancer cell membranes {{so that they may}} absorb a greater quantity of cytotoxic drugs, and by modifying the metabolic function of cancer cells so as to render them more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the drugs. One hypothesis for the mechanism of insulin's membrane effect is that the hormone activates delta- 9 desaturase enzyme activity in cancer cells, altering cellular lipid synthesis so that saturated stearic acid is transformed to the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>compound</b> oleic acid, which increases cell membrane fluidity, and thus, permeability, at physiological temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius. Other hypotheses for insulin's membrane effect propose that drugs are absorbed onto glucose molecules, with transmembrane transport then occurring via the insulin-activated glucose transport protein, or suggest a similar adsorption of drug molecules onto insulin with the resulting chimeric drug-insulin complex being internalized into the cell by a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E
