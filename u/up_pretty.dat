500|$|For {{its second}} album, Pearl Jam felt the {{pressures}} of trying to match the success of its debut album, Ten. In a 2002 interview, guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "The band was blown <b>up</b> <b>pretty</b> big and everything was pretty crazy." [...] Vs. was the first Pearl Jam album to have production duties handled by producer Brendan O'Brien. It was also the band's first album with drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who had joined the band in August 1991 and toured for the album Ten. Rehearsals for Vs. began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in Seattle, Washington. The band then moved to The Site in Nicasio, California in March 1993 to begin recording. Abbruzzese called the tranquil recording site [...] "paradise" [...] while lead vocalist Eddie Vedder said, [...] "I fucking hate it here... I've had a hard time... How do you make a rock record here?" ...|$|E

500|$|Burt Reynolds makes a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "The Man from Jupiter", as the love interest of Malory Archer. His guest appearance was formally announced in October 2011. Prior to his appearance, Reynolds was referenced in several episodes of the series. Series creator Adam Reed opined: [...] "I {{think the only}} person on the planet who's a bigger fan of Burt Reynolds than me is Sterling Archer. Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing." [...] After receiving the episode's script from Reed, Reynolds made several edits; while editing the script of the episode, Reynolds added {{a scene in which}} Sterling reveals that his career choice was largely influenced by his films. [...] "We sent him the script beforehand and he noted the script <b>up</b> <b>pretty</b> good. But it was all to make it more self-deprecating." [...] Reed, a fan of Reynolds, said that working with him was a great experience. [...] "It was such a surreal experience being in the room with Burt Reynolds, my childhood hero," [...] he affirmed. [...] "Just hearing him read the stuff that I wrote, it was pretty great." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of 2013, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters made multiple annual movie lists dedicated to underappreciated or underrated films. Movies.com opined it [...] "is, hands down, the most underappreciated film of the year…'Proper' filmmaking or not, if you've got me cheering at the screening, grinning big and then walking out with a little extra adrenaline, you’ve done something right." [...] Ryan Doom from JoBlo.com wrote that [...] "while usually that’s the thing I mock, [...] somehow ended <b>up</b> <b>pretty</b> damn enjoyable…Why not? It never takes itself serious and it knows exactly what it is: a silly film that isn't afraid {{to do what the}} hell it wants." [...] Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters has hence been labeled as a cult film by a number of horror-fantasy film fans, as well as by some critics who initially saw no merit in the movie. This significant financial and fan following have led some to question the initial perception of the film in relation to its debut in January, considered to be [...] "a refuge for films that don't have a shot of generating good word of mouth or having a leggy run." [...] While Renner's box office draw and the film's [...] "well-articulated premise" [...] have been listed as major factors behind its [...] theatrical success, its ability to maintain a lasting fan following has also been attributed to its original concept, excellent gore and action sequences, Renner's and Arterton's tongue-in-cheek performances, and the film's ability to not take itself too seriously. The film was nominated for the 40th People's Choice Awards in the category Favorite Horror Movie, but lost to Carrie.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{headed into}} the studio in early 1993 facing the {{challenge}} of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, [...] "The band was blown <b>up</b> <b>pretty</b> big and everything was pretty crazy." [...] Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. Vs. included the singles [...] "Go", [...] "Daughter", [...] "Animal", and [...] "Dissident". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut." [...] He added, [...] "Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife." [...] The band decided, beginning {{with the release of}} Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts. The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of [...] "Jeremy" [...] and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band [...] "ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans." [...] During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly Clarkson {{was born}} in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (née Rose), a first grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer. She is the {{youngest}} of three children with a brother named Jason and a sister named Alyssa. Clarkson also has two younger half brothers from her father's second marriage. Her parents divorced when she was six years old, wherein her brother went to go live with their father, her sister {{went to live with}} an aunt and she stayed with her mother. Clarkson's mother later remarried, to Jimmy Taylor. Her ancestry is Greek (from a maternal great-grandfather), Welsh, English, Irish, German, and Scottish. Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose, whose life story was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in 2013. Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said: [...] "I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I’ve always grown <b>up</b> <b>pretty</b> close to church and with God. But I think I’ve just gotten a lot closer just because He’s the only one I can lean on." [...] She later said of her upbringing: [...] "My family was highly conservative; I had to go to church on Sunday and Wednesday." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} split with Erica, Armstrong {{met a woman}} he has {{identified}} only as [...] "Amanda" [...] at Gilman, and they started dating. Amanda produced and distributed her own zine and was an iron-willed feminist, which enthralled Armstrong. Amanda, however, was unimpressed with Armstrong and though the couple dated for some time she ultimately dumped him in 1994 and joined the Peace Corps leaving Armstrong feeling suicidal. Armstrong stated {{in an interview with}} Spin about the inspiration behind the Insomniac song Armitage Shanks in 1995, [...] "It was right before Dookie came out and I was really at odds with myself. I was like man do I really want to do this? A lot of time I was thinking about suicide, how it's so easy to kill yourself, but it's so hard to stay alive. I was in a break-up with my then girlfriend, a total, raving punk rocker who didn't approve of me being on a major label. She moved down to Ecuador saying she couldn't live in a world with McDonald's and such. It was fucking me <b>up</b> <b>pretty</b> bad." [...] Armstrong has written many songs about Amanda, both during their relationship and afterwards, including [...] "She", [...] "Good Riddance", [...] "Stuart And The Ave", [...] "Sassafrass Roots", [...] "Amanda", [...] "She's A Rebel", [...] "Extraordinary Girl" [...] and [...] "Whatsername". The hero, [...] "Whatsername", on the album American Idiot, and in the American Idiot musical, is based on Amanda.|$|E
2500|$|Love {{remembers that}} Capitol's working {{title for the}} album was Our Freaky Friends, and that the label planned the cover shoot at the zoo, with the animals {{representing}} the group's [...] "freaky friends". In May, the San Diego Union reported that the group [...] "came down from Hollywood to take a cover picture for their forthcoming album Our Freaky Friends.... Zoo officials were not keen about having their beloved beasts connected with {{the title of the}} album, but gave in when the Beach Boys explained that animals are an 'in' thing with teenagers. And that the Beach Boys were rushing to beat the rock and roll group called The Animals." [...] Asher remembered: [...] " [...] had some proofs of the pictures they'd done at the zoo, and he told me they were thinking of calling the album Pet Sounds. I thought it was a goofy name for an album – I thought it trivialized what we had accomplished." [...] Until arriving to the photo shoot, Jardine thought that [...] "pet" [...] referred to slang for making out ("petting"). Jardine also expressed disappointment with the chosen cover, believing it was [...] "crazy" [...] to go to the zoo, that [...] "the art department screwed <b>up</b> <b>pretty</b> badly on that one... wanted a more sensitive and enlightening cover." [...] Author Peter Doggett writes that the design was at odds with the increasingly sophisticated cover portraits used on releases by artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan over 1965–67. He highlights it as [...] "a warning of what could happen when music and image parted company: songs of high romanticism, an album cover of stark banality." ...|$|E

Old Mr. Blyth, however, on hearing that his son was now just as determined to become a married man as he had formerly been to become a painter, thought it advisable to make certain inquiries about the young lady's constitution; and addressed them, with characteristic caution, to the family doctor, at a private interview.|$|R
