5|$|In United States v. Daniel (1821), Chief Justice John Marshall {{recounted the}} history of tie-breaking methods on the circuit courts. If one judge or justice {{disagreed}} with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend, and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practiceas required by the Judiciary Act of 1793was to hold the case over <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. After 1802, in cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> term because the circuit-riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E
5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> election season.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to Bramall Lane {{under the}} captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested {{and stayed in}} London with the team manager. After the first day's play, he organised a party for that lasted <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> afternoon—the rest day. He woke up with a hangover the next day just minutes {{before the start of}} play. Improvising, Miller arrived at the ground in a hearse. When it was Australia's turn to bat, Miller was the last man to be dismissed, having scored 86 despite his hangover.|$|E

5|$|Bednar {{passed the}} Canadian {{citizenship}} test in June 1999, {{but it was}} suggested he should delay taking the Oath of Citizenship <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) fair. He became a Canadian citizen at the 2000 CNE, during a Citizenship Ceremony in the Automotive Building. The Citizenship Oath was administered by Bill Withrow, C.M., longtime director of the Art Gallery of Ontario and great-grandson of John Withrow, the Canadian National Exhibition Association's first president.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
5|$|Each Poor Law Union {{employed}} {{one or more}} relieving officers, {{whose job}} it was to visit those applying for assistance and assess what relief, if any, they should be given. Any applicants considered to be in need of immediate assistance could be issued with a note admitting them directly to the workhouse. Alternatively they might be offered any necessary money or goods to tide them over <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> meeting of the guardians, who would decide on the appropriate level of support {{and whether or not}} the applicants should be assigned to the workhouse.|$|E

5|$|Elihu Root, Austen Chamberlain, Charles G. Dawes, Frank B. Kellogg, and Norman Angell {{were all}} awarded their {{respective}} Prizes one year late because the Committee decided {{that none of}} the nominations in the year in which they are listed as being awarded the Prize met the criteria in Nobel's will; per its rules the Committee delayed the awarding of the Prizes <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year, although they were awarded as the previous year's Prize.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> general election.|$|E
5|$|Fox started {{displaying}} {{symptoms of}} early-onset Parkinson's disease in 1991 while shooting the movie Doc Hollywood, {{although he was}} not properly diagnosed <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year. After his diagnosis, Fox started drinking heavily. He sought help and stopped drinking altogether. In 1998, {{he decided to go}} public with his condition, and since then, he has been a strong advocate of Parkinson's disease research. His foundation, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, was created to help advance every promising research path to curing Parkinson's disease, including embryonic stem cell studies.|$|E

5|$|Humphrey {{moved to}} his new home with an elderly couple in {{suburban}} London on 13 November 1997, though his retirement was not announced <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day {{to reduce the risk}} of kidnap attempts. The Conservatives were quick to point out that Humphrey lived happily at Number 10 for almost eight years under a Conservative government but moved out within six months of Labour taking power.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Breathitt was one {{of several}} {{candidates}} put before the General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate. He received 66 of 137 votes, 3 votes short of a majority. Other unsuccessful nominees included John J. Crittenden (68 votes), Richard Mentor Johnson (64 votes), and Charles A. Wickliffe (49 votes). After 15 ballots, the Assembly still had not chosen a nominee, and postponed the matter <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> session. At that session, Henry Clay was chosen to fill the seat.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin {{was removed}} and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was {{extended}} to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. By the middle of 1960, the US131 was opened {{as far south as}} Martin; the section of M-118 between the new freeway and the old routing was used as a connector <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> section south to Plainwell opened the next year. After this next freeway segment was opened, M-118 was truncated to end at the freeway.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, {{this time}} for {{allowing}} games to be called early because of weather and treating them as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end like in that manner. He suggested that NPB could have easily suspended the game and resumed where it left off {{the next day or}} even postponed the game entirely <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the extreme}} south, the six border battalions in the {{province}} of Limburg only slightly delayed the advance of the German Sixth Army; before noon the area had been overrun and the strategic city of Maastricht had surrendered, opening the way for the German feint offensive into Central Belgium. The Germans however, failed to capture the main bridge intact, forcing them to delay the crossing by the 4th Panzer Division <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6's {{propulsion}} system experienced a serious malfunction {{during the second}} crew residency in 1978 and was not usable again {{for the remainder of}} the station's lifespan. As a consequence, it was limited to firing its attitude control thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew residency ended, it was necessary for Progress and TKS spacecraft to boost the station into a high orbit so it wouldn't decay <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> residency began.|$|E

5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> time the car is switched on.|$|E
