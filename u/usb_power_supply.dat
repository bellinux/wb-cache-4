40|$|Abstract—A {{monolithic}} and self-referenced {{radio frequency}} (RF) LC clock generator that is compliant with USB 2. 0 is demonstrated in a system-on-chip (SoC). This work presents {{the first successful}} approach to replacing an external crystal (XTAL), the crystal oscillator (XO) and the phase-locked loop for clock generation in an IC supporting USB 2. 0 using a standard CMOS fabrication process. It is shown that the primary design challenges with the implemented approach involve maintaining high frequency accuracy and low jitter. Techniques for addressing both are shown. In particular, the presented architecture exploits the effects of frequency division and low far-from-carrier phase noise to achieve low jitter. From a 1. 536 GHz temperature-compensated LC reference oscillator, coherent clock signals are derived at 96 MHz for the SoC logic and 12 MHz for an on-chip full-speed USB PHY. Though self-referenced, approximately 400 ppm total frequency accuracy is achieved over process variations, 10 % variation in the <b>USB</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> voltage and temperature variation from 10 to C 85 C. Measured period and cycle-to-cycle jitter are 6. 78 ps �� � and 8. 96 ps �� �, respectively. Fabricated in a 0. 35 m CMOS technology, the clock generator occupies 0. 22 mm P and draws 9. 5 mA from a 3. 3 -V supply, which {{is derived from the}} 5 -V <b>USB</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Index Terms—Analog integrated circuits, clocks, CMOSFET oscillators, frequency synthesizers, jitter, oscillator noise, oscillator stability, oscillators, phase-locked loops, phase noise, timing jitter.

40|$|Two {{complementary}} wireless sensor nodes {{for building}} two-tiered heterogeneous networks are presented. A larger node with a 25 mm by 25 mm size {{acts as the}} backbone of the network, and can handle complex data processing. A smaller, cheaper node with a 10 mm by 10 mm size can perform simpler sensor-interfacing tasks. The 25 mm node is based on previous work that has been done in the Tyndall National Institute that created a modular wireless sensor node. In this work, a new 25 mm module is developed operating in the 433 / 868 MHz frequency bands, with a range of 3. 8 km. The 10 mm node is highly miniaturised, while retaining a high level of modularity. It has been designed to support very energy efficient operation for applications with low duty cycles, with a sleep current of 3. 3 μA. Both nodes use commercially available components and have low manufacturing costs to allow the construction of large networks. In addition, interface boards for communicating with nodes have been developed for both the 25 mm and 10 mm nodes.
