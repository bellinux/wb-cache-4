40|$|The declining {{economic}} position {{over the}} past two decades of those workers with less skill increases the importance of the unemployment insurance (<b>UI)</b> <b>system</b> in providing a safety net during periods of unemployment. Recent welfare reform legislation, designed to encourage labor market entry of typically very low-skilled workers who are likely to have unstable work patterns at best, potentially makes the <b>UI</b> <b>system</b> an even more critical component of the safety net. This paper seeks to determine how less-skilled workers typically fare in the <b>UI</b> <b>system,</b> estimating their likelihood of becoming eligible for and collecting benefits. We find that many workers who separate from a job, and particularly those with lower levels of skill, will not be compensated by the <b>UI</b> <b>system.</b> Although minimum earnings requirements keep some less-skilled job losers from receiving UI, it is the provision mandating that separations be involuntary' that prevents most workers from gaining UI eligibility. These findings suggest that the <b>UI</b> <b>system</b> will provide little additional support to the safety net following welfare reform. ...|$|E

We compare two types of existing <b>UI</b> <b>systems.</b> When <b>UI</b> is organized at trade union level (decentralized Ghent UI), trade unions strategically lower the benefit levels of their UI schemes to deter welfare recipients from other unions from entering their UI scheme, leading to a race to the bottom in UI provision. With centralized provision of UI, by contrast, trade unions do not fully account for the cost of higher wages as mobility allows them to partially shift the burden of unemployment to other <b>UIs.</b> A <b>system</b> of coordinated <b>UI,</b> combining a centrally set benefit level with decentralized funding as in Ghent <b>UI</b> <b>systems,</b> can circumvent both the strategic benefit setting and the fiscal externality problems, thus reconciling the equity and efficiency aims in the design of unemployment insurance...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine whether the {{requirements}} that workers must satisfy {{to qualify for}} unemployment insurance (UI) benefits in any succeeding period of joblessness affect the duration of employment spells. This behavioral consequence of a <b>UI</b> <b>system</b> has been neglected in empirical research, which has instead focused {{on the effects of}} UI parameters on the actions of the unemployed. The effect is identified by a unique change in the eligibility requirements of the Canadian <b>UI</b> <b>system</b> in 1990, which increased the weeks of employment required to establish UI eligibility.

For this purpose, I develop a dynamic stochastic model of joint return migration and saving decisions {{that accounts for}} uncertainty in future employment and income and estimate this model using a longitudinal data set on immigrants from five different source countries. I find that allowing for the endogeneity of the return decision makes a substantial difference in the net gain of the PI and <b>UI</b> <b>systems</b> from immigrants. Exogenous return migration – {{which has been the}} practice of the literature so far – underestimates the net gain for almost all demographic groups and the amount of underestimation is remarkable for several demographic groups. In addition, age-at-arrival profiles of net contributions of immigrants – which form the basis of suggestions on selective immigration policies in the literature – are rotated significantly. Finally, a counterfactual policy experiment in which cash bonuses are provided conditional on return to unemployed immigrants turns out be ineffective in terms of reducing the burden on the state coffers for most demographic groups. immigrant workers, life cycle models, saving, social security, public pensions, unemployment insurance, public policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} analyzing the relation of unemployment insurance to unemployment and applies the framework to evaluate recent developments in the UI literature and future research needs. Unemployment is decomposed into more basic elements related to the labor market flows which determine unemployment incidence and duration. It is also disaggregated by reason for unemployment [...] e. g., entry into the labor force or quit last job. A matrix containing those definitional elements of unemployment which are potentially affected by the <b>UI</b> <b>system</b> forms the basis for organizing the discussion. Each component of unemployment which may be affected by variations in characteristics of the <b>UI</b> <b>system</b> is considered in turn. The discussion {{of each of these}} elements focuses on recent theoretical arid empirical studies which analyze how they are influenced by features of the <b>UI</b> <b>system.</b> By proceeding systematically through the elements which comprise unemployment and considering the major behavioral explanations linking the unemployment insurance system to unemployment, it is possible to determine where the analysis has proceeded satisfactorily and where major gaps remain. ...|$|E

40|$|By {{simulating}} {{the working}} of the unemployment insurance savings accounts (UISAs) in Slovenia using a methodology similar to Feldstein and Altman (1998), the paper examines two questions: how viable is this system {{as an alternative}} to traditional unemployment insurance (<b>UI)</b> <b>system,</b> and how the redistribution of income changes if the <b>UI</b> <b>system</b> is replaced by UISAs. The simulations are performed on a representative sample of labor force participants, for which lifetime labor market histories are generated from administrative panel data. Simulations show that the UISA system is a viable alternative to a modest <b>UI</b> <b>system,</b> but that its viability is jeopardized under generous benefits. Under the modest regime (here identified with a post- 1998 period, the period after the UI reform which strongly reduced the maximum potential duration of benefit, for most workers even by half) our calculations show that only one quarter of workers end their working life with negative cumulative balance and 43 percent ever experience a negative UISA balance; in contrast, under the generous regime (here identified with the pre- 1998 -reform period), 49 percent of workers end their working life with negative cumulative balance and 66 percent ever experience a negative balance. Moreover, under the modest benefit regime workers are better able to recover positive UISA balance. The simulations also show that the level of redistribution under the UISAs lags substantially behind the <b>UI</b> <b>system,</b> even though the version of the UISAs studied permits borrowing and hence allows for redistribution. unemployment insurance, unemployment insurance savings accounts...|$|E
