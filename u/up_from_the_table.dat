25|$|Despite {{its modern}} conveniences, one problem on Pentowna was vibration. One account even {{says that it}} was so bad that ketchup from {{uncapped}} bottles would shoot <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> in the small dining room. Because of these deficiencies and because new highways and modes of transportation meant fewer passengers, Pentowna was converted into a cargo tug in 1937. The job was given to North Vancouver Shipyards Ltd., who installed a new steel deck and towing machinery and stripped off Pentowna's upper structures. The galley was moved to the top deck and the life boats were raised. After a two-month layover, Pentowna went back into service as a freight ship.|$|E
