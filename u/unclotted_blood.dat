50|$|DIC {{results in}} {{depletion}} of the body's clotting resources, {{so that it can}} no longer control bleeding. Consequently, the <b>unclotted</b> <b>blood</b> bleeds into the skin and other organs, leading to red or black patchy rash and to hematemesis (vomiting blood) or hemoptysis (spitting blood). The rash may cause bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites, usually red, sometimes white in the center.|$|E
50|$|After {{the death}} of Alexis is reported, Henry returns to Wilvercombe to monitor the {{investigation}} while he is ostensibly comforting his mother after her loss. He is by all appearances a simple, brutish and loutish man, but Wimsey and Harriet both eventually realise that Weldon is not a fool but a dangerous and cunning criminal who has been living under two different identities. Wimsey and Harriet ultimately break the case when they realise that Alexis had suffered from haemophilia, explaining the still-liquid and <b>unclotted</b> <b>blood</b> when Harriet had discovered the body even if is hours after the death is eventually pinpointed to have taken place. The time of death and explanation {{for the state of}} the blood, which had originally misled the entire investigation into confusion over the time of death, eventually helps to unmask Henry and the conspirators, who are undone by their attempts to reshuffle their alibis to match the shifting assumptions about the time of death.|$|E

25|$|Pseudohyperkalemia {{occurs when}} the {{measured}} potassium levels is falsely elevated. This condition is usually suspected when patient is clinically well without any ECG changes. Mechanical trauma during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysed blood sample. Since exercise can cause elevated potassium levels, repeated fist clenching can cause transient rise in potassium levels. Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may only become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. On the other hand, processing of heparinised, <b>unclot</b> <b>blood</b> does not cause falsely elevated potassium. In addition to that, high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases red blood cells fragility, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because formation of clot protect the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia may also be present, and is characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.|$|R
30|$|Intracerebral {{hemorrhage}} {{remains the}} least treatable form of stroke (Rincon & Mayer 2008). ICH models {{serve as an}} important tool for understanding mechanisms underlying brain injury after an intracerebral bleed (Andaluz et al. 2002). Based on previously published studies of an ICH model (Andaluz et al. 2002; Frantzias et al. 2011), we successfully generated a rabbit model of ICH by stereotactic injection of 0.3  ml non-anticoagulant autologous arterial blood into the basal ganglia. The volume of the rabbit`s brain is approximately 1 percent {{of the human brain}} (Narushima et al. 2003), so this injection is approximately equivalent to about 30  ml of hematoma in the human brain. In the present study, an ICH model was induced successfully in 33 rabbits out of 36 ones. Three rabbits were excluded from the study as {{there is no evidence of}} hematoma formation. For experimental purposes, the most common technique of producing an intracerebral hematoma in rabbits is the injection of <b>unclotted</b> autologous <b>blood.</b> Sometimes,the injected blood may ruptures into the ventricular system or it extends to the subarachnoid or subdural space (Deinsberger et al. 1996). Therefore, a CT scan was performed after successful ICH injection 3  hours later. If postoperative brain CT does not show an oval or round hyperdensity in the basal ganglia,we do not consider that there is a hematoma formation.|$|R
40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{the most}} {{commonly}} associated cause of antibiotic associated disease (AAD), which caused ~ 21, 000 cases of AAD in 2011 in the U. K. alone. The golden Syrian hamster model of CDI is an acute model displaying many of the clinical features of C. difficile disease. Using this model we characterised three clinical strains of C. difficile, all differing in toxinotype; CD 1342 (PaLoc negative), M 68 (toxinotype VIII) and BI- 7 (toxinotype III). The naturally occurring non-toxic strain colonised all hamsters within 1 -day post challenge (d. p. c.) with high-levels of spores being shed in the faeces of animals that appeared well throughout the entire experiment. However, some changes including increased neutrophil influx and <b>unclotted</b> red <b>blood</b> cells were observed at early time points {{despite the fact that}} the known C. difficile toxins (TcdA, TcdB and CDT) are absent from the genome. In contrast, hamsters challenged with strain M 68 resulted in a 45 % mortality rate, with those that survived challenge remaining highly colonised. It is currently unclear why some hamsters survive infection, as bacterial and toxin levels and histology scores were similar to those culled at a similar time-point. Hamsters challenged with strain BI- 7 resulted in a rapid fatal infection in 100 % of the hamsters approximately 26 hr post challenge. Severe caecal pathology, including transmural neutrophil infiltrates and extensive submucosal damage correlated with high levels of toxin measured in gut filtrates ex vivo. These data describes the infection kinetics and disease outcomes of 3 clinical C. difficile isolates differing in toxin carriage and provides additional insights to the role of each toxin in disease progression...|$|R

40|$|A {{photometric}} method {{was used to}} measure the bactericidal kinetics for Brucella abortus of freshly drawn rabbit blood during the time before clotting. This antibrucellar activity varied between rabbits in different immunologic states. Nonimmunized rabbits had moderate bactericidal activity after a lag of about 2 min. The blood of some immunized rabbits gave an immediate and strong kill, but in certain other immunized rabbits, especially when hyperimmunized, the bactericidal activity was inhibited. It appeared that serum bactericidins and complement are sometimes as active in <b>unclotted</b> <b>blood</b> as they are in serum. However, this bactericidal activity can be either increased or neutralized by immunization. The prozone bactericidal inhibition phenomenon (Neisser-Wechsberg) found in immune serum may, in fact, reflect inhibition taking place in vivo.

Of the 51 collected samples, 18 (35 %) were positive to an indirect ELISA and 33 (64 %) resulted positive to a BTV ELISA antigen. From a strong antigen-positive blood sample, a BTV was isolated (named as PTG- 13) on cell culture and was subsequently confirmed as BTV‑ 1 by RT‑PCR and partial sequencing of genome segment- 2. The goat serum samples were found to contain high titer of neutralising antibodies against BTV- 23, nonetheless the virus could not be isolated. Interestingly, no neutralizing antibodies were detected against PTG- 13 or other BTV- 1 isolate, which suggests that sampling was probably done before the development of neutralizing antibodies against PTG- 13 virus in the host. Isolation of BTV- 1 (PTG- 13) and presence of BTV- 23 neutralizing antibodies in serum samples indicate that goats were probably infected with BTV- 1 and 23 in different periods...|$|E
