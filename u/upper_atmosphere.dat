5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E

40|$|Results {{obtained}} {{over the}} last 21 years from satellite measurements of the neutral <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of Venus and Mars are discussed. Particular attention {{is given to the}} chemistry of the neutral <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of the two planets, the exospheric temperatures, and the sensitivity of their atmospheric temperatures to solar activity. Various theoretical models used to interpret the planetary atmospheric data are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the physical and chemical processes which produce the tenuous planetary and planetary satellite (<b>upper)</b> <b>atmospheres</b> through interactions with their particle, field, and radiation environs, it is necessary to analyze remotely observed and spacecraft data with physically meaningful models. With this in mind, we have undertaken a coupled program of theoretical modeling and complementary data analysis regarding the global distributions of neutral and ionized gases in, and escape from, tenuous planetary atmospheres of Io and Europa. The theoretical models developed will have further applications to other tenuous atmospheres such as that of Pluto and Titan or the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of the terrestrial planets...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly {{the same as that of}} the Earth, making its <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, b's <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> was {{observed}} transiting the star; so its inclination is about 85 degrees, coplanar with 55 Cancri e. This helped to constrain {{the mass of}} the planet but the inclination was too low to constrain its radius.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{can form}} only under very {{restricted}} conditions during local summer; their occurrence {{can be used}} as a sensitive guide to changes in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> They are a relatively recent classification. The occurrence of noctilucent clouds appears to be increasing in frequency, brightness and extent.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Pelz joined NASA, {{working at}} the Goddard Space Flight Center doing {{research}} on the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> {{of the earth and}} other planets in the solar system.

50|$|There {{have also}} been {{proposals}} to place robotic aerostats in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of the Solar System's gas giant planets for exploration and possibly mining of helium-3, which could {{have a very high}} value per unit mass as a thermonuclear fuel.|$|R
40|$|Some recent {{results on}} {{planetary}} <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> obtained {{by means of}} orbiting ultraviolet observatories are reviewed with emphasis on Jupiter and Io torus. Consideration is given to long-term variation in Jovian Ly alpha emission, UV polar auroras on Jupiter, and UV emission from the Io torus.

40|$|The paper reviews current {{knowledge}} {{of the characteristics of}} atmospheres surrounding the terrestrial planets; attention is given to composition, temperature, characteristics of the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> and meteorology. In addition, the long-term history of the atmospheres is discussed, along with some of the major climatic changes that have occurred. Finally, consideration is given to future efforts that will enhance the understanding of these subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} exoplanets {{is arguably the}} most {{exciting}} and fastest-growing field in astrophysics. Given the youth of exoplanet science, the field is strongly driven by observations. Here we summarise current knowledge of the atmospheres and wider environments of the known exoplanets giving particular emphasis on the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and the surrounding environment, rather than on the deeper atmospheric layers...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{activity}} on cool stars expresses {{itself in a}} bewildering variety of radiative and particle output originating from magnetic regions between the photosphere and the corona. Given its origin in evolving magnetic fields, most of this output is variable in time. Radiation in the ultraviolet, the extreme ultraviolet, and the X-ray ranges are important for heating and ionizing <b>upper</b> planetary <b>atmospheres</b> and thus driving atmospheric evaporation. Additionally, stellar winds interact with the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and may lead to further erosion. The stellar high-energy output is therefore a prime factor in determining habitability of planets. We summarize our knowledge of magnetic activity in young solar analogs and lower-mass stars and show how the stellar output changes on evolutionary timescale...|$|R
5|$|The {{hydrocarbons}} {{are thought}} to form in Titan's <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun's ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan spends 95% of its time within Saturn's magnetosphere, which may help shield it from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 {{found that}} about {{seven percent of}} the volume of Saturn's <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is hydrogen. Since Saturn's {{internal}} helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500m/s (1,100mph). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{its high}} mass, Gliese 876 c {{is likely to}} be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since it was {{detected}} indirectly through its gravitational effects on the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the planet is predicted to have a cloudless <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|E
40|$|The structure, composition, {{dynamics}} and energy balance of planetary <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> through interpretation of steller occultation data from Uranus is discussed. The wave-optical problem of modelling strong scintillation for arbitrary turbulent atmospheres is studied, {{as well as}} influence of turbulence. It was concluded that quasi-global features of atmospheric structure are accurately determined by numerical inversion. Horizontally inhomogeneous structures are filtered out and have little effect on temperature profiles...|$|R
50|$|On Titan, Saturn's largest natural satellite, {{infrequent}} methane rain {{is thought}} to carve the moon's numerous surface channels. On Venus, sulfuric acid virga evaporates 25 km from the surface. There {{is likely to be}} rain of various compositions in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of the gas giants, as well as precipitation of liquid neon in the deep atmospheres. Extrasolar planet OGLE-TR-56b in the constellation Sagittarius is hypothesized to have iron rain.|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} high spatial resolution, stellar occultations have proven {{extremely}} effective for learning about planetary <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> asteroids, and planetary rings. The occultation program at MIT involves the following: (1) identifying the scientific questions that can be answered by occultation events; (2) predicting the zone of visibility for the useful events; (3) maintaining and improving a high speed CCD camera for observing occultations; (4) obtaining the observations; and (5) reducing the data and interpreting the results...|$|R
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds. A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water vapour in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Methane concentrations {{have more than doubled}} in the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, the {{concentration}} of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes. In the Earth's heterosphere, {{a part of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.|$|E
5|$|November is {{traditionally}} {{the start of}} the thunderstorm season along the eastern seaboard of Australia, with a rise in average humidity and warmer ground temperatures combining with more frequent occurrences of cool air in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> These conditions are conducive for producing severe thunderstorms, particularly those which feature hail.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as Hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Planets with hot lower atmospheres could result in humid <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> that accelerate the loss of hydrogen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Because {{the solar}} {{radiation}} and particle environment {{plays a major}} role in all atmospheric processes like ionization, dissociation, the heating of the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> and thermal and non-thermal atmospheric loss processes, the long-time evolution of planetary atmospheres and their water inventories can only be understood within the context of the evolving Sun. We compare the effect of solar induced X-ray and EUV (XUV) heating on the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of Earth, Venus and Mars since the time when the Sun arrived to the Zero-Age-Main-Sequence (ZAMS) about 4. 6 Gyr ago. We apply a diffusive-gravitational equilibrium and thermal balance model for studying heating of the early thermospheres by pho-todissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by IR-radiating molecules like CO 2, NO, OH, etc. Our model simulations result in extended thermospheres for early Earth, Venus and Mars. Besides, our results for early Venus indicate high exospheric temperatures of more than 8000 K during the active phase of the young Sun even if we assume a dry CO 2 -rich atmosphere with a composition similar to that observed today, and about 1000...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to {{observations of the}} ultraviolet deficiencies shown {{by all of the}} outer planets and Titan, models have been proposed to explain the low albedos in terms of absorption by particles in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of these objects. These particles are generally believed to be photochemically formed from gases in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> primarily methane and hydrogen. Such processes may also be operative on Titan. Results of some laboratory experiments on proton irradiation of mixtures of gases including CH 4, H 2, and NH 3 have shown that liquid and solid materials are produced that are strong ultraviolet absorbers. However, the material produced from the CH 4 + H 2 mixture was colorless, indicating that species containing elements other than carbon and hydrogen are necessary for the production of color. Two such elements are nitrogen (as NH 3 or N 2) and sulfur (as H 2 S); colored materials have been produced from such mixtures. None of these materials has spectral properties identical to those shown by the planets. Therefore it is necessary that mixtures (and/or cloud layers) of the photochemical materials be present...|$|R
5|$|On 6 June 2013, {{scientists}} at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of Titan, a possible precursor for life. On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.|$|E
5|$|That transit is so tangential, that {{properties}} {{such as its}} radius, density, {{and temperature}} are unknown. Assuming a composition {{similar to that of}} Jupiter and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, 55 Cancri b's <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is predicted to be cloudless with a spectrum dominated by alkali metal absorption.|$|E
5|$|The Showa Station is Japan's main {{research}} station in Antarctica. A {{vast array of}} research is conducted there, including <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> physics, meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy/mapping, oceanography, glaciology, geology, marine and terrestrial biology, and medical research. Japan's other station, Dome Fuji Station was opened {{as part of a}} major ice-coring project. It mainly studies climate change and conducts deep drilling and atmospheric observations.|$|E
40|$|The solar UV (UltraViolet) flux, {{especially}} the EUV (Extreme UltraViolet) and FUV (Far UltraViolet) components, {{is one of}} the main energetic inputs for planetary <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> It drives various processes such as ionization, or dissociation which give rise to upper atmospheric emissions, especially in the UV and visible. These emissions are one of the main ways to investigate the <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of planets. However, the uncertainties in the flux measurement or modeling can lead to biased estimates of fundamental atmospheric parameters, such as concentrations or temperatures in the atmospheres. We explore the various problems that can be identified regarding the uncertainties in solar/stellar UV flux by considering three examples. The worst case appears when the solar reflection component is dominant in the recorded spectrum as is seen for outer solar system measurements from HST (Hubble Space Telescope). We also show that the estimation of some particular line parameters (intensity and shape), especially Lyman α, is crucial, and that both total intensity and line profile are useful. In the case of exoplanets, the problem is quite critical since the UV flux of their parent stars is often very poorly known...|$|R

Attention is given to spectral lines with hyperfine structure, which are indicative of nuclear spin processes. The method employed involves summations over Zeeman components, allowing an evaluation of polarization through the addition of underlying simple resonant and fluorescent scattering channels...|$|R
