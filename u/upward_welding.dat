40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of shielding gases and welding positions on properties of duplex and superduplex stainless steel circumferential pipe welds. Corrosion resistance, microstructural features and weld defects were assessed and related to the welding procedures. Horizontal and vertical <b>upward</b> <b>welding</b> positions produced high quality welds. However, welding in the overhead position resulted in less good results in terms of porosity and corrosion resistance. Shielding gases containing 30 % helium showed best results, whilst using a mixture Ar+ 2 %CO 2 resulted in undercuts and porosity in all welding positions...|$|E
40|$|Wheeler Geologic Monument (Half Moon Pass quadrangle) {{provides}} exceptional exposures {{of three}} outflow tuff sheets erupted from the San Luis caldera complex. Lowest sheet is Rat Creek Tuff, which is nonwelded throughout but grades upward from light-tan rhyolite (~ 74 % SiO 2) into pale brown dacite (~ 66 % SiO 2) that contains sparse dark-brown andesitic scoria. Distinctive hornblende-rich middle Cebolla Creek Tuff contains basal surge beds, overlain by vitrophyre of uniform mafic dacite that becomes less <b>welded</b> <b>upward.</b> Uppermost Nelson Mountain Tuff consists of nonwelded to weakly welded, crystal-poor rhyolite, which grades upward to a densely welded caprock of crystal-rich dacite (~ 68 % SiO 2).

40|$|A welded {{pyroclastic}} deposit {{has been identified}} in the Rhyolite of Calico Hills near Yucca Mountain, Nevada, where only lava flows and nonwelded {{pyroclastic deposit}}s were previously described. Field data from Fortymile Wash show that nonwelded, bedded tuff grades <b>upward</b> into partially <b>welded</b> massive ruff, and thence into densely welded vitrophyre. Petrographic data show a progressive decrease in inter- and intragranular porosity and amount of vapor-phase minerals, with increasing welding. Pumice fragments are first deformed, then develop diffuse boundaries which become increasingly obscure with progressive welding. The most densely welded rock is a perlitic vitrophyre. The origin of this welded tuff is not clear, as it could represent an ignimbrite or a tuff fused beneath a thick lava flow...|$|R
