40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} which describes the mechanisms involved in concrete pressures on formwork in wide sections. The main {{value of the}} theory is in providing a framework for analysing site data and indicating areas in which potential economies in design might be made. The horizontal pressure of concrete on formwork comprises two components whose magnitude depends -on {{the proportion of the}} vertical load taken by the particle structure and the pore water pressure. In normal formwork, the pore water pressure provides the major contribution to the maximum horizontal pressure and therefore any factor which increases the rate of load transfer from the pore water pressure onto the particle structure, will decrease the maximum pressure. For example, porous formwork will give lower horizontal pressures than impermeable formwork and the re-analysis of existing site data supports this prediction. Normal internal vibration does not have such a significant' affect on the maximum horizontal pressure as previously reported, but it can fluidify concrete to the depth of poker immersion. The elements of the theory are supported by an experimental programme, re-analysis of existing site data and new site measurements. These site measurements have shown that during <b>underwater</b> <b>concreting</b> a rapidly falling tide can cause the horizontal pressure to exceed the vertical pressure...|$|R

The customhouse at Pearl River which was ten miles inland {{at the small}} town of Pearlington, Mississippi was later changed, but in 1904 the district reported a total of 358 vessels and 19,869 tons. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has undertaken three significant navigation projects in the Pearl River Basin. In 1880, Congress authorized a 5 ft navigation channel on the West Pearl River from Jackson to the Rigolets. That project was discontinued in 1922. Beginning in 1910, a channel was dredged {{from the mouth of the}} East Pearl River into Lake Borgne, a project which is maintained on an irregular basis. In 1935, the West Pearl River Navigation Project was authorized. It provided for a navigation channel from Bogalusa to the mouth of the West Pearl River. The project includes a canal with three locks. The Corps of Engineers placed the project in [...] "caretaker" [...] status in the 1970s because of a decline in commercial traffic. Maintenance dredging resumed in December 1988. In the 1950s, <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete</b> sills were constructed to help maintain water levels in the navigation channel. This has prevented Gulf sturgeon and other migratory species from accessing upstream areas. A rock ramp constructed in 2003 helps fish navigate over one of the sills, but environmental groups propose further work to mitigate the effects of the navigation project.|$|E

A {{large number}} of non-dispersible <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete</b> {{materials}} will be extensively used in works which span over rivers and sea, so {{it is important to}} study the performance of non-dispersible under water concrete structures. Non-dispersible <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete</b> is the concrete mixing with special additives-anti-washout admixture, which is a kind of water-soluble polymers with long-chain structure and strong absorption capacity. In the present paper, the axial and eccentric compression performance of non-dispersible <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete</b> columns were experimentally investigated.

40|$|Structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete</b> {{are widely}} {{applied in the}} {{construction}} of tunnels, parking garages, rail- and road construction. Over the years many problems have been reported with aquiferous crack formation in structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete.</b> Aquiferous trough crack formation threatens the durability of structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete.</b> Through cracks can be the result of restrained deformation. Temperature- and shrinkage strains that are restrained, cause stresses in the structural slabs. Stresses from restrained deformation can cause through crack formation. During the hardening process and due to climate influences, the structural slab is affected by temperature- and shrinkage loads and cracks can form. In the design of structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete,</b> much attention was given to the calculation of stresses and calculation of reinforcement, but still aquiferous crack formation cannot be prevented. Over the years many discussion on the effect of an intermediate layer of sand between the structural slab and the <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete</b> has taken place amongst experts. Nowadays two sides exist; one in favour and the other against an intermediate layer of sand. Both sides are convinced that their alternative outperforms the other. No theoretical bases, but many uncertainties, exist about the magnitude of the stresses in structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete.</b> This research aims to create more insight in the stresses in hardened concrete that cause the forming of cracks in structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete.</b> The results should be used to develop a practical advice for handling of the problem of crack formation in structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete.</b> To obtain the goals of the research first {{the current state of the}} technology is examined in a literature study. To determine the magnitude of the stresses and to analyze the influence factors on the stresses a Finite Element model has been developed. The results of these models were used to come to a practical advice. A thermal model was built to calculate temperature loads. Based on long term temperature measurements in a structural slab on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete,</b> the model has been calibrated. Temperature loads on any given structural slab on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete</b> can now be calculated accurately. The temperature load in structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete</b> can vary between 3 °C and 17 °C. The largest influence factor on temperature load is the month of casting. The geometry of the structure can also have significant influence on the temperature load. A 3 -D Finite Element structural model was designed to research the influence factors on restraint. This has gained more insight in the influence factor on the degree of restraint and the shear forces in the piles. It is now possible to calculate the degree of restraint of any structural variant of structural slabs on <b>underwater</b> <b>concrete.</b> The degree of restraint varies between 15...|$|E
