40|$|Abstract Background Whereas ultra-short stay (day care or 24 hour hospitalisation) {{following}} {{breast cancer}} surgery {{was introduced in}} the US and Canada in the 1990 s, it is not yet common practice in Europe. This paper describes the design of the MaDO study, which involves the implementation of <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> stay admission for patients after breast cancer surgery, and evaluates whether the targets of the implementation strategy are reached. The <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> stay programme and the applied implementation strategy will be evaluated from the economic perspective. Methods/design The MaDO study is a pre-post-controlled multi-centre study, that is performed in four hospitals in the Netherlands. It includes a pre and post measuring period of six months each with six months of implementation in between in at least 40 patients per hospital per measurement period. Primary outcome measure is the percentage of patients treated in <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> stay. Secondary endpoints are the percentage of patients treated according to protocol, degree of involvement of home care nursing, quality of care from the patient's perspective, cost-effectiveness of the <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> stay programme and cost-effectiveness of the implementation strategy. Quality of care will be measured by the QUOTE-breast cancer instrument, cost-effectiveness of the <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> stay programme will be measured by means of the EuroQol (administered at four time-points) and a cost book for patients. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness of the implementation strategy will be measured by determination of the costs of implementation activities. Discussion This study will reveal barriers and facilitators for implementation of the <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> stay programme. Moreover, {{the results of the study}} will provide information about the cost-effectiveness of the <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> stay programme and the implementation strategy.

In this paper, a kind of intelligent <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> feedback endocrine controller is designed, {{which is based on}} the mechanism of hormone secretion regulation, and is applied to the control of DC motor. The endocrine controller includes the traditional control unit, the <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> feedback unit and so on. First the control signal of the endocrine controller is operated by the traditional control unit. Then the control signal is processed by the <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> feedback unit according to the regulation of hormone. In the end, the output signal of the <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> feedback unit and the output signal of the traditional control unit are combined and output, thus a nonlinear control algorithm is formed. The new control algorithm is applied to the DC servo motor model and the three- level water tank model. This paper conducts a simulation comparison through programming.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{short term}} forecast of <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> AR(1) sequences (4 to 6 terms only) {{with a single}} structural break at an unknown time and of unknown sign and magnitude. As prediction of autoregressive processes requires estimated coefficients, the efficiency of which relies on the large sample properties of the estimator, {{it is a common}} perception that prediction is practically impossible for such short series with structural break. However, we obtain a heuristic result that some universal predictors represented in the frequency domain allow certain predictability based on these <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> sequences. The predictors that we use are universal in a sense that they are not oriented on particular types of autoregressions and do not require explicit modelling of structural break. The shorter the sequence, the better the one-step-ahead forecast performance of the smoothed predicting kernel. If the structural break entails a model parameter switch from negative to positive value, the forecast performance of the smoothed predicting kernel is better than that of the linear predictor that utilize AR(1) coefficient estimated from the <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> sequence without taking the structural break into account regardless whether the innovation terms in the learning sequences are constructed from independent and identically distributed random Gaussian or Gamma variables, scaled pseudo-uniform variables, or first-order auto-correlated Gaussian process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Screening {{instruments}} for mental disorders {{need to be}} short, engaging, and valid. Current screening instruments are usually questionnaire-based and may be opaque to the user. A prototype approach where individuals identify {{with a description of}} an individual with typical symptoms of depression, anxiety, social phobia or panic may be a shorter, faster and more acceptable method for screening. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the accuracy of four new prototype screeners for predicting depression and anxiety disorders and to compare their performance with existing scales. Methods Short and ultra-short prototypes were developed for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder (PD) and Social Phobia (SP). Prototypes were compared to typical short and ultra-short self-report screening scales, such as the Centre for Epidemiology Scale, CES-D and the GAD- 7, and their short forms. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) version 6 1 was used as the gold standard for obtaining clinical criteria through a telephone interview. From a population sample, 225 individuals who endorsed a prototype and 101 who did not were administered the MINI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the <b>short</b> and <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> prototypes and for the <b>short</b> and <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> screening scales. Results The study found that the rates of endorsement of the prototypes were commensurate with prevalence estimates. The short-form and <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> scales outperformed the <b>short</b> and <b>ultra</b> <b>short</b> prototypes for every disorder except GAD, where the GAD prototype outperformed the GAD 7. Conclusions The findings suggest that people may be able to self-identify generalised anxiety more accurately than depression based on a description of a prototypical case. However, levels of identification were lower than expected. Considerable benefits from this method of screening may ensue if our prototypes can be improved for Major Depressive Disorder, Social Phobia and Panic Disorder. </p...|$|R
