5|$|The two Crex crakes are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} with other rails, since most sympatric short-billed rails are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. The European water rail and the African rail have long pointed bills.|$|E

5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{problems}} of listing maximal cliques or finding maximum cliques are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fixed-parameter tractable with the parameter , they may be fixed-parameter tractable for other parameters of instance complexity. For instance, both problems {{are known to be}} fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by the degeneracy of the input graph.|$|E
5|$|As Leighton was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dislodged, Ferguson {{promised to}} find Gunn another club, and {{fulfilled}} his pledge when he sold him for £100,000 to Norwich City in October 1986. The transfer nearly went {{through in the}} summer of 1986, but Ferguson delayed the move until October to allow time for Leighton to recover from an injury.|$|E

5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enlightening.|$|E
5|$|Excavations on Glastonbury Tor, {{undertaken}} {{by a team}} led by Philip Rahtz between 1964 and 1966, revealed evidence of Dark Age occupation during the 5th to 7th centuries around the later medieval church of St. Michael. Finds included postholes, two hearths including a metalworker's forge, two burials oriented north-south (thus <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Christian), fragments of 6th century Mediterranean amphorae (vases for wine or cooking oil), and a worn hollow bronze head which may have topped a Saxon staff.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{research}} in parallel algorithms {{has studied the}} problem of finding a maximal clique. In particular, the problem of finding the lexicographically first maximal clique (the one found by the algorithm above) {{has been shown to}} be complete for the class of polynomial-time functions. This result implies that the problem is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solvable within the parallel complexity class NC.|$|E
50|$|The Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis {{catalogue}} {{includes a}} fifth suite, BWV 1070 in G minor. However, this work <b>is</b> highly <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> composed by J. S. Bach.|$|R

5|$|Mycena nargan {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance, and is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{mistaken for}} other Mycenas.

Fuhrer's 2005 book A Field Guide to Australian Fungi was labelled as Mycena nivalis, a species with a white cap.|$|E
5|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors holds a {{score of}} 82/100 at the review {{aggregator}} Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. It was a commercial failure in Japan, with 27,762 copies sold in 2009 and an additional 11,891 in 2010, reaching a total of 39,653 copies sold. Meanwhile, American sales were described as being strong; according to Uchikoshi, this was a surprise, as the visual novel genre was seen as being particular to Japan and <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accepted overseas.|$|E
5|$|Paul Davies, {{a member}} of the SETI Post-Detection Taskgroup, has stated that post-detection protocols, calling for {{international}} consultation before taking any major steps regarding the detection, are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> followed by astronomers, who would put the advancement of their careers over the word of a protocol that is not part of national or international law.|$|E

5000|$|The earlier {{meaning of}} Ailbe is uncertain; {{it may have}} been {{understood}} in the Middle Ages to derive from Irish ail, 'rock', but this <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> its historical meaning.|$|R

5|$|Reporters deemed Harding <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{nominated}} due to {{his poor}} showing in the primaries, and relegated him to a place among the dark horses. Harding, who like the other candidates was in Chicago supervising his campaign, had finished sixth in the final public opinion poll, behind the three main candidates as well as former justice Hughes and Herbert Hoover, and only slightly ahead of Coolidge.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{has said}} it is {{unlikely}} she will write any more books in the Harry Potter series. In October 2007 she stated that her future work was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the fantasy genre. On 1 October 2010, {{in an interview with}} Oprah Winfrey, Rowling stated a new book on the saga might happen.|$|E
5|$|The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards {{legislation}} as {{an indispensable}} means for realising the rights which is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> limited by resource constraints. The enacting of anti-discrimination provisions {{and the establishment}} of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means. Some provisions, such as anti-discrimination laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.|$|E

25|$|A {{corollary}} to the Fermi paradox—"nobody else {{is doing}} it"—is the argument that, because no evidence of alien colonization technology exists, it <b>is</b> statistically <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> even <b>be</b> possible <b>to</b> use that same level of technology ourselves.|$|R
5000|$|The {{placement}} and capitals of these late British provinces are uncertain, although the late-4th century List of Offices describes {{the governor of}} Prima as being equestrian rank (...) , making the province <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> based in Londinium.|$|R
5|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe is {{the proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within a very narrow range, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would be <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood. The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} around Mont Blanc {{are home}} to many mammal species, including ibex, chamois, deer, mountain hare and alpine marmot (including a small population of albino marmots within Val Ferret). Eurasian lynx have been reintroduced into the French Alps and, although present around the Mont Blanc massif, are extremely <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> encountered.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on the surface suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO2, much {{like that of the}} Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania's summer solstice (89 K), the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).|$|E
5000|$|The New York Giants did {{not yield}} a single earned run in this Series, thereby setting a mathematically {{unbreakable}} record for lowest team ERA of 0.00, and {{a record that}} <b>is</b> highly <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>be</b> matched.|$|R
50|$|The classic Chinese novel Journey <b>to</b> the West <b>is</b> {{considered}} <b>to</b> {{have considerable}} picaresque elements.

50|$|There are {{no signs}} that the Bruce Plan's {{proposed}} Maryhill motorway will ever be implemented in any way. Bruce's proposals for a ring road with four arterial routes running off it seems <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>be</b> fully realised.|$|R
