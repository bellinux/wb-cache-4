This in turn can be used to work out the utilisation of the line for the purposes of network planning and dimensioning.|$|E

It defines four basic points of view, which can explain <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> with greatest attention to economic rationality point of view. Behaviour of transport services user can be explained through the three relatively independent parts – understanding the user’s reactions on external initiatives, understanding the user’s train of thought after receipt of external initiatives and before making purchase decision and finally understanding the <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> within the realisation of particular purchase decision steps...|$|R

User personalization is usually done by asking users either to rate items or specify their interests. Generally users {{do not like to}} rate items; an alternative approach would be to implicitly track <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> by observing their actions. In this paper, we build a {{recommender system}} by using case-based reasoning to remember past interactions with the user. We incrementally improve the system recommendations by tracking <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour.</b> <b>User</b> preferences captured during each interaction with the system are used to recommend items even in case of a partial query.

40|$|Abstract Although {{there are}} many {{approaches}} pro-posed for masquerade detection in the literature, few of them consider concept drift; the problem of distin-guishing malicious behaviours from the natural change in <b>user</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Researchers mainly focus on updat-ing <b>user</b> <b>behaviours</b> for adapting concept drift in mas-querade detection. However these approaches rely on {{the accuracy of the}} detector and do not take into ac-count malicious instances which are erroneously added to the updating scheme. In this study, we show that con-ventional approaches based on instance selection are af-fected dramatically when misclassified intrusive data is added to the training data. Therefore we propose a new approach based on instance weighting which updates <b>user</b> <b>behaviours</b> gradually according to the weights as-signed to each instance, regardless of them being ma-licious or non-malicious. The results show that the pro-posed approach outperforms the other updating schemes in the literature, where the malicious instances are more than 5 % of the benign instances in the updating, which is very likely to happen due to the high miss rate of the existing detectors.

In many cases, the e-Learning <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> model for open source e-Learning system such as Moodle, which can predict learning outcome or learning performance is still deficient and cannot generally apply in many institutions {{due to the}} fact that the majority of prediction models were developed particularly for certain institutions. This study proposes to produce a general model that can make a prediction of learning outcome inspired by Skinner’s theory, which explains the relationship between learner, achievement, and learner reinforcement. This study proposes similar patterns in e-Learning <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> models of different institutions by the data-mining technique based on the learning environment theory. Therefore, this research is conducted in three main phases; include data preparation from weblog of different institutions with the same e-Learning system, data extraction by the accurate classifier model finding process and model verification for generating a verification pattern. The research outcome will be a similar pattern that could be used as a direction for creating a more appropriate e-Learning users’ behaviour model and could be used broadly in other higher institutions...|$|R

This paper presents the design and development of a Probabilistic Adaptive Hypermedia System that uses a probabilistic approach for user modelling and presentation adaptation. The Application Domain is modelled along three different adaptivity dimensions: <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> (browsing activity), technology (network and user’s terminal constraints), and external environment (time, location, language, socio-political issues, etc.). The <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> is modelled using a probabilistic approach and the most promising profile, that is a “view ” over the application domain, is dynamically assigned to the user, using a discrete probability density function. A modular architecture implementing both the authoring phase and the run-time support of the Adaptive Hypermedia System is also presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the model-based testing of graphical user interfaces from task models. Starting from a task model of the system under test, oracles are generated whose behaviour is compared with {{the execution of the}} running system. The use of task models means that the effort of producing the test oracles is reduced. It does also mean, however, that the oracles are confined to the set of expected <b>user</b> <b>behaviours</b> for the system. The paper focuses on solving this problem. It shows how task mutations can be generated automatically, enabling a broader range of <b>user</b> <b>behaviours</b> to be considered.
