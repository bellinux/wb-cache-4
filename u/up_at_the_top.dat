5|$|The two {{combined}} battalions began {{digging in}} around Isurava. A headquarters {{had been set}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the hill, which was vital to the defence of the position. While the Australians dug themselves in, the Japanese, led by Japanese Major General Tomitarō Horii, prepared to attack. On 28 August, the Japanese launched their offensive. The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted {{in the face of}} heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat. On 29 August, the Japanese broke through the right flank, pushing the Australians back with heavy fire, threatening to cut off their headquarters. The Australians began to prepare a counter-offensive, and men volunteered to join an attack party. Kingsbury, one of the few survivors of his platoon, ran down the Track with the group. Using a Bren gun he had taken from wounded Corporal Lindsay Bear, Kingsbury, alongside Avery {{and the rest of the}} group, engaged the nearby Japanese. The fire was so heavy that the undergrowth was completely destroyed within five minutes. It was then that Kingsbury, firing from his hip, charged straight at the Japanese.|$|E

The small Republican Sinn Féin group (and some activists from the Irish Republican Socialist Party) {{were joined by}} several hundred local youths. Before the violence broke out, they chanted republican chants. Several thousand bystanders were also on the scene, but took no part in the subsequent rioting. When the marchers had formed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Parnell Square and their bands began to play {{in anticipation of the}} start of the march, gardaí attempted to disperse the protest at around 12:45. At this point, scuffles broke out between protesters and Gardaí.|$|E

At the top of the climb, Quintana changed from a road bicycle to a time trial bicycle. The only rider able to beat Quintana's time was Alberto Contador. He was 23 seconds <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the climb and finished five seconds ahead by the finish line. Cyclingnews.com suggested after the stage that Quintana's bike change may have cost him the stage victory. Henao, who had lost 46 seconds to Contador on the climb, finished 18 seconds behind and fell to second place overall.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of sound had driven costs higher: by 1930, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce. A {{broad range of}} motion pictures occupied the B category. The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as [...] "programmers" [...] (also known as [...] "in-betweeners" [...] or [...] "intermediates"). As Taves describes, [...] "Depending on {{the prestige of the}} theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> or bottom of the marquee." [...] On Poverty Row, many Bs were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major's A film, with costs {{at the bottom of the}} industry running as low as $5,000. By the mid-1930s, the double feature was the dominant U.S. exhibition model, and the majors responded. In 1935, B movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50 percent of studio output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known as the [...] "Keeper of the Bs". At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, Sol M. Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s.|$|E
500|$|British {{critics were}} {{especially}} enthusiastic about Nicolas Roeg's direction. In {{the view of}} Tom Milne of Monthly Film Bulletin, Roeg's combined work on Performance, Walkabout and Don't Look Now put him [...] "right <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> as film-maker". George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined [...] "that handful of names whose appearance {{at the end of}} the credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation". Penelope Houston for Sight & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg's direction: [...] "Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection." [...] American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg's work on the film. Jay Cocks regarded Don't Look Now to be Roeg's best work by far and that Roeg was one of [...] "those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing". Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella, noting that a reading [...] "makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [...] Scott and [...] Bryant all the more. Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise. The story is detached, almost cursory. Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate, intense speculation about levels of perception and reality." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times commented that Roeg is [...] "a genius at filling his frame with threatening forms and compositions", while Pauline Kael labelled him [...] "chillingly chic" [...] in hers. Even Vincent Canby, whose opinion of the film was negative overall, praised Roeg for being able to [...] "maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it".|$|E

Upon winning the championship, McClaren stated, [...] "Winning the Carling Cup with Middlesbrough was special but this is pretty much right <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of anything I've ever done.

2500|$|In vertebrates, {{the first}} sign of the nervous system is the {{appearance}} of a thin strip of cells along the center of the back, called the neural plate. [...] The inner portion of the neural plate (along the midline) is destined to become the central nervous system (CNS), the outer portion the peripheral nervous system (PNS). [...] As development proceeds, a fold called the neural groove appears along the midline. [...] This fold deepens, and then closes <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> [...] At this point the future CNS appears as a cylindrical structure called the neural tube, whereas the future PNS appears as two strips of tissue called the neural crest, running lengthwise above the neural tube. [...] The sequence of stages from neural plate to neural tube and neural crest is known as neurulation.|$|E
2500|$|Laleh {{began her}} music career in 2003. She founded her own {{production}} and publishing company 'Lost Army' {{and signed a}} recording and distribution contract with Warner Music Sweden before recording her first studio album. The sound of her early songs have been compared to adult contemporary artists such as Sting and Seal. She wrote, performed, and produced her self-titled debut, which was released {{in the spring of}} 2005 and saw a percentage of the proceeds go to charity. It became the highest selling album of the year with a recorded seventy-one weeks in the top sixty and reached number one on the Swedish chart. Critical praise was heaped on the album upon its release, although some noted that the album was too sprawling and genre-hopping. The first single from the album was [...] "Invisible (My Song)", which peaked at number seven in Sweden in February 2012. Follow-up [...] "Storebror" [...] failed to chart, but next single, [...] "Live Tomorrow" [...] had even greater success than [...] "Invisible" [...] and ended <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of [...] Sveriges Radio P3's radio show [...] "Tracks" [...] (Trackslistan) for several weeks. It peaked at number twenty on the Sverigetopplistan and also charted in Denmark. During 2005 she won numerous awards, including at the Swedish Grammis, where she received seven nominations and picked up three wins, including Artist of the Year, Producer of the Year, and New Artist of the Year. She was also nominated four times at the 2006 P3 Guld Awards and won Newcomer of the Year and Best Female Artist.|$|E
