40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{have been}} few {{in-depth}} studies of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injury epidemiology in rugby union football, despite reports that they accounted for between 14 and 28 of all rugby injuries. OBJECTIVE: To report on <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injury incidence, injury severity and to identify the risk factors associated with <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injuries, for example, level of play, season (years) and playing position. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study across five rugby seasons from 2004 to 2008. SETTING: Formal rugby competitions-suburban, provincial and international. PARTICIPANTS: 1475 adult male rugby players in Colts, Grade and Elite competitions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: An <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injury resulting in a missed game and its characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 61 598 athletic exposures (AE) and 606 <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injuries were recorded. About 66 of the injuries were to the shoulder. The overall <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injury incidence rate (IIR) was 9. 84 injuries/ 1000 AE (95 CI 9. 06 to 10. 62). Statistically significant associations were found between <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injuries and level of play; and between shoulder injuries and playing position (p< 0. 05). No association was found between <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> and shoulder injuries and study year. The overall <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> IIR decreased {{as the level of}} play increased; 10. 74 <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injuries/ 1000 AE (95 CI 9. 93 to 11. 56) in Colts to 6. 07 <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injuries/ 1000 AE (95 CI 5. 46 to 6. 69) in Elite. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> IIR decreased as the level of play increased indicating that age, level of skill and playing experience may be risk factors for <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> injury...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{capacity}} of the robotic device REAplan to measure overall 			<b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> peak resistance force, as a reflection of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> 			spasticity. 			Methods: Twelve patients with chronic stroke presenting <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> spasticity were 			recruited to the study. Patients underwent musculocutaneous motor 			nerve block to reduce the spasticity of elbow flexor muscles. Each 			patient was assessed before and after the motor nerve block. Overall 			the REAplan measured <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> resistance force. The robot passively 			mobilized the patient’s <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> at various velocities (10, 20, 30, 			 40 and 50 cm/s) in a back-and-forth trajectory (30 cm).

40|$|Purpose: {{to enhance}} {{understanding}} of the relationship between <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> and eye movements during reaching tasks in people with stroke. Methods: eye movements were recorded from 10 control participants and 8 chronic stroke participants during a visual orienting task (Experiment 1) and a series of reaching tasks (Experiment 2). Stroke participants completed the reaching tasks using (i) their less impaired <b>upper</b> <b>limb,</b> (ii) their more impaired <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> without support, and (iii) their more impaired <b>upper</b> <b>limb,</b> with support (SaeboMAS gravitational support and/or electrical stimulation). Participants were tested individually and completed both experiments in the same session. Results: oculomotor control and the coordination between the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> and the oculomotor system were found to be intact in stroke participants when no limb movements were required, or when the less impaired <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> was used. However, when the more impaired <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> was used, success and accuracy in reaching decreased and patterns of eye movements changed, with an observed increase in eye movements to the <b>limb</b> itself. With <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> support, patterns of hand-eye coordination were found to more closely resemble those of the control group. Conclusion: deficits in <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> motor systems result in changes in patterns of eye movement behavior during reaching tasks.

40|$|Background: <b>Upper</b> <b>limb</b> {{hemiparesis}} is a common, persisting and disabling sequela of stroke. However, {{evidence for}} the effectiveness of interventions targeted at the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> remains inconclusive. Identification of reliable predictors of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> recovery would allow interventions to be better targeted at appropriate patients and thus potentially optimise <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> rehabilitation. We carried out a systematic review of predictors of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> recovery. Methods: We completed searches in Medline, Embase, Amed, Cinahl and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Articles were included if predictor variables were measured at baseline and related to an outcome of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> recovery at a future time point. Exclusion criteria included predictor variables relating to a particular treatment and outcome measurements of very specific <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> impairments such as spasticity or pain. Results: To date two independent reviewers have identified 54 studies (over 6000 participants) that meet the inclusion criteria. Predictor variables which have been considered within these studies include; age, sex, lesion site, initial motor impairment, motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} severity of the initial <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> impairment is the most consistently reported and significant predictor of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> recovery. Discussion: Interpretation of these results is complicated by methodological factors including variations in study populations, <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> motor outcome scales, timing of baseline and outcome assessments and predictors selected. The most important predictive factor for <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> recovery following stroke appears to be the initial severity of motor impairment.

40|$|Impairments of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> {{function}} can negatively impact an individuals {{ability to}} carry out everyday tasks. Children with cerebral palsy can have limitations of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> movement due to physiological and structural changes in their body. Current treatment regimes for children with <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> involvement of cerebral palsy are assessed {{using a variety of}} qualitative assessment tools. These measures rely on subjective input from the assessor, and can be insensitive to significant functional improvements. Research methods in <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> motion analysis are developing towards use as clinical tools. To date, there is a paucity of knowledge on the quantitative measures of range of motion (ROM) and function of <b>upper</b> <b>limbs</b> in healthy children. There is also lack of agreement on repeatable functional tasks of the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> for 3 D measurement. The identification of a repeatable task in healthy children would facilitate the use of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> 3 D motion analysis to guide clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. This thesis aims to describe <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> joint range of movement in each degree of freedom and present normative three dimensional kinematic data of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> movement in healthy children during a repeatable <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> functional task. This will provide a basis for comparison to children with movement disorders for future research and clinical practice. The UNSW kinematic <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> model was found to successfully measure three dimensional <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> anatomical and functional movements in healthy children. Normative kinematic data are reported for anatomical movements and two functional tasks. The results of the studies undertaken showed that differences in dominant and non-dominant limbs were present during anatomical and functional movements. Joint angles measured were found to be repeatable in healthy children. The results suggest that methods used were reliable for investigating <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> kinematics. Functional movement time-series data were found to be repeatable for the group with the exception of wrist flexion/extension during the hand to mouth movement for both the dominant and non-dominant limbs. These findings improve current knowledge on <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> kinematics in healthy children. This knowledge can assist the investigation of movement disorders in children to facilitate clinical decision making...|$|R

Methods: General motor function and, in particular, <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> distal motor function, were assessed with the Motor Function Measure. Muscle strength {{and range of}} motion of the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> were evaluated using hand-held dynamometry, manual muscle-testing and goniometry.

Results: Constraint-induced movement therapy was more effective than no/sham intervention in terms of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> activity (SMD 0. 63, 95 % CI 0. 20 to 1. 06) and participation (SMD 1. 21, 95 % CI 0. 41 to 2. 02). However, constraint-induced movement therapy was no better than the same dose of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> therapy without restraint either in terms of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> activity (SMD 0. 05, 95 % CI – 0. 21 to 0. 32) or participation (SMD – 0. 02, 95 % CI – 0. 34 to 0. 31). The effect of constraint-induced movement therapy was not related to the duration of intervention or the age of the children. Conclusions: This review suggests that constraint-induced movement therapy is more effective than no intervention, but no more effective than the same dose of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> practice without restraint.

BeardObjectives: To {{quantify}} sub-bandage pressures {{associated with}} various bandage constructs {{applied to the}} abdomen, distal limb, carpus, and tarsus. To assess the effect of time and /or post-bandaging manipulations on sub-bandage pressures. Study design: Randomized clinical trial Methods: Each bandage’s sub-bandage pressures were measured with the Picopress® compression measuring system at various time points determined by the study protocol. Nine horses {{were randomly assigned to}} a treatment regimen consisting of placement of three abdominal bandage types. Bandages were maintained for 24 hours. 8 horses had two types of distal <b>limb</b> <b>bandages</b> (DLC and DLP) applied and maintained for 24 hours. 8 horses had a DLC bandage applied for 96 hours. 8 horses had both carpal and tarsal bandages applied and pressures monitored after application and post walking. A generalized linear model evaluating associations of pressure with location of the sensor, bandage type, time of measurement, and the potential interaction between all variables was performed (P< 0. 05). Results: For abdominal bandages, no time and treatment interactions were observed, and bandage pressures were maintained within each treatment group over the 24 hour period. For distal <b>limb</b> <b>bandages,</b> bandage type, sensor location, and time had a significant effect on sub-bandage pressures. For joint bandages, bandage type, sensor location, and post-bandaging manipulations had significant effects on sub-bandage pressures associated with compression bandages. Ambulation did not have a significant effect sub-bandage pressures generated by the carpal elastic bandages. Conclusions: Abdominal sub-bandage pressures do not significantly decrease over a 24 hour period, but generate low sub-bandage pressures. In contrast, <b>limb</b> <b>bandages</b> apply high sub-bandage pressures, but these pressures degrade over the initial 24 hours...|$|R
