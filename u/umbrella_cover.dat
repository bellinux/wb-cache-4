500|$|The Tevoda {{is built}} to a {{cruciform}} plan and {{linked to an}} entrance hall, similar to the Hindu temples built in India, particularly in Odisha. The temple has four gopuras or towers on the four cardinal signs with an entrance from the east though a raised bridge. The long hall, which links the gopuras and central chamber of the temple, has very elegant flower decorations. The temple consists of a central tower with an attached mandapa, which is achieved through an antarala chamber of small size, and with two libraries on its southern and northern sides. It is enclosed by a compound wall which has four gopuras or towers. To its east, there is a raised causeway {{that leads to the}} Siem Reap River. Many of the sculptures depict Vishnu, and are in a fairly good condition. However, the main deity of the temple is Shiva. Some of the sculptures in the temple are also of Buddha but disfigured totally. With time the ceiling has collapsed and led to further deterioration. The defaced Buddhas, which are deified in a lotus posture, flanked by devotees, are in a mandapa behind a pediment from the entrance door which leads to the antarala. The incomplete eastern Gopura I, which is oriented in the western direction, has a roof {{which is part of the}} second [...] "pediment of the lateral southern extension" [...] which is not fully restored. The main figure here is of Buddha in a cross legged posture seated on a high platform and is flanked by disfigured carvings which are interpreted as that of Garuda and the king of Nagas. The top pediment of this Gopura I with figure of Buddha has an <b>umbrella</b> <b>cover</b> of a Bodhi tree. Carvings depicting episodes from the life of Buddha are seen on the northern door of the eastern Gopura I. A notable bass relief here is of Sita (heroine of the epic Ramayana) in a seated posture over an altar flanked [...] by rakshasis (female demonesses). Hanuman, in a small monkey form, is carved in sitting posture facing Sita and offering her Rama's ring. A wall built with laterite stones enclosing the temple, [...] which had existed in the past, has disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|The typical icon of Jagannath {{is unlike}} other deities found in Hinduism who are {{predominantly}} anthropomorphic. However, aniconic forms of Hindu deities are not uncommon. For example, Shiva is often {{represented in the}} form of a Shiva linga. In most Jagannath temples in the eastern states of India, and all his major temples such as the Puri, Odisha, Jagannath is included with his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra. Apart from the principal companion deities, Jagannath icon shows a Sudarshana Chakra and sometimes under the <b>umbrella</b> <b>cover</b> of multiheaded Sesha Naga, both linking him to Vishnu. He was one of the introduction to Hinduism to early European explorers and merchants who sailed into Calcutta and ports of the Bay of Bengal. The Italian Odoric of Pordenone who was a Franciscan friar, visited his temple and procession in 1321 CE, and described him in the language of the Church.

50|$|The erotic {{connotations of}} Nuage articulé, with its <b>umbrella</b> <b>covered</b> with natural sponges, {{embodied}} a dynamic sense of contradiction: bloom with stalk; sponge as symbol of nature, as a feminine utensil, which touched and cleaned naked female skin; umbrella as a masculine symbol {{of order and}} protection from natural forces. It thus became widely recognized among the Surrealists and their growing public. Geo Dupin, Paalen´s sister-in-law, remembered that Alfred H. Barr, Jr. had been extremely taken with Paalen's object and had chosen not to buy it, for the Museum of Modern Art in New York, only {{because it was too}} fragile and difficult to transport. Nuage articulé was published later in a more political context in the Surrealist magazine London Bulletin, together with a text by André Breton translated by Samuel Beckett with acomment that the sponge-umbrella would bring to mind another, sadly prominent, umbrella-that of Neville Chamberlain at the 1938 Munich Conference and the failure of the British policy of appeasement.|$|R

40|$|Purpose of Study: The UV {{spectrum}} under public shade structures has {{not been}} previously investigated. This research compares the UV spectrum beneath four common shade structures with that of total solar UV, for relatively cloud-free sky conditions and changing solar zenith angle. No action spectrum exists for human melanoma, but the fish melanoma action spectrum may possibly provide {{an indication of the}} effective wavelengths for human melanoma development. Methodology: The protective nature of the shade environments was investigated by measuring the spectral UV in 1 nm increments in the shade for the three planes of horizontal, 45 o and vertical, and comparing it to that on a horizontal plane in full sun. The solar UV {{in the shade of a}} shade <b>umbrella,</b> <b>covered</b> veranda, covered sandpit and covered walkway was measured for an increasing solar zenith angle, between March and August. Results: For a shade umbrella on dry grass with no surrounding vegetation, UV levels in the shade weighted with the fish melanoma action spectrum reached approximately 65 % of those in full sun. For a covered sandpit with trees and shrubs in close proximity, UV levels were less than half those for the shade <b>umbrella.</b> The <b>covered</b> walkway and northern facing veranda received potentially damaging UV levels of approximately 39 % and 15 % respectively, for fish melanoma. An increasing solar zenith angle increased the relative damaging UV in the shade. Conclusions: The biologically damaging UV for fish melanoma was far from zero in the shade. This may have significant implications for humans...|$|R

50|$|The first prototypes of Kune were {{developed}} using Ruby on Rails and Pyjamas (later known as Pyjs). However, {{with the release}} of Java and the Google Web Toolkit as free software, the community embraced these technologies since 2007. In 2009, with a stable codebase and about to release a major version of Kune, Google announced the Google Wave project and promised it would be released as free software. Wave was using the same technologies of Kune (Java + GWT, Guice, XMPP protocol) so {{it would be easy to}} integrate after its release. Besides, Wave was offering an open federated protocol, easy extensibility (through gadgets), easy control versioning, and very good real-time edition of documents. Thus, the community decided to halt the development of Kune, and wait for its release... in the meanwhile developing gadgets that would be integrated in Kune later on. In this same period, the community established the Comunes Association (with an acknowledged inspiration in Software in the Public Interest) as a non-profit legal umbrella for free software tools for encouraging the Commons and facilitating the work of social movements. The <b>umbrella</b> <b>covered</b> Ourproject, Kune and Move Commons, together with some other minor projects.|$|R

40|$|The aim {{and object}} of this account is to {{elaborate}} {{on the role of}} eCAADe within the present worldwide “CAAD-activities”. Each of the associations dedicated to the field of CAAD has taken its very own course of development, many cases of overlap and interaction have resulted, some of them, however, merely based on personal contacts. The purpose of eCAADe is to promote the sharing of ideas and collaboration in matters relating to Computer Aided Architectural Design. This, jointly drafted paper outlines these global aims within a worldwide context. The eCAADe <b>umbrella</b> <b>covers</b> both Europe and its periphery. Including the Middle East and North Africa. Though this does not apply as a kind of “territorial claim“, the primary affiliation of regions to {{at least one of the}} current international associations is sought. Historically, the early eighties are to be regarded as the period of first encounters with computers of larger proportions of people involved in architecture, simultaneously with the rise of personal computers. Thus various university sites acted as the forerunners in this field. Implementation of CAAD in teaching and research soon called for channeling the exchanges of experience via a suitable platform. The founding of ACADIA (the North American Organisation) in 1981, however, seems to have set the stage, as shortly thereafter the foundations for a European movement were laid...|$|R
