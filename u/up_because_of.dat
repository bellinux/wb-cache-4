Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow <b>up.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E

It was announced on lap 90 that Kniefel had reduced the number of laps to be run from 168 to 140 because of the danger from fading sunlight. All of the leaders (including Bräck) chose to make pit stops for fuel and tyres under caution on lap 100.

25|$|The academy {{operated}} as a day-school {{for some}} time after its inception till it began accommodating students in Claremont House, a single-storey building adjoining Ellen House.

A second site, which was located at Korle Gonno, was also given <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its remote location.|$|E

However, {{the sale of}} the Hotel Del Coronado was held <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> concerns expressed by the federal inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign investors for possible national security risks. The agency was concerned about the hotel's proximity to major Navy bases. In October 2016 it was reported that he deal had fallen through and the hotel would remain in Blackstone's ownership.|$|E
