5|$|Unlike typical vomiting, the {{regurgitation}} {{is typically}} described as effortless and <b>unforced.</b> There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion, and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an <b>unforced</b> preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an <b>unforced</b> runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E
5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts {{to put out a}}n <b>unforced</b> preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to put out a forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails to put out an <b>unforced</b> preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required to determine whether the batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to put him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt to put out a preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber calling a time-out that Michigan didn't have with seconds left. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship {{due to an}} <b>unforced</b> error by the opposing team.|$|E
5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more <b>unforced</b> errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|In 1502, {{the whole}} Muslim {{community}} of Teruel (part of Aragon bordered with Castile) converted en masse to Christianity, {{even though the}} 1502 edict of conversion for Castilian Muslims {{did not apply to}} them. Harvey suggested that they were pressured by the Castilians across the border, but historian Trevor Dadson argued that this conversion was <b>unforced,</b> caused instead by centuries of contact with their Christian neighbors and a desire for an equal status with the Christians.|$|E
5|$|In July the French {{team was}} {{challenged}} by the United States team in the 1929 Davis Cup three-day final. On 26 July 12,000 people watched {{the first day of}} the encounter at the Roland Garros stadium. The French squad took the lead when Borotra beat George Lott. The second match was scheduled between Cochet and Tilden. The American started off poorly; he was not able to win one single point in the first game, hit many <b>unforced</b> errors, especially in the longer rallies, and Cochet pulled away and took the set. In the second Tilden forced a backhand game, but it did not pay off, and he lost that set as well, six games to one. Tilden relied on his serves but was only capable of winning six games in the whole match when he lost the third set six to two. According to contemporary statistics Cochet did not hit any <b>unforced</b> errors of faults during the match. The next day French captain Pierre Gillou sent Cochet and Borotra for the doubles rubber. Cochet was exhausted and showed the opposite form compared to the previous day. Despite all efforts by his partner Borotra, Cochet hit most of the balls out or into the net. The American duo of Wilmer Allison and John Van Ryn took a three-set win. The third day Tilden saved the hopes for his team when he beat Borotra in front of a capacity crowd of 15,000. The deciding rubber was between Cochet and George Lott. Cochet won in four sets and claimed the Cup for France for the third time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be fit for the US Open. This injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking as he would have attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable and it took him five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by <b>unforced</b> errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he never felt {{he had a chance to}} win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic and Murray {{appeared}} in their seventh and fourth Masters final and 19th and 17th career finals respectively. Djokovic led the head-to-head tally against Murray, but Murray {{had won the}} last two encounters between them. In the match, Murray moved into a 4–0 lead in the first set. Djokovic improved his serve from that point but lost the set. A role reversal in the second set saw Djokovic move into a 4–1 lead. Murray fought back, however, to level the score to 5–5 and won the set to secure the victory. This was Murray's third title win {{of the season and}} eleventh of his career. It was also his third Masters win of the career. Murray credited his improved fitness for his win. Djokovic, who had struggled with excessive heat in the past, struggled once again to assimilate with the temperature. He admitted that he was impatient early in the match, which resulted in him making too many <b>unforced</b> errors.|$|E
5|$|Needing to win {{the match}} to prevent an Australian series victory, England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. England {{continued}} to rearrange their team, making three changes {{in an attempt to}} find a combination that could challenge Australia, which made two changes forced by injury. Unlike the preceding Tests, England's openers were able to withstand the Australian new ball attack, and the partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook put on 168 for the opening stand. Washbrook fell for 143 in the last over of the day, but England clearly had the better of the play, ending at 268/2 by stumps. Australia's bowlers were heavily criticised for their performance, which was seen as lethargic. The next day, England continued to amass runs, with Australia appearing unthreatening and unable to dislodge Bill Edrich and nightwatchman Alec Bedser, who batted until mid-afternoon. Bedser and Edrich then fell in quick succession for 79 and 111 respectively as England then collapsed and lost 8/73 to be all out for 496 late in the day. The hosts were heavily criticised for the collapse, which was largely due to <b>unforced</b> errors. Among the Australian bowlers, the wickets were shared. Australia then reached 63/1 in reply at stumps on day two.|$|E
25|$|In July 2000 Vermont {{became the}} first state to {{introduce}} civil unions. In 2009 Vermont {{became the first}} state to legislate same-sex marriage <b>unforced</b> by court challenge or ruling.|$|E
25|$|Representing Australia for {{the first}} time in five years, Dokic {{received}} a wild card into the ASB Classic in Auckland. However, she lost her first round match to Julia Schruff, 5–7, 7–6, 6–1, hitting 51 <b>unforced</b> errors and 28 double faults. Dokic then earned a wildcard berth at the Australian Open after winning the wildcard playoff. She held a match point on her opponent Virginie Razzano's serve and hit a forehand winner which did catch the line, only to have the umpire overrule the ball out. She went on to lose the match, 3–6, 7–6, 6–1, hitting over 70 <b>unforced</b> errors.|$|E
25|$|At the US Open, Bammer was seeded 29th. She {{defeated}} No. 12 Marion Bartoli, 7–6, 0–6, 6–4 in the 4th round. She {{struggled with}} <b>unforced</b> errors {{in a loss}} to No. 2 Jelena Janković in the quarterfinals.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to examine}} {{goodness}} of fit would be to examine residuals {{as a function of}} x. Other single parameter indicators include the standard deviation of the residuals, or the RMSE of the residuals. These would have values of 0.151 and 0.174 respectively for the above example given that the fit was linear with an <b>unforced</b> intercept.|$|E
25|$|Taking to {{the court}} after was Belgian Kim Clijsters and Swiss Martina Hingis in the last quarter-final to be contested, {{and one of the}} most {{anticipated}} match-ups thus far in the tournament. Last year, Clijsters beat Hingis at exactly the same stage before losing to Amélie Mauresmo. The fourth-seed squandered the first set, making 23 <b>unforced</b> errors, but began to find her game in the second set. She raced to a 5–2 lead in the second set, but let it slip before eventually winning 6–4 to push it to a deciding set. Hingis raced off to an early 2–0 lead in the last set, but all energy had been drained from her and she lost six of the last seven games of the match to hand Clijsters the victory, despite having forty-two <b>unforced</b> errors less than the Belgian. The semi-finals will feature Maria Sharapova against Kim Clijsters.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to her}} high-risk {{game and}} {{aggressive}} style of play she is known to produce {{a high number of}} <b>unforced</b> errors in matches. Movement is another weakness in her game though it has shown significant improvement {{over the last couple of}} years as she is now able to run down more balls than before. She is known for her inconsistencies, inability to maintain focus on and off during matches as well as impatience mid-rally. Most notably of late, Kvitova has been struggling against defensive players, most notably Agnieszka Radwańska and among others Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep, who prolong points to the extent that Kvitová feels she must hit a winner, thus increasing the chances of producing an <b>unforced</b> error. Against such opponents, she has been shown to break down physically due to her opponent's use of court craft, consistency and patience on court.|$|E
25|$|The last {{match of}} the day came between two former US Open finalists Vera Zvonareva and Caroline Wozniacki, who has split their former 8 matches in half. Zvonareva, the No.6 seed, was the clear aggressor in the match, going for her big groundstrokes – {{including}} some particularly impressive backhands – {{to take the first}} set in just 35 minutes. Wozniacki broke in the last game of the second set to push the match to a third but Zvonareva came alive again, racing out to a double-break 4–1 lead and barely looking back. The Russian, who just turned 27 last month, won the last seven points of the match to end it 6–2, 4–6, 6–3. Although both Zvonareva and Wozniacki are known for their strong defensive skills, the Russian's offense really shone through at the Sinan Erdem Dome – she had by far the bigger numbers for the day, 49 winners to 49 <b>unforced</b> errors (Wozniacki finished the match with 13 winners to 18 <b>unforced</b> errors).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of Dubai, Dokic, {{hindered}} by illness, committed 41 <b>unforced</b> errors and 11 double faults to give victory to an in-form Flavia Pennetta losing 2–6, 2–6. Following the loss, Dokic travelled to Doha to participate at the qualifying draw of 2011 Qatar Ladies Open. She comfortably won her first match but lost in the second match to fellow Australian, Jarmila Groth.|$|E
25|$|Halep {{qualified}} for the main draw at the 2011 Rogers Cup in Toronto but drew 12th-seeded (and 15th-ranked) Svetlana Kuznetsova as her first opponent. After dropping the first set, Halep came back to win in a 2:14 long match that saw Kuznetsova make 50 <b>unforced</b> errors. It was Halep's first victory over a top-20 ranked player. She lost to Lucie Šafářová in the second round.|$|E
25|$|Although the 2003 Grand Prix was won by pole-sitter Barrichello for Ferrari, {{the race}} is {{probably}} most remember for a track invasion by the defrocked priest, Neil Horan, who ran along Hangar Straight, head-on to the 175mph train of cars, wearing a saffron kilt and waving religious banners. Kimi Räikkönen (McLaren) was pressured by Barrichello into losing the lead and an <b>unforced</b> error later on allowed Montoya to seize second.|$|E
25|$|At the US Open, Dementieva {{was one of}} {{six players}} with the {{opportunity}} to be ranked world No. 1 upon completion of the tournament. Dementieva defeated Schnyder in the quarterfinals but lost to Janković in the semifinals 6–4, 6–4. Dementieva was up a break in each set but committed 42 <b>unforced</b> errors and lost each of her last five service games. Nevertheless, her ranking improved to world No. 4 {{for the first time since}} 2004.|$|E
25|$|At the 2011 US Open, Halep {{was placed}} in the main draw and faced Li Na in the first round. Despite playing with an ankle sprain she had {{suffered}} in Toronto earlier in the month, Halep defeated the sixth-seeded Li in a match that saw Li make 54 <b>unforced</b> errors to Halep's 19. It was Halep's first win over a top-10 ranked player. She lost in the second round to Carla Suárez Navarro in three sets.|$|E
25|$|She {{likes to}} return serves mainly with her backhand which she hits {{extremely}} flat {{and tries to}} position herself to receive with backhand but is also capable of hitting good service returns with her forehand as well. She likes to end points early but she is capable of playing long rallies and reducing her <b>unforced</b> error count. Overall, she is an offensive baseliner but depending on the game situation and scoreboard Kanepi can play a more defensive game.|$|E
25|$|The {{week after}} Indian Wells, Federer {{played in the}} Sony Ericsson Open in Miami. Federer and the other 31 seeded players {{received}} first-round byes. In the second round, Federer defeated Nicolás Lapentti before over 14,000 fans, a record-breaking attendance for a second round match in the Stadium (the center court of Miami). After beating Florent Serra, Federer lost to the eventual runner-up, Czech Tomáš Berdych, in three sets in the fourth round. Federer hit 62 <b>unforced</b> errors in that match.|$|E
25|$|At the Qatar Telecom German Open in Berlin, Mauresmo lost in {{the third}} round to Julia Vakulenko of Ukraine, and at the Internazionali d'Italia in Rome, she {{lost in the}} second round to Australian Samantha Stosur, 7–5, 7–6(4), 6–7(7), after Mauresmo led 5–3 in the third set. Going into the French Open, Mauresmo had played only three tournaments since the end of February. Mauresmo lost to Czech Lucie Šafářová {{in the third round}}, 3–6, 6–7(4), {{committing}} eight double faults and 49 <b>unforced</b> errors.|$|E
25|$|The other quarter-final {{followed}} after with Nicole Vaidišová beating compatriot Lucie Šafářová 6–1, 6–4 to {{make her}} second major semi-final after the 2006 French Open. Vaidišová completely overpowered her fellow Czech in the first set, needing just thirty minutes to take it and compiling a 14–4 winner to <b>unforced</b> error ratio. Although Šafářová gave more of a battle in the second set, Vaidišová was still too good for her and managed to close out the one hour eleven-minute match with ease. In the semi-finals she will face Serena Williams, the first meeting between the pair.|$|E
25|$|At the French Open, Hantuchová lost in {{the second}} round in a {{marathon}} match to Harkleroad again, 6–7(2), 6–4, 7–9, making 101 <b>unforced</b> errors, leading to long-time coach Nigel Sears criticising her attitude publicly. Following the match, her extremely thin physique was noticed for the first time publicly, and some wondered about Hantuchová's health. Kicking off the grass season in Eastbourne, Hantuchová {{lost in the}} quarterfinals to Conchita Martínez, but more famously she lost {{in the second round}} of Wimbledon to Shinobu Asagoe, 6–0, 4–6, 10–12, with Hantuchová breaking down crying during the latter stages of the match and making 57 <b>unforced</b> errors. Some theorized that the media's continued interest regarding her weight and the pressure of success at 19 years of age, in addition to her on-court breakdown and her parents' divorce, as well as her coach's walked out during the middle of the match, led to this breakdown. Following Wimbledon, Hantuchová went 6–8 for the rest of the year, 0–4 against top-10 players She ended the year with an overall record of 28–23, and she fell to No. 17 in the world. Further signs of the pressure and problems she was facing during this period was that, in July, she made herself unavailable for Slovakia in the Fed Cup, in order to concentrate on her singles career, and in November she parted company with Sears.|$|E
25|$|Wang and her {{teammates}} received byes {{into the third}} round of the singles tournament. However, Wang's Olympics came to an end after she was defeated 1–4 by the Dominican Republic's Wu Xue. Seeded fifth in the tournament, Wang was expected to overcome Wu, ranked 50th in the world by the ITTF, without difficulty but made numerous <b>unforced</b> errors. She had beaten Wu at all previous encounters. Team manager Antony Lee attributed Wang's loss to the fact that Wu had played above her usual standard, and that Wang had been unable to cope with the spin from Wu's left-handed serves.|$|E
25|$|Dementieva's next tournament was the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, {{which was}} the first Premier Mandatory event of the year. After {{receiving}} a bye in the first round, she was upset by the Czech Republic's Petra Cetkovská 7–6(2), 2–6, 6–1. At the Sony Ericsson Open, another Premier Mandatory event, Dementieva was seeded fourth but committed 45 <b>unforced</b> errors while losing to 13th seeded Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round 7–5, 6–4. Despite the loss, she achieved her highest career singles ranking of world No. 3. By reaching the top 3, she became the sixth Russian to do so.|$|E
25|$|Li's next {{scheduled}} {{event was}} the BNP Paribas Open, {{where she was}} unable to compete the previous year due to injury. Seeded first at a Premier Mandatory event for the first time, she received a bye in the first round before registering straight set victories over countrywoman Zheng Jie, Karolína Plíšková and Aleksandra Wozniak en route to a quarterfinal clash with Dominika Cibulková, a rematch of the Australian Open final. Though Li committed 54 <b>unforced</b> errors, she prevailed in three sets and faced Flavia Pennetta in the semifinals. There, she was upset in straight sets by the 20th-seeded Italian and eventual champion.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} began with Belarus' Victoria Azarenka and Australia's Samantha Stosur, Azarenka lead their {{head-to-head}} 4–0. With her intense and relentless barrage of deep, penetrating groundstrokes, the No.4-seeded Azarenka never really let the No.7-seeded Stosur into the match, losing just five points in seven service games and breaking {{four times in}} building a 6–2, 5–2 lead. Stosur {{put up a fight}} in a 10-minute final game, saving three match points - including two on big inside out forehand winners - but Azarenka wrapped up the one-hour, 17-minute triumph on her fourth match point. In their winners to <b>unforced</b> errors ratio, Stosur was 11–26, Azarenka was 16–13.|$|E
25|$|The second match saw Agnieszka Radwańska {{trying to}} advance to the semifinals taking on Petra Kvitová. With Kvitová, Victoria Azarenka and Samantha Stosur already through, Radwańska had to take a set from Kvitová on Friday to become the fourth player into the final four. And that goal didn't seem far away at all as she stormed out to a 5–1 first set lead - but Kvitová {{suddenly}} came alive, her power game hitting its mark as she stormed back to take the opening set comfortably in a tie-break. Although there were a few close moments midway through the second set - she went to six deuces before holding in a marathon game for 4–3 - Kvitová never really looked in trouble again, eventually finishing the match off with a big crosscourt forehand that drew one last backhand error from Radwańska. Whether she was winning or losing, Kvitová seemed to be in complete control of the score against Radwańska - she finished the match with 42 winners to 47 <b>unforced</b> errors, while Radwańska had eight winners to 17 <b>unforced</b> errors. Kvitová finished first in the Red Group with a bullet, 3–0 in win-loss and 6–0 in sets. Although Zvonareva, Radwańska and Caroline Wozniacki all ended with a 1–2 win–loss record and 3–5 sets won-lost, Zvonareva had the best games won-lost percentage of the three and thus finished second in the Red Group. The semifinals will be Red Group No.1 Kvitová taking on White Group No.2 Stosur, and White Group No.1 Azarenka taking on Red Group No.2 Zvonareva.|$|E
25|$|The second {{series of}} two Gold Group matches took place, with Juan Martín del Potro coming {{out on top}} {{for the second time}} in two {{meetings}} with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7–6, 7–6. Both players broke their opponent's serve several times, despite the tie-breaks finishes, with del Potro taking the advantage in the first game, and Tsonga immediately breaking back to 2–2, to see the set end in a deciding tie-break the Argentinian took, on an <b>unforced</b> error by his adversary. The second set took the same start as the first, with a break by del Potro, this time held to a 5–4 advantage, when Tsonga once again broke back, forcing another tie-break. Del Potro was once more victorious in the set decider, to clinch his first Masters Cup victory. The match between the first day's winners, Nikolay Davydenko and Novak Djokovic, was their second meeting, after a Davis Cup first round encounter in which Djokovic retired, handing Russia a decisive victory. Davydenko broke in the first service game, holding his advantage until serving at 5–3. Djokovic then broke back, and the set went into a tie-break, which he won, as Davydenko's error count went up during the set decider. The Russian started a comeback, lining up seven straight games to win the second set with a bagel, and lead 1–0 in the third. Djokovic then saved two breaks points, and converted one at 5–5, with Davydenko's <b>unforced</b> errors giving him the break, and eventually the match, on the score of 7–6, 0–6, 7–5. The win meant Tsonga's elimination, and Djokovic's qualification for the semifinals.|$|E
25|$|The last match saw two US {{champion}}s the 2006 champion Maria Sharapova and {{the current}} champion Samantha Stosur. Stosur, the No.7 seed at the year-end finale, turned the tables {{on one of the}} most lopsided head-to-heads in the upper echelon of the women's game, coming out like a house on fire then surviving some tense moments to close out a No.2-ranked, No.2-seeded Sharapova in straight sets 6–1, 7–5. Having lost her last 11 sets in a row to Sharapova, Stosur stormed through the opening set in just 28 minutes, then rallied from 3–0 down in the second set, with Sharapova missing a backhand return on match point. Both players had a similar number of winners throughout the match – Stosur 18, Sharapova 17 – but Sharapova's 30 <b>unforced</b> errors far outweighed Stosur's 17 miscues.|$|E
25|$|An {{attack by}} Japan on the U.S. could not {{guarantee}} the U.S. would declare war on Germany. After such an attack, American public anger would {{be directed at}} Japan, not Germany, just as happened. The Tripartite Pact (Germany, Italy, Japan) called for each to aid another in defense; Japan could not reasonably claim America had attacked Japan if she struck first. For instance, Germany had been {{at war with the}} UK since 1939, and with the USSR since June 1941, without Japanese assistance. There had been a serious, if low-level, naval war going on in the Atlantic between Germany and the U.S. since summer of 1941, as well. Nevertheless, it was only Hitler's declaration of war on 11 December, <b>unforced</b> by treaty, that brought the U.S. into the European war.|$|E
25|$|The first match saw two Slam champions between Li Na and Samantha Stosur, {{with the}} winner {{advancing}} to the semifinals. Samantha Stosur served up a barrage of kick serves and blasted some ferocious forehands to completely confound Li Na in 66 minutes, 6–1, 6–0, improving to 6–0 in the pair's head-to-head series and dealing the Chinese her most lopsided loss on the WTA in almost {{three and a half}} years. Their sixth meeting at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships on Friday was by far their quickest, as Stosur hit far more winners (15 to 4) and was cleaner on the <b>unforced</b> errors (22 to 32) and basically dominated every department, losing her serve from 30-0 up in the fifth game of the match but otherwise winning every game en route to her easiest victory since Dubai in February.|$|E
