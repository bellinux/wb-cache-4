Only in human life we can change our future destiny. After death we lose Kriya Shakti (ability to act) and do (kriyamana) karma <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> born again in another human body.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E

2500|$|Susan Hauptman’s self {{is drawn}} both life-scale and larger-than-life. [...] She draws {{close to a}} {{traditional}} definition of drawing, [...] where the drawing fundamentals of value, tone, shading, composition and, to a lesser extent, line, are formal elements within each work, modulations of elemental light and shadow. These fundamentals are transformed by her— the artist as alchemist. [...] Her work transcends its materiality in and as drawing, offering us both the noun and verb of drawing, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> presented with seemingly autonomous, illusionistic imaginative drawings, moments in an overarching narrative.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{objected to}} Britain's seizure of mail from neutral ships and its blacklisting of firms that did any {{business}} with Germany. Wilson insisted a {{league of nations}} was the solution to ending the war. [...] Wilson found {{it increasingly difficult to}} maintain neutrality, after Germany rescinded earlier promises – the Arabic pledge and the Sussex pledge. Early in 1917 the German ambassador Johann von Bernstorf informed the U.S. of Germany's commitment to unrestricted submarine warfare. Then came the revelation of the Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany attempted to enlist Mexico as a fighting ally. Wilson's reaction after consulting the cabinet and the Congress was a minimal one – that diplomatic relations with the Germans be brought to a halt. The president said, [...] "We are the sincere friends of the German people and earnestly desire to remain at peace with them. We shall not believe they are hostile to us unless or <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> obliged to believe it". In March 1917 several American ships were sunk by Germany; the cabinet was unanimously in favor of war.|$|E
2500|$|Red Cloud's War (1866-1868), {{also known}} as the “Bozeman War” or the “Powder River War”, was an armed {{conflict}} {{after the end of the}} American Civil War involving the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho against the U.S. government in Wyoming Territory and Montana Territory. The Bozeman Trail through the Powder River Country was used by an increasing number of miners, emigrant settlers and others who competed with the Cheyenne and Lakota for resources and encroached on their traditional territory to reach gold fields discovered in Montana around 1863. The Powder River Country was the last unspoiled hunting ground of the Cheyenne and various bands of the Lakota. In late spring 1866, the U.S. government called for a council with the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne at Fort Laramie to discuss a treaty to gain a safe passage for emigrant settlers through the Powder River Country and construct forts along the trail. On June 5, 1866, Red Cloud appeared at Ft. Laramie with a thousand warriors to attend the council, and was outraged to learn that the U.S. Army was bringing in troops to construct forts before the Lakota had agreed to a military road through the area. Red Cloud refused to sign a treaty and left the council in protest, and promising resistance to any whites who sought to use the trail or to occupy the Powder River Country. Red Cloud scolded the Peace Commissioner for treating the Indians like children. “The white men have crowded the Indians back year by year, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> forced to live in a small country North of the Platte. And now our last hunting ground, the home of the people, is to be taken from us. Our women and children will starve, but for my part I prefer to die fighting rather than of starvation. Great Father sends presents and wants a new road. But white chief goes with soldiers to steal road before Indian says yes or no.” “Chief Red Cloud strode past Colonel Henry B. Carrington, and before dawn next day, the Oglala Lakota were gone from Ft. Laramie.” Despite Red Cloud’s warnings, Colonel Carrington marched into the Powder River Country with 750 men and garrisoned forts along the Bozeman Trail. One of the new garrison posts was Fort Phil Kearny, a flash point with Red Cloud. Fort Kearny was known to the Indians as the [...] "hated post on the Little Piney." [...] In response, by late summer Red Cloud had recruited a force of approximately three thousand Oglala Lakota, Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors to oppose U.S. military expansion. The majority of warriors had only bows and arrows and a small arsenal of rifles and ammunition smuggled by Wágluȟe from Ft. Laramie. Red Cloud's warriors soon strategically attacked supply trains and closed the trail. Carrington, a lawyer who made forts with no combat experience, was logistically unable to provide escorts to whites on the trail or to engage in aggressive operations. Carrington respected the fighting ability of Red Cloud, his better knowledge of the terrain and superior numbers. [...] Carrington was in trouble. Red Cloud and the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho were for preparing for battle.|$|E
