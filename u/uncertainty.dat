5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least <b>uncertainty,</b> often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The <b>uncertainty</b> in these constants is then determined from the <b>uncertainty</b> of the others by the propagation of <b>uncertainty.</b> Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units {{in which they are}} expressed, don't have an <b>uncertainty</b> associated with them, so they do not account for any extra <b>uncertainty</b> {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>uncertainties</b> in supply chain when western companies outsourcing manufacturing operations to china. A {{large amount of}} <b>uncertainties</b> could happen in supply chain and they are divided into 3 groups including supply <b>uncertainties,</b> process <b>uncertainties</b> and demand <b>uncertainties.</b> The survey aims to identify what <b>uncertainties</b> most frequently occur in supply chain, what kinds of activities {{have been taken to}} reduce <b>uncertainties</b> and whether these activities are effective in practice. According to the survey result, this paper provides some recommendations on how to lessen those frequent <b>uncertainties</b> in supply chain as well. The findings show that <b>uncertainties</b> most concerned by western outsourcing companies are lack of quick response, long order-cycle time, quality problems and delivery delays, while in the eyes of Chinese supplier, it could be demand changes and transport <b>uncertainties.</b> Some activities, like quality control techniques, are effective in solving certain <b>uncertainties</b> while others are not. It is necessary for both Chinese suppliers and western companies to take more efforts on better control of supply chain <b>uncertainties...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{computational}} mechanics of complex dynamical systems, robust design consists in finding designs of mechanical systems by solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems using numerical models which are little sensitive to <b>uncertainties</b> {{in the vicinity}} of the design point. All the published works in robust design concern data <b>uncertainties</b> and not model <b>uncertainties.</b> In the present work, a probabilistic methodology is proposed to solve the robust design optimization problem not only with respect to data <b>uncertainties</b> but also with respect to model <b>uncertainties</b> in the context of dynamical systems. The possible designs are represented by a numerical finite element model whose parameters belong to an admissible set of design variables. The nonparametric model of random <b>uncertainties</b> is used for taking into account model <b>uncertainties</b> and data <b>uncertainties...</b>|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, when {{practical}} systems are modelled, <b>uncertainties</b> of system parameters are often included. Therefore, {{most of the}} systems refer to <b>uncertainties</b> in real applications. Indeed, basically, two kinds of <b>uncertainties</b> are simultaneously encountered in the open literature, widely polytopic <b>uncertainties</b> and norm-bounded. From the practical viewpoint, {{it is important to}} investigate switched systems with uncertain parameters [19, 20, 24, 28 – 30, 33, 36]. Thus, polytopic <b>uncertainties</b> exist in many real systems, and most of the uncertain systems can be approximated by systems with polytopic <b>uncertainties</b> [34]. On the other hand, the polytopic uncertain systems are less conservative than systems with norm-bounded <b>uncertainties</b> [35].|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} table catalogues {{the notable}} changes in determination of fundamental physical constants. The constants {{are expressed in}} direct measurements and fixed constants to minimize and determine the <b>uncertainty.</b> Some constants in that expression do not contribute significantly to the uncertainty; only the significant factors are noted. The value of the relative <b>uncertainty</b> by the data of CODATA of 2014 is given, and is expressed in the relative <b>uncertainty</b> of the significant factors, noted with ur(constant). An approximately equals sign (≈) is used if an <b>uncertainty</b> is only approximated by the expression. This is due to unsignificant factors or rounding errors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uncertainty</b> {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} <b>uncertainty,</b> evidential <b>uncertainty,</b> ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual <b>uncertainty</b> arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential <b>uncertainty</b> is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential <b>uncertainty,</b> and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E

40|$|The {{consideration}} of <b>uncertainties</b> in numerical simulation is generally reason-able {{and is often}} indicated {{in order to provide}} reliable results, and thus is gaining attraction in various fields of simulation technology. However, in multibody system analysis <b>uncertainties</b> have only been accounted for quite sporadically compared to other areas. The term <b>uncertainties</b> is frequently associated with those of random nature, i. e. aleatory <b>uncertainties,</b> which are successfully handled by the use of probability theory. Actually, a considerable proportion of <b>uncertainties</b> incorporated into dy-namical systems, in general, or multibody systems, in particular, is attributed to so-called epistemic <b>uncertainties,</b> which include, amongst others, <b>uncertainties</b> {{due to a lack of}} knowledge, due to subjectivity in numerical implementation, and due to simplification or idealization. Hence, for the modeling of epistemic <b>uncertainties</b> in multibody systems an appropriate theory is required, which still remains a challeng-ing topic.
