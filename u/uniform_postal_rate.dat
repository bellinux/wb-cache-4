All post was {{transferred}} from the post office of origination to distribution points called sorting stations, and from there the post was then sent on for delivery to the receiver of the post. Initially it was {{the recipient of the}} post who paid the fee, and he had the right to refuse to accept the item if he did not wish to pay. The charge was based on the distance the item had been carried so the GPO had to keep a separate account for each item. In 1840 the Uniform Penny Post was introduced, which incorporated the two key innovations of a <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> <b>rate,</b> which cut administrative costs and encouraged use of the system, and adhesive pre-paid stamp.|$|E

50|$|On 29 January 1583 Sebastiano Montelupi and {{his nephew}} (and adopted heir), Valerio Montelupi, {{were given a}} {{contract}} to run the postal service for five years. When giving the contract the King, Stefan Batory, introduced a <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> <b>rate</b> of 4 groszy per letter not exceeding 1 łut (about 12.66 grams) for any distance in Poland. This was the first <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> <b>rate</b> to be introduced in the world. Sebastiano Montelupi died in 1600 aged 84 and Valerio Montelupi continued to run the postal service till his death in 1613.|$|E
50|$|Perforated stamps {{began in}} 1862 and, {{starting}} on 1 January 1863, <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> went into effect. In 1862 Count Ambjörn Sparre won the stamp contract, but his designs were not liked, {{and he seemed}} unable to produce the stamps. In danger of running out of stamps altogether, {{at the end of}} 1862 the Italian government once again turned to Matraire, who quickly produced a 15c value by lithography.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{a parcel}} post may be {{credited}} to Germany, where the growth of railways had brought <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> throughout Germany and Austria in 1857. The practice of forwarding parcels with the mail, however, had been in use in Austria since the seventeenth century and in some German states is said to date to the fifteenth century. In {{the first year after}} the establishment of the domestic parcel post in Germany (1874), 38,862,654 parcels were carried, rising to 62,946,100 by 1881.|$|R
50|$|The Basel Dove is {{a notable}} stamp {{issued by the}} Swiss canton of Basel. It was the first tricolor stamp {{in the world and}} was issued on 1 July 1845 with a value of 2½-rappen and was the only postage stamp issued by Basel. At the time each canton was {{responsible}} for its own postal service. There were no <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> for Switzerland until after the establishment of a countrywide postal service on 1 January 1849. The only other cantons to issue their own stamps were Zürich and Geneva.|$|R

5000|$|Postal {{services}} grew {{throughout the}} Australian colonies {{as they were}} established. A regular overland service between Sydney and Melbourne, Port Phillip District began in 1838. Also in 1838, the first prepaid [...] "stamped" [...] letter sheets were introduced in Sydney. By 1849, <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> were established by agreement between the colonies. Prepaid adhesive stamps were introduced in the 1850s. Victoria {{was the first to}} make prepayment by stamps compulsory in 1852. Monthly steamship sea mail to the United Kingdom was established in 1856. The separate colonies joined the Universal Postal Union in 1891.|$|R
25|$|Hill has two legacies. The {{first was}} his model for {{education}} of the emerging middle classes. The second was his model for an efficient postal system to serve business and the public, including the postage stamp and the system of low and <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> <b>rates,</b> which is often taken for granted in the modern World. In this, he not only changed postal services around the world, but also made commerce more efficient and profitable, notwithstanding {{the fact that it}} took 30 years before the British Post Office's revenue recovered to the level it had been at in 1839. Uniform Penny Post continued in the UK into the 20th century, and at one point, one penny paid for up to four ounces.|$|R
50|$|On 6 April 1850 the Austro-German Postal Union {{agreement}} was concluded between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Prussia {{to take effect}} from 1 July 1850.

It subsequently became the model for the creation of the Universal Postal Union in 1874.|$|R
5000|$|An Act of Congress of March 3, 1845 (effective July 1, 1845), {{established}} uniform (and mostly reduced) <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> {{throughout the}} nation, with a uniform rate of five cents for distances under 300 miles (500 km) and ten cents for distances between 300 and 3000 miles. However, Congress did not authorize {{the production of}} stamps for nationwide use until 1847; still, postmasters realized that standard rates now {{made it feasible to}} produce and sell [...] "provisional" [...] issues for prepayment of <b>uniform</b> <b>postal</b> fees, and printed these in bulk. Such provisionals included both prepaid envelopes and stamps, mostly of crude design, the New York Postmaster's Provisional being the only one of quality comparable to later stamps.|$|R
