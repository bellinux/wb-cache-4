60|$|The magnanimity which resolved, {{that for}} principle's sake no {{efforts should be}} spared to crush a bestial despotism, was {{acknowledged}} by every manly spirit whom Party degenerating into Faction had not vitiated. That such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt; and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue; but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no {{small portion of the}} obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved. The power of Napoleon Buonaparte was overthrown--his person has disappeared from the theatre of Europe--his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly Journals--but as he has left no Successor, as there is no foreign Tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear, many honest English Patriots must either find, or set up, something at home for the employment of those affections. This is too natural to occasion surprise; thousands are so framed, that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object, unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite.--Thus we see Men, who had been proud of their attachment to his Majesty's Ministers, during the awful struggle, {{as soon as it was}} over, allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion, and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation.--Through this infirmity, many were betrayed into taking part with the Men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned; and assisted them in reviling their own Government for suffering, among the States of the Continent, institutions to remain which the respective nations (surely the best, if not the only judges in the case) were unwilling to part with; and for having permitted things to be done, either just and proper in themselves, or if indeed abuses, abuses of that kind which Great Britain had neither right to oppose, nor power to prevent. Not a Frenchman is in arms in Spain! But (alas for the credit of the English Cabinet!) Ferdinand, though a lawful, appears to be a sorry King; and the Inquisition, though venerated by the People of Spain as a holy tribunal, which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years, is, among Protestants, an abomination! Is that, however, a reason why we should not rejoice that Spain is restored to the rank of an Independent nation; and that her resources do not continue at the disposal of a foreign Tyrant, for the annoyance of Great Britain? Prussia no longer receives decrees from the Tuilleries; but nothing, we are told, is gained by this deliverance; because the Sovereign of that Country has not participated, as far as became him, a popular effervescence; and has withheld from his subjects certain privileges which they have proved themselves, to all but heated judgments, not yet qualified to receive. Now, if numbers can blame, without cause, the British Cabinet for events falling below their wishes, in cases remote from their immediate concerns, the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick.--Yes, in spite of the outcry of such Men to the contrary, every enlightened Politician and discerning Patriot, however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances, will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the State. The Habeas Corpus Act is also our own near concern; it was suspended, some think without sufficient cause; not so, however, the Persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the Country; for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure, at all times so obnoxious, by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency. 'But persuasion (an Objector will say) is produced in many ways; and even that degree of it which in these matters passes for conviction, depends less upon external testimony than on the habits and feelings of those by whom the testimony is to be weighed and decided upon. A council for the administration of affairs is far from being as favourably circumstanced as a tribunal of law; for the Party, which is to pronounce upon the case, has had to procure the evidence, the sum and quality of which must needs have been affected by previously existing prejudices, and by any bias received in the process of collecting it.--The privileges of the subject, one might think, would never be unjustifiably infringed, if it were only from considerations of self-interest; but power is apt to resort to unnecessary rigour in order to supply the deficiencies of authority forfeited by remissness; it is also not unfrequently exerted merely to shew that it is possessed; to shew this to others while power is a novelty, and when it has long ceased to be so, to prove it to ourselves. Impatience of mind, moreover, puts men upon the use of strong and coarse tools, when those of lighter make and finer edge, with due care, might execute the work much better. Above all, timidity flies to extremes;--if the elements were at our command, how often would an inundation be called for, when a fire-engine would have proved equal to the service!--Much more might be urged in this strain, and similar suggestions are all that the question will admit of; for to suppose a gross appetite of tyranny in Government, would be an insult to the reader's understanding. Happily for the Inhabitants of Westmoreland, as no dispositions existing among them could furnish a motive for this restrictive measure, so they will not be sorry that their remoteness from scenes of public confusion, has placed them where they will be slow to give an <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinion</b> upon its merits. Yet it will not escape their discernment, that, if doubts might have been entertained whether the ignorant and distressed multitude, in other parts of the Island, were actually brought to a state that justified the suspension of this law, such doubts must have been weakened, if not wholly removed, by the subsequent behaviour of those in the upper ranks of society, who, in order to arraign the Government, and denounce the laws, have seized every opportunity of palliating sedition, if not of exculpating treason. O far better to employ bad men in the detection of foul conspiracies, than to excuse and shelter--(would that I were allowed to confine myself to these words)--than to reward and honour--every one that can contrive to make himself conspicuous by courses which, wherever they are not branded with infamy, find the national character in a state of degradation, ominous (if it should spread) for the existence of all that ought to be dear to Englishmen.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is required to annually prepare and submit audited financial statements of the U. S. government to the President and Congress. We are required to audit these consolidated financial statements (CFS) and report {{on the results of}} our work. An issue meriting concern and close scrutiny that emerged during our fiscal year 2004 CFS audit was the growing number of Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies that restated certain of their financial statements for fiscal year 2003 to correct errors. Errors in financial statements can result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial statements were prepared. Frequent restatements to correct errors can undermine public trust and confidence in both the entity and all responsible parties. Further, when restatements do occur, it is important that financial statements clearly communicate and readers of the restated financial statements understand that the financial statements originally issued by management in the previous year and the opinion thereon should no longer be relied on and instead the restated financial statements and related auditor's opinion should be used. Nine of the 11 agencies that had restatements for fiscal year 2003 received <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinions</b> on their originally issued fiscal year 2003 financial statements. The auditors for 6 of these 9 agencies issued <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinions</b> on the restated financial statements, replacing the previous <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinions</b> on the respective agencies' original fiscal year 2003 financial statements. The auditors for 2 of these 9 withdrew their <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinions</b> on the fiscal year 2003 financial statements and issued other than <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinions</b> on the respective agencies' restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements because they could not determine whether there were any additional misstatements and the effect of any such misstatements on the restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements. For the remaining agency, the principal auditor of the agency's fiscal year 2004 financial statements was not the principal auditor of the agency's fiscal year 2003 financial statements, and an audit opinion on the agency's restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements was not issued. Because of the varying nature and circumstances surrounding the restatements, we are issuing a number of separate reports on the matter. This report communicates our observations regarding State's fiscal year 2003 restatements. We reviewed four key areas with respect to the restatements of State's fiscal year 2003 financial statements: (1) the nature and cause of the errors that necessitated the restatements, including planned corrective actions by the agency and its auditors; (2) the timing of communicating the material misstatement to users of the financial statements; (3) the extent of transparency exhibited in disclosing the nature and impact of the material misstatement in the financial statements and the reissued auditor's report; and (4) audit issues that contributed to the failure to detect the errors that necessitated the restatements during the audit of the agency's fiscal year 2003 financial statements. ...|$|R

This fact raises questions why firms receiving <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinion</b> stop operating. The assessment of going concern has to be delivered by auditor and added into audit opinion.  An auditor is responsible to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue its operation for a reasonable period of time. This research aims to investigate the effect of bankruptcy prediction model, firm growth, leverage, and auditor reputation on going concern audit opinion. The result shows that bankruptcy prediction model affects the accuracy of going concern opinion issue. However, the firm growth, leverage, and auditor reputation do not do so...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} effects of size, profitability, and {{financial}} distress on information regulatory noncompliance (IRN) of firms listed in the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX). The firms’ IRN {{in this study is}} measured by the firm noncompliance on the timeliness regulation, i. e. whether firms submit financial statement to the Indonesian Capital Market Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM) on, before, or after the due date. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide preliminary empirical evidences about the timeliness of financial reporting which is still very limited in emerging market such as Indonesia. This study found that return on asset (ROA) is a determining factor to noncompliance behaviour of the firms in meeting the timeliness requirement. Inconsistent with previous studies (e. g., Whittred 1980 and Givoly and Palmon 1982), this study found that auditor opinion has no association with the noncompliance since most of the financial statements of noncomplying firms have <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinions.</b> The results are partially consistent with previous studies such as those of Schwartz and Soo (1996) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO continues to have concerns about restatements to federal agencies' previously issued financial statements. During fiscal year 2005, at least 7 of the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies restated certain of their fiscal year 2004 financial statements to correct misstatements. To study this trend, GAO reviewed the nature and causes of the restatements made by certain CFO Act agencies in fiscal year 2004 to their fiscal year 2003 financial statements. Eleven CFO Act agencies had restatements for fiscal year 2003. Nine of those 11 received <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinions</b> on their originally issued fiscal year 2003 financial statements. GAO's view is that users of federal agencies' financial statements and the related audit reports need to be provided at least {{a basic understanding of}} why a restatement was necessary and its effect on the agencies' previously issued financial statements and related audit reports. This report communicates GAO's observations on the transparency and timeliness of the 9 federal agencies' and their auditors' restatement disclosures. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{efficiency}} of four classification techniques, namely discriminant analysis, logit analysis, UTADIS multicriteria decision aid, and nearest neighbours, {{in the development of}} classification models that could assist auditors during the examination of Asian commercial banks. To develop the auditing models and examine their classification ability, the dataset is split into two distinct samples. The training sample consists of 1, 701 unqualified financial statements and 146 ones that received a qualified opinion over the period 1996 – 2001. The models are tested in a holdout sample of 527 unqualified financial statements and 52 ones that received a qualified opinion over the period 2002 – 2004. The results show that the developed auditing models can discriminate between financial statements that should receive qualified opinions from the ones that should receive <b>unqualified</b> <b>opinions</b> with an out-of-sample accuracy around 60 %. The highest classification accuracy is achieved by UTADIS, followed by logit analysis, nearest neighbours and discriminant analysis. Both financial variables and the environment in which banks operate appear to be important factors...|$|R
