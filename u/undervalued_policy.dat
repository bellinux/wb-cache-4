40|$|The current {{federal budget}} debate is sharply focused on implausible {{solutions}} that {{are bound to}} fail. The unsustainable deficits that are now anticipated cannot be repaired by the popular rhetori-cal fallback on cuts in domestic discretionary spending. A truly effective budget policy will re-quire difficult political compromises amidst a tangle of political “third rails”: abandoning the un-necessary goal of a balanced budget, cutting funds for defense and entitlements, and increasing taxes. The public debate on budget reform should also recognize that the supply-side virtues of tax cuts and deficit reduction have been overblown, while the benefits of public investment for eco-nomic and social welfare have been routinely and blindly <b>undervalued.</b> <b>Policies</b> that cannot succeed at putting the U. S. budget in order—for example, reductions in domestic discretionary spending—will be rendered increasingly irrelevant by the inexorable and unsustainable growth in health care entitlement costs, an issue that {{will come to the}} forefront of the budget debate with the retirement of the baby boom generation. Ill-conceived cuts in domestic spending and unnecessary obstacles to public investment will only exacerbate problems, not solve them. Policies aimed at accomplishing tax increases, defense cuts, and slower growth in entitle-ment spending must be put on the table...|$|R

30|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, {{government}} <b>policies</b> <b>undervalue</b> or actively discourage pastoralism, especially mobile pastoralism. Europe is an exception to this trend. Backed by scientific evidence, European Union (EU) policies officially endorse low intensity, transhumant livestock management in Europe as a source of diverse environmental, economic and cultural benefits. Far from seeking to eradicate mobile pastoralism, the European Union explicitly attempts to preserve it, through economic subsidies to livestock farmers, and programmes aimed at marginal grassland areas.|$|R

For an economy where the LBD externality operates in the traded sector, real exchange rate undervaluation may be used to internalize this externality, if the LBD calls for subsidizing employment in the traded sector.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theory that}} {{an important source of}} value is missing from conventional theory of the demand for health insurance, namely, the effect of the transfer of income (from those who purchase insurance and remain healthy to those who purchase insurance and become ill) on purchases of medical care. Because the portion of moral hazard that is attributable to income is welfare increasing and would replace some of moral hazard that is spuriously deemed to be welfare decreasing, the new theory suggests that the value of health insurance has been dramatically <b>undervalued.</b> Implications for <b>policy</b> are outlined...|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, the Columbus Dispatch {{noted that}} Brown [...] "loves to rail against {{international}} trade agreements." [...] Brown's book, Myths of Free Trade, argues that [...] "an unregulated global {{economy is a}} threat to all of us."

40|$|The essay {{presents}} the principal trends in migrations policies adopted in different OECD countries (block policies for structural needs, selective policies and brain drain processes) underlining, {{for each of}} them, the aspects of contradiction. The Author tries to demonstrate how {{a lot of the}} apparent failures of migration policies depend {{of the fact that the}} official aims of them often does not correspond to the latent one. In fact, the empirical phenomenology of migration rarely coincides with that represented by the policies that pretend to control it. At the centre of this plot of contradictions there are the ethnic networks, the role of which in structuring migration processes and in addressing insertion in society and in labour market is too often <b>undervalued</b> by <b>policies.</b> It is also stressed another problematic feature of immigration policies, that is the low finalisation to a circular process between economic inclusion and social integration, with relevant consequences on both aspects (increase of irregular work, temporary immigration, discrimination, etc.). The principal problem is recognised in an absence of a strategic vision of the policies that aim to create an integrated society and to carry on economic programs and social measures at the same time. The capacity of the society to recognise the link between immigrant labour and local development and competitiveness plans is estimated as the key for success policies...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE Out-of-pocket {{cost sharing}} {{for health care}} {{expenses}} is a growing bur-den. Prior research has emphasized the medical consequences of cost sharing. This study investigates the range of social, medical, fi nancial, and sometimes legal disruptions from high out-of-pocket health expenses. METHODS We conducted open-ended, semistructured interviews with 33 insured patients (two-thirds covered by Medicare). All had chronic illnesses and sought philanthropic fi nancial assistance. RESULTS We found that high levels of cost sharing precipitated considerable anxiety and substantial debt problems, as well as disruptions of medical care. Participants described various borrowing strategies (eg, credit cards), legal prob-lems (eg, debt collections), and threats to their nonmedical household budgets (eg, food, housing). Participants described explicit and rank-ordered strategies for coping with new medical expenses. Participants understood their health benefi ts with exceptional detail but described considerable anxiety about changes to those benefi ts that could easily disrupt carefully managed household budgets. Benefi t designs that resulted in large a variations in fi nancial liability from month to month (eg, large deductibles or coverage gaps) imposed considerable fi nancial challenges. CONCLUSIONS As health care cost sharing grows, policy makers will {{need to consider the}} consequences of high cost sharing for families facing strained household budgets. Although the generosity of health insurance is important, continuity of benefi ts and month-to-month stability of fi nancial liability are also important and may be <b>undervalued</b> in <b>policy</b> discussions.

40|$|Background. Hospital doctors face {{significant}} {{challenges in}} the current health care environment, working with staff shortages and cutbacks to health care expenditure, alongside increased demand for health care and increased public expectations. Objective. This article analyses challenges faced by junior hospital doctors, providing insight into the experiences of these frontline staff in delivering health services in recessionary times. Design. A qualitative methodology was chosen. Methods. Semi-structured in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} 20 doctors from urban Irish hospitals. Interviews were recorded via note taking. Full transcripts were analysed thematically using NVivo software. Results. Dominant themes included the following: (1) unrealistic workloads: characterised by staff shortages, extended working hours, irregular and frequently interrupted breaks; (2) fatigue and its impact: the quality of care provided to patients while doctors were sleep-deprived was questioned; however, little reflection was given to any impact this may have had on junior doctors own health; (3) undervalued and disillusioned: insufficient training, intensive workloads and a perceived lack of power to influence change resulted in a sense of detachment among junior doctors. They appeared immune to their surroundings. Conclusion. Respondents ascribed little importance to the impact of current working conditions on their own health. They felt their roles were underappreciated and <b>undervalued</b> by <b>policy</b> makers and hospital management. Respondents were concerned with the lack of time and opportunity for training. This study highlighted several ‘red flags’, which need to be addressed in order to increase retention and sustain a motivated junior medical workforce...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the degree to}} which the learning by doing externality [LBD] calls for an undervalued exchange rate, a policy suggested by recent empirical studies which concluded that mildly undervalued real exchange rate may enhance growth. We obtain mixed results. For an economy where LBD externality operates in the traded sector, real exchange rate undervaluation may be used in order to internalize this externality, if the LBD calls for subsidizing employment in the traded sector. Yet, we also find that these results are not robust to changes in the nature of the LBD externality. If the LBD externality is embodied in aggregate investment, the optimal policy calls for subsidizing the cost of capital in the traded sector, and there is no room for <b>undervalued</b> exchange rate <b>policy.</b> In addition, a deliberate undervaluation by means of hoarding reserves may backfire if the needed sterilization would increase the cost of investment in the traded sector. ...|$|R
30|$|Most {{conservation}} policies concerning lentic-breeding amphibians, {{including those}} in King County, WA, are focused on wetland protection through fixed-width buffers (Hayes et al. 2008, Richter et al. 2008). These are typically determined based on wetland size, type, function, and surrounding vegetation types (Hayes et al. 2008, Richter and Azous 2001). These <b>policies</b> <b>undervalue</b> the condition of adjacent terrestrial habitat types for amphibians or other wildlife. Regulatory wetland buffers in Washington ranged from 15.2 to 91.4  m in width (McMillan 1998), but such buffers are {{much smaller than the}} 200  m to 5 + km distance that R. aurora may need to migrate in order to access its necessary resources. Despite the fact that King County’s regulations are acknowledged to be effective within R. aurora habitat range, they are still unlikely to maintain landscape-level connectivity needed by R. aurora in the face of rapid population growth (Hayes et al. 2008, Richter et al. 2008). Therefore, if the goal is to avoid extirpation of R. aurora populations in urbanizing areas of the PNW, jurisdictions should consider protecting sufficiently large-scale terrestrial and breeding habitat connectivity that can facilitate inter-population dispersal and migration across broader landscapes (Semlitsch and Bodie 1998, Hayes et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|Protected {{open spaces}} - public parks, {{preserved}} farmland, and private conserved lands - provide substantial economic, environmental, {{and public health}} benefits to surrounding communities. These benefits, however, are generally not well understood and are often <b>undervalued</b> in <b>policy</b> debates and investment decisions. In the interest of fostering {{a better understanding of}} these benefits, this study estimates the economic value generated by protected open space in southeastern Pennsylvania. Approximately 14 percent of the land area in Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties is protected open space. This area includes parks and trails such as Ridley Creek State Park and the Schuylkill River Trail, working farms across southeastern Pennsylvania, and private land trust owned or eased lands. Building off of previous valuation studies and using standard economic analysis techniques, this study estimates the value of protected open space in southeastern Pennsylvania by measuring impacts across four areas: (1) the effects of protected open space on residential property values, (2) the value associated with environmental services provided by southeastern Pennsylvania's protected open spaces, (3) the value of recreational activity on protected open space and associated avoided health-care costs, and (4) jobs and revenue created as a result of activity on and connected to protected open space. This analysis indicates that protected open space adds significant value to the regional economy (see right), with benefits accruing to businesses, governments, and households. The economic benefits generated by protected open space accrue in different ways - some are direct revenue streams to individuals or governments, some represent asset appreciation value, some accrue in the form of avoided costs. Because these values differ in nature, the estimates in this study should not be added together to produce a single aggregate value of protected open space in southeastern Pennsylvania. The estimates presented in this study should provide elected leaders, policy makers, and the public with a new perspective on the value of protected open space and contribute to informed decisions concerning future development in southeastern Pennsylvania. It is important to note, however, that this study does not analyze the costs associated with acquiring, preserving, or maintaining land as protected open space, and does not represent a cost-benefit approach...|$|R

STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Loss of public funding in Ireland has led to large numbers of Irish trained doctors emigrating. Research indicates the likelihood of medical graduates returning depends on improvements to working conditions. Good working conditions are likely to encourage doctor retention yet little research has been conducted in this area. What does this study add? Intense workplace demands reduce confidence and productivity among doctors. Junior doctors were reluctant to reflect on the impact current working conditions had on their own health. Early warning signs of burnout appear to resonate with many of the issues raised by junior doctors in this study...|$|R
40|$|Aim: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} family physicians’ views on caesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR). Material and Method: Fourty-nine family physicians were included and a questionnaire covered socio-demographic characteristics, {{their own or}} their partners’ delivery modes, the reasons behind their choice of caesarean delivery, views on CDMR as a human right and their opinions on the reason behind the increasing rates of caesarean deliveries was administered by one-on-one interviews. Results: Twenty eight (57. 1 %) women in the group underwent caesarean delivery. Fear of delivery pain was mentioned as the main factor (n= 13, 46. 4 %) behind the CDMR,  pregnancies achived by assisted reproductive technologies (n= 1, 3. 6 %) and request for tubal sterilization (n= 2, 7. 1 %) were the other causes. Only 12 women (42. 9 %) underwent caesarean delivery with a medical indication. While 30 (61. 2 %) physicians refused accepting CDMR as a human right, 19 (38. 8 %) physicians supported women’s right of choosing their modes of delivery and obstetricians’ inducement (n= 25, 51. 0 %) and women’s fear for vaginal delivery pain (n= 20, 40. 8 %) were mentioned as the main causes behind {{the increase in the}} rate of caesarean delivery. Discussion: CDMR seems to continue being {{one of the most controversial}} subjects in obstetrics. The family physicians’ attitudes  plays an important part in the decisions made by mothers regarding the preferred delivery modes so it should not be <b>undervalued</b> while creating <b>policies</b> for decreasing the high caesarean rates...|$|R
