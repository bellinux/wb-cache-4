40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causes and welfare {{consequences}} of <b>unravelling</b> in two-sided matching markets.

It also shows that any Pareto-optimal mechanism must prevent <b>unravelling,</b> and that the ex-post stable mechanism is Pareto-optimal if and only if it prevents <b>unravelling.</b> Two-sided matching <b>Unravelling</b> Similarity of preferences...|$|R

5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who <b>unravel</b> and toss them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E

Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E
