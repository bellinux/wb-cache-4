25|$|Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or {{oesophagogastroduodenoscopy}} (EGD or OGD) is {{also called}} panendoscopy (PES) and upper GI endoscopy. It is also often called just <b>upper</b> <b>endoscopy,</b> upper GI, {{or even just}} endoscopy; because EGD is the most commonly performed type of endoscopy, the ambiguous term endoscopy is sometimes informally {{used to refer to}} EGD by default. The term gastroscopy literally focuses on the stomach alone, but in practice the usage overlaps.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis is very difficult, {{and usually}} one of exclusion. SMA {{syndrome}} is thus considered only after patients have undergone an extensive evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract including <b>upper</b> <b>endoscopy,</b> and evaluation for various malabsorptive, ulcerative and inflammatory instestinal conditions {{with a higher}} diagnostic frequency. Diagnosis may follow x-ray examination revealing duodenal dilation followed by abrupt constriction proximal to the overlying SMA, {{as well as a}} delay in transit of four to six hours through the gastroduodenal region. [...] Standard diagnostic exams include abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI), and, for equivocal cases, hypotonic duodenography. [...] In addition, vascular imaging studies such as ultrasound and contrast angiography may be used to indicate increased bloodflow velocity through the SMA or a narrowed SMA angle.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increasing the {{appropriateness}} of use of <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal (GI) <b>endoscopy</b> is important to improve quality of care {{while at the same}} time containing costs. This study explored whether detailed explicit appropriateness criteria significantly improve the diagnostic yield of <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopy.</b> METHODS: Consecutive patients referred for <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopy</b> at 6 centers (1 university hospital, 2 district hospitals, 3 gastroenterology practices) were prospectively included over a 6 -month period. After controlling for disease presentation and patient characteristics, the relationship between {{the appropriateness}} of <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopy,</b> as assessed by explicit Swiss criteria developed by the RAND/UCLA panel method, and the presence of relevant endoscopic lesions was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 2088 patients (60 % outpatients, 57 % men) were included. Analysis was restricted to the 1681 patients referred for diagnostic <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopy.</b> Forty-six percent of <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopies</b> were judged to be appropriate, 15 % uncertain, and 39 % inappropriate by the explicit criteria. No cancer was found in <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopies</b> judged to be inappropriate. <b>Upper</b> GI <b>endoscopies</b> judged appropriate or uncertain yielded significantly more relevant lesions (60 %) than did those judged to be inappropriate (37 %; odds ratio 2. 6 : 95 % CI [2. 2, 3. 2]). In multivariate analyses, the diagnostic yield of <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopy</b> was significantly influenced by appropriateness, patient gender and age, treatment setting, and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Upper</b> GI <b>endoscopies</b> performed for appropriate indications resulted in detecting significantly more clinically relevant lesions than did those performed for inappropriate indications. In addition, no <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopy</b> that resulted in a diagnosis of cancer was judged to be inappropriate. The use of such criteria improves patient selection for <b>upper</b> GI <b>endoscopy</b> and can thus contribute to efforts aimed at enhancing the quality and efficiency of care.

40|$|Endoscopic {{procedures}} are usually {{carried out in}} order to diagnose the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). We aimed to evaluate endoscopic findings of our patients with iron deficiency anemia retrospectively. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed our computerized data of patients who attended to Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital Gastroentology Endoscopy Unit between 2008 and 2010 years. Patients in whom <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> and/or colonoscopy were performed in order to diagnose the cause of IDA were included in this study. Results: This study included 490 patients with iron deficiency anemia in whom <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> and/or colonoscopy were performed. The mean age of patients was 58. 94 ± 14. 8 years. Of these patients, 288 (172 female, 116 male) underwent only <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy,</b> 116 (61 female, 55 male) underwent only colonoscopy and 84 (39 male, 45 female) underwent both <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> and colonoscopy. The rates of failure to reveal the cause of IDA in patients in whom either <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> or colonoscopy had been performed were 18. 75 % and 46. 55 %, respectively. On other hand, the ratio of failure to reveal the cause of IDA was 3. 48 % in patients in whom both <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> and colonoscopy had been performed. Conclusion: When referring any patient with iron deficiency anemia to endoscopy unit, ordering both <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> and colonoscopy may allow us to find the reason more accurately...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Upper</b> {{gastrointestinal}} <b>endoscopy</b> {{has been}} reported as {{a risk factor for}} the transmission of Helicobacter pylori. the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the possibility of transmission of H. pylori infection by <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> in patients who had previously had such procedures in a low disinfection level environment. Methods: the study included 1082 patients. Patients that had undergone <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> or were treated with antibiotics 15 days before the index endoscopy were excluded. H. pylori infection was diagnosed by ultra-rapid urease test. Variables analyzed were age, gender, type of dyspepsia (organic or functional), and the number of previous <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopies.</b> Results: Overall prevalence of H. pylori infection was 60 %. Patients ranged in age from 13 to 94 years (mean = 45. 8, SD = 15. 7) and the number of previous <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopies</b> ranged from 0 to 20 (mean = 1. 5, SD = 2. 4). in 53. 3 % of the patients, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; revealed some mucosal lesion (organic dyspepsia). Prevalence of H. pylori infection was higher in patients with organic rather than functional dyspepsia (71. 1 % vs. 47. 1 %, p < 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopies</b> in patients with and without H. pylori infection. Conclusions: We concluded that there was no association between history of <b>upper</b> gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> and current H. pylori infection in this study population.

40|$|Objective. To develop {{predictive}} {{models for}} positive outcomes of <b>upper</b> and lower <b>endoscopies</b> in children. Methods. Retrospective review of all endoscopies performed from January to December, 2000 at St. Justine Hospital. Predictive models for positive outcomes on endoscopy were constructed for <b>upper</b> and lower <b>endoscopies</b> separately using multiple logistic regression. Results. Age greater than 13 years, hematemesis, epigastric tenderness and hypoalbuminemia were {{significant predictors of}} positive <b>upper</b> <b>endoscopies.</b> Male sex, age and rectal bleeding were significant predictors of positive lower endoscopies.
