Yet, significant investments will still be required to rehabilitate the existing infrastructures, to bring them into conformity with more stringent environmental and health regulations, and to maintain service quality in the future. In the non-OECD countries the challenges are more daunting. Large parts of their population have no access and many suffer from <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>services.</b> Nearly one billion people lack access to clean drinking water and 2. 6 billion people lack access to improved sanitation services.

Any underperformance in order picking can lead to <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>service</b> and high operational cost for its warehouse, and consequently for the whole supply chain. In order to operate efficiently, the orderpicking process needs to be robustly designed and optimally controlled. This paper gives a literature overview on typical decision problems in design and control of manual order-picking processes. We focus on optimal (internal) layout design, storage assignment methods, routing methods, order batching and zoning. The research in this area has grown rapidly recently. Still, combinations of the above areas have hardly been explored. Order-picking system developments in practice lead to promising new research directions.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{behaviour}} of pre-stressed {{and cable}} stayed concrete bridges may be strongly {{affected by the}} time dependent response due to creep and shrinkage of concrete. Same experiences showed us that, even after accurate design assessments, some <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>service</b> behaviour can arise, due to some level of uncertainty in the reference data. In this paper {{the role of the}} uncertainties has been investigated. As sources of uncertainty, the pretensioning forces in the cables, the relative humidity and the concrete strength have been considered. For a given set of data, the creep effects have been handled by means of a step by step computation of the stress history. The effects of the uncertainties have been simulated through a Monte Carlo approach. Two topical cases have been studied. The first set is exemplified by cable stayed bridges. In these structures, the role of uncertainties does not influence the time dependent behaviour sensibly and the system seems to be self-stabilizing over time. The second set is represented by prestressed cantilever-built bridges, for whom the effects of uncertainties cause a significant variance of the tip deflections. Finally, some suggestions to govern such type of delayed behaviours are proposed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{performance}} of Mobile IP (MIP) handoffs {{with respect to the}} three available MIP movement detection methods, namely Lazy Cell Switching, Prefix Matching and Eager Cell Switching.

Since MNs are expected to perform multiple handoffs within the lifetime of a communication, it is important to analyse the impact of a handoff on the overall communication. It will be shown that the disruption caused by the MIP handoff may result in an <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>service</b> for both TCP and UDP applications. It will be identified that the combination of the inherent characteristics of TCP and MIP handoffs may result in a service disruption interval of more than ten seconds.

40|$|Purpose – Services {{recoveries}} following service failures {{not only}} imply customer recovery opportunities in which customer-company relationships can be restored, {{they can also}} result in process improvements (i. e. process recoveries in literature). This paper seeks to identify the additional impact of process recoveries on four customer outcome variables (satisfaction with service recovery, overall satisfaction, repurchase intent and word-of-mouth) by communicating these improvements back to the complaining customers. In addition, we test for outcome differences depending {{on the level of}} customer recovery a complaining customer received (no, unsatisfactory or satisfactory), and question whether the use of one-to-one versus one-to-many communication yields different effects. Design/methodology/approach – A 3 (no, unsatisfactory, and satisfactory customer recovery) x 3 (no, one-to-one, and one-to-many process recovery communication) scenario-based experiment was set up to investigate our research goals. Findings - Our results indicate that communicating process recoveries to a complaining customer significantly increases satisfaction with service recovery, overall satisfaction, repurchase intent and positive word-of-mouth. We also find evidence for different effects depending on the level of customer recovery in combination with the type of communication being used. Originality/value – This is the first study to test the effectiveness of communicating process recoveries to complaining customers as part of a more comprehensive service recovery approach. Our findings clearly demonstrate the importance of communicating process recoveries back to customers; especially in situations where customer recovery was absent or perceived as <b>unsatisfactory.</b> <b>Service</b> failure, service recovery, customer recovery, process recovery, communication...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Many service {{providers}} feel confident about their service quality and thus offer service guarantees to their customers. Yet service failures are inevitable. As guarantees {{can only be}} invoked when customers report service failures, firms are {{given the opportunity to}} redress the original failure potentially influencing customer outcomes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide the first empirical investigation of whether excellence in service recovery affects customers’ intentions to invoke a service guarantee, thereby discriminating between conditional and unconditional guarantees and testing for the impact of customers’ individualistic vs collectivistic cultural orientation. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 171 respondents from four continents (spanning 23 countries) were recruited to participate in a quasi-experimental study in a hotel setting. A three-way analysis of variance was used to test the hypotheses. Findings – All customers are very likely to invoke the service guarantee after an <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>service</b> recovery. When customers are satisfied with the service recovery, they report lower invoke intentions, except for collectivistic individuals who are still inclined to invoke an unconditional service guarantee after a satisfactory service recovery. The finding supports an in-group/out-group rationale, whereby collectivists tend to behave more opportunistically toward out-groups than individualistic customers. Originality/value – The study highlights the importance of excellence in service recovery, cultural differences and different types of service guarantees with respect to customers’ intentions to invoke the guarantee. The paper demonstrates how service guarantees should be designed in conjunction with service recovery strategies. Also, the paper shows that an unconditional service guarantee creates the condition in which collectivists might engage in opportunistic behavior; global {{service providers}} concerned about opportunistic customer claiming behavior thus might benefit from using conditional service guarantees. status: publishe...|$|E
