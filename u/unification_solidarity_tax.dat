50|$|Based {{on the new}} one-rate {{tax regime}} {{introduced}} January 2011, the overall tax rate for all income-earnings bands has been 16%. According to the income-tax returns of 2008, 14,6% of taxpayers was charged for 64,5% of the total tax burdens. Before the new Corporate income tax regime, the Corporate tax was fixed at 16% of the positive rateable value, with an additional <b>tax</b> called <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> of 4%, the measure of which {{is calculated based on}} the result before tax of the company (the <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> has been in use since September, 2006).

From January 2011, under the new Corporate income tax regime the tax rate was divided into two parts (i) corporations having income before tax below 500 million HUF (appr. USD 2.5 million) was lowered to 10% and (ii) 16% remained for all other companies until 2013. After this, the unified corporate income tax rate will be 10%, irrespectively from the size of the net income before tax. The rate of value added tax in Hungary is 27%, the highest in Europe, since 1 of January, 2012.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Previous {{research}} has shown that in many low and middle income countries micro and small entrepreneurs achieve relative high marginal returns to capital but show only very low reinvestment rates. Existing research is rather inconclusive about the possible causes. We explore whether forced solidarity, i. e. abusive demands by the family and kin hinder entrepreneurs to save and to invest. We start from a relatively simple theoretical model in which households consume and pursue different income generating activities, mainly the production of goods and services and the engagement in dependent wage work outside the household. Value added of the household business is subject to a <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> imposed by the household’s wider family and kin-group. In this model a higher <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> leads to a reallocation of productive resources away from household production to other income generating activities and leisure. We use an original data set of West-African migrant entrepreneurs to see whether the empirical observation is consistent with the predictions of the model. We find some evidence that family and kinship structures within the city enhance labour effort and the use of capital. However, closeness to the area of origin seem to have adverse effects on both...|$|R
5000|$|Inspired by {{the example}} of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, Chirac campaigned on an aggressively right-wing set of {{policies}} (including privatizations, abolition of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> on wealth and tightening restrictions on immigration) but he was faced with significant opposition in French society. For his part, Mitterrand presented himself as the protector of national unity. He campaigned for a [...] "united France" [...] and warned against [...] "the appropriation of the state by a clan", targeting Chirac and the RPR. An alliance between the Socialists and the center-right UDF was evoked.|$|R

However, this number {{does not reflect}} the reality for the majority of Aix-les-Bains households whose earnings are modest, or even precariously low. The share of households taxed in 2005 was 66.8%. The number of indebted taxpayers of the wealth tax is two hundred and twelve. The average wealth tax for the commune is approximately €4,091 per year which is slightly lower than the national average which has an average tax of €5,683 per year.

50|$|Mitterrand {{attempted}} {{to carry out}} socialist-inspired reforms (the 110 Propositions), furthering the dirigiste economic planning trends of the preceding conservative governments. The Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy nationalised the banks, the insurance industry and the defence industries, {{in accordance with the}} 1972 Common Program. Workers' wages were increased and working hours reduced to 39, and many other sweeping reforms carried out, but the economic crisis continued. Reforms included the abolition of death penalty, creation of a <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> on wealth (ISF), introduction of proportional representation in legislative elections (which was applied only at the 1986 election), decentralization of the state (1982-83 laws), repeal of price liberalization for books (Lang Law of 1981), etc.|$|R
5000|$|In France since 1968, article 515-81 of Code civil defines {{domestic}} partnership (in French: concubinage [...] or concubinage notoire) as {{a de facto}} union between two persons, of different sex or of same sex, characterised by a stable and continuous cohabitation and partnership. The French fiscal administration takes it into account in the calculation of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> on wealth but not for other purposes. All children enjoy equal right whether within or outside wedlock. Since 1999 French law also provides for a civil solidarity pact (in French: pacte civil de solidarité, or PACS), a contractual form of civil union between two adults bringing additional rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage.|$|R

5000|$|Chirac's cabinet sold {{many public}} companies, {{renewing}} with the liberalisation initiated under Laurent Fabius's Socialist government (1984-1986 - {{in particular with}} Fabius' privatisation of the audiovisual sector, leading {{to the creation of}} Canal +), and abolished the <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> on wealth (ISF), a symbolic tax on very high resources championed by Mitterrand's government. Elsewhere, the plan for university reform (plan Devaquet) caused a crisis in 1986 when a student called Malik Oussekine was killed by the police, leading to massive demonstrations and the proposal's withdrawal. It has been said during other student crises that this event strongly affected Jacques Chirac, who was afterwards careful about possible police violence during such demonstrations (e.g., maybe explaining part of the decision to [...] "promulgate without applying" [...] the First Employment Contract (CPE) after large student demonstrations against it).|$|R
25|$|The {{beginning}} of his first term was marked by a left-wing economic policy based on the 110 Propositions for France and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the Left Radical Party. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the SMIC (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, {{the creation of the}} <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> on wealth, an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the Auroux Act). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity (Keynesianism), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained monetary policy implemented by the Bank of France. However, unemployment continued to grow, and the franc was devalued three times.|$|R

Like fellow Socialist dissidents, Hamon criticized the El Khomri labor law and promised to repeal it if elected, and suggested that it be replaced with legislation acknowledging the need for greater social protections, including the right to disconnect and recognizing burnout as an occupational disease. He also proposed to reduce the 35-hour workweek to 32 hours, saying {{that it was time to}} put an end to the [...] "myth" [...] of economic growth. Another of his flagship proposals was to legalize cannabis, using funds for [...] "prevention" [...] rather than [...] "repression".|$|R

Hollande also signalled his intent to implement a 75% income tax rate on revenue earned above 1,000,000 euros per year, to generate the provision of development funds for deprived suburbs, and to return to a deficit of zero percent of GDP by 2017. The tax plan proved controversial, with courts ruling it unconstitutional in 2012, only to then take the opposite position on a redrafted version in 2013.|$|R
