These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E

A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures.

30|$|A {{large number}} of <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage</b> {{operating}} experience shows: the oil rim has {{a great impact on}} gas injection and production. Here, the <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage</b> in the Dagang Oilfield (G 393) was taken as an example to study the oil rim impact mechanism. Firstly, the G 393 gas reservoir developmental history was simulated, based thereon, the equations governing the distribution of gas, oil, and water in the reservoir before building the storage injection and production equipment was established. Then, the oil rim impact mechanism on the gas seepage of <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage</b> operation was studied using numerical simulation method and the factors affecting oil recovery from the oil rim for the gas diffusion were outlined. The result shows that oil rim may prevent seepage of gas, resulting in a one-way gas onrush, thus affecting the smooth operation of <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage.</b> In addition, crude oil recovery in the oil rim may affect the gas well’s production capacity, the lower the degree of recovery of crude oil, the harder for the <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage</b> to run quickly and smoothly. Finally, the most appropriate injection wells for the G 393 fault-block gas storage were designed, by which process the oil production period was shortened to 8  years, ensuring stable and efficient operation of the <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage.</b>|$|R

25|$|LNG {{facilities}} provide {{delivery capacity}} during peak periods when market demand exceeds pipeline deliverability. LNG storage tanks possess {{a number of}} advantages over <b>underground</b> <b>storage.</b> As a liquid at approximately −163°C (−260°F), it occupies about 600 times less space than gas stored underground, and it provides high deliverability at very short notice because LNG storage facilities are generally located close to market and can be trucked to some customers avoiding pipeline tolls. There is no requirement for cushion gas and it allows access to a global supply. LNG facilities are, however, more expensive to build and maintain than developing new <b>underground</b> <b>storage</b> facilities.|$|E

25|$|The {{consuming}} east region, {{particularly the}} states in the northern part, heavily rely on stored gas to meet the peak demand during the cold winter months. Due to the prevailing cold winters, large population centers and developed infrastructure, {{it is not surprising that}} this region has the highest level of working gas storage capacity of the other regions and the largest number of storage sites, mainly in depleted reservoirs. In addition to <b>underground</b> <b>storage,</b> LNG is increasingly playing a crucial role in providing supplemental backup and/or peaking supply to LDCs on a short term basis. Although the total capacity for these LNG facilities does not match those of <b>underground</b> <b>storage</b> in scale, the short term high deliverability makes up for that.|$|E
30|$|The oil rim, {{with regard}} to the crude oil {{recovery}} ratio, can directly affect the operating efficiency of such an <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage.</b> When the recovery factor was reduced, the production period gradually increased.

30|$|To {{improve the}} running {{efficiency}} {{of this type}} of <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage,</b> the factors influencing, and the extent of, the oil rim should be studied before any alterations are undertaken. Firstly, a three-dimensional (3 -d) dynamic model should be established to simulate the gas reservoir development history and to establish a fluid distribution model before any alterations take place; then using numerical simulation method to study the impact mechanism of oil rim, design different schemes to study the barrier effect of the fluid and the influence degree of the oil rim on gas production capacity, clear the oil, gas and water three-phase seepage rule in the process of <b>underground</b> gas <b>storage</b> rebuilt.

25|$|These are {{the most}} {{prominent}} and common form of <b>underground</b> <b>storage.</b> They are the reservoir formations of natural gas fields that have produced all their economically recoverable gas. The depleted reservoir formation is readily capable of holding injected natural gas. Using such a facility is economically attractive because it allows the re-use, with suitable modification, of the extraction and distribution infrastructure remaining from the productive life of the gas field which reduces the start-up costs. Depleted reservoirs are also attractive because their geological and physical characteristics have already been studied by geologists and petroleum engineers and are usually well known. Consequently, depleted reservoirs are generally the cheapest and easiest to develop, operate, and maintain of {{the three types of}} <b>underground</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The chief {{risks of}} such leaks come not from vehicles, but from {{gasoline}} delivery truck accidents and leaks from storage tanks.

25|$|One early {{example of}} {{inventory}} proportionality {{used in a}} retail application in the United States was for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in <b>underground</b> <b>storage</b> tanks. The motorists {{do not know whether}} they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in <b>underground</b> <b>storage</b> tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by Petrolsoft Corporation in 1990 for Chevron Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.|$|E
