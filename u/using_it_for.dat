5|$|The Newport Pagnell Canal {{had opened}} in 1817 between the Grand Junction Canal at Great Linford and Newport Pagnell. The canal carried a {{reasonable}} level of traffic, but in 1845, the LNWR attempted {{to buy the}} canal, <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a potential railway line. The offer was refused for two decades, until 1862, when the LNWR was able to purchase the canal for Â£9000. The canal closed in 1864. Despite this, the railway when built did not run on {{the line of the}} old canal.|$|E
5|$|To let {{the river}} {{replenish}} itself, {{most of the}} dams that had been built were removed in 1893. Ten years later it had somewhat recovered, and people were again <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> drinking water and swimming.|$|E
5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in a reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) leased the property, {{purchasing}} it in 1945, and <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{sparkling wine}} production from 1950 to 1989. It was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Christian Brothers sold the property in 1989 because of declining market shares and vineyard yields, {{and the costs of}} seismically retrofitting Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased the property and marketing rights to the Christian Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred. The earthquake damaged the Greystone Cellars building, rendering the northern portion of the building unusable.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had all worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him as happy as <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} Leo Phokas, heavily outnumbered by the Arab army, decided to rely once more on his proven ambuscade tactics, and occupied {{a position in}} the Arabs' rear, awaiting their return. Leo had been joined by the remaining forces of the adjoining provinces, including the theme of Cappadocia under its strategos, Constantine Maleinos, and occupied the narrow pass of Kylindros on the eastern Taurus Mountains. The Byzantine troops occupied the local fort, and hid themselves along the steep sides of the pass. According to the Arab chronicler Abu'l-Fida, this was the same pass that Sayf al-Dawla had crossed to begin his expedition, and many of his commanders advised against <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the return as well; nevertheless, the Hamdanid prince, confident of his ability and judgment, had grown haughty, and refused to heed any advice, seeking to reap the glory for this expedition alone.|$|E

5|$|St Mihangel's Church in {{the village}} of Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn is a former parish church now used as the chapel for RAF Valley in Anglesey, north Wales. The date of the first church on the site is uncertain, but in 1862 the {{then-existing}} church was rebuilt. St Mihangel's became the chapel for the nearby Royal Air Force base in 1998, after the Church in Wales had ceased <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> services. It was then extended by dismantling and reassembling another Anglesey church, St Enghenedl's, at the west end of the building.|$|E
5|$|The Green was not {{maintained}} at first; after being cleared, it was unkempt and ragged, sloping sharply towards a swamp {{in the southwest}} corner. As early as 1807, the College was debating as {{to the future of}} the plot, considering <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a variety of purposes. In 1828, the Board of Trustees finally voted to plow, seed, level, and fence the area. Lack of funding would delay this plan from being carried out immediately; the Green was leveled in 1831 and finally fenced in 1836. The main road from Hanover to the northward Lyme, New Hampshire had previously led diagonally across the Green, and due to the new fences, had to be diverted around it.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Handball Federation {{announced}} in May 2013 that the arena {{would be used}} for a four-nation men's handball tournament, Bring Cup, in November. The federation stated that they would use the tournament to evaluate if the venue was suitable as a new national arena for handball. The venue received mixed reviews. The tournament saw low attendance and Danish commentator Bent Nyegaard criticized the arena for being too large. The federation was happy with the arena, and stated that were planning on <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> finals in their bid for future World and European Handball Championships.
