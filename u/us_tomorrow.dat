6000|$|... "It's no use wishing," [...] James replied. [...] "We can't risk {{anything}} of that sort and, probably, all the farm houses are full of troops. We have got a little bread left. That will hold <b>us</b> over <b>tomorrow</b> comfortably." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right, Monsieur Campbell. Certainly {{there should}} be nothing to prevent our {{operating}} through the winter, and I shall look forward even more eagerly than I did before for d'Harcourt's return. Will you come back with <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow</b> from Chivasso?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name's Huling. I'm {{captain of}} the Salisbury nine. Just learned you were in town {{and are going to}} pitch against <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> Won't you walk out into the grounds with me now? You might want to warm up a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{happen to}} know," [...] said she, [...] "that the Flatheads intend to attack <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> {{but we are}} ready for them. Until the battle is over, I shall keep you two strangers prisoners on my island, from {{which there is no}} chance for you to escape." ...|$|E

60|$|I cannot write now. I am only {{dropping}} {{a line to}} let you know I am well. The ship will call for <b>us</b> here <b>tomorrow.</b> We may stop at Lisbon, and shall at the Bermudas, and will arrive in New York ten days after this letter gets there.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{will break}} it up," [...] Harry said, [...] "and carry {{it down with}} us to the camp. If the Utes came down on <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> and we could get off with it, that would be plenty to show {{if we want to}} make a sale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must be up an {{hour before}} daybreak; I {{think that there will}} be work for <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> If Unser and his tribe fail in {{capturing}} the temple we are to try; and there will be preparations to make." [...] And he explained the plan upon which he had determined.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but look}} at our force. Sixteen guns of Horse Artillery, a heavy field battery, and the Naval Brigade with eight guns; the 9th Lancers, the Punjaub Cavalry, and Hodson's Horse; four British regiments of {{infantry}} and two of Punjaubies, besides a column 1,500 strong {{which is expected to}} join <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow</b> or next day.|$|E

40|$|The {{government}} {{hopes to}} invest money (from the Chinese and others) in 'shovel-ready' infrastructure projects. The FT tells <b>us</b> that <b>tomorrow's</b> announcement will be 'long on good intentions, but short on signed contracts'. Translating intentions in to money will thus {{depend on the}} portfolio of projects that are shovel-ready. The quality of this portfolio will depend, in turn, on how effective DfT {{and others have been}} in generating project options...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, men, {{death to}} the traitor!" [...] the major said, solemnly. [...] "It is the {{schoolmaster}} of Grunsdorf who has sold you to the Prussians; who wrote that letter to their general, telling him of your intentions, which has caused these great reinforcements to be sent; and who has offered to guide a force to surround <b>us,</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have, upon my soul. Left {{her this}} moment.

She said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to her; so there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty good thought of mine--hey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he won't fail <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow</b> morning?" [...] came in {{a second}} voice, and now Dick {{recognized}} the speaker as Arnold Baxter, his father's worst enemy, who had been left at the hospital in Ithaca with a broken limb and several smashed ribs. Baxter had tackled Dick while the two were on a moving train, and, while trying to throw the boy off, had gotten {{the worst of the}} encounter by tumbling off himself.|$|E
5000|$|Yankee owner George Steinbrenner retired Munson's number 15 {{immediately}} upon his catcher's death. On September 20, , a plaque dedicated to Munson's memory {{was placed in}} Monument Park.

Our endeavors will reflect our love and admiration for him.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was silence}} on the {{verandah}} of the Newburys for the space of ten seconds. Then Frances burst out with: [...] "Mother, you know neither of <b>us</b> can go <b>tomorrow.</b> If it were any other day! But {{the day of the}} picnic!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is thirty-five {{miles from}} Oussoor to Kistnagherry, {{which will be}} far enough for <b>us</b> to go <b>tomorrow,</b> and then another five-and-twenty will take us down to Tripataly.

6000|$|... "It has {{not been}} a misfortune for us, Cyril; it has been a blessing indeed to us all that you have not been quite like other boys, and I think that all your life it will be a {{satisfaction}} for you to know that you have saved one house from ruin, one woman from misery, and disgrace. Now it is time for you to be going; but although you are leaving <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> Cyril, I hope that you are not going quite out of our lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{good deal}} more {{pleasant}} than most of them," [...] Aemilia said, [...] "for he puts on no airs, and is just like a merry, good tempered lad, while if a young Roman had done but a tithe of the deeds he has he would be insufferable. We must get Pollio to take <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow</b> to see the other Britons. They must be giants indeed, when Beric, who says he is but little more than eighteen years, could take Pollio {{under his arm and}} walk away with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, {{he will be}} with <b>us</b> <b>{{tomorrow}}.</b> He rides {{today to}} have {{another look at the}} Saxon position, and to give his orders there. He will, tomorrow morning, join us. It is we who are likely to have the first fighting; for the Austrians must come to the relief of the Saxons, who are shut up, as in a trap, by our divisions. They made a great mistake in not retiring, at once, into Bohemia; which they could have done without difficulty, had they lost no time.|$|E

5000|$|Koestler {{quotes a}} message {{he got from}} three other prisoners, Republican militiamen: [...] "Dear comrade foreigner, we three are also {{condemned}} to death, and they will shoot <b>us</b> tonight or <b>tomorrow.</b> But you may survive; and if you ever come out you must tell the world about all those who kill us, because we want liberty and no Hitler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. It's {{been ready}} for several days. But I can't believe the bomb is ready so soon." [...] Margaret Duffe moved numbly {{toward the door}} of her office.

6000|$|... "It {{makes all}} the {{difference}} between life and death for your friend and for me," [...] said Miguel. [...] "There is no reason why I should need an escort. I know my way throughout all Chihuahua as well as Pesita or any of his cutthroats. I have come and gone all my life without an escort. Of course your friend is different. It might be well for him to have company to El Orobo. Maybe it is all right; but wait until we learn who commands the escort. I know Pesita well. I know his methods. If Rozales rides out with <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow</b> morning you may say good-bye to your friend forever, for you will never see him in Rio, or elsewhere. He and I will be dead before ten o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he cried. [...] "Don't say that! Say that I try to love my {{neighbor}} as myself. Who but a Pharisee {{can believe that}} he is better than another? The best among us to-day may, but for the mercy of God, be the worst among <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> The true Christian virtue is the virtue which never despairs of a fellow-creature. The true Christian faith believes in Man as well as in God. Frail and fallen as we are, we can rise on the wings of repentance from earth to heaven. Humanity is sacred. Humanity has its immortal destiny. Who shall dare say to man or woman, 'There is no hope in you?' Who shall dare say the work is all vile, when that work bears on it the stamp of the Creator's hand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no doubt}} upon my mind that he {{intended}} to carry her off, and to compel her to marry him. I bethought me at first of applying to the secretary of state for a warrant for his arrest to answer for this outrage, but Mistress Maria leaves <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow</b> for Holland, and the process would delay her departure, and would cause a scandal and talk very unpleasant to herself, and which would greatly offend my good friend her father. Had the men in custody been brought up this morning, {{there would have been no}} choice but to have carried the matter through. It was then a relief to us to find that they had escaped. I have told you this, young sir, as your due after having rescued Mistress Von Duyk from so great a peril. Now, as to yourself, believe me if my friendship and assistance can in any way advantage you, they are at your service. Even of your name I am yet in ignorance." ...|$|E

When that is done, send Larry to get hold of some wood, and light a fire. It will be cold when the sun goes down. As for food, we have brought enough with <b>us</b> for tonight. <b>Tomorrow,</b> I suppose, we shall get rations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{must be some}} country tracks {{through this}} forest, Paolo. We cannot do better than keep {{along the edge of}} the stream until we come to one and then follow it. It is sure, sooner or later, to take us to some small hamlet, and I can go into a cabaret and get a couple of flasks of wine and buy enough bread to last <b>us</b> until <b>tomorrow,</b> and perhaps a sausage, they are not likely to have any other meat in a place of that sort. My German is good enough to pass muster, and even if it sounds strange to their ears, they will merely suppose that I have come from a {{different}} part of the country, for the dialects differ greatly from each other." ...|$|R
