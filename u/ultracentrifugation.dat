5|$|Proteins may be {{purified}} {{from other}} cellular components {{using a variety}} of techniques such as <b>ultracentrifugation,</b> precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known. In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through <b>ultracentrifugation</b> studies of horses' sera.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics. After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of simpler model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and <b>ultracentrifugation,</b> forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using <b>ultracentrifugation,</b> which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing.|$|E
25|$|DAPI {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1971 {{in the laboratory}} of Otto Dann {{as part of a}} search for drugs to treat trypanosomiasis. Although it was unsuccessful as a drug, further investigation indicated it bound strongly to DNA and became more fluorescent when bound. This led to its use in identifying mitochondrial DNA in <b>ultracentrifugation</b> in 1975, the first recorded use of DAPI as a fluorescent DNA stain.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to Indiaâ€™s nuclear test conducted 18 May 1974, the United States adopted more restrictive policies regulating the transfer of nuclear fuel and related technologies to different countries, including Brazil. In addition to suspending USAEC contracts of uranium supply, U.S. officials also pressed the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) Supply Agency to cease all transfers of special nuclear material to Brazil. Likewise, the U.S. pushed West Germany to remove <b>ultracentrifugation</b> technology from its agreement with Brazil and tried to craft a complementary safeguards agreement with the IAEA.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "cytosol" [...] {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1965 by H. A. Lardy, and initially referred to the liquid that was produced by breaking [...] cells apart and pelleting all the insoluble components by <b>ultracentrifugation.</b> Such a soluble cell extract is not identical to the soluble part of the cell cytoplasm and is usually called a cytoplasmic fraction.|$|E
500|$|Having {{proposed}} {{a model of}} globular proteins, Wrinch investigated whether it {{was consistent with the}} available structural data. [...] She hypothesized that bovine tuberculin protein (523) was a C1 closed cyclol consisting of 72 residues and that the digestive enzyme pepsin was a C2 closed cyclol of 288 residues. [...] These residue-number predictions were difficult to verify, since the methods then available to measure the mass of proteins were inaccurate, such as analytical <b>ultracentrifugation</b> and chemical methods.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1930s, {{analytical}} <b>ultracentrifugation</b> {{studies by}} Theodor Svedberg {{had shown that}} proteins had a well-defined chemical structure, and were not aggregations of small molecules. [...] The same studies appeared {{to show that the}} molecular weight of proteins fell into a few well-defined classes related by integers, such as M'w = 2p3qDa, where p and q are nonnegative integers. [...] However, it was difficult to determine the exact molecular weight and number of amino acids in a protein. [...] Svedberg had also shown that a change in solution conditions could cause a protein to disassemble into small subunits, now known as a change in quaternary structure.|$|E
500|$|A large {{variety of}} closed polyhedra meeting this {{criterion}} can be constructed, {{of which the}} simplest are the truncated tetrahedron, the truncated octahedron, and the octahedron, which are Platonic solids or semiregular polyhedra. [...] Considering the first series of [...] "closed cyclols" [...] (those modeled on the truncated tetrahedron), Wrinch showed that their number of amino acids increased quadratically as 72n2, where n is the index of the closed cyclol Cn. [...] Thus, the C1 cyclol has 72 residues, the C2 cyclol has 288 residues, etc. [...] Preliminary experimental support for this prediction came from Max Bergmann and Carl Niemann, whose amino-acid analyses suggested that proteins were composed of integer multiples of 288 amino-acid residues (n=2). [...] More generally, the cyclol model of globular proteins accounted for the early analytical <b>ultracentrifugation</b> results of Theodor Svedberg, which suggested that the molecular weights of proteins fell into a few classes related by integers.|$|E

2500|$|Proteins {{were finally}} {{shown to be}} macromolecules of {{well-defined}} composition (and not colloidal mixtures) by Theodor Svedberg using analytical <b>ultracentrifugation.</b> [...] The possibility that some proteins are non-covalent associations of such macromolecules was shown by Gilbert Smithson Adair (by measuring the osmotic pressure of hemoglobin) and, later, by Frederic M. Richards in his studies of ribonuclease S. [...] The mass spectrometry of proteins {{has long been a}} useful technique for identifying posttranslational modifications and, more recently, for probing protein structure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{secondary}} and low-resolution tertiary structure of globular proteins was investigated initially by hydrodynamic methods, such as analytical <b>ultracentrifugation</b> and flow birefringence. [...] Spectroscopic methods to probe protein structure (such as circular dichroism, fluorescence, near-ultraviolet and infrared absorbance) {{were developed in}} the 1950s. [...] The first atomic-resolution structures of proteins were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s and by NMR in the 1980s. [...] , the Protein Data Bank has nearly 40,000 atomic-resolution structures of proteins. [...] In more recent times, cryo-electron microscopy of large macromolecular assemblies and computational protein structure prediction of small protein domains are two methods approaching atomic resolution.|$|E
