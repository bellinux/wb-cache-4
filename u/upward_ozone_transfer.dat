Experiments were carried out in a gas-liquid-solid reactor were <b>ozone</b> <b>transfer</b> and NB oxidation took place at the same time. Three configurations of the reactor were compared: empty, filled with inert glass beads and filled with faujasite pellets.

Then, the various configurations were evaluated in terms of NB removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) decrease. The faujasite reactor showed higher removal of NB and decrease of COD compared to other configurations under the same conditions suggesting that the faujasite increases the oxidation rate of NB.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{technical}} feasibility of membrane-based ozone contacting that is <b>transfer</b> of <b>ozone</b> from its origin in the gas phase through porous membranes for application in water and wastewater treatment. The new method is distinguished by a complete absence of gas bubbles, which in some kinds of water cause formation of foam and considerably complicate or even obstruct conventional ozone contacting. Another interesting peculiarity of the process is that the volume flow of water through the setup exerts an indirect control of the <b>ozone</b> mass <b>transfer</b> by influencing the hydrodynamic conditions.

In order to choose an appropriate gas/liquid contactor, the rate constants of three phenolic compounds (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-coumaric acid) were determined by using competition kinetic model. These constants, obtained at pH 5, {{were found to be}} high (from 3. 8 × 104 L/mol s to 2. 9 × 105 L/mol s), inducing a diffusion controlled regime (Ha > 3).

40|$|International audienceIn June 1996, an {{airborne}} ozone lidar {{was successfully}} used {{to observe the}} decay of a cutoff low over southern Europe. This weather system was tracked during several days and sampled with an 8 -km horizontal resolution. Most of the measurements {{took place in the}} 4 – 12 -km altitude range and ozone-rich layers with a vertical thickness often less than 500 m were seen. Ozone vertical cross sections were obtained {{at the edges of the}} cutoff low or in frontal regions next to it. Using complementary data it is shown that these bidimensional cross sections characterize the ozone spatial field well. Two main features of the ozone distribution are large variability of the ozone tropopause and the presence of numerous ozone-rich layers within the troposphere. This paper focuses on the first feature. Observed ozone tropopauses compare well with potential vorticity ones derived from ECMWF analyses. The magnitude of the ozone to potential vorticity ratio also indicates that no significant diabatic mechanism contributes to the <b>ozone</b> <b>transfer</b> from the stratosphere to the troposphere above 325 K. An analysis of the evolution of the ozone vertical gradient in the upper troposphere (80 – 120 ppb) and lowermost stratosphere (120 – 200 ppb) is used to illustrate its usefulness as a diagnostic tool of dynamical processes. Large differences are found between air masses near and within the cutoff low. Vertical stretching induced by the PV anomaly cannot completely account for them. Differential advection in frontal regions and convective erosion on the eastern edge of the cutoff low tend to sharpen the vertical ozone gradient. On the contrary, clear sky turbulent mixing tends to smooth it. Convective erosion is also likely to <b>transfer</b> <b>ozone</b> from the stratosphere to the troposphere.

Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of succinic acid was carried out in a reactor fitted with a recirculation loop. This study investigated if the location of the solid catalyst, i. e. inside the reactor in the zone of <b>ozone</b> <b>transfer</b> or in a cartridge placed on the recirculation loop, had an influence on the amount of SA removed or on the elimination rate expression.

The effect of bubble diameter and plume structure on mass <b>transfer</b> efficiency of <b>ozone</b> in bubble plumes is investigated numerically. In order to capture the detailed plume structure, interaction between liquid and bubbles is treated by a two-way coupling Euler-Lagrange method. The motion of the continuous phase (a mixture of liquid and gas bubbles) is solved using a finite difference method in an Eulerian framework. The motion of the dispersed phase (bubbles) is tracked individually in a Lagrangian fashion. The <b>ozone</b> <b>transfer</b> process from bubbles to liquid is computed by modelling the mass transfer rate of individual bubbles.

Therefore, for a given tank size {{it is not necessary}} to generate bubbles much smaller than the optimal size.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of ozonation with pollutants in a countercurrent bubble column is studied {{for the model}} establishment. Bubble columns {{have been widely used}} for an ozonation system in the plants and laboratories. In addition, a countercurrent bubble column has been commonly recommended than a cocurrent one because it has a higher <b>ozone</b> <b>transfer</b> efficiency. Therefore, the investigation of this paper focuses on the countercurrent bubble column. As an ozonation process starts, the gas mixture of ozone and oxygen is introduced into the bottom of a column, and then transferred into the liquid. The pollutants in the wastewater are eliminated subsequently via oxidation by the dissolved ozone. There certainly exists a temporary and unsteady period before the ozonation system reaches steady state. However, available ozonation models employed to describe ozone and pollutant profiles have commonly been developed for steady state. The treating qualities of wastewater in the early stage of ozonation are usually not predicted, and the time required for the steady-state establishment remains to be determined. Moreover, oxygen mass transfer is usually neglected in previous ozonation models so that the increase of dissolved oxygen is uncertain. These information is desirable for the proper design and operation of ozonation system in a bubble column. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} model and investigate the dynamic processes of ozonation with pollutants including oxygen mass transfer.

The frequency of the stable boundary layer in the cold season accounts for 71 % of its annual occurrence frequency. A neutral boundary layer appears rarely. The average altitude of the convective boundary layer determined by the parcel method is 600 m; this is 200 to 300 m higher than that over inland Antarctica. The average altitude of the top of the boundary layer determined by the potential temperature gradient and humidity gradient is 1 200 m in the warm season and 1 500 m in the cold season.

The latter provides data in the altitude range 3 - 14 km. A ground based UV photometer is also used since 1998. Seasonal variations in 2 -km layers in the troposphere (2 - 8 km) for four five years periods were analysed with 3 -days three dimensional backward trajectories calculated for each vertical profile during twenty years. Four source regions are identified: [Europe (lat> 45 N) ], [Eastern Mediterranean], [Spain/Africa/North America (lat 40 N) ]. Considering lidar and ozonesondes data seperatly we cannot identify a clear bias due to the measurement method while differences are related to the sampling conditions.

Ozone generation has been performed by irradiation of compressed air with 4 special UV lamps. The total output of these lamps was determined to be 0. 74 mg ozone per minute at established conditions. Considering 3 periods of ozonation of effluent samples (30, 60 and 120 min) and <b>ozone</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficient of 95 %, the concentrations of applied ozone for wastewater treatment were specified to be 10. 5, 21 and 42 mg/l, respectively. Ozonation of secondary effluents at these periods has resulted in 17, 24 and 30 percent reduction in average COD and about 20, 18 and 32 percent decrease in BOD 5. It is believed that the 2 percent increase observed in BOD after 30 minutes is caused by changing some amount of COD to BOD 5 by applied ozone. According to the prescribed reduction values it could be concluded that the final effluent of a typical treatment plant would become better qualified for water reuse in irrigation. But it should be declared that the effluent might not be completely disinfected irrespective of about 99. 0 % decrease determined in MPN of total coliforms. Also it must be noted that this degree of disinfection was accomplished only for 62. 5 % of samples. Ozonation of effluent samples has caused an increase in pH value which was at least 0. 4 of a pH unit...|$|R

With a range of emission scenarios for man-made ozone precursor emission sources available, {{a wide range of}} model trends were predicted for the period up to 2030. In the scenario based on current planned air pollution controls, IIASA CLE, methane shows a strong <b>upward</b> trend, <b>ozone</b> shows a weaker upward trend, and carbon monoxide is approximately flat in baseline air masses. In one of the more pessimistic IPCC SRES scenarios, A 2, all three gases show future increases. However, in the scenario based on maximum feasible emission reductions, IIASA MFR all three trace gases decline. By 2030, projected climate change reduces the growth in CH 4, but has insignificant effects on baseline CO and O 3 in these simulations. Global or hemispheric ozone precursor emissions and their controls exert a potentially large external influence on Europe’s air quality. This influence is currently not taken into account in future European air quality policy formulation. JRC. H. 2 -Climate chang...|$|R
40|$|Ozone {{has been}} {{incorporated}} {{as part of}} water treatment processes used in numerous industries. The ozone contacting system is a critical process in overall treatment plant performance. Ozonation system performance in many potable and industrial applications can be compromised by changes in raw water quality or by poorly designed ozone contacting systems. Increased ozone demand can stretch system operation beyond the original design capabilities while low mass transfer efficiency will reduce system performance even under design demand conditions. In many cases, the answer to non-performing or borderline system operation is improving {{the operation of the}} ozone contacting system rather than installing a larger ozone generator. Enhancing <b>ozone</b> mass <b>transfer</b> efficiency can effectively reduce ozone generator operational output requirements by up to 30 % in many cases. This paper will report on the retrofit of several ozone installations with the highly efficient GDT ™ pressurized ozone injection and entrained gas removal process.

Among the most effective approaches for analyzing time series data is the model introduced by Box and Jenkins, ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average). In this study we used Box-Jenkins methodology to build ARIMA model for monthly ozone data taken from an Automatic Air Quality Monitoring System in Kemaman station for the period from 1996 to 2007 with a total of 144 readings. Parametric seasonally adjusted ARIMA (0, 1, 1) (1, 1, 2) 12 model was successfully applied to predict the long-term trend of ozone concentration. The detection of a steady statistical significant <b>upward</b> trend for <b>ozone</b> concentration in Kemaman is quite alarming.

40|$|We use {{satellite}} observations from IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) {{on board the}} MetOp-A satellite to evaluate the springtime daily variations in lower-tropospheric ozone over east Asia. The availability of semi-independent columns of ozone from the surface up to 12 km simultaneously with CO columns provides a powerful observational data set to diagnose the processes controlling tropospheric ozone enhancement on synoptic scales. By combining IASI observations with meteorological reanalyses from ERA-Interim, we develop an analysis method based only on IASI ozone and CO observations to identify the respective roles of the stratospheric source and the photochemical source in ozone distribution and variations over east Asia. The succession of low- and high-pressure systems drives the day-to-day variations in lower-tropospheric ozone. A case study analysis of one frontal system and one cut-off low system in May 2008 shows that reversible subsiding and ascending <b>ozone</b> <b>transfers</b> in the upper-troposphere–lower-stratosphere (UTLS) region, due to the tropopause perturbations occurring {{in the vicinity of}} low-pressure systems, impact free and lower-tropospheric ozone over large regions, especially north of 40 ° N, and largely explain the ozone enhancement observed with IASI for these latitudes. Irreversible stratosphere–troposphere exchanges of ozone-rich air masses occur more locally in the southern and southeastern flanks of the trough. The contribution to the lower-tropospheric ozone column is difficult to dissociate from the tropopause perturbations generated by weather systems. For regions south of 40 ° N, a significant correlation has been found between lower-tropospheric ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) observations from IASI, especially over the North China Plain (NCP). Considering carbon monoxide observations as a pollutant tracer, the O 3 –CO correlation indicates that the photochemical production of ozone from primary pollutants emitted over such large polluted regions significantly contributes to the ozone enhancements observed in the lower troposphere via IASI. When low-pressure systems circulate over the NCP, stratospheric and pollution sources play a concomitant role in the ozone enhancement. IASI's 3 -D observational capability allows the areas in which each source dominates to be determined. Moreover, the studied cut-off low system has enough potential convective capacity to uplift pollutants (ozone and CO) and to transport them to Japan. The increase in the enhancement ratio of ozone to CO from 0. 16 on 12 May over the North China Plain to 0. 28 over the Sea of Japan on 14 May indicates photochemical processing during the plume transport...|$|R
