5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s the South Florida {{metropolitan}} area grew {{four times as}} fast {{as the rest of the}} nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6million people moved to south Florida: 1,000people moved to Miami every week. Urban development between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas. With metropolitan growth came <b>urban</b> <b>problems</b> associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams; school overcrowding; crime; overloaded sewage treatment plants; and, for the first time in south Florida's urban history, water shortages in times of drought.|$|E

25|$|Human Rights Cities {{have grown}} {{in part because of}} the {{enhanced}} efforts by international agencies like UN Habitat to connect international legal regimes with municipal programs. As a result of globalized economic development processes, cities around the world are facing a similar host of <b>urban</b> <b>problems,</b> including a lack of affordable housing, traffic congestion and insufficient public services. Cities have looked to international forums like the UN Conferences on Human Settlements and the World Associations of Cities and Local Authorities to help address these problems. Shulamith Koning, founder of the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning (PDHRE), worked closely with human rights organizers in some of the first formally designated human rights cities, including Rosario Argentina, which became the first Human Rights City in the world in 1997 and the first U.S.-based Human Rights City of Washington, D.C.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{criminal}} activity in rural America, particularly drug-related activity, by analysing trends in offending for four rural communities of the mid-west. The present study has three main objectives. First, discover how many offences in these rural areas are drug-related offences. Second, discover differential offending, with an emphasis on drug offending, based on location of each area of study. 1 Third, uncover overall trends of offending in each of the rural communities examined. For the last approximately ten years rural offending has become a major concern for many criminal justice practitioners in ‘small town America’. While drug offending is a major concern nation-ally, predominantly due to all of the media exposure related to the <b>urban</b> <b>problem,</b> it is growing as a concern of rural Americans. Much research focuses on the <b>urban</b> <b>problem,</b> but only a few researchers have concerned themselves with the rural issu...|$|R

2500|$|Contemporary {{human rights}} city {{initiatives}} grow directly from earlier organizing around rights claims in urban settings. The widespread nature of <b>urban</b> <b>problems</b> affecting peoples’ everyday lives and survival have generated similar types of responses in {{places around the}} world, helping account for the simultaneous emergence and consolidation of popular claims to the “right to the city."

2500|$|Tackling {{the issue}} of {{corporate}} responsibility, his 1973 book The Limits of Corporate Responsibility Chamberlain said that businesses could do [...] "remarkably little" [...] about <b>urban</b> <b>problems,</b> environmental degradation, product safety, or worker dissatisfaction, because {{the values of the}} business culture are incompatible with such goals and economic forces will constrain businesses to only actions which result in growth and profit. [...] Writing for The New York Times Book Review, Stephen B.

Trams, it argued, are unsuitable as they [...] "are generally used for solving <b>urban</b> <b>problems</b> where origins and destinations are contained within a specified area".

2500|$|Jackson {{attempts}} to broadly interpret the American suburban experience, which he views as unique. He states that [...] "the United States {{has thus far}} been unique in four important respects that {{can be summed up}} in the following sentence: affluent and middle-class Americans live in suburban areas that are far from their work places, in homes that they own, and in the center of yards that by urban standards elsewhere are enormous. This uniqueness thus involves population density, home-ownership, residential status, and journey-to-work." [...] His working definition of suburbs has four components: function (non-farm residential), class (middle and upper status), separation (a daily journey-to-work), and density (low relative to older sections). Also dominant in the book is the notion that the wealthy began the flight from the city first — something that the middle classes eventually emulated as city tax rates gradually increased to pay for resulting <b>urban</b> <b>problems</b> - as the poorer classes remained in the older central urban areas.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Carl Bridenbaugh {{examined}} in depth five key cities: Boston (population 16,000 in 1760), Newport Rhode Island (population 7500), New York City (population 18,000), Philadelphia (population 23,000), and Charles Town (Charlestown, South Carolina), (population 8000). He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating {{the ideas of}} the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. Furthermore, they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for care of people meeting welfare. The cities were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive than corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure, and solve <b>urban</b> <b>problems.</b> They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid. Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as [...] "sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest," [...] public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to [...] "democratic yearnings" [...] for political power.|$|E
