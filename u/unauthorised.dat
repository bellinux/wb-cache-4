5|$|The Canning Reservoir, Canning River and tributaries are {{illegally}} fished for marron, {{especially during}} summer. Boating, fishing and swimming are prohibited in the reservoir {{for health and}} hygiene reasons. <b>Unauthorised</b> camping (including overnight stays and/or outside of designated areas) and <b>unauthorised</b> trail establishment occur more and more frequently in the Canning catchment.|$|E
5|$|As the scuba set is a {{life support}} system, no <b>unauthorised</b> person should touch a diver's {{assembled}} scuba gear, even to move it, without their knowledge and approval.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November 1962, {{locomotive}} No. 30131 was derailed at Eastleigh, Hampshire {{after it}} was moved by an <b>unauthorised</b> person]].|$|E
5|$|An Australian {{teenager}} {{was charged}} with four counts of inciting other hackers to impair electronic communications and two of <b>unauthorised</b> access to restricted data {{for his role in}} the attack. He was ordered to pay a bond instead of being convicted after pleading guilty and showing good behaviour.|$|E
5|$|In the UK {{the same}} laws {{covering}} computer crime can also affect forensic investigators. The 1990 computer misuse act legislates against <b>unauthorised</b> access to computer material; {{this is a}} particular concern for civil investigators who have more limitations than law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|Meinertzhargen {{had been}} {{banned from the}} Natural History Museum's Bird Room for 18months for <b>unauthorised</b> removal of specimens, and suspicions that he was {{stealing}} specimens and library material were documented by staff for over 30years, twice reaching the verge of prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or <b>unauthorised</b> permanent stamp markings, and <b>unauthorised</b> additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unauthorised</b> use of data {{contained}} in the National Register of Electors or the list of electors generated from it may result in {{the imposition of a}} maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine or one year in prison.|$|E
5|$|Vulso {{began his}} return journey to Rome in 188 BC and arrived in 187 BC. When he {{returned}} to Rome, he received much criticism because of his <b>unauthorised</b> war against the Galatians. However, he eventually overcame the arguments and was awarded a triumph by the senate.|$|E
5|$|After Bond kills Killifer {{using the}} same shark tank used for Leiter, M meets Bond in Key West's Hemingway House and orders him to an {{assignment}} in Istanbul, Turkey. Bond resigns after turning down the assignment, but M suspends Bond instead and revokes his licence to kill. Bond becomes a rogue agent, although he later receives <b>unauthorised</b> assistance from Q.|$|E
5|$|Automonopoli, {{also known}} as Go to Jail, is an <b>unauthorised</b> {{computer}} version of the boardgame Monopoly, released in June 1983 by Automata UK for the ZX Spectrum. Although other two-player Monopoly computer programs already existed, the developer advertised that their Automonopoli was the first with an artificial intelligence strong enough to compete against and defeat human players.|$|E
5|$|By 14 March 2012, all {{elevated}} {{stations have}} been retrofitted with {{the doors and}} are operational. These doors prevent suicides and <b>unauthorised</b> access to restricted areas. Under the Rapid Transit Systems Act, acts such as smoking, eating or drinking in stations and trains, the misuse of emergency equipment and trespassing on the railway tracks are illegal, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Fauré did {{not intend}} the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His {{publisher}} collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as 8 pièces brèves, allocating each of them a title <b>unauthorised</b> by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{twenty years}} after the battle, President Ivo Josipović {{presented}} the Charter of the Republic of Croatia to the commanders and units involved in the battle, commending their military achievements. That was the first such move in twenty years, and {{a reversal of the}} official stance towards the offensive which had originally declared it as an <b>unauthorised</b> deployment of the HV.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, NatWest and RBS both {{announced}} dramatic cuts {{in their}} overdraft fees. The unpaid item fee {{was reduced to}} £5 from £38 and the card misuse fee was reduced from £35 to £15. The cuts {{came at a time}} when the row over the legality of <b>unauthorised</b> borrowing, estimated to earn current account providers about £2.6bn a year, had reached the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|On an <b>unauthorised</b> {{visit to}} the village of Hogsmeade (thanks to The Marauder's Map, given to him by George Weasley and Fred Weasley), Harry overhears some of his {{teachers}} talking with Fudge about Black. They reveal that Black was a friend of Harry's parents but he betrayed them and gave Voldemort access to their house. They also mention that Black killed thirteen Muggles and his former friend Peter Pettigrew.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's 1937 British Home Championship {{match against}} England {{set a new}} world record for a {{football}} attendance. The Hampden Park crowd was officially recorded as 149,415, though the true figure is unknown as {{a large number of}} additional fans gained <b>unauthorised</b> entry. This attendance was surpassed 13 years later by the decisive match of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, but remains a European record.|$|E
5|$|Tallon missed {{selection}} {{during the}} 195152 season due his increasingly error-prone glovework and {{a combination of}} health reasons including stomach ulcers and deafness. He did not play a first-class match {{because of lack of}} his fitness. In any case, Tallon had secretly been barred from selection by the Australian Board of Control for making <b>unauthorised</b> comments in the media; this fact was not revealed for half a century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unauthorised</b> {{juvenile}} {{productions of}} Pinafore were {{so popular that}} Carte mounted his own children's version, played at matinees at the Opera Comique beginning on 16 December 1879. François Cellier, who had taken over from his brother as Carte's music director in London, adapted the score for children's voices. Between its two Christmas seasons in London, the children's production went on a provincial tour from 2 August 1880 to 11 December 1880.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{recognition}} {{on their}} albums and concerts; his <b>unauthorised</b> {{use of other}} artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones. During their live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intense performances prompted critics to compare the group to Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely <b>unauthorised</b> duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|By 2011, Rowling {{had taken}} more than 50 actions against the press. In 2001, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a {{complaint}} by Rowling over a series of <b>unauthorised</b> photographs of her with her daughter {{on the beach in}} Mauritius published in OK! magazine. In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of him. The photo, taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was subsequently published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood. The judgement was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Classic TV Press {{published}} the book Worlds Apart: an unofficial and <b>unauthorised</b> {{guide to the}} BBC's remake of Survivors (March 2010), written by Rich Cross, shortly after transmission of the second series completes. The book incorporates: in depth synopses and reviews for all the episodes from Series 1 and 2; insights into {{the making of the}} series; examination of the similarities and differences between the new series and the 1970s series; a photographic guide to filming locations; and exclusive production shots.|$|E
5|$|Eddisbury was {{excavated}} between 1935 and 1938 by W. J. Varley, {{who also}} undertook excavations at Maiden Castle nearby, {{as part of}} his investigation into the origin of Cheshire's hill forts. The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1995, giving Eddisbury protection against <b>unauthorised</b> change. The eastern entrance was re-excavated by the Habitats and Hillforts Project in 2010, finds including sling stones and a saddle quern. The excavated walls were partially reconstructed and remain visible.|$|E
5|$|Established by Standing Order 18 of the Senate, the {{privileges}} committee {{is responsible for}} reporting on matters of parliamentary privilege referred to it by the Senate. The protections afforded by parliamentary privilege are essential to parliament and its committees {{to be able to}} operate effectively. The bulk of the work of {{the privileges}} committee's work is associated with facilitating a 'right of reply' for people adversely named in the Senate, as well as involving investigations of <b>unauthorised</b> disclosures of Senate committee proceedings, complaints from witnesses in connection with evidence given to committees, and allegedly misleading evidence given to committees.|$|E
5|$|Following District Judge Earnest Lau's {{ruling in}} the Odex v. Pacific Internet lawsuit, Koshy {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} SingNet might be in breach {{of the spirit of}} the Telecommunications Competition Code, which protects the confidentiality of subscribers' information and prohibits <b>unauthorised</b> release. Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did not think that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating a chilling effect on free speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E
5|$|Galland himself flew on <b>unauthorised</b> {{interception}} {{flights to}} experience the combat pressures of the pilots, and witnessed USAAF bombers being escorted by large numbers of P-51 Mustangs. Nevertheless, on occasions the Sturmbock tactics worked. For example, on 7 July 1944 Eighth Air Force bombers belonging to the 492nd Bomb Group were intercepted unescorted. The entire squadron of 12 B-24s were shot down. The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day, the majority to a Sturmbock attack.|$|E
5|$|H.M.S. Pinafore was so {{successful}} that Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces. The opera ran for 571 performances in London, the second-longest run in musical theatre history up to that time. Over 150 <b>unauthorised</b> productions sprang up in America alone, but because American law then offered no copyright protection to foreigners, Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} demand royalties from, or to control the artistic content of, these productions.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} foil any {{plans for a}} coup d'état, the {{president}} {{took control of the}} military and police, reducing their numbers from 5,300 to 3,500. Defence was entrusted to the French armed forces that, pursuant to the treaty on defence cooperation of 24 April 1961, were stationed at Port-Bouët and could intervene at Houphouët-Boigny's request or when they considered French interests to be threatened. They subsequently intervened during attempts by the Sanwi monarchists to secede in 1959 and 1969, and again in 1970, when an <b>unauthorised</b> political group, the Eburnian Movement, was formed and Houphouët-Boigny accused its leader Kragbé Gnagbé of wishing to secede.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris {{became one}} {{front of the}} Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN {{targeted}} and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to {{the imposition of a}} curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an <b>unauthorised</b> but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Miller {{earned the}} further ire of his CO by flying <b>unauthorised</b> leisure flights. Not wanting to fly tour flights over Germany, Miller lodged bogus reports {{saying that the}} Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing {{unnecessary}} maintenance work. Thus, the CO ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire. With one functional engine, Miller {{came back to the}} air base and bellylanded. The plane broke apart and caught fire, but Miller escaped physical injury and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{case was}} that Johor had {{original}} title to Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. Johor had not ceded Pedra Branca to the United Kingdom, but had merely granted permission for the lighthouse {{to be built}} and maintained on it. The actions of the United Kingdom and Singapore in respect of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and the waters surrounding the island were not actions of the island's sovereign. Further, the 1953 letter had been <b>unauthorised</b> and the official reports and maps it had issued were either irrelevant or inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Named {{after the}} South American mammal, Kinkajou was the younger {{half-sister}} of Mozart and appeared sporadically throughout the programme. In the first series, a teenage Kinkajou took {{her younger brother}} Mitch from the burrow and left him alone in the desert after she got bored with watching him. She became a more reliable babysitter as she grew older, but followed in her mother Flower's footsteps with an <b>unauthorised</b> pregnancy in the second series. As Kinkajou was evicted between {{the second and third}} series, it remains unanswered how she was reunited with her sisters Mozart and De la Soul.|$|E
5|$|On 12 August 1978, Vulcan B.2 XL390 of No. 617 Squadron crashed {{during an}} air display at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois in the United States. The crew had been {{authorised}} {{to carry out}} a display at Chicago Lakeside airport, the captain had elected {{to carry out a}}n <b>unauthorised</b> display at Glenview beforehand. After a low-level run, probably below , the aircraft pulled up for an improperly executed wingover, resulting in a low-level stall and crash, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{independent}} {{release in}} June 1987, the JAMs were {{ordered by the}} Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from ABBA. In response, The JAMs disposed of many copies of 1987 in unorthodox, publicised ways. They also released {{a version of the}} album titled 1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits), stripped of all <b>unauthorised</b> samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little audible content that it was formally classed as a 12-inch single.|$|E
5|$|Ten miles (16km) of {{barbed wire}} was used to secure Wembley Stadium against <b>unauthorised</b> entry. The pre-match {{entertainment}} was music by the Band of the Irish Guards, and communal singing backed by the band of the Royal Horse Guards. Inclement weather prevented the attendance of King George V. Instead the guest of honour was the Duke of York. Other guests present included Baron Wigram, Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey, Austrian envoy Baron von Franckenstein and the West Indies cricket team.|$|E
