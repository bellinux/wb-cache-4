5|$|George placed B.epica in B.subg. Banksia, {{because its}} inflorescences are typical Banksia flower spikes; B.sect. Banksia {{because of its}} {{straight}} styles; and B.ser. Cyrtostylis because it has slender flowers. He considered its closest relatives to be B.praemorsa (cut-leaf banksia) and B.media, {{both of which have}} shorter flowers and smaller pollen-presenters than B.epica. In addition, B.praemorsa differs in having a hairless perianth, and B.media has larger, more <b>undulate</b> leaves.|$|E
5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others <b>undulate</b> their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E
40|$|This work investigates wave {{propagation}} in <b>undulated</b> square structural lattices. The <b>undulated</b> pattern is obtained by imposing an initial curvature to the lattice's elements. The study considers both periodic <b>undulated</b> structures, {{in which the}} undulation is uniform throughout the structure as well as graded <b>undulated</b> patterns, in which the undulation is modulated within the lattice. Undulation is specifically considered in relation to its ability to induce anisotropy in the equivalent mechanical properties and to break the symmetry of the straight square lattice. Results show that wave motion is inhibited within specified frequency ranges owing to the generation of band gaps, and in specific directions {{as a result of}} the undulation-induced anisotropy...|$|R

5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.dentata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to. Alf Salkin had noted that B.dentata displays characteristics which are primitive within the genus. Unlike southern banksias, it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves. Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with Banksia integrifolia on account of their similar inflorescences. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B.plagiocarpa, B.robur and B.oblongifolia within the series Salicinae. These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the flower spike. It was held to be most closely related to B.robur on account of its large <b>undulate</b> leaves. Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of B.dentata, B.robur and B.oblongifolia were all similar and roughly linear, suggesting a close relationship. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George; he discounted a close relationship with B.robur, which he felt was too distinctive.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} of snakes in arboreal habitats {{has only recently}} been studied. While on tree branches, snakes use several modes of locomotion depending on species and bark texture. In general, snakes will use a modified form of concertina locomotion on smooth branches, but will laterally <b>undulate</b> if contact points are available. Snakes move faster on small branches and when contact points are present, in contrast to limbed animals, which do better on large branches with little 'clutter'.|$|E

25|$|When swimming, {{the waves}} become larger {{as they move}} down the snake's body, and the wave travels {{backwards}} faster than the snake moves forwards. Thrust is generated by pushing their body against the water, resulting in the observed slip. In spite of overall similarities, {{studies show that the}} pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation, which justifies calling them separate modes. All snakes can laterally <b>undulate</b> forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).|$|E
25|$|The more {{powerful}} 6C 1750 (1752cc actual) {{was introduced in}} 1929 in Rome. The car featured {{a top speed of}} 95mph, a chassis designed to flex and <b>undulate</b> over wavy surfaces, as well as sensitive geared-up steering. It was produced in six series between 1929 and 1933. Base model had a single overhead cam; Super Sport and Gran Sport versions had double overhead cam engine (DOHC). Again, a supercharger was available. Most of the cars were sold as rolling chassis and bodied by coachbuilders such as Zagato, and Touring. Additionally, there were 3 examples built with James Young bodywork, one of which {{is a part of the}} permanent collection at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA in original, unrestored condition.|$|E
25|$|Beta vulgaris is an {{herbaceous}} biennial or, rarely, perennial plant up to 120cm (rarely 200cm) height; cultivated {{forms are}} mostly biennial. The roots of cultivated forms are dark red, white, or yellow and moderately to strongly swollen and fleshy (subsp. vulgaris); or brown, fibrous, sometimes swollen and woody {{in the wild}} subspecies. The stems grow erect or, in the wild forms, often procumbent; they are simple or branched in the upper part, and their surface is ribbed and striate. The basal leaves have a long petiole (which may be thickened and red, white, or yellow in some cultivars). The simple leaf blade is oblanceolate to heart-shaped, dark green to dark red, slightly fleshy, usually with a prominent midrib, with entire or <b>undulate</b> margin, 5–20cm long on wild plants (often much larger in cultivated plants). The upper leaves are smaller, their blades are rhombic to narrowly lanceolate.|$|E

25|$|The {{stadium is}} a bowl shape with four tiers {{on three sides}} of the ground; the lower and upper tiers being for general access, {{the second and third}} levels feed the second tier for premium tickets and the fourth tier for {{corporate}} boxes. The northern end of the stadium, due to its proximity to local housing, incorporates only the lower tier of the bowl. The North Stand is to be the away stand for football internationals. There is one basement level and seven storeys of floors including ground level. The premium level holds 10,000 spectators, while the box level holds 1,300. The remaining 38,700 seats are shared between the top and bottom tiers. The capacity of the stadium was criticised even before its opening for being too small, particularly in light of the large supporter attendance figures for Irish rugby internationals and soccer internationals at Croke Park since 2007. The stadium's roof is designed to <b>undulate</b> in a wave-like manner so as to avoid blocking light to local residences.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategy of}} the northern two-lined salamander begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he will lift her by pushing his snout under her cloacal region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position {{for an hour or}} more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against the base of the male's tail. The male may <b>undulate</b> his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves her head from side to side, alternately from the male’s tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female to walk over it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male’s sperm. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.|$|E

500|$|Relatively {{sedentary}} {{during the}} day, the yellow stingray feeds on small invertebrates and bony fishes. When hunting it may <b>undulate</b> its disc to uncover buried prey, or lift {{the front of}} its disc to form a [...] "cave" [...] attractive to shelter-seeking organisms. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females bear two litters of up to seven young per year in seagrass, following a gestation period of 5–6 months. Though innocuous towards humans, the yellow stingray can inflict a painful injury with its venomous tail spine. This species is taken as bycatch by commercial fisheries and collected for the aquarium trade; {{it may also be}} negatively affected by habitat degradation. Nevertheless, it remains common and widespread, which has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list it under Least Concern.|$|E

The large green leaves are scattered along the stems, and more crowded at the branchlet tips. They are [...] long and [...] wide, [...] in shape with [...] tips. The [...] (toothed) margins are lined irregularly with [...] long teeth, separated by u-shaped sinuses. The leaves are <b>undulate</b> (wavy) with white undersurfaces, the [...] raised underneath and depressed above.
