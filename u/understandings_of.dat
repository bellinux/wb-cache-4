As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> chess, rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.|$|E

We found little evidence of links between children’s autobiographical memory and their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> mind, but maternal reminiscing style was correlated with children’s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> mind, specifically their understanding that visual access leads to knowledge.

5|$|The {{ability of}} {{children}} to extract information from their environment rests on <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> attentional behaviors such as pointing. Episodes of joint attention provide children {{with a great deal}} of information about objects by establishing reference and intention. Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance. Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the development <b>of</b> children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the persuasive intent of advertising, which {{was defined as}} their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the purpose of advertisements to persuade people to buy the advertised products. Previous research has found age-related changes in the development <b>of</b> this <b>understanding.</b> However, {{little is known about}} the sources of developmental changes in this <b>understanding.</b> A series <b>of</b> 6 experimental studies explored children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the persuasive intent of advertising and their scepticism towards advertisements in relation to their theory of mind and their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the marketplace. Children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the persuasive intent of advertising and their scepticism towards advertisements were assessed in interviews. Established false belief tasks were used to assess children's theory of mind, and novel measures were developed to measure children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the marketplace. It was found that children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the persuasive intent of advertising was positively related to their second order theory of mind and to their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> how advertising is causally related to economic variables such as sales and demand. However, children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the persuasive intent of advertising was not related to their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> persuasion in social contexts. Moreover, children who recognised the persuasive intent of advertising did not necessarily evaluate advertisements on the basis of the advertisers' motives. Rather, children who believed the priority of businesses was to pursue financial gain, rather than to serve the welfare of customers, were more likely to be sceptical towards advertisements because of the advertisers' self-serving interests. This thesis provides some evidence that the development <b>of</b> children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> advertising is related to their cognitive development and their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the marketplace.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections {{are more likely}} to be based on allegations of mysticism, occultism, and even Satanism. Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although undoubtedly learned, was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore an opinion grounded in the attitudes and <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|This {{concentration}} is offered {{in partnership with}} Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Pastoral Care Department (RWJUH). Students in the D.Min. concentration in Pastoral Care & Counseling / Pastoral Theology will benefit from advanced theological study and professional work specifically designed for those who desire to serve as chaplains, pastoral care specialists, pastoral counselors or congregational pastors. The program emphasizes the helping relationship, theological <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> pastoral care, the multicultural contexts of pastoral care, psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of pastoral care and counseling. A race, class, and gender analysis will be appropriated {{to the practice of}} care and counseling. Questions regarding the program may be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min. Concentration in Pastoral Care and Counseling.|$|E
5|$|When {{speaking}} of {{language as a}} general concept, definitions can be used which stress {{different aspects of the}} phenomenon. These definitions also entail different approaches and <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory. Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.|$|E

25|$|One of Dourish's most {{recognized}} contributions {{has been}} bringing sociological and phenomenological <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> human activity {{to the design}} of technological systems. For example, his work on spatiality in virtual worlds and computer mediated communication has emphasized how people—in interaction with systems and with one another—evolve new <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> space, media, and relationships. He also drew on Schutzian phenomenology to argue that tangible computing and social computing share an underlying emphasis on people as embodied, social actors. Emphasizing people as social and embodied points to the importance of how individuals are constituted through their interactions and movements in space with other people. This model is counterposed to models of the person in Human-Computer Interaction that focus exclusively on people's cognitive capabilities.|$|E
