5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to <b>use</b> <b>condoms.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prev-alence of risk behaviors, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in clients of female sex workers, and to compare them with men selected from the general population. Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of men re-cruited from commercial sex venues in Lima, Peru from January to February 2002. Subjects answered a survey and provided a urine sample. Results: Men reported that in the recently concluded commercial sex encounter, 95. 8 % <b>used</b> <b>condoms,</b> and 85. 8 % always <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> with female sex workers. Only 16 % reported always <b>using</b> <b>condoms</b> with their stable partners; 50. 8 % always <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> with casual, noncommercial partners; and 59. 6 % always <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> for homo-sexual anal sex.

40|$|Nine hundred fifty-five of 1, 384 (69 per cent) gay and {{bisexual}} men {{enrolled in a}} prospective study of {{the natural history of}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who reported engaging in anal intercourse {{in the past six months}} were surveyed about <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> practices for both insertive (IAI) and receptive anal intercourse (RAI). The following results were obtained: 23 per cent of the men reported that they always <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> for IAI and 21 per cent for RAI; 32 per cent sometimes <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> for IAI; 28 per cent sometimes <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> for RAI; 45 per cent never <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> for IAI; and 50 per cent never <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> for RAI. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the following variables were associated with both insertive and receptive condom use: condom acceptability; a history of multiple and/or anonymous partners in the past six months, and the number of partners with whom one is "high" (drugs/alcohol) during sex. Knowledge of positive HIV serostatus was more strongly associated with receptive than with insertive <b>use.</b> <b>Condom</b> <b>use</b> is a relatively complex health-related behavior, and condom promotion programs should not limit themselves to stressing the dangers of unprotected intercourse...|$|R
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control <b>use</b> <b>condoms,</b> while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E

40|$|A {{multitude}} of factors influence <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> self-efficacy, including age, gender, ethnicity, <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> attitudes and barriers, sexual experience, and partner characteristics. The current study integrated past research by evaluating these factors in a large, ethnically diverse university sample {{of women and}} men (N = 665). The role of gender on <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> and sexuality variables was assessed across ethnic groups. Hierarchical linear regressions were then calculated to explain levels of <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> selfefficacy using the hypothesized sexual predictors in nonvirgin, sexually active, and recent <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> subsamples. Predictors explained 18 â€“ 45 % of variance in <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> self-efficacy. Findings suggest that a few key variables accounted for the majority of variance in <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> self-efficacy: <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> attitudes, <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> barriers, satisfaction with sexual communication, anticipated number of sexual partners, one-time sexual encounters, and ethnic identity. Significant gender differences emerged in <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> self-efficacy, <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> attitudes, and <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> behaviors. Ethnic differences were found in range of sexual experience and sexual partner characteristics.

5|$|The {{birth control}} {{movement}} received an unexpected boost during World War I, {{as a result}} of a crisis the U.S. military experienced when many of its soldiers were diagnosed with syphilis or gonorrhea. The military undertook an extensive education campaign, focusing on abstinence, but also offering some contraceptive guidance.Tone, pp. 91â€“115 contains a history of contraception in the U.S. military in World War I. Navy secretary Josephus Daniels led the efforts to enforce abstinence. The military, under pressure from purity advocates, did not distribute condoms, or even endorse their use, making the U.S. the only military force in World War I that did not supply condoms to its troops. When U.S. soldiers were in Europe, they found rubber condoms readily available, and when they returned to America, they continued to <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> as their preferred method of birth control.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} tested the {{efficacy}} of implementation intentions in promoting <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> by means of three studies. First, {{the efficacy of}} implementation intentions targeting a personally selected behavior related to <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> (e. g., buying, carrying, talking about and actually <b>using</b> <b>condoms)</b> was examined {{in a sample of}} STI clinic clients (Study 1). Also, the possibility of using implementation intentions as a means to create a cognitive link between the critical situation and the goal to <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> was investigated in a sample of sexually active people (Study 2 & 3). Results revealed that implementation intentions targeting a personally selected behavior related to <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> did not promote <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> (Study 1), most likely because the goal to <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> is temporarily abandoned in situations where <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> is actually required (Study 2). However, implementation intentions directly targeting the goal to <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> were shown to increase the accessibility of this goal when the intention to <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> was strong (Study 3). This finding suggests that implementation intentions could be effective in promoting <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> by increasing accessibility of the goal to <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> in situ.

500|$|However, {{despite these}} {{widespread}} feelings of fatalism, some men {{believe that they}} can avoid HIV contraction by modifying their personal behaviors. Men who decide to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> consistently, particularly during marital intercourse; instead, they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations, but alter {{the ways in which they}} choose their sexual partners. For example, before selecting extramarital sexual partners, men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus. Men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional gender norms by, for example, wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry HIV, while young girls, who are perceived as sexually inexperienced, are considered [...] "pure." [...] Because of this perception, many people are concerned that schoolchildren in Malawi, particularly girls, are becoming exposed to the virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors.|$|E
500|$|Condoms offer {{moderate}} {{protection against}} HSV-2 in {{both men and}} women, with consistent condom users having a 30%-lower risk of HSV-2 acquisition compared with those who never <b>use</b> <b>condoms.</b> A female condom can provide greater protection than the male condom, as it covers the labia. The virus cannot pass through a synthetic condom, but a male condom's effectiveness is limited [...] because herpes ulcers may appear on areas not covered by it. Neither type of condom prevents contact with the scrotum, anus, buttocks, or upper thighs, areas that may {{come in contact with}} ulcers or genital secretions during sexual activity. Protection against herpes simplex depends {{on the site of the}} ulcer; therefore, if ulcers appear on areas not covered by condoms, abstaining from sexual activity until the ulcers are fully healed is one way to limit risk of transmission. The risk is not eliminated, however, as viral shedding capable of transmitting infection may still occur while the infected partner is asymptomatic. The use of condoms or dental dams also limits the transmission of herpes from the genitals of one partner to the mouth of the other (or vice versa) during oral sex. When one partner has a herpes simplex infection and the other does not, the use of antiviral medication, such as valaciclovir, in conjunction with a condom, further decreases the chances of transmission to the uninfected partner. Topical microbicides that contain chemicals that directly inactivate the virus and block viral entry are being investigated.|$|E

Quantitative data were gathered by KABP surveys (n = 1450) and a condom diary with a sample of 204 female sex workers.

Reasons for not <b>using</b> <b>condoms</b> from the clients' side, as mentioned by the sex workers, were perceived less pleasure due to the condom and the belief that clients that are acquainted with the sex workers do not need protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or AIDS. The main reasons of female sex workers for not <b>using</b> <b>condoms</b> were the beliefs that boyfriends, native Indonesians and healthy-looking clients cannot spread STDs. Another reason stated was that sex workers had already taken other preventive measures, like taking antibiotics.
