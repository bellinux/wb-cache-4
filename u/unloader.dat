25|$|Modern unloaders use rotary dump devices, which {{eliminate}} {{problems with}} coal freezing in bottom dump cars. The <b>unloader</b> includes a train positioner arm that pulls the entire train to position each car over a coal hopper. The dumper clamps an individual car against a platform that swivels the car upside down {{to dump the}} coal. Swiveling couplers enable the entire operation to occur while the cars are still coupled together. Unloading a unit train takes about three hours.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several years, Howe's {{business}} expanded into engineering consulting and, much more profitably, general contracting. His firm came to dominate the construction of grain elevators in the West, as the Saskatchewan and Alberta wheat pools gave him much of their construction business. This made him unpopular among private wheat companies: [...] his firm did not receive any contracts to build terminal elevators for private corporations in the 1920s, but exceeded the number built by all other contractors combined, thanks to business from those cooperatives. [...] Howe's elevators were built more quickly, were better designed, and were cheaper to construct than those of his competitors. He worked to add to their efficiency; the Dominion-Howe <b>unloader</b> he helped design emptied a grain car in eight minutes, needing only two operators; the same operation had previously taken an hour for a crew of 20men.|$|E
50|$|The <b>unloader</b> is {{typically}} lowered only a half-inch or so {{at a time}} by the operator, and the <b>unloader</b> picks up {{only a small amount}} of material until the winch cable has become taut and the <b>unloader</b> is not picking up any more material. The operator then lowers the <b>unloader</b> another half-inch or so and the process repeats. If lowered too far, the <b>unloader</b> can pull up much more material than it can handle, which can overflow and plug up the blower, outlet spout, and the <b>unloader</b> tube, resulting in a time-wasting process of having to climb up the silo to clear the blockages.|$|E
5000|$|Cylinder <b>unloaders</b> are {{a method}} of load control used mainly in {{commercial}} air conditioning systems. [...] On a semi-hermetic (or open) compressor, the heads can be fitted with <b>unloaders</b> which remove {{a portion of the}} load from the compressor so that it can run better when full cooling is not needed. <b>Unloaders</b> can be electrical or mechanical.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews methodologies {{for fatigue}} {{analysis}} {{with emphasis on}} ship <b>unloaders.</b> Maintaining the performance of ship <b>unloaders</b> at a satisfactory level is essential for any port 2 ̆ 7 s operation in order {{to comply with the}} global demand of shipping and trading. Ship <b>unloaders</b> are subject to alternating operational loadings and to adverse environmental conditions, and as a result, they show a rapid rate of deterioration that makes them susceptible to failure by cumulative damage processes such as corrosion and fatigue. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review key features of the most common methodologies for fatigue analysis and to underline the limitations and uncertainties involved. Finally, developments in reliability-based approaches are suggested for a more accurate fatigue assessment of ship <b>unloaders...</b>|$|R
50|$|Tower silos {{containing}} silage {{are usually}} unloaded {{from the top}} of the pile, originally by hand using a silage fork, which has many more tines than the common pitchfork, 12 vs 4, in modern times using mechanical <b>unloaders.</b> Bottom silo <b>unloaders</b> are utilized at times but have problems with difficulty of repair.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} that the <b>unloader</b> {{mechanism}} becomes plugged, the farmer must climb the silo and directly stand on the <b>unloader,</b> reaching into the blower spout to dig out the soft silage. After clearing a plug, the forage needs to be forked out into an even layer around the <b>unloader</b> so that the <b>unloader</b> does not immediately dig into the pile and plug itself again. All during this process the farmer is standing on or near a machine that could easily kill them in seconds if it were to accidentally start up. This could happen if someone in the barn were to unknowingly switch on the unloading mechanism while someone is in the silo working on the <b>unloader.</b>|$|E
50|$|Preparation {{for filling}} a silo {{requires}} winching the <b>unloader</b> to the top, and any remaining forage {{at the base}} that the <b>unloader</b> could not pick up must {{be removed from the}} floor of the silo. This job requires that the farmer work directly underneath a machine weighing several tons suspended fifty feet or more overhead from a small steel cable. Should the <b>unloader</b> fall, the farmer will likely be killed instantly.|$|E
50|$|While {{the iconic}} blue Harvestore low-oxygen silos were once very common, {{the speed of}} its <b>unloader</b> {{mechanism}} {{was not able to}} match the output rates of modern bunker silos, and this type of silo went into decline. <b>Unloader</b> repair expenses also severely hurt the Harvestore reputation, because the <b>unloader</b> feed mechanism is located {{in the bottom of the}} silo under tons of silage. In the event of cutter chain breakage, it can cost up to US$10,000 to perform repairs. The silo may need to be partially or completely emptied by alternate means, to unbury the broken <b>unloader</b> retrieve broken components lost in the silage at the bottom of the structure.|$|E

50|$|Barge {{unloading}} {{should be}} conducted {{in a manner that}} minimizes the amount of cargo spilled onto the deck. The unloading process {{is the responsibility of the}} <b>unloader</b> operator at the unloading facility. Unloading can be done with a Grab Bucket Barge <b>Unloader</b> or a Continuous Barge <b>Unloader</b> (CBU). The Grab Bucket system employs a clamshell bucket suspended by a set of hoisting cables, with a separate set of control cables that open and close the bucket. The CBU is a series of buckets supported between two strands of roller chain, running in a continuous loop.|$|E
50|$|The silo <b>unloader</b> {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} a pair of counter-rotating toothed augers which rip up the surface of the silage and pull it towards the center of the <b>unloader.</b> The toothed augers rotate in a circle around the center hub, evenly chewing the silage off the surface of the pile. In the center, a large blower assembly picks up the silage and blows it out the silo door, where the silage falls by gravity down the <b>unloader</b> tube {{to the bottom of the}} silo, typically into an automated conveyor system.|$|E

40|$|Not {{far from}} Rye Beach was the Huron, Ohio, port where Hulett ore <b>unloaders</b> {{serviced}} ore-hauling freighters like the John W. Gates. Invented by George H. Hulett in 1899, the unloading machine with a self-filling bucket revolutionized the unloading of ore on the Great Lakes. The Hulett <b>unloaders</b> were first {{installed at the}} Carnegie Steel Company docks at Conneaut, Ohio. Eventually, the <b>unloaders</b> were installed at every port on Lake Erie, including Ashtabula, Huron, and Toledo. Seventy-five Huletts were built, all of them by the Wellman-Seaver-Morgan Company of Cleveland. There {{were more than a}} dozen machines located at Cleveland alone. Prior to 1899, ore was unloaded by wheelbarrow at an average cost of 50 cents per ton. The Huletts reduced the cost to 5 cents per ton...|$|R
