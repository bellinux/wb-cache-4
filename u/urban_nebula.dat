In comparison to the lay-out of the rail network in the (pre-) industrial landscape in the 19 th century, the complexity of trajectory planning has greatly increased. Consolidation of the built, mobility and infrastructural landscape, an increasing complexity of policy and procedures and a higher sensitivity to environmental issues, safety and property rights, have all resulted in complex and expensive infrastructures and in elaborate design and planning procedures. Three major forces weigh on the choice for a trajectory, {{one of which is}} a pushing force – i. e. finding a trajectory with ‘least resistance’ – and two pulling forces – i. e. bundling of infrastructure and maximizing passenger numbers. The research structures these forces into three distinct design principles, which are refered to as design spectra. Maximizing the number of passenger is the primary force and positions one extreme of each spectrum, as it is the raison d’être of public transport and the origin of its trajectory planning. At the other side of each spectrum come the steering forces: a trajectory of ‘least resistance’ (1), bundling with rail lines (2) and bundling with highways (3). The first design principle looks for an independent trajectory while optimizing travel conditions. The second principle, bundling with existing rail lines, tries {{to take advantage of the}} characteristics of existing rail infrastructure and convert them dynamically to make them more suited for the regional landscape they run through. Bundling with highways or regional roads, tries to take advantage of bundling opportunities and serve adjacent functions. For each trajectory principle a matrix of design possibilities explores on the one hand variables as proximity and stop density and tests on the other hand design concepts for both an active and a passive integration. The active approach proposes a design configuration in favor of public transport and its use, while the latter focuses less on development potential and aims at minimal disturbances of existing car-based spatial organization. Out of this exploration, based on research by design, and by looking at foreign case studies, recommendations can be made for trajectory design and profiles in the Flemish nebula. status: publishe...|$|E
