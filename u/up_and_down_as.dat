5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>as</b> before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
25|$|Very {{low-power}} engines {{have been}} built that run on a temperature difference of as little as 0.5 K. A displacer type stirling engine has one piston and one displacer. A temperature difference is required between {{the top and bottom}} of the large cylinder to run the engine. In the case of the low-temperature difference (LTD) stirling engine, the temperature difference between one's hand and the surrounding air can be enough to run the engine. The power piston in the displacer type stirling engine is tightly sealed and is controlled to move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> the gas inside expands. The displacer, on the other hand, is very loosely fitted so that air can move freely between the hot and cold sections of the engine as the piston moves up and down. The displacer moves up and down to control the heating and cooling of the gas in the engine.|$|E

25|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of the canter is {{important}} if a person wants to ride the horse with a balanced, secure, yet flexible seat. To the rider, the horse's back feels as if it is moving both <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> well as somewhat back and forth, not unlike {{the motion of}} a swing. When the hind legs engage (which occurs just before beat one), the horse raises its head and neck as its hind leg steps under. As the legs push off the ground (beats 1 and 2) the head and neck of the horse drops. When the leading leg (beat 3) touches the ground, the head and neck are as low as they will be for the stride, and then they begin to come back up as the horse places its weight on its leading leg. During the suspension phase, the head and neck continue back to the highest point as the hind legs come back under the body.|$|E
25|$|Parabolic troughs {{are used}} to {{concentrate}} sunlight for solar-energy purposes. Some solar cookers have been built that use {{them in the same}} way. Generally, the trough is aligned with its focal line horizontal and east-west. The food to be cooked is arranged along this line. The trough is pointed so its axis of symmetry aims at the sun at noon. This requires the trough to be tilted <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> the seasons progress. At the equinoxes, no movement of the trough is needed during the day to track the sun. At other times of year, there is a period of several hours around noon each day when no tracking is needed. Usually, the cooker is used only during this period, so no automatic sun tracking is incorporated into it. This simplicity makes the design attractive, compared with using a paraboloid. Also, being a , the trough reflector is simpler to construct. However, it suffers from lower efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E

500|$|Bungie's {{next project}} {{began as a}} sequel to Pathways into Darkness, but evolved into a futuristic first person shooter called Marathon.

500|$|In the {{original}} 1876 production, the Rhinemaidens were wheeled around on stands behind semi-transparent screens. The stage machinery and the lighting effects {{were designed by}} Carl Brandt, who was the foremost stage technician of the time. One innovation which Cosima did eventually approve was {{the replacement of the}} wheeled stands with giant, invisible [...] "fishing rods" [...] on which the Rhinemaidens were dangled. Wires continued {{to be used in the}} Bayreuth productions of Siegfried Wagner and, later, those of his widow Winifred, who ran the Bayreuth Festival until the end of the Second World War. Similar techniques have been used in more modern productions. In the 1996 Lyric Opera of Chicago Ring cycle, repeated in 2004–05, the Rhinemaidens were suspended on bungee cords anchored in the fly space above the stage, enabling them to dive <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>as</b> intended by Wagner. The Rhinemaidens were played on-stage by gymnasts, mouthing words sung by singers standing in a corner of the stage.|$|E
500|$|During Cleveland's {{audition}} for The Bachelorette, an unused scene was created that showed both Peter and Cleveland naked, with Peter {{sitting on top}} of Cleveland and bouncing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>as</b> if he and Cleveland were engaging in anal sex, but broadcasting standards prohibited the scene. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane comments in the DVD commentary that Walter Murphy, who composes much of the music for Family Guy, goes back and forth from standard Family Guy music to Bachelorette-style music during the episode. During the sequence where Brian and Brooke are talking in the barn, originally, the two horses in the background were intended to begin mating, but the sketch was never used. Nancy Cartwright, voice actor of Bart Simpson on The Simpsons, and Michael Bell, voice actor of Chaz Finster on Rugrats, provided their voices for the Snorks reference. The name of Quagmire's cat was originally [...] "Pussy", but broadcasting standards objected. The episode was originally to feature a sequence showing Chris breaking entry into Goldman's Pharmacy in order to destroy the acne medication wearing a Balaclava, but the scene was never shown. The promo features Quagmire in a limo finding the girl of his dreams, but the scene was also cut.|$|E
