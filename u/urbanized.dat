5|$|For example, {{in early}} 2008, the postal code G0N 3M0 (covering Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier, Fossambault-sur-le-Lac and Lac-Saint-Joseph, Quebec) was <b>urbanized</b> to postal codes {{beginning}} with G3N to remove ambiguities and confusions caused by similar street names. Unique among province-wide districts, New Brunswick (postal district E) is completely <b>urbanized,</b> its rural codes having been phased out.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{percent of the}} Abrahams Creek {{watershed}} is rural and 20 percent is <b>urbanized.</b> The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization. Its upper reaches contain second-growth forest, small patches of residential land, linear hedgerows, and agricultural land such as hay pastures, pastures, and farmland. The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed, but many {{other areas of the}} watershed could easily be <b>urbanized.</b> The mining-affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Before urban development, {{the damage}} caused by {{overgrazing}} during the Spanish period was still considered capable of recovery. However, the completion of Interstate 5 through the middle of the San Juan Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into a bedroom community for Los Angeles and permanently erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of <b>urbanized</b> land increased from 3percent in 1964 to 18percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent <b>urbanized.</b> With continuing development in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.|$|E
50|$|In February 1980, Genstar-Peñasquitos (now AG Land Associates, LLC) {{dedicated}} a {{total of}} 1806 acre of Los Peñasquitos Canyon to the city. This created a border for the preserve. As a result, a community planning program was initiated, and the original plan area was transferred from Future <b>Urbanizing</b> to Planned <b>Urbanizing</b> on the General Plan, excluding 178 acre adjacent to the Sorrento Hills community planning area, which was designated as Future <b>Urbanizing.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the {{departure}} of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O'odham (commonly known as Pima), Tohono O'odham and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache. The O'odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the formerly <b>urbanized</b> Hohokam.|$|E
5|$|After the {{intersection}} with U.S. Route6, the surroundings around the highway become {{a mix of}} homes and forests. This lasts {{for much of the}} distance on Route434 until Greeley, where it becomes <b>urbanized</b> again. In downtown Greeley, Route434 splits at an intersection where Pennsylvania Route 590 begins. The highway makes a curve, turning to the southeast for a distance north of Greeley. Soon afterwards, Route434 parallels Shohola Creek, heading northeastward. Route434 begins to become <b>urbanized</b> for a third time, passing some large buildings along with homes and forests. The creek continues to parallel, with the highway turning in several different directions. The forests begin to recede as Route434 enters Shohola Township. Twin Lakes Road, a quadrant route, terminates at Route434 before crossing the Delaware River and becoming New York State Route 55 and Sullivan County Route 11 at the border.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in the {{increasingly}} <b>urbanized</b> Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease. Between 1989 and 2002, Murmansk Oblast lost almost a quarter of its population; and almost 100,000 more between 2002 and 2010. Nevertheless, the economy rebounded somewhat {{in the first decade of}} the 2000s and the peninsula remains the most industrially developed and <b>urbanized</b> region in northern Russia.|$|E
5|$|After the war area {{economic}} diversification {{brought on by}} the war effort helped in the transition to a peacetime economy. NASA's Johnson Space Center was established in 1963 helping to spur explosive growth in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s. The remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore <b>urbanized</b> and development connected the area to Houston. Tourism and recreation re-emerged and blossomed particularly around the Clear Lake area and the nearby shoreline.Barrington (2008), p. 266.Antrobus (2005), p. 57.|$|E
5|$|All in all, the Soviet period saw a {{significant}} increase in population (799,000 in 1970 vs. 15,000 in 1913), although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the railroads and the sea coast. Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the <b>urbanized</b> areas were used for deer herding. In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million black people and 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated the population along racial lines and there was very little mixing between the colours. The white population was highly <b>urbanized</b> and, in Léopoldville, the capital, lived in a quarter of the city separated from the black majority. All blacks in the city had to adhere to a curfew.|$|E
5|$|Even as a princely state, Mysore came to {{be counted}} among the more {{developed}} and <b>urbanized</b> regions of India. This period (1799–1947) also saw Mysore emerge {{as one of the}} important centres of art and culture in India. The Mysore kings were not only accomplished exponents of the fine arts and men of letters, they were enthusiastic patrons as well, and their legacies continue to influence music and art even today.|$|E
5|$|In 1784, Belgium's {{population}} was 2.6million, with just 25 percent living in cities. During the 19th century, the population both expanded and <b>urbanized.</b> Between 1830 and 1875 {{the population of}} Brussels grew from 100,000 to 180,000, and by 1910 {{the population of the}} metropolitan area soared to 750,000. The population of Belgium was almost universally Roman Catholic, though free-thinking movements like Freemasonry were also popular among intellectuals and the urban middle classes.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} coastal Orange County streams, the {{watershed}} of Aliso Creek is now heavily <b>urbanized.</b> With 70percent {{of the original}} land surface now underneath impermeable surfaces such as pavement and buildings, far more runoff now enters the creek—not only inducing an increased year-round flow, but much larger rainy season flows. In the 1920s and 1930s, devastating floods wreaked havoc on much of southern California; the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 was the most famous flooding episode of this period.|$|E
5|$|M-97 {{runs through}} an <b>urbanized</b> {{area in the}} larger Metro Detroit. The highway starts at M-3/Gratiot Avenue and follows Gunston Street northwesterly. This {{intersection}} is one block northeast of the Coleman A. Young International Airport in Detroit. At McNichols Road, which forms part of 6 Mile Road in the Mile Road System, M-97 turns north on Hoover Street, and follows it north past Bessy Playground at 7 Mile Road. It continues north on Hoover until it turns onto Groesbeck Highway, just one block south of M-102/8 Mile Road.|$|E
5|$|North of the line, {{the highway}} follows West Side Saginaw Road through fields {{in a less}} <b>urbanized</b> area.

At the intersection with Euclid Avenue on the city line, M-13 merges in {{from the north and}} the two highways run concurrently along Salzburg Avenue. Since this segment of highway is both northbound M-84 and southbound M-13 along eastbound Salzburg Avenue, the two trunklines form a wrong-way concurrency.|$|E
