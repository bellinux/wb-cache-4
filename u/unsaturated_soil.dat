Suction stress is adopted in the new model {{in order to get}} the sound form of effective stress for <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> The shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> is dependent on its soil-moisture state based on the results of shear experiments. Hence, the parameters of this model are related tightly to hydraulic properties of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> and the strength parameters of saturated soils. The predictive curves by the new model are coincident with experimental data that underwent single drying and drying/wetting cycle paths. Hence, hysteretic effect in the strength analysis is necessary to be considered to predict the change of shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> that underwent drying/wetting cycles. Once the new model is used to predict the change of shear strength, lots of time could be saved due to avoiding heavy and complicated strength tests of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> Especially, the model can be suitable to evaluate the shear strength change of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> and the stability of slopes experienced the drying/wetting cycles...|$|R
40|$|Modelling of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> {{has been}} the subject of many {{research}} works in the past few decades. A number of constitutive models have been developed to describe the complex behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> However, many have proven to be unable to predict all aspects of the behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> in a unified manner. In this paper an alternative new approach is presented, based on the Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR) technique. EPR is a data mining technique that generates a transparent and structured representation of the behaviour of a system directly from input test data. The capabilities of the proposed EPR-based framework in modelling of behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> are illustrated using results from a comprehensive set of triaxial tests on samples of compacted <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> from literature. The main parameters used for modelling of the behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> during shearing are initial water content, initial dry density, mean net stress, axial strain, suction, volumetric strain, and deviator stress. The model developed is used to predict different aspects of the behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> for conditions not used in the model building process. The results show that the proposed approach provides a useful framework for modelling of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> The merits and advantages of the proposed approach are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the most}} {{successful}} relationships for effective stresses on <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> was proposed by Bishop {{in the middle of the}} last century. However, only recently Bishop´s effective stress equation has been implemented in various constitutive models for <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> These models have the advantage of naturally include the coupling between the hydraulic and the mechanical behavior experimentally observed on these materials. Unfortunately, still remains the problem of properly evaluate Bishop´s parameter χ. This paper presents the results of a solid-porous model used to determine Bishop´s parameter χ and evaluate the strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> These theoretical results are compared with a series of triaxial test performed on a silty sand subject to different suctions in wetting and drying paths.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, several advancements {{have been made}} in the {{research}} area of the mechanics of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> These advancements can be categorized into two groups; (i) development (or improvement) of testing techniques (or apparatus) to determine the mechanical properties of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> and (ii) development of (numerical, empirical or semi-empirical) models to estimate the variation of mechanical properties of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> with respect to suction based on the experimental results. Implementation of the mechanics of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> in conventional geotechnical engineering practice, however, has been rather limited. The key reasons for the limited practical applications may be attributed to the lack of simple and reliable methods for (i) measuring soil suction in the field quickly and reliably and (ii) estimating the variation of mechanical properties of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> with respect to suction. The main objective of this thesis research is to develop simple and reliable techniques, models or approaches that can be used in geotechnical engineering practice to estimate sol suction and the mechanical properties of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> This research can be categorized into three parts. In the First Part, simple techniques are proposed to estimate the suction values of as-compacted <b>unsaturated</b> fine-grained <b>soils</b> using a pocket penetrometer and a conventional tensiometer. The suction values less than 300 kPa can be estimated using a strong relationship between the compressive strength measured using a pocket penetrometer and matric suction value. The high suction values in the range of 1, 200 kPa to 60, 000 kPa can be estimated using the unique relationship between the initial tangent of conventional tensiometer response versus time behavior and suction value. In the Second Part, approaches or semi-empirical models are proposed to estimate the variation of mechanical properties of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> with respect to suction, which include: -	Bearing capacity of <b>unsaturated</b> fine-grained <b>soils</b> -	Variation of bearing capacity of <b>unsaturated</b> fine-grained <b>soils</b> with respect to matric suction -	Variation of initial tangent elastic modulus of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> below shallow foundations with respect to matric suction -	Variation of maximum shear modulus with respect to matric suction for <b>unsaturated</b> non-plastic sandy <b>soils</b> (i. e. plasticity index, Ip = 0 %) In the Third Part, approaches (or methodologies) are suggested to simulate the vertically applied stress versus surface settlement behavior of shallow foundations in <b>unsaturated</b> coarse-grained <b>soils</b> assuming elastic-perfectly plastic behavior. These methodologies are extended to simulate the stress versus settlement behavior of both model footings and in-situ plates in <b>unsaturated</b> coarse-grained <b>soils.</b> The results show that there is a reasonably good comparison between the measured values (i. e. soil suction, bearing capacity, elastic and shear modulus) and those estimated using the techniques or models proposed in this thesis research. The models (or methodologies) proposed in this thesis research are promising and encouraging for modeling studies and practicing engineers to estimate the variation of mechanical behavior of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> with respect to matric suction...|$|R

Some recent models for <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> also possess a stress path dependent hardening law.

40|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a key}} engineering property required {{in the design of}} several geotechnical structures that include earth dams, pavements, slopes, retaining walls and foundations. In many situations these structures are constructed with <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> or in soils that are placed in a state of unsaturated condition. The designs of these structures are based on conventional soil mechanics assuming that the soil is in a state saturated condition resulting in conservative estimations. Several experimental techniques are presently available and more are evolving for determining the shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> in the laboratory environment in this emerging research area that is of significant practical interest. However, these experimental techniques are expensive, time consuming and need elaborate testing equipment. In addition, qualified and trained personnel are required for reliably determining the shear strength behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> Due to these reasons, the focus of investigations {{in recent years has been}} directed towards predicting the shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> There are several techniques that include semi-empirical, empirical and mathematical fitting relationships that can be used in the prediction or estimation of the variation of shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> with respect to suction. Such techniques are encouraging towards extending the mechanics of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> into engineering practice. In spite of recent advances in the field of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils,</b> few practitioners have background with respect to the shear strength behaviour and the mechanics of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> This thesis provides a historical background of the development of concepts related to our present understanding of the shear strength behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> The techniques of interpreting the shear strength behaviour proposed by various investigators are also summarized. The details presented in the thesis also include the state-of-the-art testing procedures for determining the shear strength behaviour. In addition, a wealth of 130 soils data published in the literature from various conferences and journals from all over the world are summarized. There are twenty-five different equations that are available in the literature to predict the variation of shear strength with respect to suction using different techniques. All these techniques are summarized providing details of the philosophies used in the development of these equations. Thirteen of the above equations use the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) and the saturated shear strength parameters (c' and &phis;') for predicting the shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> Other techniques that include mathematical fitting models and empirical relationships for estimating the shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> are also summarized. Seven prediction equations commonly used in the literature are chosen from the available 25 equations in the literature to predict the variation of shear strength with respect to suction using 130 data sets of published experimental results from the literature. A quantitative assessment method is used in comparing the predicted and measured shear strength results of the 130 sets. Each of the seven prediction equations is able to successfully predict the variation of shear strength with respect to suction for some of the soils; however, approximately 8 % of the soils were not able to be successfully predicted by any of the 7 equations. The shear strength behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> if a complex relationship which is dependent on many factors including stress history, density, soil structure or fabric, water content, volume change behaviour during shearing state and testing techniques. For example, recent developments in shear strength testing techniques show that previously measured water content in samples may not be representative of the actual water content due to diffused air, condensation and evaporation in the system. In other words, the simple prediction procedures that are available in the literature are not capable of taking into account many complex parameters that influence the shear strength behaviour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> Therefore, the available techniques or procedures have to be used in practice with engineering judgment while predicting the shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils.</b> Some guidelines and recommendations are provided with respect to the available prediction procedures such that practicing engineers and other investigators can use them understanding the strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the research work summarized in this thesis is also useful for other investigators to undertake future work in the area of shear strength of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soils</b> to better understand its behaviour...|$|R

50|$|In many cases, {{absolute}} value of matrix potential can be relatively large {{in comparison to}} the other components of water potential discussed above. Matrix potential markedly reduces the energy state of water near particle surfaces. Although water movement due to matrix potential may be slow, it is still extremely important in supplying water to plant roots and in engineering applications. The matrix potential is always negative because the water attracted by the soil matrix has an energy state lower than that of pure water. Matrix potential only occurs in <b>unsaturated</b> <b>soil</b> above the water table. If the matrix potential approaches a value of zero, nearly all soil pores are completely filled with water, i.e. fully saturated and at maximum retentive capacity. The matrix potential can vary considerably among soils. In the case that water drains into less-moist soil zones of similar porosity, the matrix potential is generally in the range of −10 to −30 kPa.|$|E
