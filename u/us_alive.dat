Frumer was murdered a few days later, on May 2, 1943 (27 Nisan 5703). It was reported that as he was taken to the gas chamber, he clapped his hands and proclaimed aloud, [...] "Let us sanctify God's Name with joy.

Now therefore come, and let us go to the host of the Arameans; if they save <b>us</b> <b>alive,</b> we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die,’" [...] and [...] "And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there," [...] the Rabbis deduced that when there is a famine a place, one should migrate elsewhere.

2500|$|Information on {{conditions}} in the stalags is contradictory depending on the source. Some American POWs claimed the Germans were victims of circumstance and did the best they could, while others accused their captors of brutalities and forced labour. In any case, the prison camps were miserable places where food rations were meager and conditions squalid. One American admitted [...] "The only difference between the stalags and concentration camps was that we weren't gassed or shot in the former. I do not recall a single act of compassion or mercy {{on the part of}} the Germans." [...] Typical meals consisted of a bread slice and watery potato soup which, however, was still more substantial than what Soviet POWs or concentration camp inmates received. Another prisoner stated that [...] "The German plan was to keep <b>us</b> <b>alive,</b> yet weakened enough that we wouldn't attempt escape." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{recording}} and producing the album, Queen incorporated different musical instruments such as [...] "strings, piano, acoustic ballads and romantic tunes". This {{was an attempt}} to prove that reggaetón is not just its basic rhythm. She explained [...] "many think reggaetón is just nice rhythms to dance to. And they forget there are song-writers and composers, who, like everyone else, also suffer and aspire in love". She said [...] "Love is what makes us write things, what keeps <b>us</b> <b>alive.</b> If we did not have love, we would have nothing". She acknowledged that the songs on the album were one way she dealt with the end of her eleven-year marriage. The lyrics focus on the experiences she has endured within the couple of years since the release of her previous studio album, which according to Queen were a [...] "tough situation in her personal life". The ballads of the album [...] "cover familiar topics — devotion, heartbreak, hope and reconciliation". Musically, the album alternates between reggaetón, bolero, and salsa.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, Ivy Queen {{released}} her sixth studio album entitled Sentimiento. She {{began working on}} the album in 2006 after Cosa Nostra became a commercial failure.

The solo tracks include; [...] "Pobre Corazón" [...] by Divino, [...] "Manaña Al Despertar" [...] by Baby Rasta and Norieganone of which feature Queen's vocals.

2500|$|Between 3 and 4 {{o'clock in}} the {{afternoon}} of the said 29th, it began to rain mud and ashes at Caysasay ( [...] from the volcano) and this rain lasted three days. The most terrifying circumstance was that the whole sky was shrouded in such darkness that we could not have seen the hand placed before the face, {{had it not been for}} the sinister glare of incessant lightnings. Nor could we use artificial light as this was extinguished by the wind and copious ashes which penetrated everywhere. All was horror those three days, which appeared rather like murky nights and we did not occupy ourselves with anything but see to it that the natives swept off the roofs the large quantities of ashes and stones which kept on accumulating upon them and threatened to bring them down upon us, burying <b>us</b> <b>alive</b> beneath their weight. But fearing that even these precautions might prove unavailing, we 3 Europeans – viz. Fr. Prior, the Alcalde, and myself – the only ones who were at the time in the Convento of Caysasay, took refuge on the landing of the stairs; as the safest place, and awaited there whatever God might dispose with regard to us. To all this was added incessant thunder and lightning, and it really looked as if the world was going to pieces and its axis had been displaced.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Queen's fifth studio album in 2005 in the Latin market, she began working on her sixth studio album in 2006. She {{wanted to create a}} new album with more slower and romantic reggaetón. This stemmed from Queen divorcing her husband of nine years and {{releasing}} all of her anger on Flashback. Not wanting to go into detail, she [...] "acknowledged the songs were just one way she dealt with the end of an 11-year relationship". On the album, as a part of her evolution in reggaetón, she includes [...] "solo turns", instead of duets by guest artist. Of the solo tracks on the album is [...] "Pobre Corazón" [...] by Divino while others include [...] "Manaña Al Despertar" [...] by Baby Rasta and Noriega where the artist performed songs without vocals by Ivy Queen. She said she wanted to give a 180-degree turn to what people think of reggaetón. She explained [...] "Many think reggaetón is just nice rhythms to dance to. And they forget there are song-writers and composers, who, like everyone else, also suffer and aspire in love". She wanted the album to be about that. She said [...] "Love is what makes us write things, what keeps <b>us</b> <b>alive.</b> If we did not have love, we would have nothing".|$|E
