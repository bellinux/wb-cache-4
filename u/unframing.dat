40|$|Organizational life {{is replete}} with claims for emancipation. Existing {{approaches}} understand these claims either through theories of macro-emancipation (which focus on larger social structural challenges) or micro-emancipation (which focus on everyday challenges). However, these theories fundamentally misrecognize many emancipatory challenges in organizations. Drawing {{on the work of}} Jacques Rancière, we argue that this philosophy is fertile for shifting or <b>unframing</b> traditional approaches of emancipation in organization studies. Emancipation is triggered by the assertion of equality in the face of institutionalized patterns of inequality, it works through a process of articulating dissensus, and it creates a redistribution of what is considered to be sensible. By focusing on these three aspects, we argue that a whole range of emancipatory struggles which had previously been disregarded by studies of macro-emancipation and micro-emancipation come back into view. This significantly extends how we conceptualize emancipation in organizations and allows us to address some of the shortcomings of existing theories...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{the wildly}} {{conflicting}} critical evaluations of Elizabeth Bowen 2 ̆ 7 s final novel, Eva Trout, or Changing Scenes (1969) as its starting-point, this essay argues against 2 ̆ 7 interpreting 2 ̆ 7 both {{the novel and}} its 2 ̆ 7 monstrous 2 ̆ 7 heroine in conventional representational terms, to argue, instead, for an appreciation, or experience, of both novel and protagonist as instantiations of a process of becoming along Deleuzian lines. Rather than seeing Bowen 2 ̆ 7 s final novel as a (failed) attempt {{to do what the}} Anglo-Irish writer 2 ̆ 7 s previous work would have suggested this text to do as well, the novel and its eponymous heroine are approached as Bowen 2 ̆ 7 s rigorously ethical effort to, first, obviate the opposition between living and writing, and second, to show, rather than claim, that art and life are indissolubly connected. Drawing on both Gilles Deleuze 2 ̆ 7 s notion of the 2 ̆ 7 traitor-prophet 2 ̆ 7, whose function is to call both the world of dominant signification and the established order into question, and on Deleuze 2 ̆ 7 s counterpart Flix Guattari 2 ̆ 7 s concept of the work of art as an activity of 2 ̆ 7 <b>unframing</b> 2 ̆ 7, the article ultimately suggests that the novel 2 ̆ 7 s effect, beyond representation and, indeed, through its own and its protagonist 2 ̆ 7 s language, is the 2 ̆ 7 undoing 2 ̆ 7 of the reader, opening up a realm of virtual becoming that is neither reassuring nor to be captured in the chains of signification...|$|E

The idea of our proof is to show that Kontsevich's chain of quasi-isomorphisms is compatible with the circle actions and so one can essentially take the operadic semidirect product with the homology of S^ 1 everywhere to obtain a chain of quasi-isomorphisms between the homology and the chains of the framed 2 -discs.

In this dissertation, we prove an analogous result one dimension higher: that the 2 -category of <b>unframed,</b> unoriented 2 -tangles is the free semistrict braided monoidal 2 -category with duals on one <b>unframed</b> self dual object. We give appropriate definitions of the 2 -category of 2 -tangles, and of duality for monoidal and braided monoidal 2 -categories. We use the movie moves of Carter, Rieger and Saito, to show that there is a 2 -functor from this 2 -category to any braided monoidal 2 -category with duals containing an <b>unframed</b> self dual object.

40|$|Just as {{knots and}} links can be algebraically {{described}} as certain morphisms {{in the category}} of tangles in 3 dimensions, compact surfaces smoothly embedded in R 4 can be described as certain 2 -morphisms in the 2 -category of ` 2 -tangles in 4 dimensions'. Using the work of Carter, Rieger and Saito, we prove that this 2 -category is the `free semistrict braided monoidal 2 -category with duals on one <b>unframed</b> self-dual object'. By this universal property, any <b>unframed</b> self-dual object in a braided monoidal 2 -category with duals determines an invariant of 2 -tangles in 4 dimensions. ...|$|R
