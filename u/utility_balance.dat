40|$|Adaptive metric <b>utility</b> <b>balance</b> is at {{the heart}} of one of the most widely used and studied methods for {{conjoint}} analysis. We use formal models, simulations, and empirical data to suggest that adaptive metric <b>utility</b> <b>balance</b> leads to partworth estimates that are relatively biased—smaller partworths are upwardly biased relative to larger partworths. Such relative biases could lead to erroneous managerial decisions. Metric utility-balanced questions are also more likely to be inefficient and, in one empirical example, contrary to popular wisdom, lead to response errors that are at least as large as nonadaptive orthogonal questions. We demonstrate that this bias is because of endogeneity caused by a “winner’s curse. ” Shrinkage estimates do not mitigate these biases. Combined with adaptive metric <b>utility</b> <b>balance,</b> shrinkage estimates of heterogeneous partworths are biased downward relative to homogeneous partworths. Although biases can affect managerial decisions, our data suggest that, empirically, biases and inefficiencies are of the order of response errors. We examine viable alternatives to metric <b>utility</b> <b>balance</b> that researchers can use without biases or inefficiencies to retain the desired properties of (1) individual-level adaptation and (2) challenging questions. conjoint analysis, efficient question design, adaptive question design, Internet market research, e-commerce, product development...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{design is}} {{critical}} to valid inference {{from the results of}} discrete choice experiments (DCEs). In health economics, DCEs have placed limited emphasis on experimental design, typically employing relatively small fractional factorial designs, which allow only strictly linear additive utility functions to be estimated. The extensive literature on optimal experimental design outside health economics has proposed potentially desirable design properties, such as orthogonality, <b>utility</b> <b>balance</b> and level balance. However, there are trade-offs between these properties and emphasis on some properties may increase the random variability in responses, potentially biasing parameter estimates. This study investigates empirically the design properties of DCEs, in particular, the optimal method of combining alternatives in the choice set. The study involves a forced choice between two alternatives (treatment and non-treatment for a hypothetical health care condition), each with three, four-level, alternative-specific attributes. Three experimental design approaches are investigated: a standard six-attribute, orthogonal main effects design; a design that combines alternatives to achieve <b>utility</b> <b>balance,</b> ensuring no alternatives are dominated; and a design that combines alternatives randomly. The different experimental designs did not impact on the underlying parameter estimates, but imposing <b>utility</b> <b>balance</b> increases the random variability of responses.

40|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the most important issues for clean production. In a chemical production site, production and utility plants are highly interactive and are all required to perform preventive maintenance to reduce production losses and accidents due to equipment failures. To minimize its impact on production and utility systems during routine maintenance, maintenance scheduling has to be done carefully with consideration of site-wide <b>utilities</b> and material <b>balances.</b> In this paper, a multi-period mixed integer linear programming model, namely a site model, is proposed for generating optimum long-term schedules for plant maintenance as well as production.

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the estimates, two further principles can be applied: Minimal overlap and <b>utility</b> <b>balance</b> (Huber and Zwerina, 1996). The former states that more information can be inferred with a DCE if the levels of attributes within a choice set are different (in our case between contracts A and B). The latter principle states that the efficiency can be improved by using some prior assumptions about the true parameters, and setting the choices within the choice set to have similar overall utility. It has also been argued that the techniques for improving the efficiency may not be very important as sample size can substitute for an inefficient experimental design (Lusk and Norwood, 2005).|$|E

This refers to the choice probabilities, which, if not balanced, would lead respondents to answer the same option systematically.

40|$|A {{chemical}} {{production site}} consists of multiple production and utility plants. Production plants consume raw materials to produce chemical products. Utility plants provide utilities (mainly steam and electricity) {{for the use}} in production. Material and utility balances among the plants are essential for guaranteeing a feasible operation. In order to enhance profitability, the chemical production site {{has to deal with}} various management tasks from time to time like adding new profitable plants, retrofitting outdated processes and scheduling the production plan. Material and utility balances may be interrupted by these management activities. Careful studies are therefore necessary before making management decisions on the production site. Traditionally, engineers perform the studies based on their own experience together with simple material and <b>utility</b> <b>balance</b> calculations to evaluate the feasibility of the management suggestions. However, this approach is incapable to investigate a vast of possible solutions. It results in overlooking the site-wide interconnections among the production and utility plants, thus missing out improving opportunities.

The model takes into account all plant's material and utility balances and their interconnections inside the site. It simultaneously includes other site-wide factors, such as, operating condition variations, production demands, inventory control strategy and electricity supply contract. Hence, the site-model is suitable for optimizing the site-wide profitability over a long management period.

In this paper, we develop a method to construct efficient designs for a two-stage, consider-then-choose model that involves a noncompensatory screening process at the first stage and a compensatory choice process at the second stage. The method applies to both conjunctive and disjunctive screening rules. Under certain conditions, the method also applies to the subset conjunctive and disjunctions of conjunctions screening rules. Based on the local design criterion, we conduct a comparative study of compensatory and conjunctive designs [...] the former are optimized for a compensatory model and the latter for a two-stage model that uses conjunctive screening in its first stage. We find that conjunctive designs have higher level overlap than compensatory designs. This occurs because level overlap helps pinpoint screening behavior. Higher overlap of conjunctive designs is also accompanied by lower orthogonality, less level balance, and more <b>utility</b> <b>balance.</b> We find that compensatory designs have a significant loss of design efficiency when the true model involves conjunctive screening at the consideration stage. These designs also have much less power than conjunctive designs in identifying a true consider-then-choose process with conjunctive screening. In contrast, when the true model is compensatory, the efficiency loss from using a conjunctive design is lower. Also, conjunctive designs have about the same power as compensatory designs in identifying a true compensatory choice process.

Essay 1 examines whether carefully tailored ideation incentives can improve creative output. The influence of incentives on idea generation is studied using a formal model of the ideation process. A practical, web-based, asynchronous "ideation game" is developed, allowing the implementation and test of various incentive schemes. Using this system, an experiment is run, which demonstrates that incentives do have the capability to improve idea generation, confirms the prediction from the theoretical analysis, and provides additional insight on the mechanisms of ideation. Essay 2 proposes and tests new adaptive question design and estimation algorithms for partial-profile conjoint analysis. The methods are based on the identification and characterization of the set of parameters consistent with a respondent's answers. This feasible set is a polyhedron defined by equality constraints, each paired-comparison question yielding a new constraint. Polyhedral question design attempts to reduce the feasible set of parameters as rapidly as possible. Analytic Center estimation relies on the center of the feasible set. The proposed methods are evaluated relative to established benchmarks using simulations, as well as a field test with 330 respondents. Essay 3 introduces polyhedral methods choice-based conjoint analysis, and generalizes the concept of D-efficiency to individual adaptation. The performance of the methods is evaluated(cont.) using simulations, and an empirical application to the design of executive education programs is described.

40|$|A {{chemical}} {{production site}} consists of multiple production and utility {{plants that are}} interconnected with utility and material flow network. To achieve a smooth operation, keeping <b>utility</b> <b>balance</b> (mainly electricity, fuel, steam and water) inside the production site is very important. Usually, {{in order to keep}} the balance, the production site requires importing different kinds of utilities, such as electricity, fuels and sometimes steam for sustaining the production. To protect both the supplier and the customer, long-term supply contracts for these utilities are often required, such that the customer can acquire the amount of utility they desire and the supplier can also plan the schedule easily. Under conventional contracts, both parties should respect the spirit of the contracts in term of prices and peak consumption rates for any day type. A penalty will be charged, if any side violates the contract. The idea of having an integrated mathematical model to assist in contract optimization is gradually being accepted by the industry. To elaborate applications of the contract optimization, a general mathematical model, Site Model, is adopted in this thesis. The model contains the main material and energy balances of production and utility plants and their interconnections inside the production site. When considering the impact of demand uncertainty on the contract optimization, the probabilistic programming model will be used for selecting an electricity importation contract. Confidence Level is introduced for selection and optimization of the contract. In this thesis, we explore the utility contract issue from the user's point of view to investigate the impact of utility contract on the chemical production site.

40|$|The steady {{improvement}} of US Nuclear Utility generation capability observed {{over the past}} two decades has recently halted and somewhat degraded. For the industry to resume its upward trend in performance a detailed examination must be performed of current performance and new methods developed to continue the improvement. A detailed study of Boiling Water Reactor, Class IV (BWR/ 4) performance over the past five years was conducted to gain insight to the nature of lost generation capability and develop a methodology to improve capability. Extensive electronic NRC records were used in conjunction with detailed power plant records and engineering experience at PECO Energy's Limerick Generating Station and Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station for this research. Administrative or regulatory shutdowns within the study dominated the lost generation capability and detracted from the goal of analyzing equipment reliability. Nine of two hundred thirty five shutdowns were therefore limited to maximum impact of 30 days lost generation. Balance of Plant system failures were found to initiate 69 % of the occurrences of lost generation capability and account for 59 % of the capability loss. The failures of these systems were found to be infrequent events which correlated poorly to the aggregate industry experience. Approximately fifty percent of the forced outages were the result of equipment related failures such as weak design or worn parts with the remaining fifty percent the result of human related failures. Only 19 % of the failures were noted to be the result of component age related failures while 31 % of the failures were related to poor equipment design. The time frame of forced outages with in operating cycles was additionally reviewed. Failures were found to be more frequent in the early phase of the operating cycle following start up from a refueling and approximately 400 to 550 days after start up. The impact of these failures was not great enough to affect the steady state cumulative capability factor of the aggregate BWR/ 4 utility achieved after one year of operation. Individual utility sites were found to have opposing strong and weak periods of performance within their operating cycles. The loss of generation capacity taken for planned maintenance outages and on line maintenance for minor equipment problems was not found to have a significant impact on aggregate BWR/ 4 performance. For plants not involve in lengthy shutdowns, the strongest impacts on cumulative capacity were forced outages, initial start up and coast down. The unpredictable and design nature of system failures necessitates a structured effort to improve the combined performance of all systems at a <b>utility.</b> <b>Balance</b> of Plant systems were found to all have a 25 % probability of causing a single forced outage lasting slightly less than 5 days in length.
