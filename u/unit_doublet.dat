40|$|Single-motor-unit {{activity}} was recorded from flexor carpi radialis of two human subjects. 2. A {{large number of}} <b>units</b> showed repetitive <b>doublets</b> {{at the onset of}} slow recruitment. A <b>unit</b> starting with <b>doublets</b> would transfer to a normal firing pattern as the force increased. 3. At different speeds of ramp contractions, the number of doublets discharging at the onset of contraction decreased as the speed of contraction increased. 4. Both low- and high-threshold <b>units</b> discharged repetitive <b>doublets.</b> Motor <b>units</b> which could discharge doublets showed higher maximal firing rates than those units which did not fire doublets. 5. Short interspike intervals were also observed at the onset of ballistic movements. From the comparison of these short interspike intervals and the short intradoublet intervals we suggest that the two arise from two distinct phenomena in the spinal cord. 6. Linked potentials were observed both with single spikes and doublets. Their origin may lie in the spinal cord or the muscle unit itself or both...|$|R

40|$|The {{adaptations of}} the ankle dorsiflexor muscles and the {{behaviour}} of single motor {{units in the}} tibialis anterior in response to 12 weeks of dynamic training were studied in five human subjects. In each training session ten series of ten fast dorsiflexions were performed 5 days a week, against a load of 30 – 40 % of the maximal muscle strength. Training led to an enhancement of maximal voluntary muscle contraction (MVC) and the speed of voluntary ballistic contraction. This last enhancement was mainly related to neural adaptations since {{the time course of}} the muscle twitch induced by electrical stimulation remained unaffected. The motor unit torque, recorded by the spike-triggered averaging method, increased without any change in its time to peak. The orderly motor unit recruitment (size principle) was preserved during slow ramp contraction after training but the units were activated earlier and had a greater maximal firing frequency during voluntary ballistic contractions. In addition, the high frequency firing rate observed {{at the onset of the}} contractions was maintained during the subsequent spikes after training. Dynamic training induced brief (2 – 5 ms) motor unit interspike intervals, or ‘doublets’. These doublets appeared to be different from the closely spaced (± 10 ms) discharges usually observed at the onset of the ballistic contractions. Motor units with different recruitment thresholds showed doublet discharges and the percentage of the sample of <b>units</b> firing <b>doublets</b> was increased by training from 5. 2 to 32. 7 %. The presence of these discharges was observed not only at the onset of the series of spikes but also later in the electromyographic (EMG) burst. It is likely that earlier motor <b>unit</b> activation, extra <b>doublets</b> and enhanced maximal firing rate contribute to the increase in the speed of voluntary muscle contraction after dynamic training...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{morphological}} diversity {{associated with}} the strip substructure of the euglenid pellicle was examined, and after identifying characters and states, we outlined hypotheses about their evolution. We have attempted to standardize terms necessary for analytical comparisons of strips by providing a glossary and comparing published synonyms. Most of the substructural diversity found in euglenids is demonstrated with 13 representative taxa. Strips are generally composed of two subcomponents: frames and projections. Frames support the basic shape of strips and many {{can be described as}} either S-shaped, plateau-shaped, M-shaped, or A-shaped. Projections branch laterally from the frames, are usually periodic, and can be described as thread-like structures, an indented plate, tooth-like structures, and plate-like structures. The ancestral state included strips that were few in number, flat, and fused. The strips became S-shaped and disjoined in the lineage leading to most euglenid taxa. These strips became secondarily flattened and fused in one lineage. In some lineages of phototrophs, the strips became increasingly robust. Two strips of different morphology formed the repeating pellicular <b>unit</b> or <b>doublet</b> in four taxa. These doublets evolved convergently at least three times and may provide insights into developmental patterns of the cytoskeleton...|$|R
5000|$|In 1855, the infantry's tight-fitting and {{impractical}} coatee {{with its}} vestigial tails {{was replaced by}} a loosely cut single-breasted tunic of French inspiration. Within a few years, a closer-fitting double-breasted tunic was adopted. This was eventually replaced by a single-breasted tunic, of the form still worn by the Brigade of Guards when on public duties (e.g. when mounting guard during the summer months at Buckingham Palace.) Highland <b>units</b> wore a <b>doublet</b> instead of a tunic. The carrying of equipment on crossbelts and shoulder straps, which constricted the chest and restricted movement, was replaced by pouches suspended from the waistbelt and various patterns of [...] "valise", intended to be practical in hot climates and to distribute the weight evenly. Experimentation with soldiers' equipment continued throughout the period.|$|R
5000|$|The crystal {{structure}} of mercurous sulfate {{is made up}} of Hg22+ dumbbells and SO42− anions as main building units. Hg22+ dumbbell is surrounded by four Oxygen atoms with Hg₋O distance ranging from 2.23 to 2.93 Å, whereas Hg-Hg distance is approximately 2.500Å.Studies have shown mercury(I) sulfate to have the mercury atoms arranged in doublets with a bond distance of 2.500Å. The metal atom doublets are oriented parallel to the an axis in a <b>unit</b> cell. Mercury <b>doublets</b> form part of infinite chain SO4 - Hg - Hg - SO4 - Hg - Hg - … The Hg - Hg - O bond angle is 165°±1 [...] The chain crosses the unit cell diagonally. The mercury sulfate structure is held together by weak Hg-O interactions. The SO4 does not act as a single anion, but rather coordinated to the mercury metal.|$|R
40|$|Bayesian {{integral}} {{functional measure}} of entropy-uncertainty (EF) on trajectories of Markov multi-dimensional diffusion process is cutting off by interactive impulses (controls). Each cutoff minimax of EF superimposes and entangles conjugated fractions in microprocess, enclosing the captured entropy fractions as source of an information unit. The impulse step-up action launches the unit formation and step-down action finishes it and brings {{energy from the}} interactive jump. This finite jump transfers the entangled entropy from uncertain Yes-logic to the certain-information No-logic information unit whose measuring at end of the cut kills final entropy-uncertainty and limits unit. The Yes-No logic holds Bit Participator creating elementary information observer without physical pre-law. Cooperating two <b>units</b> in <b>doublet</b> and an opposite directional information unit in triplet forms minimal stable structure. Information path functional (IPF) integrates multiple hidden information contributions along the cutting process correlations in information units of cooperating doublets-triplets, bound by free information, and enfolds the sequence of enclosing triplet structures in the information network (IN) that sequentially decreases the entropy and maximizes information. The IN bound triplets release free information rising information forces enable attracting new information unit and ordering it. While IPF collects the information units, the IN performs logical computing using doublet-triplet code. The IN different levels unite logic of quantum micro- and macro- information processes, composing quantum and/or classical computation.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{pairs of}} lexical units, which in lexicology {{are defined as}} doublets or absolute synonyms. The main idea of the article is to show functional features of <b>doublet</b> <b>units</b> which would allow not to consider such units as absolutely identical. Based on the analysis of Russian nouns, noted in special publications and dictionaries as absolute synonyms, we {{show that there is}} often differentiation of elements of lexical pairs. It appears that many absolute synonyms do not disintegrate in the process of their functioning, as linguists predict (due to semantic and formal redundancy of such verbal forms), but many absolute synonyms do exist for a long time without any apparent transformation because there are factors (reasons) in the language that promote their functioning. The analysis shows that a set of factors supporting the existence of doublet forms is specific for the units of terminological character on the one hand, and for generally used absolute synonyms on the other hand.   </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{makes use}} of a {{procedure}} designed to illustrate, without serial section analysis, the three-dimensional changes in the ciliary axoneme produced by microtubule sliding, and to confirm essential features of the sliding microtubule hypothesis of ciliary movement. Cilia, isolated from Tetrahymena pyriformis by the dibucaine procedure, are attached to a polylysine substratum, and treated with Triton X- 100. Critical point drying maintains three-dimensional structure without embedding. The detergent removes the membrane and many axonemes unroll, always in an organized fashion so that doublets follow one another in sequence, according to the enantiomorphic form of the cilium. The central pair of microtuo bules fall to the side as a <b>unit.</b> The parallel <b>doublet</b> microtubules retain relative longitudinal positions in part by interdoublet or nexin links. Spoke organization and tip patterns are preserved in the opened axonemes. We generalize the work of Warner and Satir (Warner, F. D., and P. Satir, 1976. J. Cell Biol. 63 : 35 - 63) to show that spoke group arrangements are maintained for all doublets in straigh...|$|R
40|$|The physical-chemical {{sense of}} {{nonlinear}} entropy-enthalpy compensation {{based upon the}} standard thermodynamical parameters of high-temperature melting for <b>doublet</b> <b>units</b> in DNA duplexes has been considered. We are {{able to show that}} there are three, with no other constraints equally plausible, principal levels of DNA melting/hybridization description. First, DNA structure assembly/disassembly {{can be seen from the}} viewpoint of the conventional equilibrium thermodynamics without taking special care of the heat capacity Delta C-p value (by simply setting it equal to zero). Second, it is possible to assume that the Delta C-p is finite, but independent of temperature. At this approximation level the high-temperature DNA melting cannot be described, but only some special transition between metastable states of DNA duplexes in water solutions in the vicinity of ice melting point. Third, both the latter transition and the high-temperature DNA melting can be reproduced by one and the same approach, if the Delta C-p is assumed to be temperature dependent. These three approximation levels are equally justified from the nonlinear entropy-enthalpy compensation standpoint and by a generalized theory of temperature effects on themodynamical stability as is outlined here. Applicability of each of the approximation levels involved is discussed...|$|R
