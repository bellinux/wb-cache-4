Although Indiana entered the Union in 1816 as a free state it gave only a tepid welcome to African Americans and frequently sought to exclude and/or marginalize African Americans from public and social life. African Americans faced discrimination on a variety of fronts. Blacks were denied the right to testify in court in 1818. In 1829 the Indiana Colonization Society was founded to help repatriate African Americans to Liberia which reflected a desire to rid the state of its black residents. [...] The 1830 census recorded three slaves in the state. The earliest days of the territory and of statehood witnessed intense debates over whether to allow slavery in Indiana. Laws in the 1830s sought to prevent free blacks from entering the state without certificates of freedom under threat of fines and expulsion. [...] While the 1830 law was only sporadically enforced it reflected hostility towards African Americans and their settlement in the state. Throughout the early nineteenth century, Black Hoosiers struggled to enjoy basic civil rights in the state, including the right to educate their children. In 1837 and 1841 the state shifted towards formally excluding African Americans from public education. In 1837 the state legislature moved to recognize [...] "The white inhabitants of each congressional district" [...] as the citizens qualified to vote in school board elections. Four years later, they followed with an effort to preclude black households from school board assessments. This helped to establish Hoosier schools as de facto white. Efforts in 1842 to formally exclude African American children from public education were rebuffed, however. The State Committee on Education responded to the matter acknowledging that they [...] "...Are here, unfortunately, for <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>them,</b> and we have duties to perform in reference to their well-being." [...] Indiana also passed laws against interracial marriage in 1818 and 1821. Under 1840 state laws to ban miscegenation Indiana became the first state to make interracial marriage a felony. [...] Article XIII of the Indiana Constitution of 1851 sought to exclude African Americans from settling in the state, declaring [...] "No negro or mulatto shall come into or settle in the State." [...] This was the only provision of the new constitution submitted to a special election. Indiana constitutional convention delegates voted 93 to 40 in favor of the article. The popular vote was even more enthusiastic in its support for exclusion with a vote of 113,828 in favor and only 21,873 against excluding African Americans. [...] Throughout {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, Indiana attempted to keep Black Hoosiers from attending public school, voting, testifying in court, and endeavored to set other limits on African American citizenship and inclusion. Racial hostility and discrimination co-existed alongside abolition sentiments and efforts, however. The Underground Railroad in Indiana sought to help runaway slaves escape to northern states and Canada. White Quakers, Baptists, and others worked to secure safe passage for runaway slaves. Abolition efforts conflicted with a growing antipathy towards free blacks in the state.|$|E

"The issue {{revolved}} around Queen refusing {{to go on}} at their allotted time because the light wasn't right - I remember it was sundown, so whoever went on stage wouldn't get the full benefit of their light show. It came down to a battle between management, which then spilled into a fracas between the roadies of our respective bands, as each crew jostled to set gear up. The MC (or some other promoter) goaded the crowd into an <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>them</b> vibe, with the local band in favour over the unknown [...] "pommie bastards". It ended with us going on stage first, and Queen redeeming themselves to the crowd and showing a hint {{of what they were}} to become.
