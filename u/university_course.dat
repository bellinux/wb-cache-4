25|$|Some of Hegel's {{writing was}} {{intended}} for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his Encyclopedia {{was intended as a}} textbook in a <b>university</b> <b>course.</b> Nevertheless, Hegel assumes that his readers are well-versed in Western philosophy. Especially crucial are Aristotle, Kant, and Kant's immediate successors, most prominently Fichte, and Schelling. Those without this background would be well-advised to begin with one of the many general introductions to his thought. As is always the case, difficulties are magnified for those reading him in translation. In fact, Hegel himself argues in his Science of Logic that the German language was particularly conducive to philosophical thought.|$|E

25|$|In 1703–1709, Swedenborg {{lived in}} Erik Benzelius the Younger's house. Swedenborg {{completed}} his <b>university</b> <b>course</b> at Uppsala in 1709, and in 1710, {{he made his}} grand tour through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was also a flourishing center of scientific ideas and discoveries. Swedenborg studied physics, mechanics and philosophy and read and wrote poetry. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic Olof Lagercrantz, Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed that Swedenborg might be destined {{to be a great}} scientist.|$|E
25|$|Following this Act, surveyors, civil engineers, architects, {{lawyers and}} others began working {{together}} within local {{government in the}} UK to draw up schemes {{for the development of}} land and the idea of town planning as a new and distinctive area of expertise began to be formed. In 1910, Thomas Adams was appointed as the first Town Planning Inspector at the Local Government Board, and began meeting with practitioners. The Town Planning Institute was established in 1914 with a mandate to advance the study of town-planning and civic design. The first <b>university</b> <b>course</b> in America was established at Harvard University in 1924.|$|E

It is hoped that graduates of women's studies programs will be able to present gender-neutral points of view.|$|E

25|$|Among the Saint Petersburg {{professors of}} {{mathematics}} were Chebyshev {{and his students}} Aleksandr Nikolaevich Korkin and Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. Lyapunov wrote his first independent scientific works {{under the guidance of}} the professor of mechanics, D. K. Bobylev. In 1880 Lyapunov received a gold medal for a work on hydrostatics. This was the basis for his first published scientific works On the equilibrium of a heavy body in a heavy fluid contained in a vessel of a fixed form and On the potential of hydrostatic pressure. Lyapunov completed his <b>university</b> <b>course</b> in 1880, two years after Andrey Markov who had also graduated at Saint Petersburg University.

25|$|In September 1967 Mendleson {{went up to}} the University of Essex to read English Literature and American History.

In 1969 she dropped out of her <b>university</b> <b>course</b> rather than continue into her final year, but remained living in Wivenhoe around the university for several months. In early 1970 she was living in York Way in the King's Cross area of London, and was a close friend of a group including some university friends who were living a semi-communal life in Stamford Hill; among them was Hilary Creek. Mendleson and Creek were supporting a group which had squatted empty flats in Arbour Square in Stepney. She became a friend of Jim Greenfield after meeting him on leaving a political meeting.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto {{began in}} 1853, when the Ontario College of Pharmacy (now Pharmacists) who first {{operated}} {{at the school}} had merged into the school curriculum. By 1868, the pharmacy program consisted {{of only a few}} evenings of voluntary classes, with no practically prerequisite classes. However, the long, tradition apprenticeship of this professional field had pressed a strong emphasis onto the students. Today, the program has evolved into “a compulsory, four-year second-entry scientific and professional <b>university</b> <b>course</b> with a supervised period of professional practice.” The organization of this program has become significantly more structured. This change in focus strayed away from the predominant emphasis of the practice of training through an apprenticeship to today’s emphasis of a theoretical study and application of those skills in real-life situations. Students are better equipped with the skills which are required to meet the present needs of the profession. The University of Toronto was the only school in Ontario to offer a pharmacy education until the opening of the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in 2008.|$|E
