2500|$|English law draws a {{distinction}} between a [...] "debt", which is relevant for the cash flow test of insolvency under section 123(1)(e), and a [...] "liability", which becomes relevant for the second [...] "balance sheet" [...] test of insolvency under section 123(2). A debt is a sum due, and its quantity is a monetary sum, easily ascertained by drawing up an account. By contrast a liability {{will need to be}} quantified, as for instance, with a claim for a breach of contract and <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages.</b> The balance sheet test asks whether [...] "the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities." [...] This, whether total assets are less than liabilities, may also be taken into account for the purpose of the same rules as the cash flow test (a winding up order, administration, and voidable transactions). But it is also the only test used for the purpose of the wrongful trading rules, and director disqualification. These rules potentially impose liability upon directors as a response to creditors being paid. This makes the balance sheet relevant, because if creditors are in fact all paid, the rationale for imposing liability on directors (assuming there is no fraud) drops away. Contingent and prospective liabilities refer to liability of a company that arise when an event takes place (e.g., defined as a contingency under a surety contract) or liabilities that may arise in future (e.g., probable claims by tort victims). The method for computing assets and liabilities depends on accountancy practice. These practices may legitimately vary. However, the law's general requirement is that accounting for assets and liabilities must represent a [...] "true and fair view" [...] of the company's finances. The final approach to insolvency is found under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 183(3), which gives employees a claim for unpaid wages from the National Insurance fund. Mainly for the purpose of certainty of an objectively observable event, for these claims to arise, a company must have entered winding up, a receiver or manager must be appointed, or a voluntary arrangement must have been approved. The main reason employees have access to the National Insurance fund is that they bear significant risk that their wages will not be paid, given their place in the statutory priority queue.|$|E
50|$|Damages {{that are}} {{sufficiently}} uncertain may {{be referred to}} as <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages,</b> and may be so categorized because they are not mathematically calculable or are subject to a contingency which makes the amount of damages uncertain.|$|E

The Queen, in which he had Sir John Holker, Sir Richard Baggallay, and Charles Synge Christopher Bowen against him, Williams vindicated the title of the subject to sue the crown for <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages</b> resulting from breach of contract.|$|E
50|$|Actio ex stipulatu - This is a {{claim for}} an {{uncertain}} thing and would give <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages</b> e.g. failure to do something. The procedure was that you would quote {{the words of the}} stipulatio and the iudex would determine the amount due. This meant that there was leeway in determining the amount of damages owed (so that the stipulation was theoretically a stricti iuris contract was not a problem) and was also easier as you did not have to say how much you wanted to claim, and risk asking for the wrong amount.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} civil {{penalties}} in English is {{in a state}} of flux. In contract, damages is a remedy to provide monetary compensation for loss; and damages may be unliquidated (general damages), or liquidated (pre-determined). In the absence of an out-of court settlement, <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages</b> must be ascertained by a court or tribunal, whereas liquidated damages will be determined by reference to the contract or to a mutually agreed arbitrator. The purpose of liquidated damages is to provide certainty and to avoid both the bother and cost of legal proceedings.|$|E
50|$|Interest that a {{creditor}} {{would have}} earned on an amount, {{had it been}} paid, is a loss that flows naturally from the breach and therefore constitutes damages that can be claimed. At common law, mora interest on a debt becomes payable from the date that a liquidated debt falls due. Where no date for payment is agreed, payment becomes due on demand from the creditor. In a claim for <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages,</b> the debtor cannot be in mora {{until such time as}} the amount of damages has been fixed by a court. Interest is therefore only payable from the date of judgment.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} several years a variety of victim groups have forced the {{criminal}} justice system {{to pay more attention to}} the restitution needs of victims! Criminal courts, however, are still limited in the types of restitution they may award. Typically, sentencing judges can award restitution for the whole range of liquidated damages including the value of stolen or destroyed property, medical expenses, and lost past wages. In most jurisdictions, however, criminal courts cannot award restitution for <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages</b> involving compensation for pain and suffering, or for lost future earning capacity. Crime victims must initiate a civil suit at their own expense to obtain a civil judgment for <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages,</b> and then must attempt on their own to force a criminal, who may be violent, to pay these civil damages. Our present system for awarding <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages</b> to crime victims does not work well. Unliquidated damage issues primarily affect victims of personal violence. Considerable evidence exists indicating that victims face some obstacles in winning a civil suit, but even greater ones in collecting civil awards for <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages.</b> Victims would be better off if these issues were handled by criminal courts. Criminal restitution frees crime victims from the responsibilities of bringing a civil action, but most importantly criminal courts can use probation officers and the threat of revocation to induce probationers and parolees to pay their restitution orders. There are two possible solutions. First, civil collection methods could be improved to help crime victims. Second, the scope of criminal restitution could be expanded to encompass the full range of damage issues, which is already the practice in many European criminal courts. This paper will focus on the second approach, but will discuss the first one...|$|E

The decision of British Anzani (Felixstowe) Ltd ν International Marine Management (UK Ltd), has provided an impetus to the doctrine of equitable set-off in its application to leases. This case confirms α considerable latitude to a tenant to set off liquidated and <b>unliquidated</b> <b>damages</b> against rental. The author will then discuss the rules of set-off against a landlord constituted by a mortgagee in possession. This discussion will reveal that the application of set-off in that circumstance is dependent upon the local statutory provisions which affect {{the nature of the}} mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s interest and the ability of a mortgagee to recover rent. Finally the article will discuss the contractual provisions which can be applied between the parties so as to disrupt or enhance the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s ability to seek set-off against rent against a mortgagee in possession...|$|E
