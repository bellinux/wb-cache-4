In such occupations, if effort at work is unobservable, a moral hazard problem also arises. We study a particular specification of learning by doing in which the conditional distribution of output depends on the sum of <b>undepreciated</b> efforts. With this specification, we can overcome the technical difficulties for solving for the optimal contract that arise because of the persistent effects of effort in time. Our numerical example shows that effort is frontloaded over the contractual relationship, and follows a steeper decreasing pattern than in the case without learning by doing. On the other hand, the properties of wage dynamics remain unchanged with respect {{to those of the}} optimal contract without learning by doing. Labor market...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{determinants}} of capital durability and utilization and their interdependence with investment decisions. The approach is based on the view that the flow of <b>undepreciated</b> capital is an output to be used in future production. At each date capital and non-capital inputs are combined to produce current output and the capital inputs to be used for future production. Thus capital accumulation occurs in a joint product context as two kinds of output are produced, one type for current sale and one type for future production. Another issue investigated in this paper concerns the allocation of resources within a firm between installing and utilizing capital and labor training activities. Often this problem is ignored in the theory of investment, not only because depreciation is exogenous, but also due to the treatment of labor as a variable factor of production. However, it is well recognized that firms cannot costlessly adjust labor. Thus the second {{purpose of this}} paper is to analyze the intertemporal relationship between the durability of capital and the growth rate of labor. ...|$|E

This disease is typical by its symptoms as nonproductive cough, dispnoea, respiratory failure, chest pain, and wheezing. It affects people of all age groups, the worldwide rates of the disease is on the rise. The occurrence of the asthma depends on genetic predisposition and on environmental factors. The development of the disease is influenced by one's lifestyle, stress, infections and by keeping up preventive precautions.

40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of making a}} transition from an income-type to a consumption-type tax is often cited {{as an obstacle to}} such a change in policy. The problem is the double taxation of 'old savings' or 'old capital. ' A person who has accumulated wealth under an income tax will be hit with an extra tax on the consumption financed by that accumulation with a shift to a consumption tax. Such a transition effect raises issues of equity, political feasibility and efficiency. In the typical implementation of a consumption tax, the same sorts of transition phenomena associated with a shift from an income tax come from any change in the rate of tax. Introduction of a consumption tax is the same as raising the rate of consumption tax from zero to whatever positive rate is envisioned for the new system. Consequently, the problem of transition to a consumption tax generalizes to the problem of changing the rate of consumption tax. In this paper I consider the design of rules that render consumption taxes in the family of business cash-flow taxes immune to the incentive and incidence effects of changes in rate of tax. I show that two relatively simple approaches are available to deal with it: grandfathering the tax rate applicable to a given period's investment or substituting depreciation allowances for the usual expending of investment, coupled with a credit for the equivalent of interest on the <b>undepreciated</b> investment stock. A cost of this approach is its requirement to identify tru depreciation and, in the second case, the real rate of interest. ...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the study are to present a comprehensive summary of the historical, legal, and political aspects of state corporate taxation and to conduct an empirical analysis of formulary apportionment. The empirical section of the study addresses the issue of apportionment formula fairness. Five research questions are investigated [...] {{using a variety of}} multiple regression and descriptive statistics techniques [...] by observing the reported values of income, receipts, property, and payroll for 252 large corporations, operating in widely diverse industries, for the period 1977 through 1981. The study reports the following results: (1) The standard UDITPA factors of property, payroll, and receipts, taken as a set, significantly reflect income-generating processes. The explanatory power of each individual factor is highly significant, but the multicollinearity among the factors results in considerable redundancy when the factors are viewed simultaneously. (2) These factors are very stable over time. (3) The relative importance of these factors is disparate. An optimal weighting of the factors, based on the multiple regression results, would assign approximately equal weight to the property and receipts factors and a negative weighting to the payroll factor. (4) The factors, although stable over time, are not stable across industries. The income functions of different industries vary considerably, both in terms of factor dependency and factor weighting. (5) Of the eleven practical alternative apportionment formulas tested, the most appropriate, in terms of the least degree of misapportionment, varied from industry to industry. (6) Three-factor apportionment formulas generally outperformed single-factor and two-factor formulas. (7) Apportionment formulas which double-weighted the receipts factor consistently resulted in a higher degree of misapportionment than those formulas which equally weighted this factor. (8) Formulas which measured the property factor as <b>undepreciated</b> historical cost consistently outperformed those formulas which measured this factor in terms of depreciated value. (9) Formulas which measured the payroll factor in number of employees consistently outperformed alternate formulas which measured this factor in dollars of compensation. ...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen years ago, like today, {{there were}} {{concerns}} that house prices might collapse. One {{big difference between}} then and now, however, {{is the basis for}} those concerns. Today, people are worried that a house price bubble (if one exists) might burst, while 15 years ago, people were worried about demographic effects, specifically, the inevitable aging of the baby boomers. Figure 1 Age distribution of U. S. households The earlier concern was sparked by a paper by Mankiw and Weil (1989), in which the authors famously predicted that between 1987 and 2007, real house prices could fall by 3 % per year. In fact, real house prices grew by an average of 3 1 / 2 % per year from 1987 to 2004. Of course, the Mankiw-Weil prediction may yet come to pass; or it may have already occurred and simply been masked by the surge in demand over the last seven years that is due to other factors. But the relationship between demographics and house prices remains interesting both because housing constitutes such a large component of the typical household’s wealth, and because much remains to be understood about the consequences of the baby boomers liquidating their housing and financial assets. In this Economic Letter,I revisit the economics of the housing market and demographics. A simple model of the housing market Prices and quantities in housing markets are determined by the interaction of the construction sector (the supply side) with households (the demand side). Key variables governing the supply of new housing include prices, the costs of construction materials and land, the cost of financing, and the amount of <b>undepreciated</b> housing stock. Similarly, key variables governing the quantity of housing include prices, the level of mortgage rates, expectations of permanent income or wealth, rates of return on other investments, and demographic factors that influence the decision to buy a house. One demographic factor that is particularly significant is the age distribution. A baby boom, or a temporary increase in the birth rate, shifts the age distribution (Figure 1). This is important because, as Figure 2 shows, homeownership rates vary considerably by age, increasing from an average of les...|$|E
40|$|Electricity {{market reforms}} have {{occurred}} in many countries, including both developed and developing countries. The main objectives for electricity market reform in developed countries focus on reducing the production costs and electricity prices while the developing countries aim to improve quality of services, mobilise finance and expand electrification (Woolf & Halpern, 2001). Different countries have adopted a variety of market structures for their electricity industries. In general, the choice of which market liberalisation structure to adopt, e. g. monopoly, single buyer, wholesale competition or retail competition, is in part influenced {{by the state of}} their economies and their development levels. However, {{there is no guarantee that}} market reforms will ultimately bring the projected benefits to consumers and economy. This is because there is no single market structure that is ideal in all situations (Joskow, 2006; Sioshansi, 2008). In the case of Malaysia, the electricity industry has been undergoing regulatory reforms since the mid 1990 ’s. The generation sector has been partially liberalised by allowing private entry into the market. However, almost all power is purchased by the government-owned company Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) under long term power purchase agreements (PPAs). In the late 1990 ’s, there was some discussion of the possibility of creating a power pool (similar to those seen in a number of developed countries) to increase competition, rather than endorsing these long term purchase contracts. If the Malaysian government wishes to adopt a more competitive market structure, an evaluation of the performance of electricity industry in terms of the technical efficiency and total factor productivity growth could be useful and valuable in drafting any future policy. Since the early 1990 s, many countries have undergone market reform in their electricity industry. It is not surprising that the impacts of market reforms and various environmental variables (i. e., ownership, plant age, etc.) have been investigated in a number of efficiency and productivity analysis studies. The majority of empirical studies have involved applications to United States data. Yunos & Hawdon (1997) is the only empirical study (as far as we are aware) that measured the technical efficiency of the Malaysian electricity industry. Unfortunately, their data is rather dated, and hence does not reflect the current situation in Malaysia. Also, there is no published research (that we know of) that specifically evaluates the technical efficiency (TE) and total factor productivity (TFP) growth of electricity utilities in Malaysia using a parametric model. Hence, in this study we assemble three new data sets and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the TE and TFP growth of electricity utilities in Malaysia. This thesis provides the first comprehensive study (to our knowledge) of the performance of the Malaysian electricity industry, which investigates the relative technical efficiency and TFP growth of electricity utilities. There are three separate empirical analyses conducted; and the findings have important policy implications and provide valuable empirical information that can be used to help guide deliberations regarding future reform policies. We now briefly summarise each of these studies in turn. The first empirical study examines the TFP growth of TNB (and the Malaysian electricity industry as a whole) over a 30 year period from 1975 to 2005 using the Törnqvist index method. The model involves four inputs (i. e., <b>undepreciated</b> replacement value of capital stock, full time employees, fuel consumption and other inputs) and three outputs (i. e., electricity generated, residential and non residential electricity delivered). The results indicate that TNB obtains an average annual TFP change of 0. 53 percent while the industry (TNB plus IPPs) achieves an average TFP change of 0. 13 percent per year. The introduction of private sector involvement in the Malaysian electricity industry in the 1990 ’s is observed to coincide with lower TFP growth rates. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted where two different capital stock measures (the perpetual inventory method and <b>undepreciated</b> real capital stock) are used, and are found to have a limited influence upon on the empirical results obtained. Our results could suggest that the partial privatisation of TNB and introduction of private entry were insufficient to produce improved TFP performance. Based on experiences in other countries, we hypothesise that the introduction of a competitive market and/or a regulatory framework that encourages more efficient behaviour may also be required. Our empirical findings will hopefully provide useful input into any future discussions of new policy directions in the electricity industry in Malaysia. The second empirical study focuses on the efficiency and productivity differences between TNB-owned and privately-owned power plants in Malaysia. The stochastic frontier and technical inefficiency effects model (Battese & Coelli, 1995) was applied to measure TE levels and TFP growth rates in the Malaysian electricity generation sector. The data involved 86 observations for 14 Malaysian thermal power plants that were collected from 1998 to 2005. The four input variables used in the model were <b>undepreciated</b> replacement value of capital stock, labour, fuel, and other inputs, with electricity sent-out as the output measure. The empirical results show that there still a room for the TNB-owned power plants and IPPs to improve their performance (i. e., average TE score is 79 percent). The result suggests that the average plant would have to increase their technical efficiency level by 21 percent in order to reach the efficient production frontier. Furthermore, the results also show that power plants under public ownership are not performing as well as the privately-owned power plants in Malaysia. Two possible explanations for this stand out. Firstly, if the capacity of TNB owned power plants is not as fully utilised as the IPPs in Malaysia (because of the generous nature of the Power Purchase Agreements), an increase in capacity utilisation may be sufficient to improve TNB’s plant efficiency. Alternatively, the IPPs may be more efficient because the quality of management is higher. If this is the case, privatising TNB’s power plants (in association with a more competitive market) may be considered. In addition to investigating the effects of ownership on technical efficiency levels, our SFA analysis also finds that plant size and fuel type have a significant influence upon the technical efficiency of power plants in Malaysia. This information may be useful in future planning relating to the promotion of improved plant efficiency in the industry. The SFA model is also used to measure productivity growth for the electricity generation industry over the 1998 to 2005 sample period. We find that it achieved average annual TFP growth of 2. 34 percent, with technical change contributing the most to the TFP growth over the eight year period. We hence hypothesise that the new power plants with their newer capital-embodied technologies commencing during the sample period are likely to be the main reason for this strong technical change. The third empirical study is used to identify the performance difference between Malaysian and international electricity generating companies. The data involved 190 annual observations across 65 electricity generating companies in six different Asia Pacific countries (the United States, Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia) that were collected from 2003 to 2005. The stochastic frontier and technical inefficiency effects model is employed in the study, involving two input variables (i. e., nameplate generating capacity and implicit quantity of operating inputs), one output variable (i. e., electricity sent-out) and three explanatory variables (i. e., private ownership, plant age and year of observation). Our analysis finds that Malaysian electricity generating companies are relatively efficient in comparison to the selected international electricity generating companies, with an average TE score of 0. 87 relative to an average TE score across all utilities of 0. 79. Once again, the empirical results may be explained in a number of ways. First, one could argue that the superior performance of the Malaysian plants is perhaps a consequence of the use of second best data (i. e., aggregate input variables and approximate price deflators). Alternatively, the empirical results may be reliable and hence some commentators may argue that further market reform is not necessary. However, this conclusion should not be drawn until better quality data can be organised and additional analyses conducted. Finally, this thesis has made a number of key contributions. We have reviewed lessons learned from international electricity market reforms, and discussed their relevance to the case of Malaysia. We have compiled three detailed data sets and conducted three comprehensive empirical analyses of performance, from which we have (tentatively) concluded that private entry in the 1990 ’s did not result in improved TFP growth rates; that privately-owned generation plants are more efficient than publicly-owned plants; and that Malaysian power plants have above average performance relative to international comparators. However, a key theme in all three analyses is the fact that we have been forced to use a number of second-best measures in our data set, and hence that further research is needed in order for our important empirical results to be verified and then incorporated into the ongoing policy discussions in Malaysia regarding possible future reforms of the industry...|$|E
