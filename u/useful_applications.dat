25|$|For {{this article}} the bivector will be {{considered}} only in real geometric algebras. This in practice is {{not much of a}} restriction, as all <b>useful</b> <b>applications</b> are drawn from such algebras.

25|$|Considered a very {{versatile}} {{host for}} the production of heterologous proteins, researchers can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids, allowing for the mass production of proteins in industrial fermentation processes. Genetic systems have also been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins using E. coli. One of the first <b>useful</b> <b>applications</b> of recombinant DNA technology was the manipulation of E. coli to produce human insulin. Modified E. coli have been used in vaccine development, bioremediation, and production of immobilised enzymes.|$|E

25|$|Expectancy {{theory has}} been shown to have <b>useful</b> <b>applications</b> in {{designing}} a reward system. If policies are consistently, clearly and fairly implemented, then the instrumentality would be high. If the rewards are substantial enough to be meaningful to an employee, then the valence would be also considered high. A precursor to motivation is that the employee finds the reward(s) attractive. In some instances, the reward or outcome might inadvertently be unattractive, such as increased workload or demanding travel that may come with a promotion. In such an instance, the valence might be lower for individuals who feel work–life balance is important, for example.|$|E

[...] Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as WPA/WPA2 or the older (and less secure) WEP. Wired communications (such as ITU‑T G.hn) are secured using AES for encryption and X.1035 for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as GnuPG or PGP {{can be used to}} encrypt data files and Email.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} encompasses both {{diagnostic imaging}} {{and treatment of}} disease, and may also {{be referred to as}} molecular medicine or molecular imaging & therapeutics. [...] Nuclear medicine uses certain properties of isotopes and the energetic particles emitted from radioactive material to diagnose or treat various pathology. Different from the typical concept of anatomic radiology, nuclear medicine enables assessment of physiology. This function-based approach to medical evaluation has <b>useful</b> <b>applications</b> in most subspecialties, notably oncology, neurology, and cardiology. Gamma cameras and PET scanners are used in e.g. scintigraphy, SPECT and PET to detect regions of biologic activity that may be associated with disease. Relatively short lived isotope, such as 99mTc is administered to the patient. Isotopes are often preferentially absorbed by biologically active tissue in the body, and can be used to identify tumors or fracture points in bone. Images are acquired after collimated photons are detected by a crystal that gives off a light signal, which is in turn amplified and converted into count data.|$|E

Therefore, we suggest Japanese local traditional handicraft and traditional arts be utilized and recognized through digitalization and Internet communication all over the world.
