5|$|Previously a {{grade-level}} intersection, the <b>underpass</b> {{was constructed}} simultaneously with the subway station costing $250,000. The {{construction of the}} <b>underpass</b> with a subway station underneath was a massive undertaking. Three levels were required {{in order for the}} <b>underpass</b> and the subway station to be built. The upper level that was built was Queens Boulevard, which carries traffic east and west. The second level is an <b>underpass</b> that carries four lanes of Union Turnpike (and now also the Jackie Robinson Parkway) under the Boulevard. The tunnel is in between the two mezzanines and it would rest atop the roof of the subway station platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{junction}} with Tottenham Court Road suffered significant bomb damage during the Second World War. Patrick Abercrombie's contemporary Greater London Plan called for a new ring road around Central London called the 'A' Ring, but post-war budget constraints meant that a medley of existing routes were improved to form the ring road, including Euston Road. An <b>underpass</b> to avoid the junction with Tottenham Court Road was proposed in 1961, with construction taking place in 1964. The property developer Joe Levy was keen to develop buildings {{in the area and}} bought various properties. When the London County Council (LCC) refused planning permission because of the <b>underpass</b> development, Levy, who had outline planning permission, insisted the council pay him £1 million if they wanted to compulsorily purchase the site. Over the next four years, Levy bought properties along the north side of Euston Road, and an agreement was reached so that the council built the <b>underpass</b> and he built a complex of two tower blocks with office shops and apartments, the Euston Tower.|$|E
5|$|A {{second phase}} {{to convert the}} {{remaining}} section of freeway of Tower Bridge Gateway to a city street began in 2010. The 3rd Street <b>underpass</b> and subsequent interchange was removed and signalized intersections at 5th and 3rd streets were created. The project was completed in November 2011.|$|E
40|$|Low {{clearance}} <b>underpasses</b> {{can reduce}} traffic congestion at intersections where other alternatives have been exhausted. Low clearance (2. 4 m or 8 ft) <b>underpasses</b> are more compact and economical to build than standard (4. 9 m or 16 ft) <b>underpasses.</b> Four low clearance <b>underpasses</b> along a congested arterial in Honolulu were modeled with Integration. Travel time and fuel savings benefits accrued during two peak hours on workdays {{are expected to}} outweigh implementation costs in two to five years. Low clearance <b>underpasses</b> were estimated to be about 40 % shorter in length and cost approximately $ 3 million less to construct compared with standard <b>underpasses...</b>|$|R
50|$|A tota nine <b>underpasses</b> {{and three}} flyovers are planned on the 20km stretch to Dasna. But {{following}} a revision in the detailed project report, {{the plan was}} amended to 15 <b>underpasses</b> and a just one flyover, at Lal Kuan. The <b>underpasses</b> will be built {{in such a way}} that there is no criss-crossing traffic on the expressway and traffic flow at intersections will be altered accordingly.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after these}} 2 rail crossings, Ring Road <b>underpasses</b> 5 lane wide Winnipeg Street which connects with a diamond {{interchange}} and curves to the west. Next, the highway <b>underpasses</b> Broad Street (with no interchange) {{followed by a}} pedestrian walkway. Ring Road then <b>underpasses</b> 6 lane wide Provincial Highway 6 (an extension of Albert Street) with a partial cloverleaf interchange (the loop on the south-east corner is occupied by restaurants).|$|R
5|$|Nordberg Station {{was located}} in the steep road named Borgestadveien, that passed the station in a level crossing. The station served the local senior center named Nordberghjemmet, and was the most used of all {{stations}} among residents living in Nordberg. After the 1992 closure, very little remains from the station, aside from a pedestrians' <b>underpass.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Council {{wanted the}} {{developers}} to consider constructing a road tunnel from Mounts Bay Road to the underground parking to reduce traffic congestion around the tower, however the developers only agreed to consider building a pedestrian <b>underpass</b> beneath St Georges Terrace.|$|E
50|$|KMP Expressway {{has been}} {{divided into three}} {{packages}} of 45 km each. Three major camps at Kundli, Manesar and Palwal have been established, supported by three ancillary camps at Jassoure Kheri, Badli and Taoru. Four flyovers have been proposed at places where the expressway will cross national highways, namely, NH 1, NH 10 and NH 8. Sixteen overpasses and <b>underpasses</b> at crossings on state highways and major district roads; 7 overpasses, 9 <b>underpasses</b> and 27 <b>underpasses</b> at crossings on village roads; and 33 agricultural vehicular <b>underpasses,</b> 31 cattle crossing passages, 61 pedestrian crossing passages, four railway over-bridges, 18 major and minor bridges, cross drainage works (culverts) at 292 locations, and two truck parking and four bus bays will also be constructed.|$|R

5|$|The Maclennan Hill was a {{dangerous}} and steep bottleneck for traffic leaving the inner city. The first recommendations involved creating an <b>underpass</b> beneath the CPR tracks. A vote was held on January 1, 1946, with {{an overwhelming majority of}} voters approving the project.|$|E
5|$|The little {{railroad}} went broke a {{few years}} later. At about this time, the Arkansas, Oklahoma & Western Railroad (AO) was forming. The railroad ran from Rogers to Siloam Springs, over a distance of approximately 30miles (43km). It was opened for traffic on New Year's Day 1908, connecting with the Frisco at Rogers and the Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf (P) at Siloam Springs. The AO planned to build eastward to Eureka Springs. On December 1, 1909, the AO purchased the Monte Ne railroad. To connect the AO and the Monte Ne, a track {{would have to be}} laid from Hazelwood, Arkansas on the AO to Lowell; the Frisco line was in the way, and they would not allow a connection. The AO instead built an expensive <b>underpass</b> of the Frisco. The construction of the <b>underpass</b> enabled the Monte Ne line to turn over much of its outbound freight business to the AO rather than competitor Frisco. So the line enjoyed a brief but substantial volume of outgoing freight traffic from the Rogers White Lime Company located at Limedale. The <b>underpass</b> still exists and is still crossed by trains of Frisco Central Division successor Arkansas and Missouri Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The new <b>underpass</b> was {{designed}} by architects Deborah Saunt and Sam Potter of DSDHA in collaboration with Brian Lewis and artist Martin Richman. Funding for the project was provided jointly by Wakefield Council, the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, Network Rail, and the Arts Council England, Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|The {{replacement}} of the <b>underpass</b> was one of twelve elements in the Castleford Regeneration Project, originally proposed in 2001. It was featured in a four-part television series, Kevin McCloud and the Big Town Plan, broadcast by Channel 4 in August–September 2008.|$|E
5|$|US 40 Alternate {{is a part}} of the National Highway System as a {{principal}} arterial from Edgewood Drive in Funkstown to its <b>underpass</b> of I-70 south of Funkstown and from Old Hagerstown Road near Middletown to US 40 in Frederick.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the film}} {{takes place in}} Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, {{principal}} photography took place in Luleå (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from {{around the same time}} as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture. However, Alfredson shot a few scenes in the Blackeberg area. In particular, the scene where Eli leaps down on Virginia from a tree, was shot in the town square of Blackeberg. Another scene, where Eli attacks Jocke in an <b>underpass,</b> was shot in the nearby suburb of Råcksta. The original Blackeberg <b>underpass</b> that Lindqvist had envisioned was deemed too high to fit in the picture. Some of the outdoor close-up scenes were made in a super cold studio. The jungle gym where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film. Its design was intended to suit the CinemaScope format better than a regular jungle gym, which would typically have to be cropped height-wise.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to information campaigns, various physical measures (e.g. overpasses and <b>underpasses,</b> fencing, prohibitive signs) {{should be considered}} as effective and acceptable preventive measures although engine drivers somewhat hesitated to recommend <b>underpasses.</b> It is also possible to reinforce information campaigns by combining them with physical measures to have a greater influence on trespassers’ behaviour.|$|R
5|$|In April 2011, {{after many}} years of {{proposals}} and delays, construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An <b>underpass</b> was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, and would have been very costly, and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail {{made it impossible}} to cross the line at-grade; an <b>underpass</b> was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg was {{a station}} on the Sognsvann Line of the Oslo Metro in Oslo, Norway. It was opened on 10 October 1934, and was located between Østhorn and Holstein stations, in a level {{crossing}} with the steep road Borgestadveien. The station saw several accidents, and was closed on 5 May 1992 when the Sognsvann Line was upgraded to rapid transit standard. An <b>underpass</b> was constructed to allow pedestrians pass under the tracks.|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, an {{increasing}} number of highway construction and reconstruction projects have included mitigation measures aimed at reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions and maintaining habitat connectivity for wildlife. The most effective and robust measures include wildlife fences combined with wildlife <b>underpasses</b> and overpasses. The 39 wildlife crossing structures included along a 90 km stretch of US Highway 93 on the Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana represent one of the most extensive of such projects. We measured movements of large mammal species at 15 elliptical arch-style wildlife <b>underpasses</b> and adjacent habitat between April and November 2015. We investigated if the movements of large mammals through the <b>underpasses</b> were similar to large mammal movements in the adjacent habitat. Across all structures, large mammals (all species combined) were more likely to move through the structures than pass at a random location in the surrounding habitat. At the species level, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) used the <b>underpasses</b> significantly more than could be expected based on their movement through the surrounding habitat. However, carnivorous species such as, black bear (Ursus americanus) and coyote (Canis latrans) moved through the <b>underpasses</b> in similar numbers compared to the surrounding habitat...|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} of the freeway over Vail Pass is also listed as an engineering marvel. One of the challenges of this portion is {{the management of the}} wildlife that roams this area. Several parts of the approach to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses. At least one <b>underpass</b> is located along a natural migratory path and has been landscaped to encourage deer to cross.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} crosses Taylor-Massey Creek and the East Don River, {{and climbs}} out of the valley, swinging northwards toward Eglinton Avenue. In this section, the DVP passes around the apartment buildings of Flemingdon Park. The lanes split again before the <b>underpass</b> at Spanbridge Road, the road that connects a three-tower complex of apartments to the east of the parkway with Flemingdon Park to the west. The lanes pass beneath the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange.|$|E
