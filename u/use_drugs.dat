40|$|The {{differential}} effect of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on cognitive function in first-episode psychosis and healthy controls. Objective:? Illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> {{can result in}} impairment in cognitive function in healthy individuals. Individuals with a psychotic disorder also show a deficit in cognitive function. <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> may simply contribute to the characteristic cognitive deficit found in psychosis or alternatively result in a 'double deficit'. This study aims to investigate the association between <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and cognitive function at the first-episode of psychosis and in community-matched controls. Method::? One hundred and seventy-seven patients at the first episode of psychosis completed a battery of neuropsychological tests. Those that had <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> {{in the previous year}} (n?=? 80) were compared with those who had not <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> in the previous year (n?=? 97). A subsample of the first-episode psychosis patients were compared with community-matched controls (n?=? 110) according to drug-use status. Results::? Patients with a first episode of psychosis who had <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> performed equally to those who had not <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> on neuropsychological tests. In contrast, healthy controls who had <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> in the previous year performed worse on tests of executive function and working memory compared with those controls that had not <b>used</b> <b>drugs.</b> Conclusion:? There are differential associations of illicit drug misuse with cognitive function for first-episode psychosis patients and healthy controls...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) {{classification}} system classifies active ingredients of drugs {{according to the}} organ or system on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties. Objective: To establish the five most frequently <b>used</b> <b>drug</b> groups and subgroups according to ATC {{classification system}} in patients on polypharmacy in relation to age and gender, and to establish the five most frequent combinations of <b>drugs</b> <b>used</b> by patients on polypharmacy. Method: In the period from 2008 until 2013, one EMS doctor surveyed his patients in the field regarding <b>drugs</b> they were <b>using.</b> In 688 patients on polypharmacy, we have analyzed the prevalence of drugs according to the ACT classification system. Results: Most frequently <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> belonged to C, N, A, R and M group of ATC classification. Of statistical significance is that Female patients were more often <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> for treatment of musculoskeletal diseases, anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs and anxiolytics, whereas male patients were <b>using</b> predominantly <b>drugs</b> from R category and antiarrhythmics. Difference is statistically significant. Also statistically significant is that patients younger than 65 have more often <b>used</b> lipid-lowering <b>drugs,</b> antiepileptic, anxiolytics, antidepressants and drugs for treatment of respiratory diseases, whereas patient older than 65 have more often <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> for treatment of cardiovascular diseases and vasodilatating drugs. Combination of drugs that act on cardiovascular, nervous and digestive system was {{the most frequently used}} combination. Conclusion: The most often <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> belonged to C, N, A, R and MATC group, and the most frequent combination of drugs was the combination of <b>drugs</b> <b>used</b> for treatment of cardiovascular system, nervous and digestive system. Women are <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> for treatment of musculoskeletal system, including antinflammatory and antirheumatic drugs, as well as anxyolytics more often than men, and men are <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> for treatment of respiratory system and antiarrhitmics more often than women...|$|R

25|$|The {{unregulated}} {{use of such}} drugs poses severe {{risks to}} competitors' health, including addiction, overdose, serotonin syndrome and, {{in the case of}} stimulants, weight loss. Even over-the-counter energy drinks which are marketed specifically toward gamers have faced media and regulatory scrutiny due to deaths and hospitalizations. Accordingly, Adderall and other such stimulants are banned and their use penalized by many professional sporting bodies and leagues, including Major League Baseball and the National Football League. Although International e-Sports Federation (IeSF) is a signatory of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the governing body has not outlawed any PEDs in its sanctioned competitions. Action has been taken on the individual league level, however, as at least one major league, the Electronic Sports League, has made use of any drugs during matches punishable by expulsion from competition.

Later, at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, Dexter falls asleep and dreams about the death of his mother, Laura Moser (Katherine Kirkpatrick).

When he tells his sponsor Lila about his dream, she tells him that he must confront them to seek closure. He and Lila travel to Naples, Florida where one of the three men, Santos Jimenez, is alive and running a tavern. Having been warned by his girlfriend Rita Bennett's mother Gail (JoBeth Williams) to leave Rita (Julie Benz) and her children alone, Dexter tells Rita that he is going away while Gail is visiting.

In response, Dexter disarms and brutally beats him, revealing his past to Jimenez as one of the boys he left in his mother's blood.
