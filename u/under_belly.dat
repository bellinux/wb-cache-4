2500|$|Commander Chris Ferguson {{and pilot}} Douglas Hurley {{performed}} {{a series of}} rendezvous burns (NH, NC4, NCC, MC1-4 and TI) to boost the orbit of Atlantis to match {{with that of the}} ISS. At 11:40 UTC, with about 9 miles (14km) separating the shuttle and the ISS, Ferguson performed the final 12-second terminal initiation (TI) burn, firing the left OMS engine of Atlantis at 12:29 UTC. It placed the shuttle [...] below the Space Station at 13:51 UTC. By 13:26 UTC, with Ferguson flying Atlantis from the aft flight deck, the shuttle positioned [...] beneath the ISS and began the 360-degree flip rendezvous pitch maneuver (RPM). As the shuttle's underside rotated into view, three of the Expedition 28 ISS crew members – Sergei Volkov, Mike Fossum and Satoshi Furukawa using cameras with 1000mm, 800mm and 400mm lenses, respectively, photographed Atlantis's <b>under</b> <b>belly</b> for 90 seconds, as part of post-launch inspections of the thermal protection system. The photos were being sent to mission control in Houston to be evaluated by experts on the ground to look for any damage.|$|E

50|$|Almost without exception, blue-backed {{fish are}} salt water fish that travel in schools {{close to the}} surface of the water, have wide migratory {{patterns}} and are relatively low on the food chain so feed on plankton, etc. Their appearance, as is indicated by their name, is a dark blue dorsal with a nearly white <b>under</b> <b>belly.</b> Further, blue-fish are generally fairly small in size and caught in large quantities resulting in low market price, so are thought of as mass-market fish for general consumption and are distinguished from larger, specialty fish caught in smaller quantities, even if they share other qualities.|$|E

It placed the shuttle 1,000 ft below the Space Station at 13:51 UTC. By 13:26 UTC, with Ferguson flying Atlantis from the aft flight deck, the shuttle positioned 600 ft beneath the ISS and began the 360-degree flip rendezvous pitch maneuver (RPM).

5000|$|Members of the Dasycercus genus have a {{body mass}} of over 100 g, a length of 15 cm and tail length of 9 cm. Males are {{typically}} much larger than females. [...] The tail is “of moderate length, shorter than the head and body, incrassated (thickened); the proximal two-fifths covered with short still yellow hairs, the remainder with gradually lengthening black hairs that do not however form a crest. The whole of the lower surface is black, {{with the exception of}} a small proximal portion which is yellow.” [...] The upper portion of fur appears sandy and speckled with brown, while the basal portion appears as a dark grey. The entirety of the <b>under</b> <b>belly,</b> inner side of the limbs, and lining of the pouch are pure white. Dentition shows two premolar teeth in both the upper and lower jaws, with the first observed as smaller than the second in the upper jaw. One feature that distinguishes D. blythi from other species of Dasycercus as observed in specimens is a gap between the second premolar and first molar.|$|E
5000|$|Ferrer's success {{began in}} the late 1960s with {{installations}} engaging conceptual and process art. These first involved actions, such as his [...] "3 Leaf Pieces" [...] at the Castelli Warehouse and then developed into installations that became progressively more narrative in tone, which included complicated artifacts assembled and fabricated by the artist which inferred voyages. Many of these artifacts became part of recurring themes or series, including this paper bag faces, kayaks and maps, themes that he returns to up to the present. These installations were done at prominent museums including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and the Museums Of Contemporary Art in both Philadelphia and Chicago. In the 1980s he became known for his expressionistic paintings of his native Caribbean, works that dealt with the tropic's <b>under</b> <b>belly,</b> breaking the stereotype of the tourist cliche. These works deal with the marvelous, the rough, the frightful and the beautiful as seen through the eyes of one born of these regions. Painting enabled Ferrer {{to go back to the}} privacy of working alone in his studio.|$|E
60|$|To our surprise, the {{farewell}} shouts {{from the}} canoe, as we dashed along <b>under</b> <b>bellied</b> royals, were heard unmoved by our islander; {{but it was}} not long thus. That very evening, when the dark blue of his native hills sunk in the horizon, the poor savage leaned over the bulwarks, dropped his head upon his chest, and gave way to irrepressible emotions. The ship was plunging hard, and Wymontoo, sad to tell, in addition to his other pangs, was terribly sea-sick.|$|R
