5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of <b>uranium</b> <b>isotopes</b> with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|The {{calutron}} {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, {{an instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between <b>uranium</b> <b>isotopes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along {{with all}} {{elements}} having atomic weights {{higher than that}} of iron, it is only naturally formed in supernovae. Primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r-process (rapid neutron capture), because the s-process (slow neutron capture) is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth. Besides the two extant primordial <b>uranium</b> <b>isotopes,</b> 235U and 238U, the r-process also produced significant quantities of 236U, which has a shorter half-life and has long since decayed completely to 232Th, which was itself enriched by the decay of 244Pu, accounting for the observed higher-than-expected abundance of thorium and lower-than-expected abundance of uranium. While the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct 242Pu (half-life 0.375millionyears) and 247Cm (half-life 16millionyears), producing 238U and 235U respectively, this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half-lives of these parents and their lower production than 236U and 244Pu, the parents of thorium: the 247Cm:235U ratio at the formation of the Solar System was (7.0 ± 1.6) × 10−5.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1943 Eicher {{joined the}} Manhattan Project at Columbia University in New York, working first with Willard Libby (1908–1980), Nobel Laureate in 1960; then with Harold C.

Groves (1896–1970), major general, commanding the Manhattan Engineer District. There Eicher worked on the synthesis of fluorocarbons used as lubricants, as plastics such as Teflon. He then worked on pilot plant tests for the enrichment of uranium-235. Finally, Eicher spent two years along with colleague Albert L. Myerson (1919–2004) constructing and operating a gas viscosimeter used to study uranium hexafluoride at various temperatures and pressures, the data from which {{were used in the}} production of <b>uranium</b> <b>isotopes</b> at the large gaseous diffusion plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E

50|$|The <b>uranium</b> <b>isotope</b> 235U {{is used as}} {{the fuel}} for nuclear {{reactors}} and nuclear weapons. It is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is fissile, that is, fissionable by thermal neutrons. The isotope 238U is also important because it absorbs neutrons to produce a radioactive isotope that subsequently decays to the isotope 239Pu (plutonium), which also is fissile. Uranium in its natural state comprises just 0.71% 235U and 99.3% 238U, and {{the main focus of}} uranium metallurgy is the enrichment of <b>uranium</b> through <b>isotope</b> separation.|$|R

500|$|In September 1941, Oliphant {{met with}} Lawrence and Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where they {{showed him the}} site for the new [...] cyclotron. Oliphant in turn took the Americans to task for not {{following}} up the recommendations of the British MAUD Committee, which advocated a program to develop an atomic bomb. Lawrence had already thought about the problem of separating the fissile isotope uranium-235 from uranium-238, a process known today as uranium enrichment. Separating <b>uranium</b> <b>isotopes</b> was difficult because the two isotopes have very nearly identical chemical properties, and could only be separated gradually using their small mass differences.

500|$|A {{few weeks}} after Ulam reached Los Alamos in February 1944, the project {{experienced}} a crisis.

[...] This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the Hanford site and to make slow separation of <b>uranium</b> <b>isotopes</b> {{the only way to}} prepare fissile material suitable for use in bombs. [...] To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an implosion-type weapon and appointed George Kistiakowsky head of the implosion department.

500|$|Fermi and Szilard still {{believed}} that enormous quantities of uranium {{would be required}} for an atomic bomb, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi urged Alfred O.C. Nier to separate <b>uranium</b> <b>isotopes</b> for determination of the fissile component, and on 29 February 1940, Nier separated the first U-235 isotope sample, which, after mailed to Columbia's cyclotron, Dunning confirmed to be the isolated fissile material. An initial design planned to use the U-235, but sufficient quantities still proved limited at the time. When he was working in Rome, Fermi had discovered that collisions between neutrons and neutron moderators can slow the neutrons down, and thereby make them {{more likely to be}} captured by uranium nuclei, causing the uranium to fission. Szilard suggested to Fermi that they use carbon in the form of graphite as a moderator. As a back-up plan, he considered heavy water. This contained deuterium, which would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, and was a better neutron moderator than carbon; but heavy water was expensive and difficult to produce, and several tons of it might be needed. Fermi estimated that a fissioning uranium nucleus produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. (Today the average number of neutrons emitted per fissioning uranium-235 nucleus is known to be about 2.4.) ...|$|E
