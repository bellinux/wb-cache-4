Swaziland's health financing system performance in terms of ensuring financial health protection is not clearly understood. This paper assesses financial catastrophe and impoverishment from out - of - pocket payments and associated factors that predict them in Swaziland. The Swaziland Household Income and Expenditure Survey (SHIES) for 2009 / 2010 {{was used for the}} analyses. Financial catastrophe was assessed using a variable threshold. Impoverishment was assessed using both a national and $ 1. 25 /day international poverty line. Logistic regression models were used to assess factors that predict household vulnerability to financial catastrophe and impoverishment. It emerged that about 9. 6 per cent of the Swazi households experienced financial catastrophe while about 1. 1 per cent were pushed below the poverty line as a result of out - of - pocket payments. Factors associated with households' vulnerability include; education of the household - head, household size, location, age and household socio - economic status. The findings indicate that financial health protection is not adequate in Swaziland.

Once the diagnosis of DS is made (by the paediatrician, neonatologist or family physician), it ushers in a series of investigations for associated medical problems. This is because in this syndrome almost every system or organ in the body needs special attention. Appropriate interventions, if carried out on time, can reduce complications and {{improve the quality of life}} of these children. It is therefore important that all doctors caring for children with Down syndrome are updated with the latest recommendations and are mindful that they should avoid inflicting <b>undue</b> <b>hardships</b> on the family.

Rescission is distinct from termination of a contract, whereby a breach of a term cancels future performance, and only extinguishes the contract prospectively. For rescission the claimant may have a restitutionary remedy to recover any enrichment that a defendant has received under the contract (and in return give up any enrichment the claimant has received). The claimant may also have a tort claim for any losses that had arisen. In principle the rescission remedy is available for fraud and negligent misrepresentation as of right. For innocent misrepresentation, however, Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(2) gives the court discretion to award damages instead of rescission if <b>undue</b> <b>hardship</b> to the defendant would result.

In the Pan-American series the Post Office realized the plan for two-toned stamps that it had been obliged to abandon during the production of the Trans-Mississippi issue.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} actual and {{anticipated}} {{costs of a}} law regulating workplace smoking and smoking in restaurants, taking into consideration observed and anticipated infrastructure costs, lost productivity, increased absenteeism, and loss of clientele.  SETTING AND DESIGN—A survey of 401  Québec restaurants and 600  Québec firms conducted by the Québec Ministry of Health before {{the enactment of the}} law was used to derive costs incurred by those who had already complied and anticipated by those that did not.  RESULTS—Direct and indirect costs associated with tobacco regulation at work and in restaurants were minimal. Annualised infrastructure costs amounted to less than 0. 0002 % of firm revenues and 0. 15 % of restaurant revenues. Anticipated costs were larger and amounted to 0. 0004 % of firm revenues and 0. 41 % of restaurant revenues. Impacts on productivity, absenteeism, and restaurant patronage were widely anticipated but not observed in currently compliant establishments.  CONCLUSION—Firms and restaurants expected high costs to result from strict tobacco regulation because of infrastructure costs, decreased productivity, and decreased patronage. That none of these were actually observed suggests that policy makers should discount industry claims that smoking regulations impose <b>undue</b> economic <b>hardship.</b>    Keywords: regulation; firms; restaurants; costs; surve...|$|R

Those in favour of UHC see health as a public good not simply an individual benefit, and they recognise that, as a consequence of this view, the implementation of UHC requires a level of regulation and a kind of investment that is inconsistent with an unconstrained free market.
