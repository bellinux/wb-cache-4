5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs <b>untreated</b> <b>control</b> group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E

We studied the antifungal efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ravuconazole lysine phosphoester in escalating dosages {{for the treatment of}} invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus fumigatus in persistently neutropenic rabbits. Treatment groups consisted of rabbits treated with ravuconazole at 2. 5 (RVC 2. 5), 5 (RVC 5), and 10 (RVC 10) mg/kg of body weight/day, rabbits treated with amphotericin B (AMB) at 1 mg/kg/day, or <b>untreated</b> <b>controls.</b> There was a dose-dependent reduction of pulmonary residual fungal burden (CFU per gram) in RVC 5 -, RVC 10 -, and AMB-treated rabbits in comparison to <b>untreated</b> <b>controls</b> (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 001, and P < 0. 01, respectively). These findings correlated with progressive galactomannan antigenemia in <b>untreated</b> <b>controls</b> and the RVC 2. 5 -treated rabbits, a lower galactomannan index (GMI) in RVC 5 - and RVC 10 -treated rabbits, and a similarly low GMI in AMB-treated rabbits (P < 0. 01). Rabbits treated with RVC 5, RVC 10, and AMB also showed a reduction of organism-mediated pulmonary injury, as measured by infarct scores and lung weights, in comparison to <b>untreated</b> <b>controls</b> (P < 0. 001). These results were supported by decreased pulmonary infiltrates detected by computed tomography in RVC 5 - and RVC 10 -treated rabbits in comparison to <b>untreated</b> <b>controls</b> (P < 0. 05). Survival throughout the entire study was achieved in 95 % of RVC 5 -treated rabbits (P < 0. 001), 85 % of RVC 10 -treated rabbits (P < 0. 001), and 50 % of AMB-treated rabbits (P < 0. 05) in comparison to none of the <b>untreated</b> <b>controls.</b> Ravuconazole showed linear plasma pharmacokinetics and a large volume of distribution while maintaining concentrations in plasma above the MIC throughout the dosing interval. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity among ravuconazole-treated animals.

The mean tonic immobility duration in lizards with striato-amygdaloid transition area lesions was significantly shorter (80. 5 %; p < 0. 0033) in trial 2 than in trial 1. There were no inter-trial differences within dorsal cortex-lesioned lizards or <b>untreated</b> <b>controls.</b> There was a significant treatment effect on tonic immobility duration in trial 2 (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the underlying mechanisms}} by which sevoflurane protects the liver against ischemia/reperfusion injury {{evaluate the}} mechanism by which sevoflurane exerts this protective effect. METHODS: Twenty-six rats were subjected to partial ischemia/reperfusion injury for 1 h: one group received no treatment, one group received sevoflurane, and sham group of animals received laparotomy only. Four hours after reperfusion, levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukins 6 and 10 were measured. Analyses of mitochondrial oxidation and phosphorylation, malondialdehyde content, histology, and pulmonary vascular permeability were performed. RESULTS: Serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were significantly lower in the sevoflurane group compared to <b>untreated</b> <b>controls</b> (p< 0. 05). The sevoflurane group also showed preservation of liver mitochondrial function compared to <b>untreated</b> <b>controls</b> (p< 0. 05). Sevoflurane administration did not alter increases in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukins 6 and 10. Sevoflurane treatment significantly reduced the coagulative necrosis induced by ischemia/reperfusion (p< 0. 05). Pulmonary vascular permeability was preserved in the sevoflurane group compared to <b>untreated</b> <b>controls.</b> CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane administration protects the liver against ischemia/reperfusion injury, via preservation of mitochondrial function, and also preserves lung vascular permeability...|$|R
