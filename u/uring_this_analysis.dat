The group was announced on 10 November 2014 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, with Geldof stating that he took the step after the United Nations had contacted him, saying help was urgently needed to prevent the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa spreading throughout the world.

40|$|North American {{universities}} {{are encouraged to}} increase opportunities for undergraduate research experiences (<b>UREs).</b> To <b>this</b> end, many universities offer directed studies courses (DSCs) which are 1 - 2 semester long courses involving one-on-one instruction, {{with a focus on}} student-led independent research. Building on the understanding of dynamics generally related to <b>UREs,</b> <b>this</b> paper seeks to compare the motivations, benefits, and barriers specifically related to DSCs from student, instructor, and administrator perspectives. Based on a set of qualitative focus group discussions at a small undergraduate liberal arts institution, we present the similarities and differences in these perspectives and recommend a set of best practices for DSCs. All three groups reported motivations for engaging in a DSC that addressed working with a particular student or instructor, assistance with graduate school preparation, and meeting program requirements. In terms of perceived benefits of DSCs, both students and instructors indicated the mentoring relationship and practical outcomes arising from DSCs. Students recognized the benefits of developing research skills, but stressed the motivation and benefit of independent learning more than was found in other studies. Instructors focused on benefits of research engagement and relationship building. The major challenges to participating in DSCs were workload and time (all groups), unprepared students and lack of guidelines (instructors and administrators), and the oral presentation requirement and lack of information about DSCs (students). Based on these results, we suggest increased clarity in DSC expectations, consistent standards of quality, and promoting research processes common to the DSC’s home discipline...|$|R

40|$|The Transylvanian Basin {{with its}} up to 10 -kin-thick Upper Cretaceous to Pliocene fill {{is one of}} the most {{important}} sedimentary basins of southeastern Europe. Upper Cretaceous coarse-grained clastics lie unconformably on basement strongly tectonized uring Early Cretaceous and older stages. Upper Cretaceous ediments were mainly deposited along roughly N-S-trending rabens and were subsequently folded before the end of the Paleocene. Eocene to Middle Oligocene rocks record mostly quiet sedimentation. N-S tension and extension took place in the Oligocene and was followed by widespread NW-SE compression and contraction. Important hrusts are associated with this phase in the northwestern and southeastern parts of the basin. Widespread N-S contraction followed during the Early Miocene in association with S-vergent thrusting in the northem part of the basin. A southward thinning clastic wedge developed <b>uring</b> <b>this</b> stage. The Badenian basal unconformity marked a major change in the sedimentary and tectonic pattern of the Transylvanian Basin with new depocenters developing in the central parts of the present-day basin. Late Miocene E-W extension affected vast areas and caused some important normal faulting in the southeast. The youngest deformation recorded is associated with E-W contraction and is of Pliocene or younger age...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Diatoms {{are useful}} for biostratigraphic {{correlation}} of Neogene sediment sections in the North Atlantic Ocean. The warm-temperate ssemblage observed in cores from the middle and high latitude Atlantic enables partial application of the diatom zonations defined in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Sixteen of the equatorial Pacific diatom zones are recognized incores from the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic. The diatom assemblage implies that surface waters were warm during the early Miocene in the Rockall Plateau region. A decrease {{in the quality of}} diatom preservation, and the occurrence of numerous hiatuses at approximately the early-middle Miocene boundary, suggest a major change in oceanic circulation. An increase in deep water overflow from the Norwegian Sea may have been a contributing factor. Although middle Miocene sediments at both middle and high latitudes are generally enriched with silica, a possible restriction of siliceous edimentation towards the high latitudes is observed <b>uring</b> <b>this</b> time. The interval representing the early late Miocene and earliest Pliocene is generally devoid of diatoms. Conditions favouring siliceous edimentation continued at high latitudes and returned to middle latitudes of the North Atlantic during the late Pliocene, maybe in response to increase...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Dismembered and {{fragmented}} ophiolite assemblages constitute {{important elements}} of the metamorphic allochthon ofthe Scandinavian Caledonides. Ophiolites recognized to date {{range in age from}} probable Vendian to Middle Ordovician d occur at two principal tectonostratigraphic levels. Field criteria, with support from geochemical data, permit a classification of many of the ophiolite complexes into two fundamental groups. Group I is characterized by a generally well-developed pseudostratigraphy, MORB as well as IAT and WPB petrochemistry, plagiogranites at higher levels, and a conformable cap of oceanic sediments with local ocean r immature arc volcanism. The group is representative of either a major ocean or evolved marginal-basin regime. Evidence points to their obduction, and initial internal deformation, i the Finnmarkian orogenic event in pre-Middle Arenig time. Group II complexes are younger, of late Arenig to Llanvirn and possibly Llandeilo age, and show a poorer-defined pseudostratigraphy. They are laterally and vertically intercalated with either siliciclastic sediments from a contemporary magmatic arc or arcs, and are considered as having been generated in a restricted marginal-basin setting. Their prime tectonic deformation, and translation within nappes, i essentially ofSilurian age.

The trh gene is located in a region close to the gene cluster for urease production (<b>ure).</b> <b>This</b> region was characterized in V. parahaemolyticus strain TH 3996 and it was found that a nickel transport operon (nik) was located between the first gene (ureR) and the rest of the ure cluster genes. The organization of the trh-ureR-nik-ure gene cluster in the Norwegian trh+ isolates was unknown. In this study, we explore the gene organization within the trh-ureR-nik-ure cluster for these isolates. PCR analyses revealed that the genes within the trh-ureR-nik-ure gene cluster of Norwegian trh+ isolates were organized in a similar fashion as reported previously for TH 33996. Additionally, the phylogenetic relationship among these trh+ isolates was investigated using Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST). Analysis by MLST or ureR-trh sequences generated two different phylogenetic trees for the same strains analyzed, suggesting that ureR-trh genes have been acquired at different times in Norwegian V. parahaemolyticus isolates.
