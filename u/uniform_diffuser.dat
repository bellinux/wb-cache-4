In theory, an incident-lightmeasurement should agree with a reflected-light measurement of a test cardof suitable reflectance that is perpendicular to the direction to themeter. However, a test card seldom is a <b>uniform</b> <b>diffuser,</b> so incident- andreflected-light measurements might differ slightly.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} claimed that {{volumetric}} displays {{are incapable of}} reconstructing scenes with viewer-position-dependent effects, such as occlusion and opacity. This is a misconception; a display whose voxels have non-isotropic radiation profiles are indeed able to depict position-dependent effects. To-date, occlusion-capable volumetric displays require two conditions: (1) the imagery is rendered and projected {{as a series of}} [...] "views," [...] rather than [...] "slices," [...] and (2) the time-varying image surface is not a <b>uniform</b> <b>diffuser.</b> For example, researchers have demonstrated spinning-screen volumetric displays with reflective and/or vertically diffuse screens whose imagery exhibits occlusion and opacity. One system created HPO 3D imagery with a 360-degree field of view by oblique projection onto a vertical diffuser; another projects 24 views onto a rotating controlled-diffusion surface; and another provides 12-view images utilizing a vertically oriented louver.|$|E

For this reason, a zone plate-like pattern is imaged onto a rotating ground glass. Generally the ground glass exhibits a strong directivity. It {{is far from}} an ideal <b>uniform</b> <b>diffuser</b> that is implicitly assumed in the theory. To solve this problem, we propose a new illumination system. In our system, the beam illuminating the zone plate-like pattern {{is focused on the}} test surface. We measured the longitudinal coherence functions in our optical system. The result shows that the longitude coherent function is better controlled in our interferometer. 1...|$|E

The reflectance {{property of the}} surface material is the <b>uniform</b> perfect <b>diffuser,</b> and the light source produces a uniform parallel beam and the illuminating direction is varied slightly only in the azimuth direction. The local surfacc orientation can be determined from the image density and its directional derivatives. It is shown that the zenith angle of the illuminating direction is also determined analytically. The errors caused by calculating the directional derivatives using the numerical differences from three input image densities are evaluated, {{and the effectiveness of}} the shape reconstruction algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations. 1...|$|R

Several parameters have been studied, among which, the diffusion pattern, the relative surface on the façades, the absorption, the arrangement {{and the size of}} diffusers. Results show that a significant noise reduction can be observed both on the sound attenuation and on the sound decay in a street, by considering <b>uniform</b> and absorbing <b>diffusers</b> locating on {{the lower part of the}} façades.

Specifically, this paper focuses both on investigating {{the influence of}} the inner cylinder's design and operating parameters and on the water flow characteristic, thermal stratification and overall performance of the hot heat storage water tank during heat charging operation process installed in thermal energy systems. Validation of CFD results with experimental data found in the literature has a good consistency. In order to visually compare the efficiency of the energy storage tank with thermal stratification, and the dimensionless fluid temperature, one of existing methods for calculating stratification efficiencies is applied to hypothetical storage process of charging in this paper. Cylinder insides the tank plays a role of <b>uniform</b> <b>diffuser,</b> so that the water in the tank is formed thermal stratification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the CFD study of air flow inside a bus passenger compartment. The {{objective is to}} estimate the temperature level at the diffuser, seat and floor locations of the bus passenger compartment. Two conditions of airsupply velocity were examined, namely 2. 7 m/s and 3. 1 m/s. CFD Fluent software was used to develop a simplified three-dimensional model of a quarter section of a bus passenger compartment. Air temperature and velocity boundary conditions were prescribed on the model based on the actual data obtained from field measurement. Turbulent flow analysis was carried out using standard k-ε model to predict the air movement inside the compartment. The {{results show that the}} velocity distribution is <b>uniform</b> when the <b>diffuser</b> air velocity is 3. 1 m/s. When the diffuser air velocity is 3. 1 m/s the air temperature ofthe seat area was decreased by 0. 3 °C. The air temperature was improved when the air velocity was fixed at 3. 1 m/s...|$|R

Insufficient fresh air causes feeling of uncomfortable to passenger and affects passenger’s health. Airborne transmission disease, headache and respiratory allergies are the usual health symptoms. This paper presents the CFD study of air flow inside a bus passenger compartment. The objective is to estimate the temperature level at the diffuser, seat and floor locations of the bus passenger compartment. Two conditions of airflow velocity at the supply diffuser were examined, namely 2. 7 m/s and 3. 1 m/s. A CFD Fluent software was employed to develop and meshed a simplified 3 D model of a quarter section of a bus passenger compartment. Air velocity and temperature boundary conditions were prescribed on the model based on the actual data obtained from field measurement. Turbulent flow analyses were carried out using standard k-e model to visualize the air flow distribution inside the compartment. The {{results show that the}} velocity distribution is <b>uniform</b> when the <b>diffuser</b> air velocity is 3. 1 m/s. When the diffuser air velocity is 3. 1 m/s the air temperature of the seat area was decreased by 0. 3 °C.

40|$|A turning {{diffuser}} {{is a kind}} of adapter used in {{the fluid}} flow system to recover surplus energy by converting kinetic energy to pressure energy. Nevertheless, minimal energy is commonly recovered as the flow within turning diffuser is often disrupted {{due to the nature of}} its geometry, leading to excessive losses. This paper aims to investigate the performance of 2 -D turning diffuser by varying inflow Reynolds number (Rein). The outlet pressure recovery (Cp) and flow uniformity (σu) of 2 -D turning diffuser with an area ratio of AR= 2. 16, operated at inflow Reynolds number of Rein= 5. 786 E+ 04 - 1. 775 E+ 05 have been experimentally tested. The experimental rig was developed incorporated with several features of low subsonic wind tunnel. This was mainly to produce a perfect fully developed and <b>uniform</b> flow entering <b>diffuser.</b> Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to examine the flow quality, and a digital manometer provided the average static pressure at the inlet and outlet of turning diffuser. The best produced pressure recovery of Cp= 0. 239 was recorded when the system was operated at maximum Rein= 1. 775 E+ 05. However, the flow uniformity was considerably distorted, σu= 6. 12 with the increase of Rein Keywords- turning diffuser; flow uniformity; pressure recovery; particle image velocimetry (PIV) mainly due to secondary flow separation. A compromise between the maximum permissible pressure recovery and flow uniformity needs to be sought. The results obtained from this study will be in future used to validate the CFD codes.

40|$|Various {{diffuser}} types {{characterized by}} the geometry are introduced in the flow line to recover the energy. A 3 -D turning diffuser {{is a type of}} diffuser that its cross-section diffuses in all 3 directions of axes, i. e. x, y and z. In terms of applicability, a 3 -D turning diffuser offers compactness and more outlet-inlet configurations over a 2 -D turning diffuser. However, the flow within a 3 -D turning diffuser is expected to be more complex which susceptible to excessive losses. As yet there is no established guideline that can be referred to choose a 3 -D turning diffuser with an optimum performance. This paper aims to investigate the effects of varying inflow Reynolds number (Rein) on the performance of 3 -D turning diffuser with 90 o angle of turn. The outlet pressure recovery (Cp) and flow uniformity (u) of 3 -D turning diffuser with an area ratio (AR= 2. 16) and outlet-inlet configurations (W 2 /W 1 = 1. 44, X 2 /X 1 = 1. 5), operated at inflow Reynolds number of Rein= 5. 786 E+ 04 - 1. 775 E+ 05 have been experimentally tested.

This was mainly to produce a perfect fully developed and <b>uniform</b> flow entering <b>diffuser.</b> Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to examine the flow quality, and a digital manometer provided the average static pressure of the inlet and outlet of turning diffuser. There is a promising improvement in terms of flow uniformity when a 3 -D turning diffuser is used instead of a 2 -D turning diffuser with the same AR. An unexpected trend found with a drop of pressure recovery at maximum operating condition of Rein= 1. 775 E+ 05 shall require further investigations. The results obtained from this study will be in future used to validate the numerical codes. Upon successful validation, several other configurations will be numerically tested in order to establish the guidelines in the form of mathematical models...|$|R
