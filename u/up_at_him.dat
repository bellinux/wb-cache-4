25|$|In Paris {{there is}} a full length marble statue by Pierre Julien, now in the Louvre, that was {{commissioned}} in 1781 and exhibited at the 1785 Salon. The writer is represented in an ample cloak, sitting in contemplation on a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes is climbing. On his knee is the manuscript of the fable of the fox and the grapes, while at his feet a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Small scale porcelain models were made of this by the Sèvres pottery and in polychrome porcelain by the Frankenthal pottery. In the following century small models were made of the bronze statue by Etienne Marin Melingue, exhibited in Paris in 1840 and in London in 1881. In this the poet is leaning thoughtfully against a rock, hat in hand. Also in the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre is the 1857 standing stone statue by Jean-Louis Jaley.|$|E
25|$|In 207 BCE, Xiang Yu's army {{advanced}} towards Julu {{and he sent}} Ying Bu and Zhongli Mo to {{lead the}} 20,000 strong vanguard army to cross the river and attack the Qin forces led by Zhang Han, while he followed behind with the remaining majority of the troops. After crossing the river, Xiang Yu ordered his men to sink their boats and destroy all but three days worth of rations, in order to force his men to choose between prevailing against overwhelming odds within three days or die trapped before {{the walls of the}} city with no supplies or any hope of escape. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Chu forces scored a great victory after nine engagements, defeating the 300,000 strong Qin army. After the battle, other rebel forces, including those not from Chu, came to join Xiang Yu out of admiration for his martial valour. When Xiang Yu received them at the gate, the rebel chiefs were so fearful of him that they sank to their knees and did not even dare to look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|Wisden {{describes}} {{how in the}} first innings, Agnew's accuracy was affected by debutant nerves, but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2–51. Agnew {{describes how}} Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets, catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips, and passing on some {{advice on how to}} dismiss Viv Richards, Botham's great friend: [...] "Botham said: 'Right. Don't pitch a single ball <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15." [...] Wisden called the pair of batsmen Agnew's [...] "first illustrious victims in Test cricket".|$|E

2500|$|Soon after {{a meeting}} of 2007 with Democratic State Senator Mike Jacobs, meant to {{convince}} Jacobs to vote for Blagojevich's health insurance proposals, Jacobs emerged telling reporters that the Governor [...] "blew <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> like a 10-year-old child", Blagojevich {{would not comment on}} the alleged incident. Jacobs said during 2008: [...] "This is a governor who I don't think has a single ally, except for Senate president Emil Jones — and that's tenuous at best." [...] Jones and Blagojevich sometimes collaborated, while at other times they disagreed on funding for education.|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Philip Norman {{notes that}} Linda had some {{personality}} aspects which Paul admired. She seemed {{less concerned with}} clothing or her public appearance, preferring to dress casually, even in semi-formal settings. She typically held his arm when they were together, often [...] "gazing <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in awe," [...] and seeming to idolize him. However, Paul's friends claimed that his own appearance also became noticeably less formal, whether shaving less often or just wearing simpler clothes. [...] "He could go on the bus down to Apple," [...] said his maid, [...] "and no one would recognize him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{advice from}} his old coach Alf Gover, {{who was in}} Australia as a journalist, Tyson stopped using his {{laborious}} 38-yard run up and returned to a shorter run up used in league cricket with ten short then ten long final strides. With this he took 4/45 in the first innings, described vividly by Margaret Hughes [...] "Harvey received a beast of a ball from Tyson which spat <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and splashed off his bat to Cowdrey". Ray Lindwall had bowled Tyson for a duck in the England first innings and was bounced again, so in the second innings the Australian fast bowler took his revenge: ...|$|E

2500|$|Australia {{replied with}} 228, the top nine batsmen getting into double figures, {{but no one}} reached 50, Ron Archer equalling his best Test score of 49 and Jim Burke making 44. Bailey opened the bowling {{as well as the}} batting and took 4/59, but the talking point was Frank Tyson. With his [...] "short" [...] run up of 18–20 yards Tyson took 4/45, {{described}} vividly by Margaret Hughes [...] "Harvey received a beast of a ball from Tyson which spat <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and splashed off his bat to Cowdrey". Ray Lindwall had bowled Tyson for a duck in the England first innings and was bounced again by the England fast bowler.|$|E
2500|$|The alleged rivalry aside, Callas made remarks {{appreciative of}} Tebaldi, and vice versa. During an {{interview}} with Norman Ross in Chicago, Callas said, [...] "I admire Tebaldi's tone; it's beautiful—also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice." [...] Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of La Gioconda {{in order to help}} her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry, he recommended Zinka Milanov's version. A few days later, he went to visit Tebaldi, only to find her sitting by the speakers, listening intently to Callas's recording. She then looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and asked, [...] "Why didn't you tell me Maria's was the best?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Editors Bryant and Springer suggest {{perception}} {{is a central}} theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: [...] "All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks" [...] — and Ahab is determined to [...] "strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall" [...] (Ch. 36, [...] "The Quarter-Deck"). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in [...] "The Doubloon" [...] (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab [...] "discover no sign" [...] (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In the British edition, Melville changed the word [...] "discover" [...] to [...] "perceive", and with good reason, for [...] "discovery" [...] means finding what is already there, but [...] "perceiving", or better still, perception, is [...] "a matter of shaping what exists by {{the way in which}} we see it". The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{perpetrators}} returned, both [...] "walking with a swagger" [...] {{to where}} McIlwaine waited downhill from the parked car with Burcombe. McIlwaine {{at that moment}} made an attempt to run away but Brown, Dillon, and Burcombe {{caught up with him}} as he fell to the ground. Brown gave him a severe kicking, mostly in the head. Dillon produced a butcher's knife and cut McIlwaine's throat while Brown shouted encouragement and Burcombe overlooked the scene from about five feet away. Brown and Dillon left McIlwaine still breathing on the ground; once they were back inside the car, Brown proposed to drive the car over his head, but Dillon dissuaded him. Brown halted the vehicle, took the knife and walked back over to where McIlwaine was lying on the road making a [...] "wheezing" [...] sound. Brown stabbed McIlwaine repeatedly in the face and chest. When he noticed that McIlwaine appeared to be looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> Brown stabbed him deeply in his left eye; the wound penetrated his brain, killing him. According to Burcombe's later testimony, Brown appeared [...] "crazed" [...] as he handed the knife back to Dillon and said he was [...] "buzzing"; he subsequently went on to recount stabbing McIlwaine in the eye. He threatened to cut Burcombe's throat or kill a member of his family if he told anyone what happened.|$|E
