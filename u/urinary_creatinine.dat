Background Twenty-four-hour creatinine excretion is an established marker of muscle mass in heart failure and other populations. Spot urine creatinine might be an easy obtainable, cheap marker of muscle wasting and prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients. Methods Spot urine creatinine concentration was measured in 2130 patients included in the GISSI-HF trial. We evaluated the prognostic value of <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> and its relation with clinical variables. Results Median spot <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> was 0. 80 (IQR 0. 50 - 1. 10) g/L. Lower spot <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> was associated with older age, smaller height and weight, higher NYHA class, worse renal function and more frequent spironolactone and diuretic use (all P <. 02). During a median follow-up of 2. 8 years, 655 patients (31 %) experienced the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization.

40|$|Thesis (M. Med.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2008. Background: The most {{commonly}} employed screening method for proteinuria is a semi- quantitative dipstick urinalysis, {{but it has}} been shown to be inaccurate in pregnancy. New developments in the assessment of proteinuria have included the use of urinary albumin measurements. The Clinitek Microalbumin Reagent Strip (Bayer Healthcare LLC, USA) is a semi-quantitative dipstick test. It is used to measure the spot <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio that is read using the Clinitek 50 portable urine chemistry analyzer. Aims We embarked on a pilot study to validate the Clinitek 50 system by determining the accuracy of spot <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks and conventional visual dipsticks (Makromed) compared to the laboratory <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio quantification to detect significant proteinuria in normotensive and hypertensive antenatal attendees. The accuracy of spot <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks and conventional visual dipsticks were then compared to a 24 hour urinary protein (gold standard) to detect significant proteinuria in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We then determined the role of proteinuria as assessed by the diagnostic accuracy of both the 24 hour urinary protein (gold standard) and the spot <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipstick, in pregnancy outcomes of these participants. Methods This was a prospective study conducted at hospitals serving the Durban Metropolitan region in South Africa. To validate the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipstick, fifteen normotensive healthy pregnant women and 11 women with new onset hypertension in pregnancy were recruited. Each women had a spot midstream urine, which was assessed for proteinuria using a semi-quantitative visual dipstick (Makromed) and analysed using the semi-quantitative <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks (Clinitek® Microalbumin) read on the Clinitek® 50 urine chemistry analyser. A result of 1 + on visual dipsticks and a spot <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio UAC of > 300 mg/g (33. 9 mg/mmol) was considered as positive for significant proteinuria. The results were compared to the laboratory quantitative measurement of the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio. The study group comprised 163 women presenting with newly diagnosed hypertension during pregnancy after 20 weeks of gestation, being recruited from antenatal clinics. Each participant had a spot urine sample that was tested by trained midwives for proteinuria using a semi-quantitative visual dipstick (Makromed). Participants were admitted to the ward where a spot midstream urine sample was collected and analysed using the semi-quantitative <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks. A 24 hour quantitative urinary protein analysis was completed. The results of the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks and conventional visual dipsticks were compared to the 24 hour urinary protein (gold standard) to detect significant proteinuria. A <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio of < 300 mg/g (nil and trace on visual urine dipsticks) was considered to be a negative result. A <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio 300 mg/g (1 + to 4 + on visual urine dipsticks) was considered to be a positive result. Urinary protein 0. 3 g/ 24 hours was considered significant proteinuria. The outcomes of pregnancy in 2 sub-categories viz. those with and without significant proteinuria were compared using the 24 hr urinary protein measurement. A secondary analysis of outcomes of pregnancy was performed by subcategorizing the participants according to the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks. In the 26 patients enrolled in the initial study, the visual dipstick had a sensitivity of 25 % (95 % CI [0. 04 - 0. 64]) and specificity of 89 % (95 % CI [0. 64 - 0. 98]). The <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks had a sensitivity of 88 % (95 % CI [0. 47 - 0. 99]), specificity of 89 % (95 % CI [0. 64 - 0. 98]), negative predictive value (NPV) of 94 % (95 % CI [0. 69 - 1. 00]) and positive predictive value (PPV) of 78 % (95 % CI [0. 40 - 0. 96]). In the 163 patients subsequently enrolled the visual dipstick had a sensitivity of 51 % (95 % CI [0. 41 - 0. 61]) and specificity of 91 % (95 % CI [0. 81 - 0. 96]). The PPV and NPV was 89 %(95 % CI [0. 77 - 0. 95]) and 58 % (95 % CI [0. 48 - 0. 67]) respectively. The <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks had a sensitivity of 63 % (95 % CI [0. 52 - 0. 72]) and specificity of 81 % (95 % CI [0. 70 - 0. 89]). The PPV was 82 % (95 % CI [0. 71 - 0. 90]) and NPV was 62 % (95 % CI [0. 51 - 0. 71]). Our results show that in hypertensive pregnant women, significant proteinuria determined by the quantitative 24 hour urinary protein is associated with delivery at an earlier gestational age, increased induction of labour and lower birthweights compared to the non-proteinuric hypertensives (gestational hypertension). There is also a trend towards an increased maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. When the groups were classified into pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension using the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipsticks, there were no differences in the clinical outcomes between the false negatives and true negatives except a trend towards a higher caesarean section rate in the false negatives. Conclusion The <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipstick read on the Clinitek 50 system provides a semi – quantitative result of the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio that has good sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipstick has a good negative predictive value and a result of < 300 mg/g rules out significant proteinuria and avoids unnecessary investigations in pregnancy. Both the visual dipstick (Makromed) and the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipstick read on the Clinitek 50 system are not accurate when compared to the total 24 hour urinary protein. Differences between the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio and 24 hour total urinary protein may be due to the variation in the albumin fraction of the total urinary protein of pre-eclampsia, technical problems with imprecision of the assay technique and clinical causes of false positives and negatives. The improved sensitivity of the automated <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipstick over the visual dipstick suggests it may be a suitable substitute for the visual dipstick in clinical practice Hypertension in pregnancy associated with significant proteinuria is associated with greater adverse maternal and fetal outcome. Outcome of pregnancy is similar when a classification of gestational hypertension is made based either on the 24 hour urinary protein or the <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipstick read on the Clinitek 50 system. The <b>urinary</b> microalbumin to <b>creatinine</b> ratio dipstick is a good screening test to rule out significant proteinuria. It has the potential to improve accuracy of screening for proteinuria and enhancing safety by preventing incorrect diagnosis and unnecessary investigation. Further research is required to determine its full impact and cost effectiveness in the clinical setting...|$|R

We used 24 -hour <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> {{excretion}} rate to assess determinants of muscle mass and its evolution with kidney function decline. We also described the range of <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> concentration in this population. METHODS:We included 1072 men and 537 women with non-dialysis CKD stages 1 to 5, all of them with repeated measurements of glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) by (51) Cr-EDTA renal clearance and several nutritional markers. In those with stage 1 to 4 at baseline, we used a mixed model to study factors associated with <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion rate and its change over time. RESULTS:Baseline mean <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion decreased from 15. 3 ± 3. 1 to 12. 1 ± 3. 3 mmol/ 24 h (0. 20 ± 0. 03 to 0. 15 ± 0. 04 mmol/kg/ 24 h) in men, with mGFR falling from ≥ 60 to < 15 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2), and from 9. 6 ± 1. 9 to 7. 6 ± 2. 5 (0. 16 ± 0. 03 to 0. 12 ± 0. 03) in women. In addition to mGFR, an older age, diabetes, {{and lower levels of}} body mass index, proteinuria, and protein intake assessed by urinary urea were associated with lower mean <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion at baseline. Mean annual decline in mGFR was 1. 53 ± 0. 12 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) per year and that of <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion rate, 0. 28 ± 0. 02 mmol/ 24 h per year.

40|$|Determining the {{presence}} of functional gonadal tissue in dogs can be challenging, especially in bitches during anestrus or not {{known to have been}} ovariectomized, or in male dogs with nonscrotal testes. Furthermore, in male dogs treated with deslorelin, a slow-release GnRH agonist implant for reversible chemical castration, the verification of complete downregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis can be difficult, especially if pretreatment parameters such as the size of the testes or prostate gland are not available. The aims of this study were to validate an immunoradiometric assay for measurement of FSH in canine urine, to determine if the <b>urinary</b> FSH to <b>creatinine</b> ratio can be used to verify the neuter status in bitches and male dogs, {{as an alternative to the}} plasma FSH concentration, and to determine if downregulation of the HPG axis is achieved in male dogs during deslorelin treatment. Recovery of added canine FSH and serial dilutions of urine reported that the immunoradiometric assay measures urinary FSH concentration accurately and with high precision. Plasma FSH concentrations (the mean of two samples, taken 40 ??minutes apart) and the <b>urinary</b> FSH to <b>creatinine</b> ratio were determined before gonadectomy and 140 ??days (median, range 121 ??? 225 ??days) and 206 ??days (median, range 158 ??? 294 ??days) after gonadectomy of 13 bitches and five male dogs, respectively, and in 13 male dogs before and 132 ??days (median, range 117 ??? 174 ??days) after administration of a deslorelin implant. In both bitches and male dogs, the plasma FSH concentration and the <b>urinary</b> FSH to <b>creatinine</b> ratio were significantly higher after gonadectomy, with no overlapping of their ranges. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the <b>urinary</b> FSH to <b>creatinine</b> ratio revealed a cut-off value of 2. 9 in bitches and 6. 5 in males to verify {{the presence}} or absence of functional gonadal tissue. In male dogs treated with deslorelin, the plasma FSH concentrations and <b>urinary</b> FSH to <b>creatinine</b> ratios were significantly lower after administration of the implant, but their ranges overlapped. We conclude that the <b>urinary</b> FSH to <b>creatinine</b> ratio can be used to verify the neuter status of bitches and male dogs.

In both sexes this excretion rose with age until adolescence where it reached a plateau. In normal adults the men had significantly higher (p less than 0. 001) excretions of U-iPGF 2 alpha than the women; also body weight and <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion were higher in men (p less than 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> {{excretion}} {{is used as}} {{a marker}} of completeness of timed urine collections, which are a keystone of several metabolic evaluations in clinical investigations and epidemiological surveys. The current reference values for 24 -hour <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion rely on observations performed in the 1960 s and 1970 s in relatively small and mostly selected groups, and may thus poorly fit to the present-day general European population. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish and validate anthropometry-based age- and sex-specific reference values of the 24 -hour <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion on adult populations with preserved renal function. METHODS We used data from two independent Swiss cross-sectional population-based studies with standardised 24 -hour urinary collection and measured anthropometric variables. Only data from adults of European descent, with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60  ml/min/ 1. 73  m(2) and reported completeness of the urinary collection were retained. A linear regression model was developed to predict centiles of the 24 -hour <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion in 1, 137 participants from the Swiss Survey on Salt and validated in 994 participants from the Swiss Kidney Project on Genes in Hypertension. RESULTS The mean <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion was 193 [*]±[*] 41  μmol/kg/ 24  hours in men and 151 [*]±[*] 38  μmol/kg/ 24  hours in women in the Swiss Survey on Salt. The values were inversely correlated with age and body mass index (BMI).

40|$|Background & objectives: The family {{caregivers}} {{of patients with}} chronic diseases are known to undergo psychiatric stress leading to oxidative damage to glomerular membrane of kidney resulting in proteinuria. This study was aimed to compare current anxiety, depression levels and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio between primary caregivers of chronic mental patients and matched controls, and also whether the <b>urinary</b> albumin : <b>creatinine</b> ratio is correlated with stress factors (state and trait anxiety level, depression and caregiver burden) amongst caregivers. Methods: The present cross-sectional study included 131 subjects (93 primary caregivers of patients with major mental illness as cases and 38 normal controls). They completed the Burden Assessment Schedule of SCARF, State Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck′s Depression Inventory. A spot urine sample was tested for <b>urinary</b> albumin : <b>creatinine</b> ratio from all study subjects. Results: Mean values of current State and Trait anxiety, depression, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio were significantly higher in caregivers than controls (P < 0. 001). <b>Urinary</b> albumin : <b>creatinine</b> ratio was significantly correlated (P < 0. 001) with State and Trait anxiety level, depression as well as caregiver burden. Interpretation & conclusions: The study demonstrated depression, anxiety and albuminuria amongst primary caregivers of patients with mental illness. Increase in the caregivers′ burden, depression and anxiety resulted {{in an increase in}} the <b>urinary</b> albumin: <b>creatinine</b> ratio. This indicates that psychological stress is one of the determinants of albumin excretion rate in otherwise healthy subjects...|$|R

40|$|Efficient gonadotrophin therapy {{requires}} both biochemical and ultrasonic {{measurements of}} ovarian response. Biochemical monitoring {{can take the}} form of measurement of plasma oestradiol levels or urinary oestrogen excretion. Levels of first morning <b>urinary</b> oestrogen to <b>creatinine</b> ratio have been shown to correlate well with 24 -hour total urinary oestrogen excretion. Such urine collection is not cumbersome and is less invasive than daily venepuncture. Eighty gonadotrophin treatment cycles were evaluated by first morning <b>urinary</b> oestrogen to <b>creatinine</b> ratio and ultrasound scanning of follicles. Analysis confirmed that the ratio correlated significantly both with plasma oestradiol and 24 -hour urinary oestrogen levels. The administration of the ovulating dose of human chorionic gonadotrophin depended primarily on ultrasonic demonstration of the presence of mature follicles in the ovaries. There was no increased incidence of multiple gestation or hyperstimulation syndrome in 135 treatment cycles. It is concluded that first morning <b>urinary</b> oestrogen to <b>creatinine</b> ratio is a convenient and cheap method of efficient biochemical monitoring of ovarian response to gonadotrophin therapy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Biologic {{monitoring}} (i. e., biomonitoring) is used {{to assess}} human exposures to environmental and workplace chemicals. Urinary biomonitoring data typically are adjusted to a constant creatinine concentration to correct for variable dilutions among spot samples. Traditionally, this approach {{has been used in}} population groups without much diversity. The inclusion of multiple demographic groups in studies using biomonitoring for exposure assessment has increased the variability in the <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> levels in these study populations. Our objectives were to document the normal range of <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> concentrations among various demographic groups, evaluate the impact that variations in creatinine concentrations can have on classifying exposure status of individuals in epidemiologic studies, and recommend an approach using multiple regression to adjust for variations in creatinine in multivariate analyses. We performed a weighted multivariate analysis of <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> concentrations in 22, 245 participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 – 1994) and established reference ranges (10 th– 90 th percentiles) for each demographic and age category.

Two groups, A (n = 14) and B (n= 23), were defined by their weight-for-height index, 90 %, respectively. Anthropometrically assessed lean body mass (LBM), 24 -h <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine,</b> and REE were measured. Form multiple-regression analysis, the best-fitting equation for calculating REE (REE = 54. 4 LBM (kg) + 0. 095 creatinine (mmol/kg) + 4. 7) was highly significant (r= 0. 987, p < 0. 0001). Although the regressions of REE on weight were significantly different between the two groups, the equations using LBM or 24 -h <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> did not discriminate between them. These findings suggest that an equation based on LBM or 24 -h <b>urinary</b> <b>creatinine</b> excretion could be more accurate estimate of REE than are conventional methods based on weight or height, and it may be applicable to diverse nutritional states...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{prevalence}} and effects of the presence of metabolic syndrome in patients with type 1 diabetes. Research design and methodsRetrospective analysis of data from a one year period of patients attending annual review clinic was undertaken. Body weight, height and blood pressure were measured along with assessment of micro-/macro-vascular complications. HbA 1 c, urea, cholesterol, triglyceride, <b>urinary</b> albumin: <b>creatinine</b> ratios were also measured. Patients were divided into those with and those without metabolic syndrome. ResultsData from 365 type 1 diabetic patients was analysed. Hundred and twelve had metabolic syndrome. There was no difference according to gender or smoking. Type 1 diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome had longer duration of diabetes, were significantly older, heavier, had higher blood pressure, higher triglyceride and lower HDL cholesterol levels. There were significant increases in mean BMI, urea, serum <b>creatinine,</b> <b>urinary</b> albumin: <b>creatinine</b> ratio, cholesterol and triglyceride in the group with metabolic syndrome even after controlling for both age and duration of diabetes. Neuropathy and macro-vascular complications were commoner in patients with metabolic syndrome. Patients with metabolic syndrome were more likely to be on statins, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers and had a significantly higher mean insulin dosage requirement per kg. ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of the presence of the metabolic syndrome in patients with type 1 diabetes. It shows that metabolic syndrome is associated with a higher incidence of diabetes-related complications, a need for higher insulin doses and a more aggressive multifactorial intervention...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with diabetic nephropathy, lowering {{blood pressure and}} reducing proteinuria by over 30 % correlates with a slower progression to kidney failure. We compared two different angiotensin receptor-blockers in a double blind, prospective trial of 860 {{patients with}} type 2 diabetes whose blood pressure levels was over 130 / 80 mmHg or who were receiving antihypertensive medication(s) and who had a morning spot <b>urinary</b> protein to <b>creatinine</b> ratio of 700 or more. Patients were randomized to telmisartan (a highly lipophilic agent with a long half-life) or losartan (with low lipophilicity and short half-life).
