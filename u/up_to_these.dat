25|$|Actors form {{schools or}} are {{associated}} with a particular theatre. Every actor has a stage name, which is different from the name they were born with. These stagenames, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names {{are associated with}} certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career.|$|E

Avelyn, a promising young monk at St. Mere-Abelle begins learning {{the use of the}} powerful gemstone magic, but eventually leaves the Church after finding it to not be the holy place he had hoped for and receiving a vision of the awakened demon dactyl.

25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave out a lot of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E
25|$|The {{content and}} {{form of the}} salon to some extent defines the {{character}} and historical importance of the salon. Contemporary literature about the salons is dominated by idealistic notions of politesse, civilité and honnêteté, but whether the salons lived <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> standards is matter of debate. Older texts on the salons tend to paint an idealistic picture of the salons, where reasoned debate takes precedence and salons are egalitarian spheres of polite conversation. Today, however, this view is rarely considered an adequate analysis of the salon. Dena Goodman claims that rather than being leisure based or 'schools of civilité' salons were instead at 'the {{very heart of the}} philosophic community' and thus integral to the process of Enlightenment. In short, Goodman argues, the 17th and 18th century saw the emergence of the academic, Enlightenment salons, which came out of the aristocratic 'schools of civilité'. Politeness, argues Goodman, took second-place to academic discussion.|$|E

After {{finishing}} third in 2003, expectations were high during early 2004, when the club signed several well-known players, including FC Barcelona defender Patrik Andersson, a former Malmö FF player. The Swedish press compared this spending spree to those of Real Madrid, and labelled Malmö FF's new collection of players [...] "Real Malmö".

500|$|During the 1970s the bootleg {{industry}} in the United States expanded rapidly, coinciding with the era of stadium rock or arena rock. Vast numbers of recordings were issued for profit by bootleg labels such as Kornyfone and TMQ. [...] The large followings of rock artists created a lucrative market for the mass production of unofficial recordings on vinyl, as it became evident {{that more and more}} fans were willing to purchase them. In addition, the huge crowds which turned <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> concerts made the effective policing of the audience for the presence of covert recording equipment difficult. Led Zeppelin quickly became a popular target for bootleggers on the strength and frequency of their live concerts; Live on Blueberry Hill, recorded at the LA Forum in 1970, was sufficiently successful to incur the wrath of manager Peter Grant. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band recorded numerous concerts for radio broadcast in the 1970s, which resulted in many Springsteen bootlegs.|$|E
500|$|In Stage three (good {{intentions}} {{as determined}} by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views.

Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the [...] "golden rule". [...] "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." [...] Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that [...] "they mean well".|$|E

2500|$|Communication and negotiation: Because {{there is}} no [...] "standard model" [...] for polyamorous relationships, and {{reliance}} upon common expectations may not be realistic, polyamorists often advocate explicitly negotiating with all involved to establish the terms of their relationships, and often emphasize that this should be an ongoing process of honest communication and respect.
