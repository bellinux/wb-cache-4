25|$|The NXE {{was leaked}} onto Torrent sites {{and could be}} {{installed}} via a USB drive. Microsoft's Major Nelson stated that <b>unauthorized</b> <b>installation</b> of NXE {{would result in the}} user's console being banned from Xbox Live until its official release which was on November 19, 2008.|$|E
5000|$|In Virginia, {{computer}} trespass consists of, with malicious intent, copying, altering, or erasing {{data from}} a computer, causing a computer to malfunction, causing an electronic funds transfer, etc. The element of [...] "malicious" [...] intent was added by the Virginia General Assembly in 2005 by House Bill 2215. Civil liability can be imposed regardless of intent {{under the terms of}} ยง 18.2-152.12. The law bans <b>unauthorized</b> <b>installation</b> and use of software keyloggers but not specifically hardware keyloggers. There are felony provisions if damage is caused of $1,000 or more, or if software is installed in violation of this law on more than five computers of another.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to activation, Windows XP service packs will refuse to install on Windows XP systems with product keys {{known to be}} widely used in <b>unauthorized</b> <b>installations.</b> These product keys are either intended for use with one copy (for retail and system builder), for one OEM (for BIOS locked copies) or to one company (for volume license copies) and are included with the product. However a number of volume licence product keys (which as mentioned above avoid the need for activation) were posted on the Internet and were then used for {{a large number of}} <b>unauthorized</b> <b>installations.</b> The service packs contain a list of these keys and will not update copies of Windows XP that use them.|$|R
50|$|On 19 March 2006 a {{construction}} pile from an <b>unauthorized</b> billboard <b>installation</b> was driven through a tunnel roof, hitting a train between the Sokol and Voikovskaya stations on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. No injuries were reported.|$|R
5000|$|Sophia Wallace (born 1978) is an American {{conceptual}} {{artist and}} photographer. She {{is best known}} for her project [...] "CLITERACY," [...] which addresses citizenship and body sovereignty through the medium of text-based objects, <b>unauthorized</b> street <b>installation,</b> performance and sculptural forms.|$|R
5000|$|In The Concrete Jungle, Bob Howard {{is called}} {{in for an}} emergency: {{there are too many}} Concrete Cows in Milton Keynes. Howard reads {{classified}} files on the presumed cause: gorgonism, which has been banned by treaty for military use, and has been researched by various scientists over time - Lavosier, Geiger, and Rutherford. Alarmingly, the government has built a network to artificially emulate gorgons in FPGAs, then planned a network of cameras that could be hooked into this emulation - the CCTV network of anti-crime cameras deployed across Britain in the late 90s and early 2000s. This network was intended as a defense if the Old Ones were to rise and attack; however, someone has subverted a CCTV camera to stone a cow, then deposited it with the other concrete cows. As unauthorized use of the CCTV-basilisk network could hold the entire nation at hostage, this is an incredible risk. In an unrelated event, Howard is informed that he is being negligent about preparing for a meeting about a Business Software Alliance audit for the Laundry's software; Howard strongly opposes the audit, as the BSA invariably installs [...] "spyware" [...] to snoop for <b>unauthorized</b> <b>installations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to the Supreme Court, {{liability}} for such <b>unauthorized</b> replication and <b>installation</b> {{would have to}} arise under the patent laws of those foreign countries, not the U.S. Patent Act. Although AT&T argued that the Supreme Court's decision actually created a [...] "loophole" [...] for software makers to avoid liability under ยง 271(f), the Supreme Court explained that it is Congress, not the Court, {{that is responsible for}} addressing any such loopholes.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use of shock collars is pet {{containment}} {{systems that are}} used to keep a dog inside the perimeter of the residence without the construction of a physical barrier. This use of shock collars is increasingly popular in areas where local laws or homeowners' associations prohibit the construction of a physical fence. Available systems include: in-ground installation to preserve the aesthetics of the yard; above ground installation to reinforce an existing barrier that was not sufficient in containing the dog; and wireless systems to allow for indoor use. Most pet containment systems work by installing a wire {{around the perimeter of the}} yard. The wire carries no current (as opposed to electric fences which do carry a current at high voltage that may be lethal in the event of <b>unauthorized</b> or defective <b>installation</b> or equipment) but forms a closed loop with a circuit box that transmits a radio signal to the receiver collar worn by the dog. As the dog approaches the perimeter the collar will activate.|$|R
