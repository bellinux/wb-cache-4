40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{statistical inference}} for discrete distributions under parameter orthogonality and model misspecification. Parameter orthogonality has many advantages in statistical inference (see, Cox and Reid, 1987); for example, convergence is fast in numerical maximum likelihood estimation (see, Willmot, 1988). Since statistical models are approximations to the unknown models, {{the issue of}} model misspecification {{must be considered in}} any statistical analysis. A closely related important issue is to determine if a given random sample fits a probability model well, a goodness-of-fit problem. The research deals with a goodness-of-fit test based on an information matrix identity known as Bartlett’s First Identity (BFI) which is the basis of White’s (1982) Information Matrix (IM) test for model misspecification. However, the proposed goodness-of-fit test statistic differs from White’s IM test. It has been simplified after the application of parameter orthogonality and does not require the evaluation of the complicated covariance matrix as in the IM test. For illustration purpose, a Monte Carlo simulation study using the negative binomial distribution as an example has been conducted to compare the proposed test statistic with goodness-of-fit tests based on the empirical distribution function (EDF). The results show that the proposed test is useful as an alternative goodness-of-fit test in terms of power. In addition, some asymptotic results of the test are derived. In this thesis we consider the orthogonality of the mean μ as a parameter, in multiparameter models, where the remaining parameters are regarded as nuisance parameters. In particular, orthogonality for Poisson-convolution models, which are of practical importance, has been derived. As an application of this orthogonality result, we develop a uniformly most powerful (<b>UMP)</b> <b>test</b> of the mean based on the asymptotic result under the model iv misspecification. A small Monte Carlo power study of the proposed <b>UMP</b> <b>test</b> has been conducted.

The orthogonal parameters to the mean of Delaporte distribution can be easily obtained. The efficiency of the various methods of estimation for the Delaporte distribution, namely, the method of moments, moments and zero frequency, and maximum likelihood, as discussed by Ruohenen (1988), has been examined. The comparative study of interval estimation under correct specification and misspecification of the Delaporte distribution is also discussed. Parameter estimation of the Delaporte distribution by a new quadratic distance statistic has been considered and the results are compared to maximum likelihood estimates...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{statistical}} method for detecting activated pixels in functional MRI (fMRI) data is presented. In this method, the fMRI time series measured at each pixel is modeled as {{the sum of}} a response signal which arises due to the experimentally controlled activation-baseline pattern, a nuisance component representing effects of no interest, and Gaussian white noise. For periodic activation-baseline patterns, the response signal is modeled by a truncated Fourier series with a known fundamental frequency but unknown Fourier coefficients. The nuisance subspace {{is assumed to be}} unknown. A maximum likelihood estimate is derived for the component of the nuisance subspace which is orthogonal to the response signal subspace. An estimate for the order of the nuisance subspace is obtained from an information theoretic criterion. A statistical test is derived and shown to be the uniformly most powerful (<b>UMP)</b> <b>test</b> invariant to a group of transformations which are natural to the hypothesis testing problem. The maximal invariant statistic used in this test has an F distribution.

The objectives of this project are to collect the data of the passenger car during decelerates using the <b>UMP’s</b> <b>test</b> car under on-road and off-road driving condition and to analyze the deceleration performance of passenger car for difference deceleration test. This report describes the few type of deceleration by run the test. The test was divided into two sections which are on road and off road. For the on road test, the initial speed of the car before decelerate was varies and control the stopping distance. Base on the theory, the higher the initial speed of the car, the longest time and distance needed to stop safely but for this test, the stopping distance is constant so that the stopping time will decrease if the initial speed is increase. Other than that, the brake system also needs to absorb greater energy and power if the car decelerates from the high speed. For the off road test, the stopping time and stopping distance want to be study base on the initial speed of the car. Finally, some calculations need to be performed using related formulas and equations {{to know the difference}} between all the decelerations types. Some graphs was plotted to show the trends and pattern of the result. The results concluded that the braking techniques and ways to reduce the car speed will affect the stopping time, stopping distance, and power and energy absorb by the brake system. Therefore, the road condition also is the main factor that influent the deceleration performance of the passenger car. The results indicate difference deceleration behavior for passenger car under various speed in on-road and off-road condition, which is an important study to develop difference braking techniques...|$|R

To facilitate the phenotypic rescue of this defective gene, mutants which overproduced ornithine transcarbamylase mRNA were isolated as a first step. The absence of exogenously added arginine causes stringent conditions, and phenotypic rescue by 5 FU is, thus, prevented, unless the 5 FU uptake mechanism is mutationally changed in such a manner that the drug is taken up into the cell.

40|$|In {{several studies}} in Survival Analysis, {{the cause of}} failure / death of items or {{individuals}} may be attributable {{to more than one}} cause. In this chapter, we consider the competing risks model when the data is progressively Type-II censored. We provide di®erent techniques for the analysis of the model under the assumption of independent causes of failure and exponential lifetimes. The maximum likelihood estimators of the di®erent parameters and the UMVUE's are obtained. In addition, the exact distributions of the di®erent estimators are derived. We also derive the <b>UMP</b> and UMPU <b>test</b> for the equality of the failure rates of the competing risks. We consider the Bayesian estimation using the Inverse Gamma distribution as a prior. To assess the performance of all these estimators, con¯dence intervals are developed using the exact, asymptotic, and bootstrap distributions. In the Bayesian context, we develop credible intervals for the parameters. The di®erent methods are compared through a simulation study, and the analysis of a real dataset. Finally, we also provide some insight into inference under the Weibull model and dependent causes of failure...|$|R
