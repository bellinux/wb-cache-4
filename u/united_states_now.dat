5|$|In early 1942, {{with the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>now</b> embroiled World War II, Arthur Compton {{concentrated}} the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Zinn used athletes to build Fermi's increasingly large experimental configurations under the stands of the disused Stagg Field. In July 1942, Fermi measured a k = 1.007 from a uranium oxide lattice. This raised hopes that pure uranium would yield a suitable value of k.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{first year}} at Ohio State was a success. The Buckeyes won {{all but one of}} eight games in 1941; the only loss was to Northwestern University and its star tailback, Otto Graham.

The Buckeyes tied for second place in the Western Conference, a grouping of college teams from the Midwestern <b>United</b> <b>States</b> (<b>now</b> known as the Big Ten), and finished 13th in the AP Poll. Brown was fourth in balloting for national Coach of the Year.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a step {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>now</b> needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. The proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>now</b> {{an active}} {{participant}} in World War II, Idaho and Mississippi left Iceland on 9 December to rejoin the Pacific Fleet. They stopped in Norfolk before steaming through the Panama Canal and continuing on to San Francisco, where they arrived on 31 January 1942. For much of the year, Idaho was occupied with combat training off the coast of California. In October, she went to the Puget Sound Navy Yard to receive replacements for her worn out main battery guns. The original secondary battery of 5-inch/51 cal. guns was removed as, these guns were badly needed to arm merchant ships. Further training followed until April 1943, when on the 7th she departed for the Aleutian Islands, where Japanese troops had occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska. Idaho served as the flagship of the bombardment and patrol force. On 11 May, US Army forces went ashore on Attu, and Idaho provided gunfire support for the assault. The following month, a second attack followed on Kiska, but the Japanese had already abandoned the island in July. On 7 September, Idaho returned to San Francisco to begin preparations for the next major amphibious assault, which shifted focus to the central Pacific.|$|E

25|$|The SMI rankings are a {{collaborative}} publication from CollegeNet and PayScale.

The rankings were also created to combat the rising costs of tuition, much of which is attributed to the efforts of some colleges to increase their own fame and wealth in ways that increase their rank in media periodicals that put an emphasis on such measures. According to the SMI, the top five colleges are Montana Tech, Rowan University, Florida A, Cal Poly Pomona, and Cal State Northridge.|$|E
