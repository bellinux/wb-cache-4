"Closure," [...] {{written by}} series creator Chris Carter and {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, brought an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted {{when he was a}} child.

500|$|While filming was {{underway}} {{for the seventh}} season, {{many members of the}} crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, [...] "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show {{that it was time to}} call it a day." [...] Because the show's producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, [...] "Millennium" [...] was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter-created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, [...] "Closure", features Mulder discovering what happened to his sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, [...] "It's been seven years.

Paul Rabwin explained that, [...] "we found ourselves starting to get energized again. [...] As we got toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Manchester Arena bombing, Hopkins {{wrote that}} [...] "Britain {{is faced with}} some hard {{questions}} the people charged with protecting <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have to answer sooner or later". [...] Hopkins asserted that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the police, and questioned how he was permitted to re-enter Britain unchallenged after visiting Libya. [...] "Our leaders allow such deeply suspicious characters back into Britain," [...] wrote Hopkins, [...] "and then expect us to swallow their lies {{that we will not}} give in to terror?" [...] Hopkins also tweeted about the need for a [...] "final solution", the Nazis' term for the Holocaust, on the morning following the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Although the tweet was soon deleted and reworded as a [...] "true solution", Hopkins claimed the original was only a typographical error (she had also misspelled Manchester). The motive for the attack, and the background of the suicide bomber, was unknown at the time Hopkins made the comment.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come, Nurse, let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> <b>going.</b> Up {{the river}} and down the river we cannot walk, for there are nothing but weeds and mud, so we must strike out through the forest, whither the gods may lead us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} king, [...] "victory {{is to the}} Cross, and {{henceforth}} the Cross shall be worshipped in this land, or at least no other god shall <b>be</b> worshipped. Let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> <b>going.</b> Come with me, Messenger, Lord of the Lightning." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We'll smuggle you ashore all right," [...] said Bill, [...] "none of <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to sign back in {{this old}} tub. I'll take you aboard some ship with me--Eh?" ...|$|E

60|$|THE YOUTH. Come! own up: arnt {{you very}} unhappy? It's dreadful {{to see you}} ancients going about by yourselves, never noticing {{anything}}, never dancing, never laughing, never singing, never getting anything out of life. None of <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to be like that}} when we grow up. It's a dog's life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in {{and play}} a game, and have some lunch. You will have plenty of time, and some of <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to the rink by and by. Do, we want a boy to help us, for Maurice is too lazy, and Jack has hurt his hand with that stupid base ball," [...] said Alice, beckoning persuasively, while the other girls nodded and smiled hopefully.|$|E
6000|$|I {{am always}} delighted {{to hear from}} you. Your genial earnestness does me good to think of. And {{every day of my}} life I feel more and more that to be {{thoroughly}} in earnest is everything, and to be anything short of it is nothing. You see what we have been doing to our valiant soldiers.[65] You see what miserable humbugs we are. And because we have got involved in meshes of aristocratic red tape to our unspeakable confusion, loss, and sorrow, the gentlemen who have been so kind as to ruin <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to give us a day of humiliation and fasting the day after to-morrow. I am sick and sour to think of such things at this age of the world. [...] . I am in the first stage of a new book, which consists in going round and round the idea, as you see a bird in his cage go about and about his sugar before he touches it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Soa is dead," [...] he answered. [...] "She {{fell down}} {{the gulf and}} nearly pulled us with her. I will {{tell you all about}} it afterwards; you are not fit to hear it now. Come, dear, let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> out of this accursed place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Father, {{but it is}} so," [...] {{answered}} Tua.

6000|$|... "So, Harmachis, take Pharaoh's {{head and}} I will take his----Oh, what an awful place is this!" [...] and {{suddenly}} she clung to me. [...] "Methought I saw a shadow yonder in the darkness! Methought that it moved toward us and then straightway vanished! Let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> <b>going!</b> Didst thou see naught?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{just the}} same reason that we have been {{learning}} to use our firearms, father. We do not suppose that the natives, who are all friendly with <b>us,</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to turn treacherous. Still, as there is a bare possibility of such a thing, we have taken some pains in learning to shoot straight. In the same way it would be just as well to have strong shutters put up. We don't at all suppose {{we are going to be}} attacked, but if we are the shutters would be invaluable, and would effectually prevent anything like a night surprise. The expense wouldn't be great, and in the unlikely event of the natives being troublesome in this part of this island we should all sleep much more soundly and comfortably if we knew that there was no fear of our being taken by surprise. Mr. Atherton is sending for a couple of dogs too. I have always thought that it would be jolly to have a dog or two here, and if we do not want them as guards they would be pleasant as companions when one is going about the place." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, my friends--it is {{just these}} very {{questions}} which I hope and trust God {{will help me}} to answer to you, in my next few sermons--I am perfectly convinced that we must get them answered and act upon them speedily. I am perfectly convinced that if we go on as most of <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in England now, the Lord of us all will come in an hour when we are not aware, and cut us asunder in the deepest and most real sense, as He came and cut asunder France, Germany, and Austria only last year, and appoint us our portion with the unbelievers. And I believe that our punishment will be seven times as severe as that of either France, Germany, or Austria, because we have had seven times their privileges and blessings, seven times their Gospel light and Christian knowledge, seven times their freedom and justice in laws and constitution; seven times their wealth, and prosperity, and means of employing our population. Much {{has been given to}} England, and of her much will be required. And if you could only see the state of mankind over the greatest part of the globe, how infinitely fewer opportunities they have of knowing God's will than you have, you would feel that to you, poor and struggling as some of you are-- to you much has been given, and of you much will be required.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ghosts," [...] said Hadden roughly, for he {{was angry}} at his own tremors, [...] "I should like to see those ghosts. Do you think that I have never heard a troop of monkeys in the bush before, mother? Come, Nahoon, let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> while there <b>is</b> light to climb the cliff.

6000|$|... "Yes, we've {{had several}} tussles since then," [...] Wingate repeated, [...] "and we haven't hurt each other much. This time I {{think one of}} <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> under.

6000|$|Bradley {{scratched}} his head. [...] "Neither of <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to die," [...] he said; [...] "at least {{not at the}} hands of any god.

5000|$|After {{all three}} were buried, Price told the group: Well, boys, you've done a good job. You've struck a blow for the white man. Mississippi {{can be proud of}} you. You've let those {{agitating}} outsiders know where this state stands. Go home now and forget it. But before you go, I'm looking each one of you in the eye and telling you this: [...] "The first man who talks is dead! If anybody who knows anything about this ever opens his mouth to any outsider about it, then the rest of <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to kill him just as dead as we killed those three sonofbitches (sic) tonight.

6000|$|... "It is {{pride that}} stands in your way.
