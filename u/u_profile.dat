30|$|Another {{concern is}} that the {{amplitude}} of LSWS perturbation cannot be estimated so easily, because it depends on a chain of events that occur before the AGW participates in the above-described neutral-ion coupling process. The AGW must be convectively generated in the lower atmosphere and propagate up {{to the base of the}} F layer. During its upward migration, the AGW undergoes fluid amplification because of decreasing neutral density with altitude, and it may suffer attenuation or reflection, depending on <b>U</b> <b>profile</b> of the background atmosphere. Whether the AGW can couple efficiently with the plasma will depend on its direction of propagation and other wave properties. Hence, we are still far from being able to estimate the LSWS seed amplitude. But, given the host of possible encounters leading up to and including the neutral-ion coupling process, we have good reason to expect variability in upwelling growth properties. Whether any process, or a combination of a few, can produce what we found in our case study, remains to be seen.|$|E
40|$|Ferromanganese crusts record {{seawater}} isotope {{history for}} several elements useful for paleoceanography. Interpreting crust isotope profiles, however, requires {{an assessment of}} the rate of diffusion of each element within the crust. We address this issue using U- and Th-isotope profiles, coupled with concentration measurements of some trace elements whose isotopes are often measured in crusts. A depth profile of (230 Th(xs) / 234 U) for a North Atlantic crust (Alv 539) yields a growth rate of 3. 05 mm/Myr, consistent with an existing 10 Be/ 9 Be record. But the growth rate implied by a (234 U/ 238 <b>U)</b> <b>profile</b> in the same crust is ~ 6 times faster due to diffusion of U in the crust. The difference between the observed (234 U/ 238 <b>U)</b> <b>profile</b> and that expected from (230 Th(xs) / 234 U) enables the effective diffusivity of U to be calculated as 1. 2 x 10 - 6 cm 2 /year. Recalculated literature data indicate that other crusts have diffusivities which range down to 4. 7 x 10 - 8 cm 2 /yr. This variation is to be expected given the range of porosity observed for ferromanganese crusts. Concentration measurements of various elements in the surface layer of the crust provide relative distribution coefficients for each element between seawater and crust. These distribution coefficients enable the effective diffusivity of each element to be calculated by comparison with the diffusivity of U. Such diffusivities are assessed for crust Alv 539 and give a first indication of the expected preservation of isotope signals in ferromanganese crusts. Li, Os, and Sr have diffusivities of 2 x 10 - 4, 3 x 10 - 5 and 2 x 10 - 5 cm 2 /year respectively and diffusion is expected to be sufficiently fast that crusts will not accurately preserve past seawater compositions. Th, Nd, Pb and Be have diffusivities less than 10 - 9 cm 2 /year and are highly immobile in crusts, a reassuring result for Th and Be crust chronologies and for Nd- and Pb-isotope tracing of past water masses using crusts. Hf has a diffusivity of 3 x 10 - 8 in Alv 539 - fast enough to perturb but not destroy its isotope history. For studies of Hf in this and other crusts, diffusion should therefore be considered. Measuring U-isotope profiles provides a potential way of assessing such diffusion for Hf or for other elements with relatively low distribution coefficients into ferromanganese crusts...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we {{argued that the}} inversion of Stokes profiles applied to spectropolarimetric observations of the solar internetwork yield unrealistically large values of the inclination of the magnetic field vector (γ). This is because photon noise in Stokes Q and U are interpreted by the inversion code as valid signals, that leads to an overestimation of the transverse component B_, thus the inclination γ. However, our study {{was based on the}} analysis of linear polarization signals that featured only uncorrelated noise. In this paper, we develop this idea further and study this effect in Stokes Q and <b>U</b> <b>profiles</b> that also show correlated noise. In addition, we extend our study to the three components of the magnetic field vector, as well as the magnetic filling factor α. With this, we confirm the tendency to overestimate γ when inverting linear polarization profiles that, although non-zero, are still below the noise level. We also establish that the overestimation occurs mainly for magnetic fields that are nearly vertical γ≲ 20. This indicates that a reliable inference of the inclination of the magnetic field vector cannot be achieved by analyzing only Stokes I and V. In addition, when inverting Stokes Q and <b>U</b> <b>profiles</b> below the noise, the inversion code retrieves a randomly uniform distribution of the azimuth of the magnetic field vector ϕ. To avoid these problems, we propose only inverting Stokes profiles for which the linear polarization signals are sufficiently above the noise level. However, this approach is also biased because, in spite of allowing for a very accurate retrieval of the magnetic field vector from the selected Stokes profiles, it selects only profiles arising from highly inclined magnetic fields.

40|$|Thin-walled {{open section}} beams are {{carefully}} analysed by Vlasov's {{theory of the}} sectorial areas.

30|$|Therefore, {{in order}} to explain the {{observed}} occurrence of scintillations over the dip equator, another element of the Tsunoda model (Tsunoda 2008) is clearly needed (these occurrences, of course, should be relatively rare). Keeping {{in mind that the}} <b>U</b> <b>profile</b> is produced by the solar tide, we should expect an associated, downward phase velocity. In other words, the wind-shear node should move downward in altitude with time. Given enough time, the Esb patch should be transported to an altitude, where the ions become unmagnetized, which means that the Esb patch will no longer be transported vertically. If this happens {{in the vicinity of the}} dip equator, we envision that the Esb patch will be left there, despite any recovery in strength of the Ep associated with the EEJ. The return of the Ep, together with the presence of Esb over the dip equator, is envisioned to lead to irregularity generation by GDI. The reason is that the Hall current will be driven by Ep, and the Esb can provide the gradient needed for irregularity generation. Hence, we envision that scintillation over the dip equator could occur after the recovery of the EEJ from quiet conditions. This will be discussed in “Comparison of daytime GHz scintillation occurrences at UKM and Langkawi” section.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effect of the inhomogeneous atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and near-wall treatment on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the flow and dispersion around an isolated building. Based on a revised k-. e{open} model (MMK), the effect of the inhomogeneous ABL is studied by comparing several sets of inhomogeneous inlet conditions with a homogeneous one, while the roughness-adapted standard wall functions and two-layer model are compared to examine the effect of the near-wall treatment of rough ground. Wind tunnel experimental data from previous investigations are used to validate the numerical simulations. The inhomogeneous ABL has a significant effect on the prediction of the flow and dispersion fields, depending on the percentage deviation of the incident from the inlet conditions. A decreased incident k profile results in a longer reattachment length on the roof and a larger recirculation region in the wake, which in turn produce decreased and increased nondimensional velocity and concentration fields, respectively. An increased incident <b>U</b> <b>profile</b> enlarges the reattachment lengths and raises the k field, which has a similar effect on the nondimensional velocity and concentration fields as decreased k. It is observed that the use of the two-layer model to solve the near-wall viscous sublayer clearly improves the prediction of flow and dispersion, depending {{on the role of the}} low-Reynolds-number effect of the near-wall region on the entire wall-bounded turbulent flow.

40|$|U-series dating of bone has {{suffered}} problems of reliability {{since its inception}} because bone remains an open system with respect to uranium. Commonly applied a priori assumptions of U uptake, such as early uptake or linear uptake, are inadequate {{because they have no}} physical or chemical bases, no means of demonstrating which model is suitable for a particular bone, and no intrinsic tests of reliability. Despite this and numerous examples of anomalous U-series dates, such assumptions are still routinely applied. We address this problem using the diffusion-adsorption (D-A) model of U uptake (Millard and Hedges, 1996), which incorporates a physicochemical description of U uptake. Using this model, we show how the U uptake of a bone responds to geochemical changes in the burial environment, which can lead to phenomena such as the removal of U from bones (“leaching”) or U uptake late in their burial history (“recent uptake”), and we show how the overall uptake history is reflected in distributions (<b>profiles)</b> of <b>U</b> and U-series isotopes across a bone section. We present measurements of <b>U</b> concentration <b>profiles,</b> and 230 Th/ 234 <b>U</b> <b>profiles</b> on archeological bone from a number of different sites and burial environments and compare the results to profiles predicted by the D-A model. Bones that have undergone complex uptake histories (which include U leaching or recent uptake) are identified {{on the basis of these}} profiles and rejected as unsuitable for dating. For bones that appear to have undergone uptake under constant geochemical conditions, the D-A model is applied to calculate U-series dates, with much improved reliability...|$|R

40|$|We have {{produced}} detailed maps of U and Th isotopes for three cross-sections of an Early Pleistocene equid tooth from the archaeological site of Fuente Nueva- 3 (Orce, Andalusia, Spain). This permits us to visualise, {{for the first}} time, U migration processes in 3 dimensions. The tooth shows a concentration gradient from the top to the base, indicating the <b>U</b> <b>profile</b> had not equilibrated after 3 ̆e 1 Ma. The spatial pattern of 230 Th/ 234 U and 234 U/ 238 U indicates complex U-mobilisation processes over the last 100 ka, dominated by small-scale redistribution of U. Leaching from the tooth through the pulp cavity started at least 93 ka ago with several later phases in various domains of the dentine and cement. This leaching event could have been triggered by changes in the local hydrological regime associated with periods of increased erosion in the Guadix-Baza basin. The results illustrate the difficulty of dating faunal material from Early Pleistocene sites. They also demonstrate that dental tissues can neither be considered as homogeneous media for U-diffusion, nor behave as closed systems for U-series isotopes because diagenetic alterations seem to trigger U-migration. The results {{do not support the}} notion that U-uptake into dental tissues is necessarily of short duration. Nevertheless, rapid laser ablation scanning can be used to identify suitable samples for dating as well as domains within the teeth that may have preserved original isotopic signatures, i. e. domains that have not been affected by recent U-mobilisation process...|$|E

The turbulence quantity measured was the variance of the streamwise wind velocity component 2 u. This variance is {{a component of the}} turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), and it is shown to be numerically approximately equal to TKE for stable conditions—profiles of 2 u are therefore equivalent to profiles of TKE. Mean-wind profiles showed low-level jet (LLJ) structure for most of the profiles, which represented 10 -min averages of mean and fluctuating quantities throughout each of the six nights studied. Heights were normalized by the height of the first LLJ maximum above the surface ZX, and the velocity scale used was the speed of the jet UX, which is shown to be superior to the friction velocity u * as a velocity scale. The major results were 1) the ratio of the maximum value of the streamwise standard deviation to the LLJ speed u/UX was found to be 0. 05, and 2) the three most common 2 <b>u</b> <b>profile</b> shapes were determined by stability (or Richardson number Ri). The least stable profile shapes had the maximum 2 u at the surface decreasing to a minimum {{at the height of the}} LLJ; profiles that were somewhat more stable had constant 2 u through a portion of the subjet layer; and the most stable of the profiles had a maximum of 2 u aloft, although it is important to note that the Ri for even the mos...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la "Thirteenth International Conference on Accelerator Mass Spectrometry" celebrada en Aix-en-Provence (Francia) del 24 al 29 de agosto de 2014. In {{this work}} we present the first {{comprehensive}} 236 U data in a sediment core from the North Atlantic Ocean (4000 m depth, Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) site, 49 º 0 ' N, 16 º 30 ' W). The sediment core has been further characterized through the measurement of other natural and anthropogenic radionuclides (14 C, 129 I, 137 Cs, 210 Pb, 239 Pu and 240 Pu). Concentration profiles show mobilization due to bioturbation, probably due to a reported increase of the seabed fauna in 1995 that followed an extra input of organic matter from the surface. Bioturbation affected differently to the different radionuclide profiles and this allowed us to go into detail on its biogeochemistry. 210 Pb and fallout radionuclides profiles showed two secondary maxima at 2 and 6 cm depth. On the contrary 236 <b>U</b> <b>profile</b> showed an additional pronounced maximum in most superficial layer; {{which may have been}} caused either by an additional source or by a different biogeochemical response. Similarly, a maximum was observed in the organic fraction of 14 C which evidences the role of organic matter in the transport of 236 U. The origin of this maxima was investigated through the analysis of the ratios of 236 U to the other radionuclides. Finally, significantly higher 236 U/ 238 U atomic ratios than the ones measured in the dissolved phases were obtained. This point out to a physico-chemical speciation of the antropogenic 236 U, as previously suggested by Sakaguchi et al. [2009]. The implications of our results on the 236 U chemistry and the potential sources of artificial radionuclides at the PAP site will be analysed. Ultimately, the potential use of 236 U as oceanic tracer will be discussed. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Here we focus on investigating the influence of atomic level polarization on the emergent Stokes profiles for a broad range of magnetic field strengths, in both 90 ◦ and forward scattering geometry.

40|$|Posttranscriptional {{processes}} often involve specific {{signals in}} mRNAs. Because mRNAs of integral membrane proteins across evolution are usually translated at distinct locations, we searched for universally conserved specific features {{in this group}} of mRNAs. Our analysis revealed that codons of very hydrophobic amino acids, highly represented in integral membrane proteins, are composed of 50 % uracils (U). As expected from such a strong U bias, the calculated <b>U</b> <b>profiles</b> of mRNAs closely resemble the hydrophobicity profiles of their encoded proteins and may designate genes encoding integral membrane proteins, {{even in the absence}} of information on ORFs. We also show that, unexpectedly, the U-richness phenomenon is not merely a consequence of the codon composition of very hydrophobic amino acids, because counterintuitively, the relatively hydrophilic serine and tyrosine, also encoded by U-rich codons, are overrepresented in integral membrane proteins. Interestingly, although the U-richness phenomenon is conserved, there is an evolutionary trend that minimizes usage of U-rich codons. Taken together, the results suggest that U-richness is an evolutionarily ancient feature of mRNAs encoding integral membrane proteins, which might serve as a physiologically relevant distinctive signature to this group of mRNAs...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{concentrations}} of 238 U and δ 234 U values were determined in estuarine surface waters and pore {{waters of the}} Amazon and Fly (Papua New Guinea) Rivers to investigate U transport phenomena across river-dominated land-sea margins. Discharge from large, tropical rivers is {{a major source of}} dissolved and solid materials transported to the oceans, and are important in defining not only oceanic mass budgets, but also terrestrial weathering rates. On the Amazon shelf, salinity-property plots of dissolved organic carbon, pH and total suspended matter revealed two vastly contrasting water masses that were energetically mixed. In this mixing zone, the distribution of uranium was highly non-conservative and exhibited extensive removal from the water column. Uranium removal was most pronounced within a salinity range of 0 - 16. 6, and likely the result of scavenging and flocculation reactions with inorganic (i. e., Fe/Mn oxides) and organic colloids/particles. Removal of uranium may also be closely coupled to exchange and resuspension processes at the sediment/water interface. An inner-shelf pore water profile indicated the following diagenetic processes: extensive (∼ 1 m) zones of Fe(III) - and, to a lesser degree, Mn(IV) - reduction in the absence of significant S(II) concentrations appeared to facilitate the formation of various authigenic minerals (e. g., siderite, rhodocrosite and uraninite). The pore water dissolved 238 <b>U</b> <b>profile</b> co-varied closely with Mn(II). Isotopic variations as evidenced in δ 234 U pore waters values from this site revealed information on the origin and history of particulate uranium. Only after a depth of about 1 m did the δ 234 U value approach unity (secular equilibrium), denoting a residual lattice bound uranium complex that is likely an upper-drainage basin weathering product. This suggests that the enriched δ 234 U values represent a riverine surface complexation product that is actively involved in Mn-Fe diagenetic cycles and surface complexation reactions. In the Fly River estuary, 238 U appears to exhibit a reasonably conservative distribution as a function of salinity. The absence of observed U removal does not necessarily imply non-reactivity, but instead may record an integration of concurrent U removal and release processes. There is not a linear correlation between δ 234 U vs. 1 / 238 U that would imply simple two component mixing. It is likely that resuspension of bottom sediments, prolonged residence times in the lower reaches of the Fly River, and energetic particle-colloid interactions contribute to the observed estuarine U distribution. The supply of uranium discharged from humid, tropical river systems to the sea appears to be foremost influenced by particle/water interactions that are ultimately governed by the particular physiographic and hydrologic characteristics of an estuary. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, it should allow the identification of teeth (and also bone) samples that have simple U-uptake histories and are amenable to precise dating by time-consuming and expensive Th–U and Pa–U TIMS techniques. We also demonstrated the use of laser ablation ICPMS to measure U-series isotopes in dentine and enamel samples with relatively high U concentrations (> 20 ppm).

The scattering induced by the prominence generates linear polarization signals in Stokes Q and <b>U</b> <b>profiles,</b> which are modified by the Hanle effect when a magnetic field is present.

The <b>U</b> + <b>profile</b> is obtained by solving the momentum equation which is written as an ordinary differential equation. An eddy viscosity formulation based on a near-wall turbulent kinetic energy k + function [R. Absi, Analytical solutions for the modeled kequation, ASME J. Appl. Mech. 75 (2008) 044501] and the van Driest mixing length equation [E. R. van Driest, On turbulent flow near a wall, J. Aero. Sci. 23 (1956) 1007] is used. The parameters obtained from the k + profiles are used for the computation of U + (variables with the superscript of + are those nondimensionalized by the wall friction velocity uτ and the kinematic viscosity ν). Comparisons with DNS data of fully-developed turbulent channel flows for 109 < Reτ < 2003 show good agreement (where Reτ denotes the friction Reynolds number defined by uτ, ν and the channel half-width δ).

It requires the assumption that the external forcing term satisfies that f(t, x) = t−(p− 2) / 2 F(t− 1 / 2 x) for some complex exponent p and for some profile function F which is assumed to be with compact support in RN.

40|$|In the past, spectropolarimetric {{data from}} Hinode/SP has been {{employed}} to infer {{the distribution of}} the magnetic field vector in the quiet Sun. While some authors have found predominantly horizontal magnetic fields, others favor an isotropic distribution. In this paper, we investigate whether it is actually possible to accurately retrieve the magnetic field vector in regions with very low polarization signals (e. g: internetwork), employing the FeI line pair at 6300 Å. We first perform inversions of the Stokes vector observed with Hinode/SP in the quiet Sun at disk center in order to confirm the distributions retrieved by other authors. We then carry out several Monte-Carlo simulations with synthetic data where we show that the observed distribution of the magnetic field vector can be explained in terms of purely vertical (γ= 0) and weak fields (B̅< 20 G), that are misinterpreted by the analysis technique (Stokes inversion code) as being horizontal (γ≈ 90) and stronger (B̅≈ 100 G), due to the effect of the photon noise. This casts doubts as to whether previous results, presenting the distributions for the magnetic field vector peaking at γ= 90 and B̅= 100 G, are actually correct. We propose that an accurate determination of the magnetic field vector can be achieved by decreasing the photon noise to a point where most of the observed profiles posses Stokes Q or <b>U</b> <b>profiles</b> that are above the noise level. Unfortunately, for noise levels as low as 2. 8 × 10 ^- 4 only 30...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{distribution}} of linear polarization signals in the quiet Sun internetwork using ultra-deep spectropolarimetric data. We reduce {{the noise of the}} observations as much as is feasible by adding single-slit measurements of the Zeeman-sensitive Fe I 630 nm lines taken by the Hinode spectropolarimeter. The integrated Stokes spectra are employed to determine the fraction of the field of view covered by linear polarization signals. We find that up to 69 % of the quiet solar surface at disk center shows Stokes Q or <b>U</b> <b>profiles</b> with amplitudes larger than 0. 032 % (4. 5 times the noise level of 7 x 10 ^{- 5 } reached by the longer integrations). The mere presence of linear polarization in most of the quiet Sun implies that the weak internetwork fields must be highly inclined, but we quantify this by inverting those pixels with Stokes Q or U signals well above the noise. This allows for a precise determination of the field inclination, field strength, and field azimuth because the information carried by all four Stokes spectra is used simultaneously. The inversion is performed for 53 % of the observed field of view at a noise level of 1. 3 x 10 ^{- 4 }. The derived magnetic distributions are thus representative of {{more than half of the}} quiet Sun internetwork. Our results confirm the conclusions drawn from previous analyses using mainly Stokes I and V: internetwork fields are very inclined, but except in azimuth they do not seem to be isotropically distributed...|$|R
