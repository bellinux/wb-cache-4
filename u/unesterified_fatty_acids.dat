40|$|Mechanisms {{restricting the}} {{accumulation}} of chloroplast glycolipids in achlorophyllous etiolated or heat-treated 70 S ribosome-deficient rye leaves (Secale cereale L. cv “Halo”) and thereby coupling glycolipid formation to the availability of chlorophyll, were investigated by comparing [14 C]acetate incorporation by leaf segments of different age and subsequent chase experiments. In green leaves [14 C]acetate incorporation into all major glycerolipids increased with age. In etiolated leaves glycerolipid synthesis developed much more slowly. In light-grown, heat-bleached leaves [14 C]acetate incorporation into glycolipids was high at the youngest stage but declined with age. In green leaves [14 C]acetate incorporation into <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and all major glycerolipids was immediately and strongly diminished after application of an inhibitor of chlorophyll synthesis, 4, 6 -dioxoheptanoic acid. The turnover of glyco- or phospholipids did not differ markedly in green, etiolated, or heat-bleached leaves.

40|$|An acute {{intraperitoneal}} injection of ethanol (0. 7 or 2. 1 g/kg body wt.) causes the reversible, dose-dependent accumulation of hepatic triglyceride in rats.

However, either dose increased the fraction of the total flux going to liver from 0. 16 to 0. 27 as rapidly as could be measured (30 s), and it remained elevated until all ethanol had been cleared from the blood. The fraction of the total radioactivity in lipids of liver that was in triglyceride increased linearly for 1 h from 30 to 50 % and there was a simultaneous decrease in phospholipid from 60 to 40 %. The rate of synthesis of hepatic triglyceride derived directly from <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> of serum was calculated by using the flux rate of <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in serum, the fractional hepatic uptake of this flux, and the percentage of liver <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> esterified to triglyceride.

Such cells maintained mitochondrial potential, and retained more K+ than cells without an energy source. Over the same duration, cells without an energy source were lethally injured. Treatment with antimycin induced increments of triglycerides and decreases of phospholipids. With severe ATP depletion (approximately equal to 5 - 10 % of normal after 5 h), decrease of phospholipids was marked. Cells in which ATP was not measurable (or was less than 5 % of normal) showed comparable phospholipid declines but, in addition, showed massive and progressive increase of <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The results identified a low threshold of ATP, at best 5 - 10 % of normal, which preserved viability in LLC-PK 1 cells despite major loss of membrane phospholipids.

40|$|The {{existence}} of small quantities of <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in blood plasma {{has been known}} for some years. In particular, the finding of unesteri-fied <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (hereafter abbreviated UFA) in al-bumin fractions prepared from fresh human plasma by the methods of Cohn, Hughes, and Weare (1), and the report of Davis (2) that fresh serum yielded small quantities of UFA, indicate that UFA actually exists as such in plasma and is not a laboratory artifact. In connection with the in-vestigations into the mechanism of lipid transport being carried forward in this laboratory, it had been found (3, 4) that a principal product of lipemia clearing in vitro is <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> Study of the relationship of physiologic clearing in vivo to the concentration of circulating UFA therefore suggested itself, and led to the present investigation. It will be observed that the term "unesterified <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> " is used in preference to "free fatty acid" in spite of the widespread acceptance of the latter in fat and oil chemistry. The choice is due to the evidence (5 - 7) that higher <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are firmly, though reversibly, bound to serum albumin and at times to other plasma proteins when proteins and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> exist together in aqueous solution.

40|$|Studies {{were made}} on the {{mechanism}} by which livers of ethanol-treated rats take up an increased {{fraction of the total}} flux of <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in serum. It was found that ethanol (0. 7 g/kg) causes a twofold rise in the serum content of liver, and that this serum is in rapid equilibrium with the general circulation. The fractional hepatic uptake from serum of group of compounds with varying uptake mechanisms and metabolic fates was studied in control and ethanol-treated animals. All the compounds tested, including <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> showed an enhanced uptake when ethanol was given. For one of the compounds, carbon tetrachloride, a dose/response relationship was established between the amount administered, the amount taken up by liver, and the amount metabolized. These findings were interpreted to mean that this dose of ethanol causes the liver to receive an increased flow of blood, and as a result all compounds present and capable of being taken by liver are taken up at an increased rate. Hepatic blood flow was measured by a technique that monitors the rate of clearance of a colloidal lipid emulsion. It was found that ethanol increased hepatic blood flow by about 60 %. This effect of ethanol on hepatic blood flow provides an explanation for the fatty liver and the synergistic effect between an acute dose of ethanol and carbon tetrachloride.

The estimated fractional removal rate of the injected triglycerides and the clearance of free fatty acids from circulation were both higher in omega 3 -depleted rats than in control animals. The injection of the lipid emulsions apparently inhibited intracellular lipolysis, this being least pronounced in omega 3 -depleted rats. The increased clearance of circulating triglycerides and <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in omega 3 -depleted rats may favor the cellular accumulation of lipids.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of [32 P]Pi into phosphatidylinositol by rat fat-cells was markedly {{increased in the}} presence of adrenaline. Phosphatidic acid labelling was also increased, but to a lesser extent. These effects are due to α 1 -adrenergic stimulation since they were unaffected by propranolol, blocked by α-blockers in the potency order prazosin«phentolamine<yohimbine and mimicked by methoxamine. The α-adrenergic stimulation of phosphatidylinositol labelling did not require extracellular Ca 2 +, which supports the hypothesis that an increased turnover of phosphatidylinositol is involved in α-adrenergic activation of Ca 2 + entry. Insulin and the ionophore A 23187 gave a small increase in 32 P labelling of phosphatidylinositol in Ca 2 +-free medium containing 1 mm-EGTA. The increases due to insulin or ionophore A 23187 were abolished if 2. 5 mm-Ca 2 + was added to medium containing EGTA. However, the increases in labelling of phosphatidylinositol due to α-adrenergic amines were still evident in medium containing EGTA and Ca 2 +. Lipolytic agents such as corticotropin, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, adrenaline {{in the presence of}} phentolamine and isoproterenol decreased [32 P]Pi incorporation into phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid. This inhibitory effect may be secondary to accumulation of intracellular <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> since it was decreased by incubating fewer cells in medium with 6 rather than 3 % albumin and was restored by the addition of oleate to the medium.

The output of bile {{and the flow}} of perfusate/g of liver were decreased in livers from animals pretreated with ethynyloestradiol, whereas the liver weight was increased slightly. The rates of uptake and of utilization of [1 - 14 C]oleate were measured when the concentration of <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in the perfusate plasma was constant. The uptake of <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> was unaffected by pretreatment of the animal with oestrogen; however, the rate of incorporation of [1 - 14 C]oleate into hepatic and perfusate triacylglycerol was stimulated, whereas the rate of conversion into ketone bodies was impaired by treatment of the rat with ethynyloestradiol. Pretreatment of the rat with ethynyloestradiol increased the output of very-low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerol, cholesterol, phospholipid and protein. The production of 14 CO 2 and the incorporation of radioactivity into phospholipid, cholesteryl ester and diacylglycerol was unaffected by treatment with the steroid. The net output of glucose by livers from oestrogen-treated rats was impaired despite the apparent increased quantities of glycogen in the liver. The overall effect of pretreatment with oestrogen on hepatic metabolism of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> is the channeling of [1 - 14 C]oleate into synthesis and increased output of triacylglycerol as a moiety of the very-low-density lipoprotein, whereas ketogenesis is decreased. The effect of ethynyloestradiol on the liver is apparently independent of the nutritional state of the animal from which the liver was obtained. It is pertinent that hepatocytes prepared from livers of fed rats that had been treated with ethynyloestradiol produced fewer ketone bodies and secreted more triacylglycerol than did hepatocytes prepared from control animals. In these respects, {{the effects of the}} steroid were similar in livers from fed or starved (12 – 14 h) rats.

Compared with receptor-dependent uptake of low density lipoprotein cholesteryl ester by heart endothelium, the chylomicron pathway appears to provide a major proportion of cholesteryl ester cleared from the plasma.

40|$|Alterations in {{triacylglycerol}} and phospholipid metabolism {{are known}} to occur during the evolution of myocardial ischemic injury. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore potential relationships between the accumulation of arachidonic acid and other fatty acids, the accumulation of triacylglycerol, and the progression of myocardial injury. Measurements of the fatty acid levels in triacylglycerol, <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> and calcium content were correlated with myocardial function during ischemia and ischemia with reflow in an isolated perfused rat heart preparation. After 10 minutes of ischemia in this model, myocardial dysfunction was reversible, with recovery of left ventricular +dP/dt to 82. 0 % +/- 4. 8 % of control values upon reperfusion. Hearts did not recover with reperfusion after 30 minutes of ischemia and displayed a significant increase in tissue calcium content. A significant, nearly threefold increase in the arachidonic acid content of triacylglycerol was found after 10 minutes of ischemia and continued to increase with longer periods of ischemia and reflow. Other fatty acids also showed increased levels in triacylglycerol. The time course of accumulation of unesterified arachidonic acid paralleled the loss of myocardial function. Levels of free arachidonic acid were (in nanomoles per gram wet weight) 11. 1 +/- 2. 1 (SEM) for control hearts, 17. 3 +/- 1. 9 after 10 minutes of ischemia, and 38. 4 +/- 2. 5 after 30 minutes of ischemia. Increases in other free fatty acids contributed to a significant increase in total free fatty acid accumulation after 30 minutes of ischemia. Thus, the content of arachidonic and other fatty acids in triacylglycerol was found to increase early during ischemia, and a major increase in free arachidonic and other <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> occurred after a longer period of ischemia. These findings are consistent with an initial reincorporation of free fatty acids into triacylglycerol after release from membrane phospholipids, suggesting that membrane fatty acids may be a major source of triacylglycerol that accumulates in ischemic myocardium. In addition, these results suggest that a major increase in free fatty acids during ischemia and ischemia with reflow correlates temporally with the development of severe contractile dysfunction and accumulation of calcium in the heart...|$|E

We hypothesized that these changes are associated with phospholipase (PLA 2) enzymes that regulate arachidonic (AA, 20 : 4 n- 6) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 6) acid metabolism, major polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in brain. Male Wistar rats were fed a control or high-sucrose diet for 8 weeks. Brains were assayed for markers of AA metabolism (calcium-dependent cytosolic cPLA 2 IVA and cyclooxygenases), DHA metabolism (calcium-independent iPLA 2 VIA and lipoxygenases), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and synaptic integrity (drebrin and synaptophysin). Lipid concentrations were measured in brains subjected to high-energy microwave fixation. Results The high-sucrose compared with control diet induced insulin resistance, and increased phosphorylated-cPLA 2 protein, cPLA 2 and iPLA 2 activity and 12 -lipoxygenase mRNA, but decreased BDNF mRNA and protein, and drebrin mRNA. The concentration of several n- 6 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and lysophosphatidylcholine was increased, as was unesterified AA concentration. Eicosanoid concentrations (prostaglandin E 2, thromboxane B 2 and leukotriene B 4) did not change. Conclusion These findings show upregulated brain AA and DHA metabolism and reduced BDNF and drebrin, but no changes in eicosanoids, in an animal model of {{the metabolic}} syndrome. These changes might contribute to altered synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment in rats and humans with the metabolic syndrome. </p...|$|R
40|$|SHR/NDmcr-cp (cp/cp) rats (SHR/NDcp) are {{an animal}} model of {{metabolic}} syndrome. A previous study of ours revealed drastic {{increases in the}} mass of palmitic (16 : 0), oleic (18 : 1 n- 9), palmitoleic (16 : 1 n- 7), cis-vaccenic (18 : 1 n- 7) and 5, 8, 11 -eicosatrienoic acids in the liver of SHR/NDcp. However, detailed information on the class of lipid accumulated and the mechanism responsible for the overproduction of the accumulated lipid in the liver was not obtained. This study aimed to characterize the class of lipid accumulated and to explore the mechanism underlying the lipid accumulation in the liver of SHR/NDcp, in comparison with SHR/NDmcr-cp (+/+) (lean hypertensive littermates of SHR/NDcp) and Wistar Kyoto rats. In the liver of SHR/NDcp, de novo synthesis of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (16 : 0, 18 : 1 n- 9 and 16 : 1 n- 7) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis were up-regulated and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> β-oxidation was down-regulated. These perturbations of lipid metabolism caused fat accumulation in hepatocytes and accumulation of TAG, which were enriched with 16 : 0, 18 : 1 n- 9 and 16 : 1 n- 7, in the liver of SHR/NDcp. On the other hand, no changes were found in hepatic contents of diacylglycerol and <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (FFA); among FFA, {{there were no differences}} in the hepatic concentrations of unesterified 16 : 0 and stearic acid between SHR/NDcp and two other groups of rats. Moreover, little change was brought about in the expression of genes responsive to endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of SHR/NDcp. These results may reinforce the pathophysiological role of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> elongase 6 in the liver of SHR/NDcp...|$|R
40|$|Tween 80 and Triton A 20 are two water-dispersible, non-ionic, {{surface-active}} agents which favor {{dispersed growth}} of tubercle bacilli in aqueous media probably by wetting the bacterial surface. Tween 80 is a polyoxyethylene ester of sorbitan monooleate and {{is liable to}} enzymatic hydrolysis by lipases. Triton A 20 in an arylalkyl polyether of phenol which appears resistant to the known enzymes of animal tissues. Tween 80 loses its ability to disperse cultures of tubercle bacilli in media containing serum; Triton A 20 does not. Tween 80 increases the yield of growth, probably by supplying oleic acid to the bacilli; Triton A 20 does not. In concentrations sufficient to cause dispersed browth, Tween 80 (purified by removal of <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid)</b> and Triton A 20 are completely innocuous for virulent tubercle bacilli. However, Triton A 20 exhibits a marked toxic effect on the avirulent variants of mammalian strains; Tween 80 does not. The two wetting agents also differ in their effects on the morphological aspects of the bacterial cultures. Whereas Triton A 20 prevents the formation of large amorphous bacillary clumps, it is less effective in preventing {{the orientation of the}} virulent bacilli resulting in the formation of long bacillary strands. Tween 80 on the contrary prevents also the formation of these cords of bacilli and exerts therefore a more effective dispersing effect on cultures of virulent tubercle bacilli...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal {{absorption}} of [3 H]octanoic acid and [3 H]decanoic acid {{was investigated in}} the rat by electron microscope autoradiography. The common duct (bile and pancreatic common duct) of the rats was diverted and a loop of the duodenum was cannulated 24 h later. The lipid mixture to be investigated was introduced into each experimental loop, and after 15 min or less the loop was removed. One part of each loop {{was used to determine}} the distribution of radioactivity in different lipid fractions, and an autoradiographic study was performed on {{the other part of the}} loop. Radioactivity distribution studies confirmed that medium chain fatty acids are absorbed in their nonesterified form and established that these fatty acids are absorbed much more rapidly than oleic acid. Autoradiographic studies indicated that the medium chain fatty acids are taken up in a molecular or aggregate molecular form, leave the epithelial cells by way of the lateral plasma membrane, and are next found in the blood capillaries. Our results suggest that the Golgi complex does not play an important role in the {{absorption of}} <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{serum albumin}} {{promotes}} {{the growth of}} small inocula of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in media containing <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Albumin binds fatty acids present in concentrations toxic for the organisms. In the present study, additional roles of albumin were investigated. When present in a basal medium, fatty acid-free albumin could be utilized by M. tuberculosis as a sole source of carbon. Since albumin could not substitute for the amino acids in basal medium as a nitrogen source, {{it was concluded that}} the protein component in albumin was not utilized as a nutrient by the organisms. An ether extract of fatty acid-free albumin supported a small but significant amount of growth. Analysis of the lipids in fatty acid-free albumin by gas chromatography revealed the presence of 686 microgram of fatty acid per g of albumin. Although a small amount of growth occurred when a lipid extract of albumin was present in the medium, growth stimulation was dependent in major part on the presence of undenatured albumin in the medium. Lipids, when bound to albumin, can serve as a nontoxic source of carbon and energy...|$|E
40|$|Storage of {{non-polar}} lipids in ubiquitous eukaryotic organelles, lipid droplets (LDs), {{prevents the}} toxic consequences of <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{and provides a}} lipid reservoir that can be promptly used to satisfy cellular needs under multiple metabolic and physiological conditions. Tight temporal and spatial control of LD biogenesis and mobilization of neutral lipids {{is essential for the}} correct channelling of lipid intermediates to their various cellular destinations and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. These functions are mediated by multiple interactions between LDs and other intracellular organelles that are required for the delivery of stored lipids. Here we review recent advances in the interactions of LDs with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and vacuole/lysosome.

40|$|Diacetyl {{long-chain}} 1 (3) - and 2 -acyl-sn-glycerols containing either [9, 10 - 3 H]oleic acid or [1 - 14 C]palmitic acid were synthesized by partial hydrolysis of {{the corresponding}} labelled triacylglycerols and acetylation. They were obtained {{in a high}} degree of stereochemical purity by preparative h. p. l. c. on a column containing a diol bonded phase. Each compound was rapidly metabolized by adipocyte preparations in vitro, and a high proportion of the label was recovered in the <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and triacylglycerol fractions. Negligible amounts of intermediate products of hydrolysis were detected. Triacylglycerols were formed from [9, 10 - 3 H]oleic acid and from diacetyl- 1 (3) -[9, 10 - 3 H]oleoyl glycerol precursors at about the same rate, but the 2 -isomer was metabolized rather more slowly. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that essentially complete hydrolysis occurred in the medium or at the plasma membrane, through the actions of lipoprotein lipase and monoacylglycerol lipase, and that subsequent esterification took place within the cell. To confirm that no putative intermediate monoacylglycerols were utilized for triacylglycerol biosynthesis via the monacylglycerol pathway, the positional distributions of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in triacylglycerols from each substrate were determined. No positional selectivity was observed. It was concluded that monoacylglycerols, of an origin exogenous to the tissue, e. g. those derived from plasma triacylglycerols, were not utilized to a significant degree for triacylglycerol biosynthesis in adipose tissue. The diacetyl derivatives of monoacylglycerols may serve as useful stereochemical probes in studies of triacylglycerol biosynthesis via the monoacylglycerol pathway in other tissues...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effects of conditioned running (1 h and 2 h at 20 m min- 1), which accelerates lipolysis, on the concentrations of tryptophan (Trp) in plasma, liver and brain and on 5 -hydroxytrptamine (5 -HT) and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) levels in brain. Running caused time-dependent increases in plasma free Trp and brain Trp of the rat, leading to increased brain 5 -HT turnover as revealed by higher amounts of its metabolite, 5 -HIAA. The ratio of brain Trp to plasma free Trp was decreased after 2 h of running. Liver Trp content rose only after 3 h of running, while liver <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (UFA) concentrations remained unmodified. A comparison between food deprivation and running (both of which promote lipolysis) was performed. Running for 2 h affected {{to the same extent}} plasma Trp disposition when compared with 24 h food deprivation. Nevertheless, the ratio of brain Trp to plasma free Trp was decreased in the food-deprived rats, when compared to the runners. Nicotinic acid, which inhibits fat catabolism, completely abolished the plasma UFA increase induced by 1 h of running. The drug did not affect plasma free Trp, brain Trp, 5 -HT or 5 -HIAA but enhanced plasma total Trp level. Naloxone, an opiate antagonist, which decreased running-induced lipolysis, did not alter plasma Trp disposition. Desipramine, an antidepressant compound, affected only peripheral Trp concentrations of the runners. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} our {{laboratory}} have established {{the presence of}} MTP in both white and brown adipose tissue in mice {{as well as in}} 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. Additional studies demonstrated an increase in MTP levels as 3 T 3 -L 1 cells differentiate into adipocytes concurrent with the movement of MTP from the juxtanuclear region of the cell to the surface of lipid droplets. This suggested a role for MTP in lipid droplet biogenesis and/or maturation. To probe the role of MTP in adipocytes, we used a Cre-Lox approach with aP 2 -Cre and Adipoq-Cre recombinase transgenic mice to knock down MTP expression in brown and white fat of mice. MTP expression was reduced approximately 55 % in white fat and 65 - 80 % in brown fat. Reducing MTP expression in adipose tissue had no effect on weight gain or body composition, whether the mice were fed a regular rodent or high fat diet. In addition, serum lipids and <b>unesterified</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> levels were not altered in the knockdown mice. Importantly, decreased MTP expression in adipose tissue was associated with smaller lipid droplets in brown fat and smaller adipocytes in white fat. These results combined with our previous studies showing MTP lipid transfer activity is not necessary for lipid droplet initiation or growth {{in the early stages of}} differentiation, suggest that a structural feature of the MTP protein is important in lipid droplet maturation. We conclude that MTP protein plays a critical role in lipid droplet maturation, but does not regulate total body fat accumulation...|$|R
