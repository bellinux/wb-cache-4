5|$|Sledd's {{advocacy}} {{of social change}} and an evolving understanding of biblical texts came at a high personal price. Given his chosen career of minister and professor, he never accumulated much personal wealth. Sledd died deep in debt, having lost the family home to foreclosure after the salaries of Candler professors were cut when financial support of the school fell during the Great Depression in the 1930s. His creditors obtained a deficiency judgment for the <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion</b> of his debt after the foreclosure and, following his death, forced the sale {{of some of his}} furniture and parts of his personal library in partial satisfaction of his remaining debts.|$|E
5|$|The BS {{struggled}} {{on for a}} time, {{funding the}} construction work by making calls on the <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion</b> of its shares, but activity eventually {{came to a stop}} and the partly built tunnels were left derelict. Before its collapse, the L attempted to sell its interests in the BS for £500,000 to an American consortium headed by Albert L. Johnson, but was unsuccessful. However, it attracted the interest of another American consortium headed by financier Charles Yerkes. After some months of negotiations with the L's liquidator, Yerkes purchased the company for £360,000 plus interest (£ today). He was involved in the development of Chicago's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s. He came to London in 1900 and purchased a number of the struggling underground railway companies, The BS became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) which Yerkes formed to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the District Railway. The UERL was capitalised at £5million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects.|$|E
5|$|The 2009–10 season started poorly, {{with the}} club failing to pay bonuses to former players, as well as £250k owed to Bristol City for the {{transfer}} of Australian international Nick Carle twelve months before. The Football League placed a transfer embargo on the Eagles in early August, which was lifted {{near the end of}} that month. However, it was only another three weeks before a second embargo was put into effect, this time due to an <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion</b> of a transfer fee owed to Ipswich Town for Alan Lee. The financial problems came to a head at the end of January when the club was placed into administration by creditor Agilo Finance, and Brendan Guilfoyle took over the running of the club. Victor Moses departed for Wigan Athletic days later, and Neil Warnock left one month later to take over at Queens Park Rangers. Paul Hart was brought in on a temporary basis to keep the Eagles up, with Dougie Freedman and John Pemberton both returning to the club they played for as assistant and coach respectively. Before administration, the Eagles appeared to be building towards a run for the play-offs, but the ten-point deduction for going into administration turned the season into a battle against relegation. Survival was only achieved on the final day, with a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, who went down to League One instead of Palace. Following the end of the season, Freedman took over as caretaker manager and the club emerged from administration owned by a consortium of wealthy fans, CPFC 2010.|$|E

5000|$|On May 26, 2004, Grasso {{responded with}} a counter-suit against the Exchange and its {{chairman}} John Reed. The counterclaim was twofold; It sought restitution of <b>unpaid</b> <b>portions</b> of his retirement package and further accused certain individuals at the Exchange of [...] "besmirching his name". Grasso went on to place a 1,500-word op-ed article in the Wall Street Journal detailing this counter-suit {{as well as his}} grievances against Spitzer.|$|R
25|$|Complicating {{the story}} {{were reports that}} Lowe had blackmailed the team's {{management}} with publicly revealing {{the fact that he}} had been sent to see Garcia del Moral, demanding the <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion</b> from his 2010 contract (which was withheld due to Lowe riding with the equipment for his presumed 2011 team, Pegasus, while still under contract to Garmin). Lowe's lawyer later refuted the blackmail claims, but Lowe bringing up the matter is the reason, per Vaughters, why White was fired for an incident which took place nearly two years prior.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{there was}} {{initially}} a widespread {{belief that a}} corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its shares only partly paid, as where shares are partly paid, the investor would be liable {{for the remainder of}} the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866–1867) and the Long Depression (1873–1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion</b> of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{borrower}} makes a Pay-Option ARM payment that is {{less than}} the accruing interest, there is [...] "negative amortization", which means that the <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion</b> of the accruing interest is added to the outstanding principal balance. For example, if the borrower makes a minimum payment of $1,000 and the ARM has accrued monthly interest of $1,500, $500 will be added to the borrower's loan balance. Moreover, the next month's interest-only payment will be calculated using the new, higher principal balance.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson in 1996 chaired {{a special}} {{committee}} examining tort reform. [...] The resulting bill, which passed the Senate, would, {{in the words}} of The Columbus Dispatch, [...] "cap noneconomic and punitive damages, impose additional time limits for filing lawsuits and protect defendants in multidefendant cases from being liable for <b>unpaid</b> <b>portions</b> of a judgment." [...] The minority party was unhappy, the paper reported, [...] "Democrats blasted Republicans, saying they were catering to business {{at the expense of the}} victims of their negligence." [...] Senator Jeffrey D. Johnson, a Cleveland Democrat, said [...] "Somewhere along the way we have shifted away from concern for the victim to concern for business," [...] but Johnson defended the legislation. [...] "What we've done is tried to strike a balance. [...] Lawsuit abuse threatens to close the doors of many small businesses in our state." ...|$|R
50|$|Under the Act, {{shareholders}} {{were still}} liable directly to creditors, for the <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion</b> of their shares. The modern principle that shareholders {{are liable to}} the corporation was introduced by the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844.|$|E

50|$|However, {{there was}} still no limited {{liability}} and company members could still be held responsible for unlimited losses by the company. The next, crucial development, then, was the Limited Liability Act 1855, passed {{at the behest of the}} then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Robert Lowe. This allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company - shareholders were still liable directly to creditors, but just for the <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion</b> of their shares. (The principle that shareholders are liable to the corporation had been introduced in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844).|$|E

5000|$|It {{is further}} {{based on a}} hadith in which Muhammad instructs a man to agree to his wife's wish of divorce if she gives back a garden {{received}} from him {{as part of her}} mahr. [...] A khul' is concluded when the couple agrees to a divorce in exchange for a monetary compensation paid by the wife, which cannot exceed the value of the mahr she had received, and is generally a smaller sum or involves forfeiting the still <b>unpaid</b> <b>portion.</b> [...] Hanafis and Malikis do not require a compensation paid by the wife. The divorce is final and irrevocable, effective when the contract is concluded. [...] The couple cannot reconcile during the waiting period, defined {{as in the case of}} talaq, but the husband is required to pay maintenance during its term, unless the requirement is waived by the contract. As in the case of talaq, remarriage is possible until a khul' is concluded for a third time. If the husband pressures his wife to agree to khul' instead of pronouncing talaq, which would let him avoid attendant financial responsibilities, the divorce is considered to be invalid. Like talaq, khulʿ takes place out of court.|$|E
