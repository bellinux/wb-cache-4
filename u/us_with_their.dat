Bryzak writes that [...] "standing up for their faith in Life and Hope, Antestor received serious death threats during this time {{from some of the}} major bands and key players of the scene." [...] When asked if the band ever played with other groups in the black metal scene, Antestor said in a 2000 interview with Tcu zine: [...] "We played with some early form of the band Old Man's Child once. Apparently they expressed their opinion of <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> legs {{and walked out of the}} venue during our set. It was their way of saying 'screw you Christians.'" [...] In the liner notes of Martyrium, Antestor corresponds in a slightly bitter tone: [...] "For those of you who despised us, disbelieved in us and misplaced your anger upon us, may God have mercy on your poor souls!" ...|$|E
500|$|Washington would {{normally}} have assigned {{the duties of}} advance guard to Daniel Morgan and his riflemen, but he had detached these to assist Horatio Gates {{in the defense of}} the Hudson River Valley against the advance of General John Burgoyne. [...] Since they were unavailable, he organized a light infantry corps consisting of 700 picked men from Continental Army regiments (including future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, who would go on to fight in the coming battle) and about 1,000 Pennsylvania and Delaware militia, and placed them under the command of Brigadier General William Maxwell. [...] These troops occupied Iron Hill and Cooch's Bridge. General Nathanael Greene advocated moving the entire Continental Army to this position, believing the Christina River to be a more defensible point, but Washington declined, instead ordering [...] Maxwell to monitor British movements and slow its advance {{while the rest of the}} army fortified the Red Clay Creek and Wilmington. [...] Maxwell's men were encamped on either side of the road leading south from Cooch's Bridge toward Aiken's Tavern (present-day Glasgow, Delaware) in a series of small camps designed to facilitate ambushes. [...] On August 28, Washington, atop Iron Hill, and Howe, on Gray's Hill, observed each other as they took stock of the enemy's position; one of the Hessian generals wrote, [...] "These gentlemen observed <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> glasses as carefully as we observed them. [...] Those of our officers who know Washington well, maintained that the man in the plain coat was Washington." ...|$|E
