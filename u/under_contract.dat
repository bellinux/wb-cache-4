30|$|As {{explained}} in Section  2.1, one {{important source of}} wage rigidities in France lies {{in the type of}} job contracts. Being less protected and more subject to labor turnover, the population of native workers <b>under</b> fixed-term <b>contracts</b> should have a wage structure that is less rigid than those <b>under</b> indefinite-term <b>contracts.</b> Thus, an immigrant-induced increase in labor supply should reduce the wage of competing native workers <b>under</b> fixed-term <b>contracts.</b> The employment reaction of the native population <b>under</b> fixed-term <b>contracts</b> should then depend on their labor supply elasticity.|$|R

30|$|The {{negative}} wage {{reaction of}} native workers <b>under</b> fixed-term <b>contracts</b> due to immigration {{is consistent with}} the IV estimates presented in column (2): immigration has a negative impact on the fraction of time worked by native workers <b>under</b> fixed-term <b>contracts.</b> As immigration decreases monthly wages, native workers tend to respond at the intensive margin by reducing their hours of work. However, I find that immigration does not reduce the employment of competing natives <b>under</b> fixed-term <b>contracts</b> (the estimated coefficients in columns (3) and (4) are insignificant and have moreover an unexpected sign). This result suggests that the labor supply of natives <b>under</b> fixed-term <b>contracts</b> is not responsive to wages at the extensive margin—i.e., native workers <b>under</b> fixed-term <b>contracts</b> prefer to reduce their number of hours worked rather than to leave their jobs after wage reductions.|$|R
