The album's story was inspired by Petrucci's love of fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, as well as his observations on the role of technology in modern-day society. In an interview with Billboard, he explained, “I was thinking of all of the things now that people <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> they don’t do anymore because they’re automated or done by robots: lots of jobs, self-driving cars coming right around the corner ...

Given the lack of studies about self-regulation and tobacco use in Portuguese context, this paper aims to present the results of the confirmatory factor analysis of the Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire (Carey, Neal & Collins, 2004) in our population, exploring the role of self-regulation in tobacco <b>use.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> the SSRQ and a socio-demographic questionnaire was administered to a sample of 390 adolescents, mostly females (n= 228, 59. 2 %), with ages ranging from 15 and 18 years old (M= 16. 05, SD=. 865). Results allow us to find a good fit model with good reliability of the SSRQ. Descriptive statistics and differential studies allow us to find differences in impulse control according gender and a negative correlation with age.

In terms of negative priming, this paper builds {{on the work of}} Smith (1995, 2003). A negative prime is an example solution to a task that incorporates undesirable features, and is given to participants before they begin the task. In particular, attention is paid to Smith’s “coffee cup ” paradigm, where participants asked to design as original a spill-proof coffee cup as they can will incorporate many basic features of the example which they are given, even if those features are detrimental to the function of the cup. Work on time pressure in various contexts is reviewed, as well as the cognitive load imposed by time pressure. Expected conclusions include main effects of time pressure and negative priming, and an interaction demonstrating a different effect of negative priming when time pressure is involved. Simply stated, time pressure leaves less time for participants to overcome the effect of negative priming, whatever specific strategy they <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Actual results were significant interactions of the two variables for originality and quality/clarity, and...|$|R

60|$|It was {{not till}} our hero reached Paris, {{on his return}} from the distant East, that the rumor I have just {{mentioned}} acquired an appreciable consistency. Here, indeed, it took the shape of authentic information. Among a number of delayed letters which had been awaiting him at his banker's he found a communication from Gordon Wright. During the previous year or two his correspondence with this trusted--and trusting--friend had not been frequent, and Bernard had received little direct news of him. Three or four short letters had overtaken him in his wanderings--letters as cordial, to all appearance, if not as voluminous, as the punctual missives of an earlier time. Bernard {{made a point of}} satisfying himself that they were as cordial; he weighed them in the scales of impartial suspicion. It seemed to him on the whole that there was no relaxation of Gordon's epistolary tone. If he wrote less often than he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> was a thing that very commonly happened as men grew older. The closest intimacies, moreover, had phases and seasons, intermissions and revivals, and even if his friend had, in fact, averted his countenance from him, this was simply the accomplishment of a periodical revolution which would bring them in due order face to face again. Bernard made a point, himself, of writing tolerably often and writing always in the friendliest tone. He made it a matter of conscience--he liked to feel that he was treating Gordon generously, and not demanding an eye for an eye. The letter he found in Paris was so short that I may give it entire.|$|E

When, on the contrary, she saw him pass the summit and proceed rapidly down a long and steep incline, she was seized, first with surprise, secondly with indignation, and lastly with alarm. She ran {{to the top of the}} hill and shouted, but he never turned his head. She watched him disappear into a wood a mile and a half distant, and then sat down and cried. They had had a slight difference that morning, and she wondered if he had taken it seriously and intended desertion. She had no money; she knew no Dutch. People passed, and seemed sorry for her; she tried to make them understand what had happened. They gathered that she had lost something, but could not grasp what. They took her to the nearest village, and found a policeman for her. He concluded from her pantomime that some man had stolen her bicycle. They put the telegraph into operation, and discovered in a village four miles off an unfortunate boy riding a lady's machine of an obsolete pattern. They brought him to her in a cart, but as she did not appear to want either him or his bicycle they let him go again, and resigned themselves to bewilderment.|$|E

In this project, two clustering algorithms are studied and numerically compared with various data sets. The first one is the K-means clustering which starts with initial roughly-guessed clusters, tries to classify some data points into one cluster, and iteratively repeats until converges. The second algorithm is called Fast Search and Find of Density Peaks (FSDP), which is able to automatically detect the correct number of clusters according to the inherent property of its decision graph. It is based on the following assumptions: 1) the viii cluster centers have higher density than their neighbor data points; 2) the distance between the cluster center and any data points with higher local density is relatively large. Its decision graph is a graphic and intuitive expression for the clustering. One may get more or fewer clusters, by setting smaller or larger thresholds. The two algorithms are described in the following chapters. They are implemented in Java. To compare how well they perform on four milestone data sets, we use two metrics: Entropy and Purity. The results demonstrate that Kmeans clustering is faster, while the FSDP is more accurate...|$|R
