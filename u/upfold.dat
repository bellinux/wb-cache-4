25|$|Charles <b>Upfold</b> {{was born}} in Grove Street, Walworth Common, (both now gone), Surrey (today Walworth, London), then a prosperous middle-class district. His father, John <b>Upfold,</b> was a fellmonger. Charles was baptised in Sir John Soane's new St.Peter's Church of England at Walworth, on 7 January 1835. An {{excellent}} photograph of this splendid church {{can be found on}} page 206 of London's Churches by Christopher Hibbert.|$|E
25|$|A {{very long}} {{street in the}} suburb of Mayfield is named <b>Upfold</b> Street after the great man himself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Upfold</b> and his wife, Sarah Ann Temperance (née Blundell) (b. 1843, Finchley Common, - d.1921, Cronulla, Sydney) had ten children: {{four sons}} and six daughters.|$|E
5000|$|On August 23, 1865, Talbot {{was elected}} Assistant Bishop of Indiana, where {{he began his}} duties that October. [...] Due to diocesan bishop George <b>Upfold’s</b> feeble health, he acted as the virtual {{executive}} head of the diocese until <b>Upfold’s</b> death in 1872. [...] He took over as diocesan bishop on August 26, 1872. [...] He served in this capacity {{until his death in}} 1883.|$|R
50|$|The sediments {{have since}} been upturned, <b>upfolded</b> (forming anticlines), downfolded (forming synclines) and folded back onto {{themselves}} (forming recumbent folds).|$|R
25|$|Following {{his death}} in Sydney, the <b>Upfolds</b> were bought out by Lever Bros who were also busy {{acquiring}} the paid up capital of Kitchen & Co., of Melbourne, Victoria, who also had {{a stake in the}} Sydney Soap & Candle Co. This new amalgamated firm became Lever & Kitchen.|$|R
25|$|Charles <b>Upfold</b> built a large {{mansion on}} a piece of land in Crebert Street, North Waratah (now Mayfield), given to him by his friend John Scholey. It was later sold to the famous biscuit {{manufacturer}} William Arnott who sold it in 1898 to Isaac Winn, owner of the big Newcastle department store. It is today a home for the aged, owned by the Methodist Church. Charles <b>Upfold</b> subsequently purchased a small estate near Raymond Terrace, containing extensive vineyards, where he built another fine country residence.|$|E

25|$|By 1873 Charles <b>Upfold</b> was an Alderman of {{the newly}} {{incorporated}} Municipality of Wickham, a position he held for some years as evidenced by his further nomination for the Tighe's Hill Ward published in the Newcastle Morning Herald on 21 January 1888.|$|E
50|$|Four {{variants}} of the TOZ-194 shotgun {{are available on}} the market: the TOZ-194M with sole pistol grip; the TOZ-194-01M with pistol grip and <b>upfolding</b> metal stock, and muzzle adapters available for tactical applications; the TOZ-194-02M and TOZ-194-03M, both with standard fixed stock, the latter one also available with muzzle adapter.|$|R
50|$|Sideling Hill is a {{syncline}} mountain, in {{a region}} of downward-folded (synclinal) rock strata between two <b>upfolded</b> anticlines. The ridge is capped by an erosion-resistant conglomerate and sandstone of Mississippian (early Carboniferous) geologic age, the Purslane Sandstone of the Pocono Formation. The ridge's slopes are formed of much more easily eroded kinds of rock, including the Devonian-Mississippian Rockwell Formation, with long, narrow valleys paralleling the ridge on either side.|$|R
5000|$|The Saddle Mountains {{consists}} of an <b>upfolded</b> anticline ridge of basalt in Grant County of central Washington state. The ridge, reaching to 2,700 feet, terminates in the east south of Othello, Washington near {{the foot of the}} Drumheller Channels. It continues to the west where it is broken at Sentinel Gap (a water gap through which the Columbia River passes) before ending {{in the foothills of the}} Cascade Mountains.|$|R
25|$|Charles <b>Upfold</b> {{served his}} {{apprenticeship}} as a soap maker with John Knight & Co. at their Wapping soapworks in London, {{just across the}} river from the parishes where Charles's father resided and worked. Knight's Castile soap is still sold today. His sister, Eliza, married John Knight junior. Charles was later a Director of Knights.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{also with}} his civic duties, and on 26 February 1900 Charles <b>Upfold</b> laid the Foundation Stone of the Tighe's Hill School of Arts, Newcastle. The stone remains in situ today. He {{was involved in}} the Victoria Theatre Company which erected, in 1890, Newcastle's first theatre of an international standard. For many years he was {{also a member of the}} committee of the Newcastle Jockey Club. He was also a magistrate.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 Charles <b>Upfold</b> {{was rapidly}} {{expanding}} his industrial base, having purchased further land at Newcastle, {{this time from}} Peter Crebert, a wine merchant, whose daughter Elizabeth would later marry Charles's eldest son, John. Upfold's company called for tenders for {{the building of a}} new works costing £50,000, and the installation of machinery valued at a further £83,000, on a twenty two acres site at Port Waratah, close to the Ferndale Colliery at Tighe's Hill, whence cheap coal was expected. The soap making equipment was the 'newest American' but English manufacturers had supplied the candle making plant. These works were the largest in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Levers gained {{full control}} & dropped the 'Kitchen' altogether. With {{the decline in}} candle-making, the Sino-Japanese war (much of Charles <b>Upfold's</b> exports went to China - he had {{warehouses}} in Canton and his son Robert spoke Cantonese), coupled with the now ageing plant, the Newcastle factory was closed down just before World War II, a great blow to the city. A new factory for the Australian Wire Rope Works was built upon its site.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{rocks are}} hard, grey, often shelly, Carboniferous limestones. These were {{laid down in}} a warm, shallow sea during {{the early part of}} the Carboniferous Period when Wales lay just south of the equator. Subsequent earth {{movements}} have folded and fractured the crust, and during the next 100 million years they suffered extensive erosion. These earth movements left the <b>upfolded</b> Carboniferous limestones as an area of high ground, extending through what is now the Vale of Glamorgan.|$|R
50|$|Eldon Hill is {{situated}} in the Peak District National Park in the county of Derbyshire, England four kilometres southwest of the village of Castleton. It is a grass-covered limestone hill which reaches a height of 470 metres (1542 feet). It is primarily pastureland and is used for rough grazing, although {{a large proportion of}} the hill has been lost to limestone quarrying. It lies within the Castleton Site of Special Scientific Interest. Eldon Hill was formed when a bed of pure limestone was squeezed and <b>upfolded</b> by geological forces to form a dome; it is the highest limestone hill north of the River Wye.|$|R
500|$|The {{camouflage}} {{training school}} {{was set up}} at Helwan in November 1941, with the British zoologist Hugh B. Cott as chief instructor; he was a captain. Peter Proud was responsible for ensuring that the training provided was practical and useful. The development wing was commanded by a captain from the Royal West African Frontier Force, A. E. <b>Upfold.</b> The Camouflage Directorate included a training school and a development wing, both based at Helwan, Egypt, {{as well as a}} factory and experimental section. These produced [...] "a stream of new ideas for dummy vehicles, tanks, aircraft and all the other portents of impending battle". Every new device was carefully tested by observation from the air, through collaboration with the Royal Air Force.|$|E
2500|$|In 1877 Charles <b>Upfold</b> {{was back}} in London and visiting {{factories}} in England. The following year the New South Wales Official Post Office Directory, has listed under the now entirely separate heading of [...] "Wickham", [...] "Charles <b>Upfold,</b> soap manufacturer" [...] (p.621). Interestingly, also in Wickham in the same directory were Charles's three brothers-in-law, Albert, James, and John Blundell, who came from Finchley, Middlesex, (north London), and were clearly all working for Charles as their occupations are given as soap-boilers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1895 the Port Waratah works {{employed}} {{over 500}} people. In 1898 his son, Robert Wallace <b>Upfold,</b> now {{manager of the}} soap & candle factory, was married to Clara, daughter of John Scholey, (a local landowner and colliery proprietor from Leeds; described in the 1901 Federal Directory as a [...] "gentleman"). Charles <b>Upfold,</b> the father, is described on the certificate as [...] "Managing Director - Soap Works". Robert had a residence in Woodstock Street, North Waratah, and the 1901 Federal Directory of Newcastle & District records him as a [...] "manufacturer".|$|E
50|$|An inlier {{is an area}} {{of older}} rocks {{surrounded}} by younger rocks. Inliers are typically formed by the erosion of overlying younger rocks to reveal a limited exposure of the older underlying rocks. Faulting or folding may also contribute to the observed outcrop pattern. A classic example from Great Britain is that of the inlier of folded Ordovician and Silurian rocks at Horton in Ribblesdale in North Yorkshire which are surrounded by the younger flat-lying Carboniferous Limestone. The location has long been visited by geology students. Another example from South Wales is the Usk Inlier in Monmouthshire where Silurian age rocks are <b>upfolded</b> amidst Old Red Sandstone rocks of Devonian age.|$|R
50|$|To {{the north}} is Longstone Edge, a {{limestone}} ridge some 1,300 ft in height, on an <b>upfolding</b> of the Derbyshire limestone known as the Longstone Anticline. It has been, and is, intensively quarried for galena, fluorspar, barytes and, more controversially, limestone. Since Longstone Edge is a noted beauty spot and is within the Peak District National Park there is strong local pressure for quarrying to stop altogether. Some of the quarrying is strictly controlled by the Peak District National Park Authority, which has been conducting a lengthy legal battle {{to try to stop}} other quarries that are operating outside the authority's guidelines. Further north is the White Cliff, where the exposed limestone contains fossilised corals.|$|R
5000|$|Fold {{mountains}} {{occur when}} two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened. Since the less dense continental crust [...] "floats" [...] on the denser mantle rocks beneath, {{the weight of}} any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas. Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The <b>upfolds</b> are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding {{there may also be}} recumbent and overturned folds. The Jura Mountains are an example of fold mountains.|$|R
2500|$|That year Charles <b>Upfold</b> {{purchased}} the soap and candle factory of Frederick Nainby at Wickham and Honeysuckle Point, Newcastle, {{and in the}} Newcastle Chronicle of 16 May 1869 there is {{a reference to the}} [...] "Great Northern Soap and Candle Works, proprietor, Charles Upfold." [...] By the following year Upfolds plants were producing 9,420 hundredweight of soap and 600 cwt of candles. By 1872 soap production had increased to 21,000 cwt. Most was exported, much to China. That year <b>Upfold</b> expanded his Australian trading links by establishing a Sydney office at 50 Clarence Street.|$|E
2500|$|The late {{professor}} John Turner wrote: [...] "the {{modern technology}} and large {{scale of the}} Sydney Soap and Candle Company made it the outstanding industrial establishment of its kind. <b>Upfold</b> had wide experience of colonial conditions and constructed his Port Waratah works on recent British and American lines, in a location which gave unequalled access to tallow and coal." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the 6 April 1895 the Newcastle Morning Herald {{carried a}} large article {{entitled}} [...] "Departure of Mr Charles <b>Upfold</b> - Citizen's Send-off". Charles {{was about to}} depart for England, Europe and America, and a large function was given in his honour at the Centennial Hotel in Newcastle, with an impressive guest list of local worthies. [...] He returned from that overseas trip {{at the end of}} September and another large article describing his tour appeared in the same newspaper on 3 October 1895.|$|E
50|$|The {{composition}} of the great tectonic units reflects {{the history of the}} formation of the Alps. The rocks from the Helvetic zone on the north and the Austroalpine nappes - Southern Alps on the south come originally from the European and African continent respectively. The rocks of the Penninic nappes belong to the former area of the Briançonnais microcontinent and the Tethys Ocean. The closure of the latter by subduction under the African plate (Piemont Ocean first and Valais Ocean later) preceded the collision between the two plates and the so-called alpine orogeny. The major thrust fault of the Tectonic Arena Sardona in the eastern Glarus Alps gives a visible illustration of mountain-building processes and was therefore declared a UNESCO World Heritage. Another fine example gives the Alpstein area with several visible <b>upfolds</b> of Helvetic zone material.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basement}} in the Farallon Negro {{area of the}} Sierras Pampeanas are schists and gneisses of {{deep water}} origin with an intruded batholith of Ordovician-Silurian age. This plutonic activity coincided with the collision of South America with eastern North America during that time. The Sierras Pampeanas are formed by several chains of mountains of Proterozoic-Paleozoic age with valleys separating them. During the Pliocene-Pleistocene separate basement blocks were <b>upfolded.</b> [...] These geological patterns {{are similar to the}} Laramide orogeny in North America and may be a general pattern of mountain building over flat subduction. During the Miocene, red beds were deposited in the area forming the El Morterito Formation that reaches a thickness of 200 m. This formation was probably formed in episodic events such as flash floods. Rocks of the Paleozoic basement beneath Farallon Negro contain amphibolite, mica schist, phyllite and quartzite.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to present a {{versatile}} scheme for the computation of optical properties of solids, with particular emphasis on realistic many-body calculations for correlated materials. Geared at the use with localized basis sets, we extend the commonly known lattice "Peierls substitution" approach {{to the case of}} multi-atomic unit cells. We show in how far this generalization can be deployed as an approximation to the full Fermi velocity matrix elements that enter the continuum description of the response of a solid to incident light. We further devise an <b>upfolding</b> scheme to incorporate optical transitions, that involve high energy orbitals that had been downfolded in the underlying many-body calculation of the electronic structure. As an application of the scheme, we present results on a material of longstanding interest, vanadium dioxide, VO 2. Using dynamical mean-field data of both, the metallic and the insulating phase, we calculate the corresponding optical conductivities, elucidate optical transitions and find good agreement with experimental results.

2500|$|In a {{full report}} of John Scholey's funeral the names {{of many of the}} most {{prominent}} attendees are given and it is stated that over 200 telegrams of condolence were received. He was buried in the Church of England division of Sandgate Cemetery, Newcastle. [...] In his Will (proved 8 October 1908) he bequeathed his entire estate to his wife, by whom he had seven daughters, six of whom survived him. His daughter Clara married Robert, son of Charles <b>Upfold,</b> the managing director of the Sydney Soap and Candle Company, [...] "the largest such concern in Australasia". His youngest daughter, Agnes, died a spinster in 1972.|$|E
50|$|<b>Upfold</b> married Sarah Sophia Graves in 1817. They had two daughters, Sophia Bicker <b>Upfold,</b> {{who later}} married Joseph J. Bingham, {{editor of the}} Indiana Daily Sentinel; and Emily L. <b>Upfold,</b> who became the {{librarian}} of the Diocese of Indiana.|$|E
50|$|In December 1849, <b>Upfold</b> {{was elected}} Bishop of Indiana. He was the 50th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated on December 16, 1849 by Bishops Benjamin Bosworth Smith, Charles Pettit McIlvaine, and Jackson Kemper. While bishop, <b>Upfold</b> {{also served as}} rector for St. John's Church in Lafayette, Indiana and Christ Church Cathedral in Indianapolis. By 1855, the Diocese of Indiana had built is status and {{stability}} {{to the point that}} it could financially support the office of bishop, allowing <b>Upfold</b> to concentrate only on his duties as bishop. <b>Upfold</b> received a LL.D. degree from the Western University of Pennsylvania in 1856. In 1857 he moved the seat of the Diocese to Indianapolis where he remained in office until 1872. He served as the sole bishop until 1865 when, crippled by gout, he arranged for the election of a coadjutor bishop.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{there was}} an isthmus across the Strait of Dover. During an earlier glacial maximum, the exit from the North Sea was blocked to the north by an ice dam, and the water flowing out of rivers backed up into a vast lake with {{freshwater}} glacial melt on the bed {{of what is now}} the North Sea. A gently <b>upfolding</b> chalk ridge linking the Weald of Kent and Artois, perhaps some 30 metres (100feet) higher than the current sea level, contained the glacial lake at the Strait of Dover. At some time, probably around 425,000 years ago and again around 225,000 years later the barrier failed [...] or was overtopped, loosing a catastrophic flood that permanently diverted the Rhine into the English Channel and replacing the [...] "Isthmus of Dover" [...] watershed by a much lower watershed running from East Anglia east then southeast to the Hook of Holland and (as at modern sea level) separated Britain from the continent of Europe; a sonar study of the sea bed of the English Channel published in Nature, July 2007, revealed the discovery of unmistakable marks of a megaflood on the English Channel seabed: deeply eroded channels and braided features have left the remnants of streamlined islands among deeply gouged channels where the collapse occurred.|$|R
5000|$|The working {{system of}} the RMb-93 is itself an odd slide-action {{operation}} called [...] "Inverted Cycle", similar in concept to the one used in the South-African Truvelo Armoury Neostead shotgun (the only other mass-produced firearm to be based upon this system). The feeding tube is placed over the barrel rather than under it, and tilts upwards for loading. Once the weapon is loaded, a shell is chambered by pushing the slide forward-then-backward, instead of the standard backward-then-forward motion of the forend found on most pump-action weapons. Having the RMb-93 a fixed breech face and movable barrel, the operation moves the entire barrel assembly. Once a round is fired and another is chambered, the empty shell falls downwards to the ground, pushed by its own weight.The design of the RMb-93 [...] "Rys-K" [...] carries several advantages: the ejection system makes the gun fully ambidextrous, and the magazine located over the barrel gives the shotgun a low center of mass and reduces upward recoil. The main drawback of the overall design stands {{in the fact that}} the weapon has a pistol grip with <b>upfolding</b> metal stock, which when folded finds itself right up the feeding tube. The RMb-93 thus can not be reloaded without extending or removing the stock, a disadvantage if it is being used tactically with a folded stock.|$|R
