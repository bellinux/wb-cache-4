5000|$|According to this paradigm, {{the primary}} force driving an addict's predicament is what Trimpey calls the [...] "addictive voice", which can physiologically be {{understood}} as being related to {{the parts of the}} human brain that control our core survival functions such as hunger, sex, and bowel control.

Most important to recovering addicts is the recognition of this addictive voice, and determination to remain abstinent by constantly reminding themselves of the rational basis of their decision to quit. As time progresses, the recovering addict begins to see the benefits of separating themselves and their rational minds from a bodily impulse that has no regard for responsibility, success, delayed gratification, or moral obligation.|$|R
30|$|A further {{regulatory}} {{alternative is}} offered by the “cut-off criteria” of the EU Regulation on Plant Protection Products [10], which provide for a ban on active substances with particularly hazardous properties, the so-called PBT substances [persistent (P), bio-accumulative (B), and toxic (T)]. A further exclusion criterion is targeting endocrine disruptors. The cut-off criteria represent a very progressive instrument in several pieces of Europe’s chemicals legislation, which is oriented more towards the precautionary principle than other international regulations. These criteria have been introduced by policy-makers and require a paradigm shift in the decision-making process. The decision on an approval or ban should in future only {{be based on the}} <b>undesirable</b> <b>substance</b> properties and not, as previously, on a quantitative risk assessment (i.e., the comparison of the expected environmental exposure concentrations with (eco)toxicological threshold concentrations/doses for the harmful impacts on non-target organisms). Experts justify the hazard-based regulation by referring to the high level of uncertainty in the risk assessment for the targeted hazardous properties. The cut-off criteria provide an impulse to develop and use active substances and PPPs that have lower environmental impacts. However, a practical implementation is currently not possible, because the scientific and technical details of the cut-off criteria have not yet been developed and specified in subordinate regulations. The delays in implementation have been due not least to the massive interventions of the European PPP industry, which categorically rejects hazard-based regulation and demands a return to risk assessment, even for <b>undesirable</b> <b>substance</b> properties [50]. The UBA believes that the cut-off criteria are in principle well suited to improve the protection of the environment against particularly hazardous PPPs. Because of this conviction and in accordance with its responsibilities, UBA is also involved in the discussion about the specification and implementation of the cut-off criteria [51, 52]. One particular challenge {{is that it is not}} always clear from an environmental point of view whether an alternative active substance really is better than the banned active substance it is meant to replace. The same task of comparative assessment applies for PPP approval: The EU regulation provides that a PPP containing so-called substitution candidates (e.g., active substances with two out of three PBT properties) should be replaced by a PPP with a lower environmental impact. The methodology of comparative assessment of the environmental hazard or risks of PPPs is—both from a scientific and regulatory viewpoint—challenging and has not been sufficiently tested so far [53]. However, the general public and users rightly demand that in future the assessment authorities should make increased use of their expertise to provide information about the more environmentally favourable alternatives. It remains to be seen how effective the instrument of comparative assessment will prove in terms of making environmental impacts measurable.|$|R

40|$|Sometimes we {{are better}} off not knowing things. While we often hear that 2 ̆ 2 ignorance is bliss, 2 ̆ 2 {{there has not been}} a {{comprehensive}} consideration in the legal academy of the virtues of ignorance and its regulation. Though the distribution of knowledge, like the distribution of other goods, is affected both directly and indirectly by law, several characteristics of knowledge distinguish it from other kinds of property. Much has been written about the impact of the nonrival and nonexclusive nature of knowledge on its production and distribution. This Article centers around two other attributes of knowledge that combine to create a special kind of problem: (1) its stickiness, meaning that once acquired knowledge may not be abandoned but only fortuitously forgotten, and (2) its capacity to impose substantial disutilities on its holder. If ignorance is a good, then knowledge must be avoided in the first instance. My approach in this initial inquiry is pragmatic. I first consider four examples of knowledge that individuals may desire not to have, namely knowledge of one 2 ̆ 7 s genetic make-up and predispositions, knowledge of one 2 ̆ 7 s HIV status, lenders 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of the race of a borrower, and lawyers 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of the falsity of a client 2 ̆ 7 s proposed testimony or evidence.

I conclude that our decision whether to respect autonomy in making knowledge decisions is affected not only by our operating conception of autonomy but also the category of ignorance interest at issue. In addition, the nature of knowledge impacts our ability to ascertain preferences, our instrumental goals, and our choice of regulatory tools...|$|R
5000|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{a number}} of wine brands have {{switched}} to alternative wine closures such as plastic stoppers, screw caps, or other closures. During 1972 {{more than half of}} the Australian bottled wine went bad due to corking. A great deal of anger and suspicion was directed at Portuguese and Spanish cork suppliers who were suspected of deliberately supplying bad cork to non-EEC wine makers to help prevent cheap imports. Cheaper wine makers developed the aluminium [...] "Spelvin" [...] cap with a polypropylene stopper wad. More expensive wines and carbonated varieties continued to use cork, although much closer attention was paid to the quality. Even so, some high premium makers prefer the Spelvin as it is a guarantee that the wine will be good even after many decades of ageing. Some consumers may have conceptions about screw caps being representative of lower quality wines, due to their cheaper price; however, in Australia, for example, much of the non-sparkling wine production now uses these Spelvin caps as a cork alternative, although some have recently switched back to cork citing issues using screw caps. These alternatives to cork have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, screwtops are generally considered to offer a trichloroanisole (TCA) free seal, but they also reduce the oxygen transfer rate between the bottle and the atmosphere to almost zero, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the wine. TCA is the main documented cause of cork taint in wine. However, some in the wine industry say natural cork stoppers are important because they allow oxygen to interact with wine for proper aging, and are best suited for wines purchased with the intent to age. Stoppers which resemble natural cork very closely can be made by isolating the suberin component of the cork from the undesirable lignin, mixing it with the same substance used for contact lenses and an adhesive, and molding it into a standardized product, free of TCA or other <b>undesirable</b> <b>substances.</b> [...] Composite corks with real cork veneers are used in cheaper wines.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of how to feed the growing world population is very old, but because of the increase of population and possible climate change, currently it has an explosive impact. Plant breeding can be considered as the starting point for the whole human food chain. Therefore, high, stable and highly digestible yields of phytogenic biomass with low external inputs of non-renewable resources, such as water, fuel, arable land, fertilizers, etc.; low emissions of gases with greenhouse potential during cultivation; and high resistance against biotic and abiotic stressors, including adaptation to potential climate change, and a low concentration of <b>undesirable</b> <b>substances</b> in the plants are real challenges for plant breeders in the future. Virtually unlimited resources such as sunlight, nitrogen and carbon dioxide from the air as well as the genetic pool of microbes, plants and animals can be used to breed/develop optimal plants/crops. Biofortification of plants may also be an objective of plants breeders, but it is more important for human nutrition to avoid micronutrient deficiencies. A lower concentration of <b>undesirable</b> <b>substances</b> in the plants can be considered as more important than higher concentrations of micronutrients in plants/feeds. Animal nutritionists have various possibilities for feed additive supplementation to meet animal nutrient requirements. Examples to reduce <b>undesirable</b> <b>substances</b> in feed plants are discussed and shown in the paper. In summary, plant breeding has a large and strategic potential for global feed and food security.

40|$|Legg et al Discrepancies in the {{calibration}} {{of reaction}} rate analysers Many enzyme assays {{are linked to}} the formation or utilisation of NADH so that reaction rates can be monitored at 340 nm. The absorbance spectrum of naphthol green is sufficiently different from that of NADH to render calibration using this <b>substance</b> <b>undesirable,</b> and NADH or the particular chromophore used to monitor the reaction, e. g. p-nitrophenol, should be used. The new calibration procedure confirmed the extent of the disparity between the two instruments noted when performing enzyme analyses and supported the view that the problem was one of instrumentation, possibly electronic in origin. An electronic calibration procedure produced by the company was successful in bringing the instruments back into specification and cured the problem of the disparity between the 0. 05 and 0. 20 absorbance scales. Exactly what is accomplished when electronic calibration is carried out remains uncertain. Certainly such items as the ratio of the two absorbance scales and linearity across the recorder are correctly adjusted during this procedure, but {{the manner in which the}} photocell output is linked to true absorbance is not clear. In the light of the authors’ experience, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that electronic calibration merely succeeded in ensuring that both instruments investigated produced the same result. It may not ensure that the output from an instrument is linked to true absorbance. For this reason, a correction factor may still need to be applied to the results obtained after electronic and absorptiometric calibration has been carried out. It is suggested that results which are within + 5 % of the true absorbance need not be corrected, while instruments operating outside of these limits should have a correction factor applied until they can be serviced and the error corrected. This may well depend on the type of analysis being performed on the instrument. The calibration procedure outlined could be performed at intervals of about six months. It can be adapted to calibrate any other type of reaction rate analyser and has been " used successfully in calibrating both the AKES (MSE Scientifi...|$|R
40|$|The Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act 140 of 1992 (hereinafter the 'Act') makes {{provision}} for the essential crimes pertaining to drugs.

The Act divides drugs into three general categories which are: dependence producing substances; dangerous dependence producing substances; and <b>undesirable</b> dependence producing <b>substances</b> and the specific drugs resorting into each of these categories are listed in Schedule 2 of the Act (Snyman op cit 429). Dealing in drugs is the more serious offence of the two offences concomitantly carrying harsher sentences or penalties (see section 17 (c) and (e) of the Act read with sections 13 (e) and (f); S v Cwele and Another 2013 (1) SACR 478 (SCA); S v Gcoba 2011 (2) SACR 231 (KZP); S v Naidoo 2010 (1) SACR 369 (KZP); S v Mtolo 2009 (1) SACR 443 (O); S v Mlambo 2007 (1) SACR 664 (W); S v Tshabalala 2007 (2) SACR 263 (W); Snyman op cit 431).

The absence of suitable medicines or critical safety and efficacy information, poses significant risks to a particularly vulnerable patient population. The paediatric population is made up {{of a wide range of}} individuals of substantially varied physical size, weight and stage of physiological development. Some commonly used excipients may be unsuitable for use in children; and some dosage forms may be undesirable to the paediatric population. There is a need for a dosage form platform that is designed to meet the needs of the paediatric patient. The dosage form should offer dose flexibility, dose accuracy, afford acceptable taste of <b>undesirable</b> tasting drug <b>substances</b> and be suitable for administration to all paediatric sub groups. To ensure affordability and thus enhance access to medicines for children in developing countries or emerging markets, the dosage form should be simple to manufacture without the need for specialised equipment. Spray-drying was investigated to co-process a functional polymer, hypromellose, with a model drug substance, paracetamol, to enhance the functionality of the polymer and to taste mask the paracetamol. Though hypromellose was successfully spray-dried it was not possible to spray-dry hypromellose with paracetamol. The viscosity of aqueous solutions of hypromellose played a key role in determining the grade and concentration of hypromellose that could be successfully spray-dried. Temperature was used to reduce viscosity of hypromellose solutions but careful temperature control is required to avoid reaching the gelation temperature of the hypromellose. The effect of temperature on aqueous hydroxyl propylcellulose (HPC) solutions showed that heating causes a reduction in solubility of HPC in water which results in its precipitation and the formation of liquid crystals. Consequently, the aqueous HPC solutions appear ‘cloudy’ and their viscosity decreases. The temperature at which these changes occur is referred to as the ‘cloud-point’. The effect of temperature on aqueous HPC solutions containing drug is dependent on the properties of the drug. Paracetamol decreased the temperatures of dehydration and onset of precipitation and ranitidine hydrochloride increased the temperatures of dehydration and precipitation. This is probably associated with a salting in effect. HPC was used to form films which disintegrate in < 30 seconds but are able to retard dissolution rate of paracetamol. HPC may be used to form films which meet the pharmacopoeial content uniformity criteria typically applied to oral dosage forms. HPC films have application for administering drugs to paediatric or geriatric patients by disintegrating in the mouth and so overcoming swallowing difficulties; potentially providing taste masking and aiding absorption across the oral cavity. HPC films offer significant benefits to the paediatric population. The manufacturing process is simple and transportation is easy as secondary packs are likely to be less bulky than currently used for tablets. The films may also be suitable for administering combinations of drugs in the same dosage form by layering or by combining the drugs at the HPC solution stage. For these reasons the HPC films may have particular application for diseases in the developing world and meet many requirements associated with WHO and other global regulatory guidelines...|$|R
