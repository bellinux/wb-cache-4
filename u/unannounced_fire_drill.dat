40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} influence of stairwell width on velocity and specific flow of occupants descending stairs during building evacuations. It examines data collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology taken from eight different stairwells during <b>unannounced</b> <b>fire</b> <b>drills</b> in four buildings. Based on the raw data given by NIST the velocity, density, and specific flow were calculated for each occupant on every floor in which data was collected. Though data was noisy, results demonstrate {{that there is a}} linear trend between density of occupants in a stairwell and the velocity they descend at. There is also a parabolic trend between density and specific flow rate of occupants on stairs. While no direct correlation was found, stairwell width does seem to influence the speed and specific flow of occupants since the stairwell with the smallest effective width found occupants traveling slower. As well, the correlations in the SFPE Handbook, developed by Nelson and Mowrer concerning velocity and specific flow rate, were found to be an upper limit on the data that was analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of group emergency fire-safety skills training for blind adolescents was examined. Eight subjects {{in a residential}} school were trained to respond to an emergency fire situation under simulated conditions. The intervention consisted of instructions, explicit corrective feedback, behavior rehearsal, social and token reinforcement, and verbal and behavioral reviews. Participants 2 ̆ 7 fire-emergency responses were assessed in simulated emergency situations as well as during <b>unannounced</b> nighttime <b>fire</b> <b>drills.</b> A multiple-baseline analysis across subjects showed {{high levels of skill}} acquisition in all subjects during emergency simulations. Further, behaviors generalized to actual <b>fire</b> <b>drills</b> in six of the eight subjects. Results are discussed in terms of: (1) the cost-effectiveness of the group treatment strategy, and (2) the need for additional research in emergency safety skills with the visually handicapped. Limitations of the present methodology are indicated; suggestions for directions future investigations might take are offered...|$|R
40|$|Findings {{in earlier}} studies on fire {{evacuation}} and way finding suggest that building features have influence on evacuation behaviour. For example, way finding {{is believed to}} be strongly dependent on the lay-out of the building and seems to be hardly dependent on (escape) route signs. Though some aspects are investigated, it is not discussed at great length. In particular their is little insight in how persons find their escape route, and how this process can be supported with lay-out and design measures has been hardly examined. Thus, there is need for insight in the decision-making processes which evacuees pass through. In this paper are the results presented of 83 evacuation experiments in a hotel building at night. The main focus of the study is on way finding during fire evacuation. In the evacuation experiments we investigated the possible influence of smoke and low placed exit signs on the human fire response performance. The experiments are conducted with a traditional research method, namely the registration and evaluation of <b>unannounced</b> <b>fire</b> <b>drills.</b> The study is conducted as part of the validation of a new research method that makes use of serious gaming. The results of the study suggest that smoke has influence on the route choice: when no smoke is perceptible the majority of the participants escape via the main exit and when smoke blocks the route towards the main exit, the majority of the participants escape via the fire exit. Furthermore, low placed exit signs appear to have a positive influence {{on the use of the}} nearest fire exit...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>drill</b> {{is one of}} {{the steps}} taken to {{mitigate}} the risk trapped in a building during outbreak of fire. Hence, it is very important for every building to practice <b>fire</b> <b>drill,</b> especially high-rise building. Referring to Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia(BOMBA), high-rise building had a higher risk compared to other type of buildings. However, there might be problems arise to practice <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> especially in high-rise building. This research intends to study on <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> procedure and identify any possible common problems arises when practicing <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> in high-rise building in Kuala Lumpur. Information was gained through regulations and guidelines associated with <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> procedure and also parties involved in the practice. Besides, a survey is done for awareness of occupants in high-rise building on <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> practice. For the case study, three high-rise building are selected in Kuala Lumpur based on specific criteria. Analysis for this research comprises of comparative and descriptive approach as well as statistical analysis which are documented based on case studies and questionnaire survey. The findings indicates that there is no standardized procedure in <b>fire</b> <b>drill,</b> while the most common problems that can be seen in practicing <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> are lack of commitment among occupants, lack of information on <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> and output on weaknesses after <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> been practiced...|$|R
