5|$|The Islamic Andalusi philosopher Averroes or Ibn Rushd (11261198) {{criticized the}} {{argument}} on its methodology. Averroes, an avid Aristotelian, argued that God's existence {{has to be}} shown {{on the basis of}} the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on physics, and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful. Other Muslim philosophers such as Al-Ghazali (10581111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed incompatible with God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary. Al-Ghazali disputed this as incompatible with the concept of God's <b>untrammelled</b> free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's Asharite theology. He further argued that God's free choice can be shown by the arbitrary nature of the exact size of the universe or the time of its creation.|$|E
5|$|While still {{embroiled in}} his {{conflict}} with Longchamp, Geoffrey began feuding with Hugh du Puiset, probably over Geoffrey's authority in Puiset's diocese of Durham, {{one of those}} subject to York. The dispute dragged on for years, with many appeals to Rome and the king. York had been vacant for several years, and Puiset had grown used to having <b>untrammelled</b> authority in the northern archdiocese. After Geoffrey's consecration, he summoned Puiset to a provincial synod in late September 1191, at which the bishop was charged with various irregularities. Puiset appealed to Rome and refused to attend the synod, and was excommunicated in December by Geoffrey. An attempt in March 1192 by Queen Eleanor and Hubert Walter to settle the issue came to nothing when Geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from Puiset, who in turn demanded an admission from Geoffrey that the excommunication had been unjust. Further appeals to Rome led to an eventual settlement in October 1192, when the bishop finally acknowledged Geoffrey's authority over Durham.|$|E
25|$|Annibale {{meanwhile}} developed {{hundreds of}} preparatory sketches {{for the major}} work, wherein he led a team painting frescoes on {{the ceiling of the}} grand salon with the secular quadri riportati of The Loves of the Gods, or as the biographer Giovanni Bellori described it, Human Love governed by Celestial Love. Although the ceiling is riotously rich in illusionistic elements, the narratives are framed in the restrained classicism of High Renaissance decoration, drawing inspiration from, yet more immediate and intimate, than Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling as well as Raphael's Vatican Logge and Villa Farnesina frescoes. His work would later inspire the <b>untrammelled</b> stream of Baroque illusionism and energy that would emerge in the grand frescoes of Cortona, Lanfranco, and in later decades Andrea Pozzo and Gaulli.|$|E

25|$|The President, however, {{does not}} have the final say over certain decisions, as Parliament may {{override}} his veto with a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of all the elected MPs. For instance, this mechanism applies if the President vetoes key civil service appointments or withholds assent to bills that are likely to draw on the nation's past reserves. A prerequisite for the exercise of the override mechanism is that the President must have disagreed with the recommendation of the Council of Presidential Advisers, which he is required consult before exercising these powers. The override mechanism shows that the President's discretionary powers pose no obstacle to a government which continues to enjoy <b>untrammelled</b> power so long as it controls a clear two-thirds parliamentary majority. The weaker the Government is, the stronger the presidential check is; and the stronger the Government, the weaker the presidential blocking mechanism.|$|E
500|$|Darwinism {{became a}} {{movement}} covering {{a wide range}} of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 Lyell's Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then The Naturalist on the River Amazons by Henry Walter Bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection. Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the Royal Society's Copley Medal, awarded on 3 November 1864. That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential [...] "X Club" [...] devoted to [...] "science, pure and free, <b>untrammelled</b> by religious dogmas". By {{the end of the decade}} most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin's view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.|$|E

2500|$|The X Club was {{a dining}} club of nine men who {{supported}} the theories of natural selection and academic liberalism in late 19th-century England. Thomas Henry Huxley was the initiator: he called the first meeting for 3 November 1864. The club met in London once a month—except in July, August and September—from November 1864 until March 1893, and its members {{are believed to have}} wielded much influence over scientific thought. The members of the club were George Busk, Edward Frankland, Thomas Archer Hirst, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas Henry Huxley, John Lubbock, Herbert Spencer, William Spottiswoode, and John Tyndall, united by a [...] "devotion to science, pure and free, <b>untrammelled</b> by religious dogmas." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1864, Huxley {{wrote to}} Hooker and {{explained}} that he feared he and his group of friends, the other men of the social network, would drift apart and lose contact. He proposed {{the creation of a}} club that would serve to maintain social ties among the members of the network, and Hooker readily agreed. Huxley always insisted that sociability was the only purpose of the club, but others in the club, most notably Hirst, claimed that the founding members had other intentions. In his description of the first meeting, Hirst wrote that what brought the men together was actually a [...] "devotion to science, pure and free, <b>untrammelled</b> by religious dogmas," [...] and he predicted that situations would arise when their concerted efforts would be of great use.|$|E
2500|$|In Sense and Sensibility, for example, Elinor and Marianne {{represent}} [...] "the {{view of the}} nature-nurture dichotomy usually {{adopted by}} conservatives", that is, [...] "on the one hand, Marianne's way is subjective, intuitive, implying confidence in the natural goodness of human nature when <b>untrammelled</b> by convention. Her view is corrected by the more cautious orthodoxy of Elinor, who mistrusts her own desires, and requires even her reason to seek the support of objective evidence." [...] Duckworth argues that Austen's heroines aim [...] "to support and maintain an inherited structure of values and behavior", often with an explicit Christian stoicism. In his interpretation, Austen's heroines' morality is based in religious principle and duty to society. Austen's novels portray [...] "society" [...] positively, and her novels end with hero and heroine united {{in the company of}} true friends, society [...] "reaffirmed around the central union, and the social fragmentation that initially threatened... reconstituted through individual commitment into a new whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|Austen's {{early works}} are often {{structured}} around {{a pair of}} characters. For example, Sense and Sensibility is a didactic novel based on {{the contrast between the}} beliefs and conduct of two heroines, a novel format that was particularly fashionable in the 1790s and exemplified by Edgeworth's Letters of Julia and Caroline and Elizabeth Inchbald's Nature and Art. Because circulating libraries often used catalogues that only listed a novel's name, Austen chose titles that would have resonance for her readers; abstract comparisons like [...] "sense and sensibility" [...] were part of a moralistic tradition and eponymous heroine names were part of a new romantic novel tradition. Elinor, representing [...] "sense", and Marianne, representing [...] "sensibility", articulate a contrast [...] "between two modes of perception", according to Butler. [...] "Marianne's way is subjective, intuitive, implying confidence in the natural goodness of human nature when <b>untrammelled</b> by convention. Her view is corrected by the more cautious orthodoxy of Elinor, who mistrusts her own desires, and requires even her reason to seek the support of objective evidence." [...] However, other critics have argued that the contrast between the two characters is not a strict binary. For example, Marianne reasonably discusses propriety and Elinor passionately loves Edward.|$|E

2500|$|Riina's {{tenure as}} 'boss of bosses' {{was marked by}} {{changing}} public attitudes to organised crime. Traditionally, Sicilians did not acknowledge {{the existence of the}} Mafia as a coherent organised group, assertions to the contrary by other Italians were often seen as 'attacks from the north'. This attitude was enabled by the traditional-minded previous bosses. Prior to Riina' faction becoming dominant the Sicilian Mafia were based in Palermo where they controlled large numbers of votes, enabling mutually beneficial relationships with local political figures such as mayors of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino and Salvatore Lima. Ciancimino, who was born in Corleone, corruptly allowed <b>untrammelled</b> property development on a famous valley known as [...] "Conca d'Oro" [...] (Golden Bowl), amassing a vast fortune in the process. Lima granted a valuable monopoly concession on tax collection to mafioso businessman Ignazio Salvo, and was instrumental in Rome-based Giulio Andreotti becoming a force in national politics. In his turn Salvo acted as financier to Andreotti. Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, ruled in October 2004 that Andreotti had [...] "friendly and even direct ties" [...] with Stefano Bontade and Tano Badalamenti, bosses in the so-called moderate wing of Cosa Nostra that Riina had supplanted in the Second Mafia War.|$|E
