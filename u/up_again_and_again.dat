Smith {{dismissed the}} White Horse Prophecy as a [...] "ridiculous story ... {{and a lot}} of trash that has been circulated about ... by two of our brethren who put together some broken sentences from [...] that they may have heard from time to time". In his 1966 book Mormon Doctrine, LDS theologian (and, later, apostle) Bruce R. McConkie wrote that [...] "From time to time, accounts of various supposed visions, revelations, and prophecies are spread forth by and among the Latter-day Saints, who should know better than to believe or spread such false information. One of these false and deceptive documents that has cropped <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> for over a century is the so-called White Horse Prophecy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} [...] "Barron {{found that}} it was probable the guns were kept at a farm at Glenanne belonging to James Mitchell, an RUC reservist ... from which a group of paramilitaries and members of the security forces ... carried out the massacres at Dublin and Monaghan.... The chain was unbroken because the perpetrators of these attacks weren't caught, or investigations were haphazard, or charges were dropped, or light or suspended sentences were given. The same individuals turn <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> but the links weren't noted. Some of the perpetrators weren't prosecuted despite evidence against them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The RUC {{furnished}} the Gardaí with {{a report}} that attempted to undermine Weir's evidence. Barron found this RUC report to be highly inaccurate and lacking credibility. The Barron Inquiry believes that Weir’s evidence is credible, and [...] "agrees with the view of An Garda Síochána that Weir's allegations regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings must be treated with the utmost seriousness".Connolly, Frank (16 November 2006) , Village The Barron Inquiry found evidence to support Weir's claims. This included a chain of ballistics history linking the same weapons {{to many of the}} attacks Weir outlined. Journalist Susan McKay noted that [...] "The same individuals turn <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> but the links weren't noted. Some of the perpetrators weren't prosecuted despite evidence against them".|$|E

6000|$|As a {{historical}} romance [...] "Darnley" [...] {{is a book}} {{that can be taken}} [...] <b>up</b> pleasurably <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> for there is about it that [...] subtle charm which those who are strangers to the works of G.

2500|$|One {{problem that}} came <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> between 1930 and 1933 was the {{variation}} {{in the number of}} singers {{and the quality of the}} choir: Ulbrich was able to keep some of the members of the choir from leaving and train them for some promising performances, but the best singers quickly fell victim to their voices changing and had to leave; meanwhile, Ulbrich needed to recruit and train new boys. Furthermore, Schola Cantorum Basiliensis planned to form a children's choir, which meant further competition. For this reason, an [...] "educational department" [...] (now known as [...] "Choir 101") was created to avoid any further reduction in quality. Talented singers then still came into the choir right away, and the others went through the educational department. A further improvement came in 1933 with vocal training, for which they were able to employ Helene Sandreuter. The rehearsal space was changed from the expensive location in Nadelberg to the church. At the end of the year, Jakob Staehelin stepped down as president due to having to move from Basel; his cousin Hans Staehelin took over his position.|$|E

60|$|I {{think there}} is also wanting a law against twice breaking, and that all second {{commissions}} should have some penalty upon the bankrupt, and a third a farther penalty, and if the fourth brought the man to the gallows, {{it could not be}} thought hard; for he that has set up <b>and</b> broke, <b>and</b> set <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> broke <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> the like, a third time, I think merits to be hanged, if he pretends to venture any more.|$|R
50|$|However, South Park {{realizes that}} the other teams also want out and have {{actually}} trained to lose games. The South Park Cows end <b>up</b> winning <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> against opponents whose efforts at throwing games are more successful, and eventually, {{they get to the}} state championship game. To their horror, they realize that if they win that game, their season will start over on the national circuit, meaning they will have to play baseball all summer.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes I {{have succeeded}} and {{sometimes}} I have failed, but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once {{said about the}} man in the arena, [...] "whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs <b>and</b> comes <b>up</b> short <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> because there is not effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deed, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly".|$|R

I knocked down two men. After the fourth fall (there was not much bloodshed--more brutal rushing and throwing--for nobody could use their weapons), after the fourth fall, I say, I got up like a devil, and I tore a poleaxe out of a man's hand and struck where I saw the scarlet of Wayne's fellows, struck <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> Two of them went over, bleeding on the stones, thank God; and I laughed and found myself sprawling in the gutter <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> got <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> struck <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> broke my halberd to pieces.

Meanwhile, Shockwave succeeds in getting through to Megatron at last and in warning him of the explosive device installed by Starscream in the Arkeville's laboratory, so that Megatron and Optimus Prime have time to prevent the explosion and to save the Earth.|$|R

60|$|There was no {{particular}} reason why, but the incident lingered with me. The sudden raising of the blind, as of the curtain of some small theatre, the barely furnished room coming dimly into view, and the woman standing there, close to the footlights, as to my fancy it seemed. And then the sudden ringing down of the curtain before the play had begun. I turned {{at the corner of}} the street. The blind had been drawn <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> I saw <b>again</b> the slight, girlish figure silhouetted against the side panes of the bow window.|$|R
60|$|But in vain did he rail. In sullen quiet they remained, {{their weapons}} {{on the ground}} before them.

60|$|The {{rolling stock}} of the Halfa-Sarras line was in good order and {{sufficient}} quantity, but the eight locomotives were out of all repair, {{and had to be}} patched <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> with painful repetition. The regularity of their break-downs prevented the regularity of the road, and the Soudan military railway gained a doubtful reputation during the Dongola expedition and in its early days. Nor were there wanting those who employed their wits in scoffing at the undertaking and in pouring thoughtless indignation on the engineers. Nevertheless the work went on continually.|$|E
6000|$|... 218. Nor is {{it merely}} of entire scenes, or of {{particular}} incidents that Turner's memory is thus tenacious. The slightest passages of color or arrangement that have pleased him--the fork of a bough, the casting of a shadow, the fracture of a stone--will be taken <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> and strangely worked into new {{relations with other}} thoughts.

Still his mad career continued, and he bore down upon {{the main body of}} the escort.|$|R
60|$|No one answered.

60|$|Rikki-tikki was {{bounding}} {{all round}} Nagaina, keeping {{just out of}} reach of her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself together and flung out at him.

60|$|But when subjects, {{by a long}} {{course of}} such ill conduct, are once {{thoroughly}} inflamed, and the state itself violently distempered, the people must have some satisfaction to their feelings more solid than a sophistical speculation on law and government.

5000|$|This {{piece is}} an {{extremely}} volatile one as fierce alternating notes in fortissimo fire away.

60|$|But {{the anguish}} and {{suffering}} of the two sons {{of one of these}} men, when they heard, or fancied that they heard, their father's voice, is past description. After wringing their hands and rushing to and fro as if they were stark mad, one mounted on the shoulders of his brother, and tried to clamber up the face of the high wall, guarded at the top with spikes and points of iron. And when he fell among the crowd, he was not deterred by his bruises, but mounted <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> fell <b>again,</b> <b>and,</b> when he found the feat impossible, began to beat the stones and tear them with his hands, as if he could that way make a breach in the strong building, and force a passage in.
