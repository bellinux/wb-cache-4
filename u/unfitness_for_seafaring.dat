2500|$|... "'roved misbehaviour' means such misconduct, whether {{criminal}} or not, {{and whether}} or not displayed in the actual exercise of judicial functions, as, being morally wrong, demonstrates the <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> office of the judge in question." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 25 January 1988, Klehr's {{sentence}} was suspended due to <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> custody (Vollzugsuntauglichkeit). On 10 June, {{he was ordered}} to serve the remainder on probation. After seven months of freedom, he died at age 83.|$|R

6000|$|... "That didn't count; not {{the wrong}} you mean. The {{greatest}} injury {{he could have}} done me would have been in giving you to Brand. However, it was not this, but his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> our work that made me refuse him." ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 1918, Lawson ran for {{re-election}} to the State Senate but {{was defeated by}} Democrat Charles E. Russell.

6000|$|... [52] The {{impossibility of}} an {{absolute}} thing (substantia unica) as neither genus, species, nor individuum: {{as well as}} its utter <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the fundamental position of a philosophic system, will be demonstrated in the critique on Spinozism in the fifth treatise of my Logosophia.|$|R
5000|$|... (a) If the District Magistrate observes in any {{police officer}} of {{or below the}} rank of Inspector marked {{incompetence}} or <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the locality {{in which he is}} stationed, or <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> his particular duties, he may draw the attention of the Superintendent to the fact and request him to consider the advisability of transferring him to another locality or to other duties. He shall; however, bear in mind that not only are transfers detrimental to police work, but the officer transferred may do as badly or even worse in another place. Unsatisfactory work is as a rule met by punishment and a transfer should not be recommended unless it is likely to improve the criminal administration of the district as a whole.|$|R
6000|$|Lemuel came forward, full of his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> {{the sight}} of men, but {{gathering}} a little courage when he found the dining-room so dark.

6000|$|... "That's what I'm {{trying to}} decide," [...] he replied. [...] "Sometimes I feel like renouncing myself altogether; but usually I give myself another chance.

60|$|Christie talked, and {{the good}} soul enjoyed that far more than her dinner, for she meant to ask Mr. Power to help her find the right sort of home for the {{stranger}} whose <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> her present place was every day made more apparent to the mind of her hostess.|$|R

6000|$|Tom, in his turn, {{wished to}} make the balance dip in his favor. This hunchback must not suppose that his {{acquaintance}} with fighting stories {{put him on a}} par with an actual fighting hero, like Tom Tulliver. Philip winced under this allusion to his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> active sports, and he answered almost peevishly,-- ...|$|R
25|$|The {{years of}} Charles's reign were {{difficult}} for Spain. The economy was stagnant, there was hunger in the land, {{and the power}} of the monarchy over the various Spanish provinces was extremely weak. Spain’s finances were perpetually in crisis. Charles's <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> rule meant he was often ignored, and power during his reign became the subject of court intrigues and foreign influence, particularly French and Austrian.|$|R
50|$|The term half-caste was {{not merely}} a term of legal convenience. It became a term of common {{cultural}} discourse and appeared even in religious records.

5000|$|Mustard gas was {{a source}} of extreme dread. In The Anatomy of Courage (1945), Lord Moran, who had been a medical officer during the war, wrote: After July 1917 gas partly usurped the role of high {{explosive}} in bringing to head a natural <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> war. The gassed men were an expression of trench fatigue, a menace when the manhood of the nation had been picked over.|$|R
50|$|As a {{focal point}} <b>for</b> <b>seafaring</b> in general the society has stewarded {{donations}} of model ships, telescopes, paintings, scrimshaw, and travel souvenirs. Visitors to the society's present-day quarters in Charlestown may view some of these objects on display.|$|R
50|$|The album {{continues}} {{in the style of}} Summertime Dream (1976) and Endless Wire (1978), with a mix of faster-paced, country style songs and introspective folk ballads. Lightfoot's penchant <b>for</b> <b>seafaring</b> songs was again evident with three songs featuring an ocean theme.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. The confederated governments {{mutually}} pledge {{themselves to}} {{remove from the}} universities or other public educational institutions all teachers who, by obvious deviation from their duty, or by exceeding {{the limits of their}} functions, or by the abuse of their legitimate influence over the youthful minds, or by propagating harmful doctrines hostile to public order or subversive of existing governmental institutions, shall have unmistakably proved their <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the important office entrusted to them.|$|R
60|$|Isabella groaned aloud, {{and walked}} to a distant part of the chapel, while Mercedes burst into tears, and sinking on her knees, she {{buried her face in}} the cloth of the couch, and prayed fervently for the enlightening of the soul of the princess. The churchman did not receive this proof of ignorance in his penitent, and of her <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the rite he had just administered, with the same pity and indulgence.|$|R
50|$|Usually the {{purposes}} behind watercraft designs and skills are <b>for</b> <b>seafaring</b> education or leisure activities, fishing and resource extraction, transportation of cargo or passengers, and for conducting combat or salvage operations.

6000|$|I {{wonder that}} any man, {{who could not}} but be {{conscious}} of his own <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> it, should go to amuse the learned world with such an undertaking! A man ought to value his reputation more than money; and not to hope that those who can read for themselves will be imposed upon, merely by a partially and unseasonably celebrated name.[474] Poetis quidlibei audendi shall be Mr Dryden's motto, though it should extend to picking of pockets.[475] ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Hurtle {{promised that}} she would speak to Ruby, though when making the promise she could not but think of her <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the task. She knew nothing of the country. She had not a single friend in it, but Paul Montague;--and she had run after him with as little {{discretion}} as Ruby Ruggles was showing in running after her lover. Who was she that she should take upon herself to give advice to any female? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} rid, at any rate, of one terrible bother. I daresay we shall drop it before long in England. I don't {{see why we}} should {{continue}} to sit merely to register the edicts of the House of Commons, and be told that we're a pack of fools when we hesitate." [...] I {{told him that it}} was the unfortunate destiny of a House of Lords to be made to see her own <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> legislative work.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I, madam? angry?’ he cried. ‘You rave! I have {{no cause}} for anger. In every way I have been taught my weakness, my instability, and my <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the world. I am a plexus of weaknesses, an {{impotent}} Prince, a doubtful gentleman; and you yourself, indulgent as you are, have twice reproved my levity. And shall I be angry? I may feel the unkindness, but I have sufficient honesty of mind to see the reasons of this coup d’état.’ ...|$|R
50|$|During the cess controversy, {{where the}} landowners of the Pale {{objected to the}} {{taxation}} reforms proposed by the Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, Plunket was almost alone in supporting Sidney, and earned his gratitude as a result (although Sidney privately admitted that {{he was concerned about}} Plunket's fitness for office, in view of his age and failing health). Successive administrations praised Plunket's diligence and incorruptibility; only from about 1577 on were public complaints made of his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> office.|$|R
50|$|Admission of new {{students}} takes place twice a year, in August and in December.

60|$|I cannot {{entangle}} {{the reader}} in the intricacy of the inquiries necessary for {{anything like a}} satisfactory solution of these questions. But, were he to engage in such inquiries, their result would be his strong conviction of the earth's having been brought from a state {{in which it was}} utterly uninhabitable into one fitted for man;--of its having been, when first inhabitable, more beautiful than it is now; and of its gradually tending to still greater inferiority of aspect, and <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> abode.|$|R
