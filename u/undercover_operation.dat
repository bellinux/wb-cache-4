5|$|A 1980 US {{indictment}} {{said that}} Francisco Rafael was {{under investigation by}} the DEA for alleged cocaine and heroin distribution in the San Diego area. The DEA had identified him as one of the cocaine suppliers and set up an <b>undercover</b> <b>operation</b> to arrest him and his associates by purchasing multi-ton shipments of cocaine. He admitted to have worked with drug distributor Ramón Torresillos-Rendón, and that he used him as a mediator for a drug transaction with an undercover federal agent. In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces of cocaine to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond and promising to appear at every court session. Nonetheless, he fled to Mexico shortly afterwards and did not appear in court on 8 October 1980.|$|E

25|$|The second episode gained notoriety for {{the violent}} killing of {{character}} Helen Flynn (Lisa Faulkner), which drew {{the largest number}} of complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Commission in 2002. During an <b>undercover</b> <b>operation</b> Helen and Tom were captured by race riot instigator Robert Osborne, played by Kevin McNally, who tortured Helen with a deep fryer in an attempt to make Tom reveal classified information.

5000|$|In {{the wake}} of Abscam, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued [...] "The Attorney General Guidelines for FBI Undercover Operations" [...] ("Civiletti Undercover Guidelines") on January 5, 1981. These were the first Attorney General Guidelines for <b>undercover</b> <b>operations</b> and formalized {{procedures}} necessary to conduct <b>undercover</b> <b>operations</b> to avoid future controversy. Following the initial press accounts about the Abscam investigation, Congress {{held a series of}} hearings to examine FBI <b>undercover</b> <b>operations</b> and the new Civiletti Undercover Guidelines. The House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights began hearings on FBI <b>undercover</b> <b>operations</b> in March 1980 and concluded with a report in April 1984. Among the concerns expressed during the hearings were the undercover agents' involvement in illegal activity, the possibility of entrapping individuals, the prospect of damaging the reputations of innocent civilians, and the opportunity to undermine legitimate rights to privacy.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted {{as a result of}} the long standing criticism against <b>undercover</b> <b>operations</b> due to the conduct of informers and agents during these <b>operations.</b> Since both <b>undercover</b> <b>operations</b> and informers are controversial issues it may cause serious judicial problems if the system is not applied correctly. The problem was investigated by means of qualitative research. A thorough literature study and semi-structured interviews were used to gather the required data. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with advocates of the Director of Public Prosecutions Free State and detectives from the Organised Crime Unit of the South African Police Service. It has been found that <b>undercover</b> <b>operations</b> are an effective manner to address organised crime and especially precious metals related crimes. <b>Undercover</b> <b>operations</b> are an excellent barometer to determine the extent of organised crime. It gives investigators a clear view of the compilation of a syndicate and the roles of leaders, runners and associates. Informers are invaluable sources of information. Without the use of informers it will be virtually impossible to engage in <b>undercover</b> <b>operations,</b> since the police will have no intelligence to engage into an investigation of this nature. The implications of the findings are that it is the responsibility of investigators, agents and informers to keep the system transparent, fair and acceptable. Their conduct may never violate their mandate and the boundaries of the investigation. <b>Undercover</b> <b>operations</b> are justified when the system is properly administered, structured, controlled and without bias.

One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an <b>undercover</b> <b>operation</b> by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room. In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison (with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island, along with liquor imports. Forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments were reportedly closed, and 2,000slot machines were destroyed. [...] Though officials said they destroyed all of the city's gaming equipment, some locals including R.S.

500|$|Elsewhere, Hermione Norris {{returns as}} Ros Myers. The {{character}} was initially written {{off after the}} eighth episode of the sixth series due to the actress's pregnancy, however when the seventh series entered pre-production, Norris was asked to return and she accepted. Miranda Raison also returns as Jo Portman; the cliffhanger of the sixth series finale, where Jo was apparently killed, was to leave the audience wonder whether she survived. Raison stated that she realised the producers wanted her to return, {{and she wanted to}} return. Alex Lanipekun returns as Ben Kaplan, and was upgraded to a series regular from the last series. Lanipekun believed that the seventh series was [...] "kind of for Ben," [...] adding that there was an episode that would see his coming of age by dealing with his first <b>undercover</b> <b>operation</b> and his burdens, namely getting close to someone who is involved with the group he was sent to stop.

500|$|Tom Quinn joined Section D in 1996, {{where he}} {{eventually}} became Head of Section D following the imprisonment of predecessor Lucas North (Richard Armitage) during an operation in Russia. Throughout the first series, Tom engages {{in a relationship}} with Ellie Simm (Esther Hall), who knows him as [...] "Matthew Archer", a civil servant in IT. In the second episode, Tom performed an <b>undercover</b> <b>operation</b> with fellow officer Helen Flynn (Lisa Faulkner) to recruit the wife of right-wing businessman, Robert Osbourne, who was believed to incite race riots throughout the country. However, during the operation, Osbourne discovers they are spies and attempts to get his hands on information regarding MI5 operations. When Tom fails to cooperate Osbourne tortured Flynn with a deep fryer before killing her. Tom is able to escape and works with Harry to have Osbourne assassinated for retribution. When Tom is shot during a Turkish Consulate raid in the third episode, Tom is forced to admit his true identity and profession, which temporarily puts a strain on their relationship. In the series one finale, Tom has his home protected in order to keep Ellie and her daughter Maisie safe. However, in the end of the finale, he inadvertently brings home a laptop rigged with C4; Ellie and Maisie become trapped in the house with the bomb. The bomb fails to detonate. However, {{by the end of the}} second series premiere, Ellie leaves Tom, claiming that he will always choose his job over her.|$|E
