40|$|Chemical-mechanical {{planarization}} (CMP) is a {{key process}} {{in the manufacture of}} ultra-large-scale-integrated (ULSI) semiconductor devices. A major concern in CMP is non-uniform planarization, or polishing, at the wafer-scale- primarily as interconnect metal dishing and dielectric erosion. In conventional face-down CMP, the pad is much larger than the wafer and the wafer is always in contact with the pad. Thus, non-uniform polishing rate at the wafer-scale is due to variations in relative velocity, normal pressure, and especially slurry distribution at the wafer/pad interface. Wafer-scale polishing <b>uniformity</b> <b>requirements</b> are expected to be even more stringent in the future as the ULSI technology advances toward larger wafers (450 mm) and ever shrinking feature sizes (< 20 nm).

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for developing more robust and error oriented mesh adaptation methods. Speci cally, assuming that a regular (in cell shape) and uniform (in cell size) computational mesh is used (as is commonly done in computation), we develop a criterion for mesh adaptation based on an error function which de nition is motivated by the analysis of function variation and local error behavior for linear interpolation.

The functionals that satisfy these conditions approximately are constructed using discrete and continuous inequalities.

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} {{amorphous silicon}} position-sensitive detector (PSD) is {{usually in the}} form of large-area, continuous p-i-n silicon layer structure coupled with resistive layers next to the p and n Si layers. The device has many applications (e. g. light position measurements, light-pen input devices, etc.) and can be fabricated by using low-cost PECVD process. When used as a light-pen-based input device, several material-related design issues must be critically considered for achieving acceptable performance. The present work addresses three important issues, namely the spectral response of PSD, the <b>uniformity</b> <b>requirement</b> of the resistive layers, and the design of optical filter on the input side of PSD. They correspond to the signal-to-noise ratio of the device, the accuracy of light-position determination, and the integration problem with liquid crystal displays (LCD), respectively. Analytical analysis and computer simulation results draw the following important conclusions: (1) red-light-sensitive PSD can be obtained by properly tuning the thickness of p-layer and i-layer, which suppress the interference of background light when using the input device under sun light or similar illumination (2) the spot size of input light has little effect on position determination, as long as the size does not differ too much from that of required resolution. And a conservative <b>uniformity</b> <b>requirement</b> for the resistive layers can be obtained as Δ h/h {{less than or equal to}} 4 /n with n being the required number of pixels of display and h bring the film thickness (3) multi-layered filters made of oxides can be deposited on PSD to reflect non-signal light for LCD display while preserving the input-signal when the PSD is placed under a TN LCD.

40|$|Pinhole SPECT is a fully 3 -dimensional {{tomography}} technique. <b>Uniformity</b> <b>requirements</b> for gamma-cameras {{have been}} studied for 2 -dimensional SPECT performed with parallel-hole collimators. This study investigated reconstruction artifacts in pinhole SPECT arising from intrinsic uniformity defects of the gamma-camera {{in the case of}} a pinhole aperture (5 mm) and a rotation radius (10 cm) suitable for human studies. METHODS: A cylindric phantom was filled with water and 99 mTc. The count density in the pinhole SPECT projections largely exceeded the density that would be expected in human studies. Two-dimensional gaussian-shaped positive uniformity defects of various heights and various full widths at half maximum were simulated at 5 locations on the 64 projections. All these sets of projections were reconstructed using an iterative 3 -dimensional ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm tailored to the pinhole geometry. The influence of the number of OSEM iterations (2, 5, or 8 for 8 subsets) was also investigated. The height of the ring artifacts generated by the uniformity defects was measured on the reconstructed transverse slices and was compared with the noise in the noncorrupted slices. The uniformity defects were also generated on a 30 -megacount flood image from the camera. These images were inspected visually, and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) differential and integral uniformities were calculated. RESULTS: Defects centered on the line corresponding to the orthogonal projection of the camera axis of rotation onto the detector plane generated artifacts whose magnitude-to-noise ratio exceeded 1 % when the defect height was larger than 5 %- 10 %, depending on the defect full width at half maximum. These defects were clearly visible on the slices and the flood images. Defects located elsewhere on the camera detector generated ring artifacts of magnitude-to-noise ratio smaller than 1 %. They were visually observable both on the reconstructed slices and on the flood images for defect heights larger than 5 %. The increase in the number of OSEM iterations conducted to a decrease in the artifact magnitude-to-noise ratio. CONCLUSION: Although hardly visible on the flood images and only slightly increasing the NEMA differential or integral uniformity, a detector uniformity defect of 3 % height is able to generate a visible artifact on the reconstructed transverse slices. The study was conducted on a relatively high-count pinhole SPECT acquisition. Considering that far fewer counts would accumulate in clinical practice, any camera that fulfils these <b>uniformity</b> <b>requirements</b> should not lead to the presence of visible uniformity artifacts in the reconstructed slices.

It is a highly complex material, which makes modeling its behavior a very difficult task. This paper aimed to show possible applicability of Neural Networks (NN) to predict the slump in High Strength Concrete (HSC). Neural Network models is constructed, trained and tested using the available test data of 349 different concrete mix designs of High Strength Concrete (HSC) gathered from a particular Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) batching plant. The most versatile Neural Network model is selected to predict the slump in concrete. The data used in the Neural Network models are arranged in a format of eight input parameters that cover the Cement, Fly Ash, Sand, Coarse Aggregate (10 mm), Coarse Aggregate (20 mm), Water, Super-Plasticizer and Water/Binder ratio.
