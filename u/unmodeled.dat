5|$|An {{analysis}} of Pluto's orbit by Matthew J. Holman and Matthew J. Payne found perturbations {{much larger than}} predicted by Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for Planet Nine. Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic errors in the measurements of Pluto's orbit; an <b>unmodeled</b> mass in the Solar System, such as a small planet {{in the range of}} 60– (potentially explaining the Kuiper cliff); or a planet more massive or closer to the Sun instead of the planet predicted by Batygin and Brown.|$|E

Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of horse-chestnut colours of the clothes on the bank, and the grouping of oranges of the boys in the water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.|$|E
25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large <b>unmodeled</b> voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small offset voltage (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|E

Only a weak a priori knowledge (namely, upper bounds of the absolute value of the <b>unmodelled</b> parameters and orders of the <b>unmodelled</b> dynamics) is required for the implementation.

40|$|AbstractIn Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) positioning, one often {{tries to}} {{establish}} a mathematic model to capture the systematic behaviors of observations as much as possible. However, the observation residuals still exhibit, to a great extent, as (somewhat systematic) signals. Nevertheless, those systematic variations {{are referred to as}} the <b>unmodelled</b> errors, which are difficult to be further modelled by setting up additional parameters. Different from the random errors, the <b>unmodelled</b> errors are colored and time correlated. In general, the larger the time correlations are, the more significant the <b>unmodelled</b> errors. Hence, understanding the time correlations of <b>unmodelled</b> errors is important to develop the theory for processing the <b>unmodelled</b> errors. In this study, we compare and analyze the time correlations caused by <b>unmodelled</b> errors of Global Positioning System (GPS) and BeiDou signals. The time correlations are estimated based on the residuals of double differenced observations on 11 baselines with different lengths. The results show that the time correlation patterns are different significantly between GPS and BeiDou observations. Besides, the code and phase data from the same satellite system are also not the same. Furthermore, the <b>unmodelled</b> errors are affected by not only the baseline length, but also some other factors. In addition, {{to make use of the}} time correlations with more efficiency, we propose to fit the time correlations by using exponent and quadratic models and the fitting coefficients are given. Finally, the sequential adjustment method considering the time correlations is implemented to compute the baseline solutions. The results show that the solutions considering the time correlations can objectively reflect the actual precisions of parameter estimates...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in trajectory and orbital estimation is to obtain a realistic estimate of {{the accuracy of the}} trajectory and other important parameters. In the orbital case, some of the parameters which may not be solved for are geopotential constants, survey, etc. These factors will affect the total uncertainty in the orbit and, of course, ephemeris predictions.

40|$|Abstract. Most {{real-world}} {{business processes}} involve {{a combination of}} both well-defined and previously modelled as well as unforeseen and therefor <b>unmodelled</b> scenarios. The goal of comprehensive process management should be to cover all actually performed processes by accurate models so that they may be fully supported by IT systems. <b>Unmodelled</b> processes can be observed by the Process Observation system which generates models reflecting the recorded behaviour. Modelled processes may be of different natures: while so-called “automation ” processes involve little human participation and mainly orchestrate services and applications, so-called “knowledge-intensive ” processes are based on human expert participation. Both types of models may be enacted by the Process Navigation system. This contribution introduces the integration of both systems which leads to an approach for supporting the full range from <b>unmodelled</b> processes to both automation and knowledge-intensive processes as well as the transition from <b>unmodelled</b> to modelled processes...|$|R

In that paper, Krstic, Sun and Kokotovic solve various stabilization problems in presence of input <b>unmodelled</b> dynamics. Their solution incorporates, in the controller, a signal, called normalizing signal, which captures the effect of the <b>unmodelled</b> dynamics. Here, we show that this signal is not needed. This result is obtained via an appropriate change of coordinates of the <b>unmodelled</b> dynamics and by applying the technique of propagating the ISS property through integrators proposed in -Praly-Teel.

Although it has been most widely applied in the field of biostatistics (typically to assess cluster-based models of DNA sequences, or other taxonomic models), it can also be used in other fields of inquiry where raw data tend to occur in clumps, or clusters. This coefficient has also been proposed for use as a test for nested clusters.|$|E

The expected frame-dragging effect was similar in magnitude {{to the current}} noise level (the noise being dominated by initially <b>unmodeled</b> effects due to nonuniform coatings on the gyroscopes). Work continued to model and account for these sources of error, thus permitting extraction of the frame-dragging signal. By August 2008, the frame-dragging effect had been confirmed to within 15% of the expected result, and the December 2008 NASA report indicated that the geodetic effect was confirmed to better than 0.5%.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the method of}} reference model decomposition {{as a way to}} improve the robustness of model reference adaptive control systems (MRACs) with respect to <b>unmodelled</b> dynamics with a known structure. Such <b>unmodelled</b> dynamics occur when some of the nominal plant dynamics are purposely neglected in the controller design with the aim of keeping the controller order low. One of the effects of such undermodelling of the controller is a violation of the perfect model-matching condition of the primary controller. The decomposition {{can be seen as a}} way to adjust the reference model output (and hence the control goal) to the actual model-matching capabilities. It is shown that the decomposition alleviates the negative effects <b>unmodelled</b> dynamics have on the error equation.

With a series of significant results, he has established a solid framework for the identification and adaptive control of uncertainty systems with quantized information.

40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} model reference adaptive control (MRAC) strategy is developed {{for use on}} plants with noise or <b>unmodelled</b> high-frequency dynamics. MRAC consists of two parts, an adaptive control part and a fixed gain control part. The adaptive algorithm uses a combination of low- and high-pass filters such that the frequency range for the adaptive part of the strategy is limited. The mechanism for noise-induced gain wind-up is demonstrated analytically, and it is shown how MRAC can be modified to eliminate this wind-up. Further to this, an additional filter is proposed to improve MRAC robustness to high-frequency <b>unmodelled</b> dynamics. Two test plants, one with added noise {{and the other with}} <b>unmodelled</b> high-frequency dynamics, are considered. Both plants exhibit unstable behaviour when controlled using standard MRAC, but, with the modified strategy, robustness is significantly improved...|$|R
