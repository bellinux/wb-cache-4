40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In {{photonic}} crystal (PC) gratings whose structural symmetry is broken owing to one-side corrugations, the Rayleigh-Wood anomalies can {{appear in a}} one-way manner. In the combination with the vanishing coupling to the lowest Floquet-Bloch mode at the upper band edge, these anomalies lead to {{the appearance of the}} defect-mode-like, i. e., very narrow <b>one-way</b> <b>transmission,</b> peak, which cannot appear in the corresponding slab of PC without corrugations. Such a sole peak can be transformed into a <b>one-way</b> <b>transmission</b> band with a desired width by varying angle of incidence. The nonoverlapping and thus switchable one-way (higher-order) and two-way (zero-order) transmission bands can be obtained in both the frequency and incidence-angle domains. Adjustment of PC lattice and corrugation parameters allows one to obtain two subsequent one-way bands, every being connected with a certain higher diffraction order. Conditions required for the appearance of a narrow <b>one-way</b> <b>transmission</b> band in the vicinity of a Rayleigh-Wood anomaly are well consistent with typical dispersion features of a very large class of PCs and do not need unusual performances...|$|R
