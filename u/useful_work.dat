Monasticism is forbidden, and Bahá'ís {{are taught}} to practice spirituality while engaging in <b>useful</b> <b>work.</b> The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bahá'u'lláh's writings, where he states that work done {{in the spirit of}} service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.|$|E

Gandhi favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and <b>useful</b> <b>work,</b> one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow <b>useful</b> <b>work</b> to be done underwater.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration.

He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 and 1998 Maclay et al. {{published}} the first models of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) with Casimir forces.

25|$|It is {{possible}} to couple a thermodynamically favorable reaction (a transition from a high-energy state to a lower-energy state) to a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction (such as a separation of charges, or {{the creation of an}} osmotic gradient), {{in such a way that}} the overall free energy of the system decreases (making it thermodynamically possible), while <b>useful</b> <b>work</b> is done at the same time. The principle that biological macromolecules catalyze a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction if and only if a thermodynamically favorable reaction occurs simultaneously, underlies all known forms of life.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} was working with the caloric theory, Sadi Carnot in 1824 {{suggested}} that some of the caloric available for generating <b>useful</b> <b>work</b> is lost in any real process. In March 1851, while grappling {{to come to terms with}} the work of James Prescott Joule, Lord Kelvin started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of useful heat in all processes. The idea was framed even more dramatically by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the heat death of the universe.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{this and}} several similar peer {{reviewed}} papers, {{there is not}} a consensus as to whether such devices can produce a continuous output of work. Garret Moddel at University of Colorado has highlighted that he believes such devices hinge {{on the assumption that the}} Casimir force is a nonconservative force, he argues that there is sufficient evidence (e.g. analysis by Scandurra (2001)) to say that the Casimir effect is a conservative force and therefore even though such an engine can exploit the Casimir force for <b>useful</b> <b>work</b> it cannot produce more output energy than has been input into the system.|$|E
25|$|A {{screensaver}} (or screen saver) is {{a computer}} program that blanks the screen or fills it with moving images or patterns when the computer is not in use. The original purpose of screensavers was to prevent phosphor burn-in on CRT and plasma computer monitors (hence the name). Though modern monitors are not susceptible to this issue, screensavers are still used for other purposes. Screensavers are often set up to offer a basic layer of security, by requiring a password to re-access the device. Some screensavers use the otherwise unused computer resources to do <b>useful</b> <b>work,</b> such as processing for distributed computing projects.|$|E
25|$|One {{liter of}} ethanol contain 21.1 MJ, a liter of {{methanol}} 15.8 MJ and a liter of gasoline approximately 32.6 MJ. In other words, {{for the same}} energy content as one liter or one gallon of gasoline, one needs 1.6 liters/gallons of ethanol and 2.1 liters/gallons of methanol. The raw energy-per-volume numbers produce misleading fuel consumption numbers however, because alcohol-fueled engines can be made substantially more energy-efficient. A larger percentage of the energy available in a liter of alcohol fuel {{can be converted to}} <b>useful</b> <b>work.</b> This difference in efficiency can partially or totally balance out the energy density difference, depending on the particular engines being compared.|$|E
