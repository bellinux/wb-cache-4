Any of these compounds serve the same role, reversibly forming a mixture of metal hydride compounds.|$|E

Here we present a unified view of the minimum norm methods and describe how we can use Tikhonov regularization to avoid instabilities in the solutions due to noise.

Objections to its <b>use</b> <b>fall</b> into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic {{in the number of}} documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval. We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm. 1 Introduction Document clustering has been extensively investigated as a methodology for improving document search and retrieval (see [15] for an excellent review).

40|$|Abstract. The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) {{establishes}} a new legal {{framework for the}} management of biological resource use, for example in fisheries. The signatory states to the CBD have agreed upon several major principles which become legally binding following ratification of the Convention by the national legislature. In terms of resource management, two of these principles are especially remarkable: 1. a concept of sustainability which includes distributional considerations; 2. an ‘ecosystem approach ’ that calls for the integration of aspects of community ecology into management schemes. Unfortunately, current approaches to the management of biological resource <b>use</b> <b>fall</b> somewhat short of satisfying these two principles. I try to rectify this, developing a method of analysis that integrates neoclassical resource economics, property rights theory and community ecology into one theoretical concept which can be applied to such distinctive problems as overexploitation, negative impact on ecosystems by resource use, and conflicts among resource users. This method of analysis will make it possible to determine whether a specified biological resource use system and its accompanying management structures meet the requirements set out by the CBD...|$|E

We propose a "conversational vibrancy" framework to capture dynamics of hashtags based on their topicality, interactivity, diversity, and prominence. Statistical analyses of the growth and persistence of hashtags reveal novel relationships between features of this framework and the relative success of hashtags. Specifically, retweets always contribute to faster hashtag adoption, replies extend the life of "winners" while having no effect on "also-rans. " This is the first study on the lifecycle of hashtag adoption and use in response to purely exogenous shocks. We draw on theories of uses and gratification, organizational ecology, and language evolution to discuss these findings and their implications for understanding social influence and collective action in social media more generally.

40|$|Fertilizer use is notably {{lower in}} most of Africa than in other {{developing}} regions. Too little irrigation and varieties unresponsive to fertiliser may explain this to some degree. But more often the finger is pointed at lack of credit, long distances between farmers and the nearest fertilizer retailer, weak market infrastructure, and liberalized crop input and output markets. Indeed, in many countries the withdrawal of state input delivery systems has seen fertiliser <b>use</b> <b>fall</b> as commercial distribution systems compete with subsidized government programs. Kenya, however, stands as a notable departure from this parallel input marketing model. In the early 1990 s fertiliser markets were liberalised, government price controls and import licensing quotas were eliminated, and fertilizer donations by external donor agencies were phased out. Subsequently fertiliser use has almost doubled from the 1980 s to recent years, much of the increase being registered on small farms. Rates of fertiliser application on maize crops compare well with those seen in Asia and Latin America. How has this been achieved? Liberalization, implemented for nearly 15 years without competing government subsidy programs, has induced tremendous private investment in fertilizer importation and retailing.

40|$|Work-related falls {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the leading causes of fatalities in the Australian construction industry, and the failure to <b>use</b> <b>fall</b> protection equipment, such as fall-arrest harnesses and arresting devices, has been found to be a contributing factor. In an attempt to gain an understanding of the issues surrounding the use of fallarrest harness systems by construction workers a study involving semi-structured interviews of 15 male construction workers was carried out at three construction sites. The majority of interviewees commented that there was discomfort in wearing a fall-arrest harness; that there were a number of problems when anchored via an arresting device; and that using a fall-arrest system reduced productivity. Most of the interviewees considered that they needed safety precautions against falls, and they expressed the view that workers’ attitudes towards safety depended critically upon their supervisors’ attitude towards safety. It was also found that workers were not trained in rescue procedures. Interviewees expressed concern that retrieval of a suspended worker may not be carried out in time to prevent the onset of suspension trauma. A number of issues were identified which require further research, such as, investigation into suspension trauma, harness and arresting device design, training provided to workers, and the provision for rescues...|$|E
40|$|Prescribed fire is {{commonly}} applied world-wide {{as a tool}} for enhancing habitats and altering resource-selection patterns of grazing animals. A scientific basis for this practice has been established in some ecosystems but its efficacy has not been rigorously evaluated on mesic sagebrush steppe. Beginning in 2003, resource-selection patterns of beef cows were investigated using global positioning system (GPS) collars for 2 years before and for 5 years after a fall prescribed burn was applied to mesic sagebrush steppe in the Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho, USA. Resource-selection functions (RSF) developed from these data indicated cattle selected for lightly to moderately burned areas for all 5 postfire years. Cattle had been neutral towards these areas prior to the fire when their distribution was primarily affected by slope, sagebrush dominance, and distance to upland water. Resource-selection responses to the fire lasted 2 – 3 years longer than would be expected for fire-induced, forage-quality improvement effects. Although this is a case study and caution should be taken in extrapolating these results, if applied under conditions similar to this study, livestock producers and natural resource managers can likely <b>use</b> <b>fall</b> prescribed fire in the mesic sagebrush steppe to affect cattle resource-use patterns for 5 years postfire...|$|E
