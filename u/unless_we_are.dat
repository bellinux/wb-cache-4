2500|$|The Tibetans {{were aware}} of the expedition; to avoid bloodshed, the Tibetan general at Yadong pledged that if the British made no attack upon the Tibetans, he would not attack the British. Colonel Younghusband replied, on 6 December 1903, that [...] "we are not at war with Tibet and that, <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{ourselves}} attacked, we shall not attack the Tibetans". When no Tibetan or Chinese officials met the British at Khapma Dzong, Younghusband advanced with some 1,150 soldiers, porters, labourers, and thousands of pack animals, to Tuna, 50 miles beyond the border. After waiting more months there, hoping in vain to be met by negotiators, the expedition received orders (in 1904) to continue toward Lhasa.|$|E
2500|$|Myers further {{stated that}} [...] "several {{faculty members and}} deans {{suggested}} that perhaps {{it was time to}} stop playing ranking roulette and opt out of the survey." [...] Myers next argued that at the NEAIR (North East Association for Institutional Research) 33rd Annual Conference in 2006, a talk given by U.S. News, [...] "indicated that if a school stops sending data, the default assumption will be that it performs one standard deviation below the mean on numerous factors for which U.S. News can't find published data. Again, making up the numbers it can't get. The message is clear. <b>Unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> willing to be badly misrepresented, we had better send the information the magazine wants." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{announced}} in August 2010 that Gates {{was trying to find}} $100 billion in Defense savings through to 2015, in order to in-still a [...] "culture of savings and restraint" [...] in the military. Secretary Gates said that [...] "It is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense,". Gates said [...] "As a matter of principle and political reality, the Department of Defense cannot expect America's elected representatives to approve budget increases each year <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing a good job, indeed everything possible, to make every dollar count". [...] These cuts included the closing of the Joint Forces Command, the redundancy of fifty general and admirals, and the removal of 150 senior civilian positions.|$|E
2500|$|He then {{announced}} his formal candidacy {{for the presidency}} of the United States and in turn, his intention to seek the nomination of the Republican Party for the 2008 presidential election, shortly after noon in Prescott Park on the waterfront of Portsmouth, New Hampshire on Wednesday, April 25, 2007. In his announcement, McCain emphasized that [...] "America should never undertake a war <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> prepared to do everything necessary to succeed," [...] and he also stated that, [...] "I'm not running for President to be somebody, but to do something; to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things." [...] The audience was somewhat listless. He then visited Saint Anselm College and several other spots around Manchester, New Hampshire on a cold rainy day, before starting a planned three-day campaign rally in South Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, and Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} date had shifted to winter 2000, {{similarities}} were noted between {{the film and}} DreamWorks Animation's The Road to El Dorado. Marc Lument, a visual development artist on El Dorado, claimed [...] "It really was a race, and Katzenberg wanted ours out before theirs." [...] Lument also added that, [...] "We didn't {{know exactly what they}} were doing, but we had the impression {{it was going to be}} very similar. Whoever came out second would face the impression that they copied the other." [...] Fullmer and Dindal denied the similarities with the latter commenting [...] "This version [...] was well in the works when that movie came out," [...] and further added [...] "Early on, when our movie got to be very comic, all of us felt that you can't be making this farce about a specific group of people <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to poke fun at ourselves. This didn't seem to be a proper choice about Incas or any group of people. It was more of a fable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nehru, while a pacifist, was not {{blind to}} the {{political}} and geostrategic reality of India in 1947. While laying the foundation stone of the National Defence Academy in 1949, he stated: [...] "We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, {{we have to face}} all contingencies, and <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> prepared to face them, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, whom we have lost, but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom. We have to be prepared with all modern defense methods and a well-equipped army, navy and air force." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{order to}} get out of it, once <b>we</b> <b>were</b> inside, it would be necessary, as I have already said, to expose {{ourselves}} to the fire of the enemy, and before many hours should elapse <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> forced to take to our heels <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> minded to die of hunger or thirst.|$|R

60|$|As I have said, Captain Hanaford {{shoved his}} tiller hard over, {{throwing}} the pungy around until her nose struck the mud, {{and it was}} a question of getting her off the bank in the shortest possible space of time, <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> minded to lay there when the action began, for none of us doubted but that an engagement was close at hand.|$|R
