5|$|Although <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West, school {{corporal}} punishment {{is not uncommon}} in more conservative areas of the state, with 28,569 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of school {{corporal punishment}} in Texas is surpassed only by Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|In comparison, the South Island has {{experienced}} fewer large earthquakes. The magnitude 7.1 Mw event of 4 September 2010 produced {{by far the}} strongest ground motions ever recorded in the Canterbury region, triggering {{a large number of}} aftershocks. Although similar aftershock sequences have historically occurred around the world, such occurrences were extremely <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, which had shown low levels of seismic activity for thousands of years. The event has led to the discovery of previously dormant geological faults across central-eastern South Island, in particular beneath regional plains and the adjacent seabed.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the graves}} {{are marked by}} plain {{triangular}} stones set at one end. These are not carved or inscribed with names as in Christian cemeteries, but are similar to markers found in pagan cemeteries. Some graves are interrupted by stakeholes cut into them, possibly indicating the presence of wooden poles that might have served as markers or supported wooden structures within the graves. This is <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of England, though comparable examples {{have been found in}} Kent in the south-east.|$|E

5|$|The 1936 {{season was}} fairly active, with 20 {{tropical}} cyclones including 3 tropical depressions. Seven storms became hurricanes, of which one {{became a major}} hurricane. In addition, the season was <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that no storms moved across large portions of the Caribbean Sea. Seven storms, including three hurricanes, struck the United States. The season also set many records for the earliest date for a numbered storm, though all were surpassed by the extreme activity of the 2005 season.|$|E
5|$|Whale was {{openly gay}} {{throughout}} his career, {{something that was}} very <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext {{and it has been}} claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led {{to the end of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1100 Henry married Matilda, the {{daughter}} of Malcolm III of Scotland. Henry was now around 31 years old, but late marriages for noblemen were not <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th century. The pair had probably first met earlier the previous decade, possibly being introduced through Bishop Osmund of Salisbury. Historian Warren Hollister argues that Henry and Matilda were emotionally close, but their union was also certainly politically motivated. Matilda had originally been named Edith, an Anglo-Saxon name, {{and was a member}} of the West Saxon royal family, being the niece of Edgar the Ætheling, the great-granddaughter of Edmund Ironside and a descendant of Alfred the Great. For Henry, marrying Matilda gave his reign increased legitimacy, and for Matilda, an ambitious woman, it was an opportunity for high status and power in England.|$|E
5|$|Though some emperors, such as Justin I and Justinian I, took low-born wives, dynastic intermarriages in {{imperial}} {{families were}} not <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire. Following {{the fall of}} Constantinople in 1204, the ruling families, the Laskarides and then the Palaiologoi, thought it prudent to marry into foreign dynasties. One early example is the marriage of John Doukas Vatatzes with Constance, the daughter of Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire to seal their alliance. After establishing an alliance with the Mongols in 1263, Michael VIII Palaiologos married two of his daughters to Mongol khans to cement their agreement: his daughter Euphrosyne Palaiologina was married to Nogai Khan of the Golden Horde, and his daughter Maria Palaiologina, was married to Abaqa Khan of the Ilkhanate. Later in the century, Andronikos II Palaiologos agreed martial alliances with Ghazan of the Ilkhanate and Toqta and Uzbeg of the Golden Horde, which were quickly followed by weddings with his daughters.|$|E
5|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{offered an}} {{extension}} of Bethe's fellowship, allowing {{him to return to}} Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a privatdozent. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the Handbuch der Physik on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that it was <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depth and breadth of its treatment of the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the handbuch article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called solid state physics. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent and complete coverage of it. His work on the handbuch articles occupied {{most of his time in}} Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.|$|E

5|$|The core {{purpose of}} a stela was to glorify the king. Many Maya stelae depict only {{the king of the}} city, and {{describe}} his actions with hieroglyphic script. Even when the individual depicted is not the king himself, the text or scene usually relates the subject to the king. Openly declaring the importance and power of the king to the community, the stela portrayed his wealth, prestige and ancestry, and depicted him wielding the symbols of military and divine power. Stelae were raised to commemorate important events, especially {{at the end of a}} k'atun 20-year cycle of the Maya calendar, or to mark a quarter or a half k'atun. The stela did not just mark off a period of time; it has been argued that it physically embodied that period of time. The hieroglyphic texts on the stelae describe how some of the calendrical ceremonies required the king to perform ritual dance and bloodletting. At Tikal, the twin pyramid groups were built to celebrate the k'atun ending and reflected Maya cosmology. These groups possessed pyramids on the east and west sides that represented the birth and death of the sun. On the south side, a nine-doored building was situated in order to represent the underworld. On the north side was a walled enclosure that represented the celestial region; it was left open to the sky. It was in this celestial enclosure that a stela-altar pair was placed, the altar being a fitting throne for the divine king. Calakmul practised a tradition that was <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Maya area, that of raising twin stelae depicting both the king and his wife.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from being}} <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way it funded emigrants, the Society was also <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{application}} {{of its first}} Rule - emigration by family. This was {{in contrast to the}} usual pattern of immigration at the time which was single men, couples, or small families. The families selected by the Land and Emigration Commissioner's agent in Scotland, acting on behalf of the Society, were extended, sometimes to three generations.|$|E
