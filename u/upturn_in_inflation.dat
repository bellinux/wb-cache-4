How {{is that we have}} been able to enjoy such strong economic growth and resulting low unemployment rates without an <b>upturn</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation?</b> The author reviews the primary explanations offered for these unusually favorable circumstances - that the U. S. economy has been the beneficiary of temporary factors that have held down the inflation rate or that the U. S. economy has entered a new era of intensified competition and rising productivity growth in which inflation is less of a threat. She also discusses arguments that the U. S. economy may be experiencing an asset price bubble, noting that while rising stock prices cannot explain low inflation, decreases in inflation may have contributed to rising stock prices.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{expansion in the}} United States became increasingly well established {{in the first half}} of 2004, but the pace of inflation picked up from its very low rate in 2003. At the time of the February Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, considerable evidence suggested that the U. S. economy had moved into a period of more-vigorous expansion. Nonetheless, some businesses remained cautious about hiring and investment. In the event, businesses stepped up their hiring in the spring, and capital spending seems to have continued apace. > Over the first half of this year, energy prices soared, and <b>inflation</b> <b>in</b> core consumer prices increased. To some extent, the <b>upturn</b> <b>in</b> core <b>inflation</b> reflected the indirect effects of higher energy prices. In addition, strengthening aggregate demand worldwide induced a surge in the prices of many primary commodities and industrial materials, and the decline in the dollar in 2003 put upward pressure on import prices. In this environment, firms were better able to pass on the higher costs of imports, raise the prices of domestically produced items that compete with imports, and in many cases boost their profit margins. > Monetary policy was very accommodative at the start of 2004 as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sought to provide continuing support to the {{economic expansion}}. Following some upbeat labor market reports, solid growth in output, and a pickup in core consumer price inflation, the FOMC announced at its May meeting that it believed that the monetary policy accommodation then in place could be "removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. " At its June meeting, the FOMC decided to begin moving the federal funds rate back toward a more neutral setting. > Although some of the recent data have been on the soft side, the available information on the outlook for the U. S. economy is, on balance, positive. The prospects also seem favorable for inflation to remain contained in the period ahead.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide medium run {{forecasts}} of headline and core HICP inflation for the euro area, we assess the usefulness of dynamic factor models. We use Stock and Watson's (1999) out-of-sample methodology for models estimated over the 1988 : 1 - 2002 : 3 period, with balanced and unbalanced panels. We provide evidence that factors alone or combined with indicators help improve upon the simple Autoregressive (AR) model for forecasting HICP core inflation as well total inflation, if one refers to the usual criterion of "Relative MSE" together with its standard deviation. However, regarding total HICP we do not produce forecasts that are totally satisfactory {{in the sense of}} being capable of recognizing the 1999 - 2000 <b>upturn</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation</b> in a timely manner. But, from that point of view, the construction of a ''synthetic core'' indicator helps achieve significantly better forecasts over a 12 -month horizon than the AR model for total inflation for the final part of the sample. We also show that the results are rather robust to potential data-snooping. Inflation; Out-of-sample forecast; Indicator models; Dynamic factor models; Phillips curve; Euro area; Data snooping...|$|E
40|$|With {{a growth}} rate of only 1 ½ percent in real terms, {{economic}} activity was weak in the EU in 1996. The strong upturn {{after the end of}} the recession of 1992 - 93 faltered as early as in the first half of 1995 on account of unstable exchange rates, high interest rates, and restrictive fiscal policies. Demand and production remained flat until the first half of 1996. The recovery setting in then, slow and fragile at first, was mostly driven by an expansion in exports. Import demand from important trading partners of the EU, mainly the USA and East-Central Europe, was lively; at the same time, the competitive position of European exporters vis-à-vis the dollar area improved with the strengthening of the dollar. Trade between the member countries of the EU is also estimated to have expanded at a lively pace. Production expectations and business climate indicators in manufacturing improved markedly since the middle of the year. The austerity policy pursued by the majority of the EU countries at the same time – public deficits had soared after the recession of 1992 - 93 – tended to depress each country's domestic consumption and investment demand and, by dampening import demand, also export demand in other EU countries, an effect that was reinforced by the tight linkage between the EU economies. Consumer confidence was subdued in most countries. Economic growth in Europe was too weak to relieve the strains in the labor market; employment stagnated and the unemployment rate rose to 11 percent. The development of the labor market was more favorable in those countries with an above-average expansion of production and demand, such as Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Spain, and the U. K. The highest increase in the unemployment rate, by about ¾ percentage point, was recorded in Germany, France, and Sweden. The slow growth in revenues and the rise in expenditures on unemployment relief, both a result of the weakness in economic activity, impeded fast progress in the consolidation of public sector budgets. Despite comprehensive discretionary measures with regard to taxes and expenditures, public sector deficits declined only marginally to 4 ½ percent of GDP (1995 5 percent). Inflation continues to follow a downward trend. The inflation rate was 2 percent in the EU on average. The decrease was particularly pronounced in countries with high inflation; in Italy, the rate of price increase declined from 5. 6 percent in December 1995 to 2. 7 percent in December 1996.

40|$|Forecasts for the French Economy at the Dawn of 1992 M. Fouet, A. Fonteneau, E. Bleuze As {{regards the}} {{international}} environment, {{the two main}} hypotheses underlying these forecasts are {{an increase in the}} oil price, {{at an annual rate of}} 12 %, to reach $ 31 per barrel by 1992, and a recession in the United States as early as mid- 88. Combined with a moderately restrictive monetary policy, US budgetary policy is likely to be insufficient to prevent a downward cyclical movement in domestic demand, despite a positive contribution from foreign trade. Given the world trade context, international competition is predicted to become stronger. Despite an end to dollar devaluation, US products will remain competitive and the Asian exporters will be more attracted by European markets. The evolution of the French economy is likely to be affected importantly by the international environment. But the assumption concerning the split between wages and profits is of great importance too. If the moderation in the growth of wages observed for several years persists, as predicted, during the six forthcoming years, household consumption growth is expected to be weak (1. 4 % per year) and profits are likely to be used to reduce debts rather than to increase productive investment. After 1989, a pick-up in the growth of world demand and improving competitiveness due to real wage stagnation could lead to a positive contribution of foreign trade. Due to some gains of market share after several years of losses, the manufactures balance is likely to be in surplus at the beginning of the 90 s. The pick-up of investment in industry in 1984 - 1985 and in the tertiary sector since the end of 1985 is predicted to continue, sustained in the short-term by profits, and then by GDP growth (2. 3 % per year from 1989 to 1992). Overall, French economic growth seems likely to be led by exports and investment. Nominal wage rates are likely to increase at an annual rate of 3. 8 % over the period 1987 - 1992, compared with 3. 5 % for the consumer price index. Margins should continue to improve, this ending only at the end of the period because of the oil price increase, which will lead to an <b>upturn</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation.</b> The recent slowdown in productivity growth seems to a large extent to be structural, and could permit some growth of employment (+ 210 000 from 1989 to 1992). Taking into account the growth of the active population (+ 180 000 persons per year) and the effects of employment policies, the number of unemployed could reach 3. 2 million by 1992. These forecasts underline two sources of deficit for the public and social accounts : the weakness of VAT revenues and of social contributions payed on salaries. To achieve its deficit reduction objective, the government should reduce the growth of expenditure, and stop the tax cut programs launched since 1985. To emphasize how susceptible the French economy is to international development, a more favourable hypothesis is studied at the end of this article. Muet Pierre-Alain.

40|$|Confiscated Growth Département des {{diagnostics}} de l'OFCE In 1986 {{both the}} price of oil and the exchange rate of the dollar have come back to levels more in line with market equilibrium. But these have not had the expected stimulating effects. The improvements in the terms of trade — particularly large in Europe and Japan [...] have slowed down the growth of general government and corporate net debt {{at a time when many}} developing countries have been forced to adopt severe financial measures. The flow of capital to the OECD countries has been balanced by a sharp reduction of the demand from the rest of the world, while important losses of market shares were conceded to the newly-industrialising countries. The recovery of private consumption has been significant, but not enough to stimulate investment. An important portion of corporate resources has continued to flow to the financial markets, contributing to keeping real interest rates high. In 1987 and early 1988 the slackening of demand in the United States and then its contraction, will dominate the international environment. In such a context the persistence of the American external deficit will aggravate monetary, trade and financial tensions. Faced with increased external competition and weak world demand, Japan and above all Europe will suffer seriously from any additional drop of the dollar. In France the likelihood of significant growth appears limited. Household consumption growth will slow down because of low wage increases, not fully compensated by a strong growth in non-wage income. The recovery of private investment will accelerate but its pace will remain slower than the improvement in profits. The growth of final domestic demand will tend to benefit foreign more than French suppliers, who are facing hightened competition in domestic and world markets from the South-East Asian countries. The trade balance could turn negative. A 1. 7 per cent GDP growth in 1987 will not be enough to stop unemployment from rising. A more expansionist economic policy could curb this upward trend, but there is a continuing risk of any surge in demand being captured largely by foreign competitors. expected slowdown of household consumption, the near-stagnation of investment, and the weakness of exports. Destocking following involuntary stockbuilding in the second quarter of 1986 is expected to depress activity in the first part of this year, notwithstanding some strengthening of final demand. A modest pick-up is therefore not likely until the second quarter, led by investment and exports. Household consumption is likely to recover only moderately, given the weak growth of real incomes. The slowdown in the growth of world demand, projected for around the end of this year, will again limit growth in 1988. Overall, GNP seems likely to grow by 1. 7 per cent in 1987 and 1. 3 per cent in 1988. As a result only part of the considerable increase in profits in 1985 - 86 seems likely to be used for productive investment. The risk of an <b>upturn</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation</b> in France in the coming quarters seems small. The policy of strict control of public sector salaries, combined with rising unemployment, seems likely to lead to moderation in the overall growth of incomes : hourly wage rates are likely to increase by a modest 2. 8 per cent in 1987 and 2. 4 per cent in 1988. Output prices seem likely to stop growing faster than unit costs, except in the tertiary sector, which has not yet restored its margins to the levels of the 1970 s. On the assumption that {{the price of}} oil will stabilize around $ 16 per barrel at the end of the second quarter, the growth of the consumer price index will be around 2. 7 per cent in 1987 and 2. 4 per cent in 1988. Under the assumption of a progressive increase in the oil price to $ 20 by the end of 1988, inflation could be around 3 per cent both this year and next. In either case disinflation, as measured by the GNP deflator, will continue, with inflation falling from 5 per cent in 1986 to 3 per cent in 1987 and 2. 5 per cent in 1988. Despite the modest growth of domestic demand and inflation, the external surplus of goods and services recorded in 1986 (around FF 21 billion) seems likely to be smaller this year because of a reduction in the manufactures balance of FF 15 billion. The decline in international competitiveness, due to the fall of the dollar since 1985, could be expected to result in some loss of market share. Nevertheless this is likely to be limited to 1. 5 points in 1987 and 1 point in 1988, compared with 3 points over the course of the last two years. The slow growth of employment in the market sector seen in 1986 risks being interrupted because of modest growth of production and the perverse effect of the youth employment scheme "Emploi des Jeunes". It seems that a number of people were taken into employment in 1986 in anticipation of an exemption from social charges. Despite the recent new measures in respect of long-term unemployed, unemployment will continue to grow significantly. The number of unemployed could reach 2. 8 million in the spring of 1988. The pick-up of investment in industry in 1984 - 1985 seems likely to continue in the next two years (6. 5 per cent in 1987 and 5. 4 per cent in 1988 in 1970 prices for the total of non-financial enterprises). Is this likely to be sufficient ? It would seem to be so if compared with the likely growth of internal and external demand, but not if considered in relation to the now considerable capacity to finance productive investment out of retained earnings. The study reported in the last part of this article suggests that the reduction of corporation tax would probably not be effective in sparking off a significant increase in investment. For given budgetary cost a direct subsidy to productive investment in the form of a tax credit would be ten times as effective. But the benefits would be realised only over the medium term.
