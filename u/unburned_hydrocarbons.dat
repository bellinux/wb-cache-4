5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the driving}} factors in modern gas turbine design is {{reducing}} emissions, and the combustor is the primary contributor to a gas turbine's emissions. Generally speaking, there are five major types of emissions from gas turbine engines: smoke, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (UHC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx).|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} and <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{emissions in}} a {{gas turbine engine}} are reduced by bleeding hot air from the engine cycle and introducing {{it back into the}} engine upstream of the bleed location and upstream of the combustor inlet. As this hot inlet air is recycled, the combustor inlet temperature rises rapidly at a constant engine thrust level. In most combustors, this will reduce carbon monoxide and <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions significantly. The preferred locations for hot air extraction are at the compressor discharge or from within the turbine, whereas the preferred reentry location is at the compressor inlet...|$|R

Without afterburning, carbon monoxide and <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions were highest at idle and lowest at takeoff; oxides of nitrogen exhibited the reverse trend. With afterburning, carbon monoxide and <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions were greater than for military power. Carbon monoxide emissions were altitude dependent. Oxides of nitrogen emissions were less at minimum afterburning than at military power. For power levels above minimum afterburning, the oxides of nitrogen emissions were both power level and altitude dependent...|$|R
25|$|Heaters {{are also}} {{available}} for engine oil so that warm oil can immediately circulate throughout the engine during start up. The easier starting results from warmer, less viscous engine oil and less condensation of fuel on cold metal surfaces inside the engine; thus an engine block heater reduces a vehicle's emission of <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and carbon monoxide; also heat is available more instantly for the passenger compartment and glass defogging.|$|E
25|$|As FAME {{contains}} {{low levels}} of sulfur, the emissions of sulfur oxides and sulfates, major components of acid rain, are low. Use of biodiesel also results in reductions of <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter. CO emissions using biodiesel are substantially reduced, {{on the order of}} 50% compared to most petrodiesel fuels. The exhaust emissions of particulate matter from biodiesel {{have been found to be}} 30% lower than overall particulate matter emissions from petrodiesel. The exhaust emissions of total hydrocarbons (a contributing factor in the localized formation of smog and ozone) are up to 93% lower for biodiesel than diesel fuel.|$|E
25|$|Advancements in {{combustor}} technology {{focused on}} several distinct areas; emissions, operating range, and durability. Early jet engines produced {{large amounts of}} smoke, so early combustor advances, in the 1950s, were aimed at reducing the smoke produced by the engine. Once smoke was essentially eliminated, efforts turned in the 1970s to reducing other emissions, like <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and carbon monoxide (for more details, see the Emissions section below). The 1970s also saw improvement in combustor durability, as new manufacturing methods improved liner (see Components below) lifetime by nearly 100 times that of early liners. In the 1980s combustors began to improve their efficiency across the whole operating range; combustors tended to be highly efficient (99%+) at full power, but that efficiency dropped off at lower settings. Development over that decade improved efficiencies at lower levels. The 1990s and 2000s saw a renewed focus on reducing emissions, particularly nitrogen oxides. Combustor technology is still being actively researched and advanced, and much modern research focuses on improving the same aspects.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{of the influence}} of hydrogen enrichment on the combustion and emission characteristics of an n-heptane fuelled homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine was numerically investigated using a multi-zone model. The model calculation successfully captured the most available experimental data. The results show that hydrogen addition retards combustion phasing of an n-heptane fuelled HCCI engine due to the dilution and chemical effects, with the dilution effect being more significant. It is because of the chemical effect that combustion duration is reduced at a constant compression ratio if an appropriate amount of hydrogen is added. As a result of retarded combustion phasing and reduced combustion duration, hydrogen addition increases indicated thermal efficiency at a constant combustion phasing. Hydrogen addition reduces indicated specific <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions, but slightly increases normalized <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions that are defined as the emissions per unit burned n-heptane mass. The increase in normalized <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions is caused by the presence of more remaining hydrocarbons that compete with hydrogen for some key radicals during high temperature combustion stage. At a given hydrogen addition level, N 2 O emissions increases with overly retarding combustion phasing, but hydrogen addition moderates this increase in N 2 O emissions.

2500|$|The {{shape of}} the Wankel {{combustion}} chamber is more resistant to preignition operating on lower-octane rating gasoline than a comparable piston engine. The combustion chamber shape may also lead to relatively incomplete combustion of the air-fuel charge. This {{would result in a}} larger amount of <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in NOx emissions, because combustion temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of some inherent exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in early engines. Sir Harry Ricardo showed in the 1920s that for every 1% increase in the proportion of exhaust gas in the admission mix, there is a 7°C reduction in flame temperature. This allowed Mazda to meet the United States Clean Air Act of 1970 in 1973, with a simple and inexpensive [...] "thermal reactor", which was an enlarged chamber in the exhaust manifold. By decreasing the air-fuel ratio, <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (HC) in the exhaust would support combustion in the thermal reactor. Piston-engine cars required expensive catalytic converters to deal with both <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and NOx emissions. This inexpensive solution increased fuel consumption, which was already a weak point for the Wankel engine, and the oil crisis of 1973 raised the price of gasoline. Toyota discovered that injection of air into the exhaust port zone improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The best results were obtained with holes in the side plates; doing it in the exhaust duct had no noticeable influence. The use of a three-stage catalysts, with air supplied in the middle, as for two-stroke piston engines, also proved beneficial.|$|E

2500|$|Slow {{combustion}}. Fuel combustion is slow, {{because the}} combustion chamber is long, thin, and moving.

The trailing side of the combustion chamber naturally produces a [...] "squeeze stream" [...] that prevents the flame from reaching the chamber trailing edge. Fuel injection, in which fuel is injected towards {{the leading edge of the}} combustion chamber, can minimize the amount of unburnt fuel in the exhaust. Where piston engines have an expanding combustion chamber for the burning fuel as its oxidized and decreasing pressure as the piston travels toward the bottom of the cylinder during the power stroke is offset by additional leverage of the piston on the crankshaft during the first half of that travel, there is no additional [...] "leverage" [...] of a rotor on the [...] "crankshaft" [...] during combustion and the [...] "crankshaft" [...] has no increased leverage to power the rotor through the intake, compression and exhaust phases of its cycle.|$|E

In this review, the bioethanol production techniques from different lignocellulosic biomass, and its potential ethanol yield are studied. Moreover, this paper has reviewed the effects of bioethanol fuel blends on spark ignition engine combustion characteristics (i. e. cylinder pressure, cylinder temperature, flame speed, combustion efficiency, combustion duration, heat release rate, knocking and cold start); engine performance parameters (i. e. torque, brake power, brake specific fuel consumption, brake mean effective pressure, brake thermal efficiency and volumetric efficiency); and emission characteristics (i. e. carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, <b>unburned</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and other unregulated emissions).
