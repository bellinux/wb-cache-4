40|$|Ortega-Farias, S. O. Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias, Escuela de Agronomia, Universidad de Talca, 747 Casilla, Talca, Chile. The Penman method using hourly {{and daily}} weather data was {{evaluated}} to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration over a well-established stand of <b>Alta</b> <b>fescue</b> under different atmospheric conditions. The {{performance of the}} Penman equation was evaluated using evapotranspiration measured by the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method. Good agreement between the BREB method and Penman using hourly weather data was observed. On an hourly basis, the overall {{standard error of estimate}} (SEE) and absolute relative error (ARE) were 0. 06 mms. h - 1 (40. 8 Ws. m - 2) and 5. 2 %, respectively. On a daily basis, the SEE was 0. 55 mms. d - 1 and the ARE was 6. 9 %. The SEE and ARE for the Penman model using daily weather data were 0. 74 mms. d - 1 and 9. 8 %, respectively. These results suggest that the accuracy of the Penman equation could improve if hourly weather data were used as inputs and strongly suggest that the Penman equation with hourly weather data could be used in the Willamette Valley to predict daily evapotranspiration for irrigation purposes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Effluent from an {{anaerobic}} swine manure lagoon {{was applied}} {{at the upper}} end of six, 100 feet (30. 5 m) long by 3 feet (0. 9 m) wide, grass-covered plots which sloped about 3 percent. The objectives were to measure concentration attenuation and mass reduction of potential pollutants in the wastewater as the result of overland flow, and to examine the influences of experimental variables on the effectiveness of the overland flow wastewater treatment process. Controlled variables included application rate and frequency, and grass species. Seasonal differences in temperature, precipitation, and related physical, chemical and biological conditions were uncontrolled variables. Wastewater and soil horizons were sampled and analyzed at selected plot intervals, and plot runoff volume, air temperature, precipitation, and water table data were recorded. Applied wastewater amounts ranged from 2. 0 to 10. 8 inches (5, 1 to 27. 4 cm) per week. Attenuation occurred for oxygen-demanding materials, ammonia nitrogen, phosphorus, total solids, turbidity, salinity, conductivity and fecal coliform bacteria during both cool-wet and warm-dry climatic periods. The concentration of most measured parameters changed linearly with distance of overland flow. Dilution by emerging groundwater (composed partially of wastewater subsequent to plot surface and subsurface treatment) was a major cause for concentration attenuation. Averaged mass reductions of COD, PO₄, and inorganic nitrogen were 47, 40,and 38 percent, respectively, during high application rates, and 72, 78 and 75 percent, respectively, during low application rates. Extractable soil phosphorus, potassium and ammonium concentrations increased greatly during the 13 -month investigative period whereas extractable calcium, magnesium and sodium concentrations increased slightly. <b>Alta</b> <b>fescue</b> grass grew well throughout the period of study whereas redtop grass progressively died from the upper to {{the lower end of the}} plots during the first five months of operation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Copper {{deficiency}} and Mo-induced Cu deficiency are nutrition {{problems of}} ruminant livestock in the Burns and Klamath Falls area of Oregon. Chemical analysis {{of plant and}} soil samples was used to survey Cu and Mo levels in forage in these areas. The objectives were to assess the possibility of animal nutrition problems and to study the relationship between forage levels of Cu and Mo and plant species, stage of plant maturity, time of growing season, management factors, and soil characteristics. A total of approximately 400 plant samples was collected during the 1972 grazing season. The samples from Burns were taken from an alfalfa maturity experiment, improved pastures, native meadows, and a forage nursery. The legumes sampled were alfalfa (Medicago sativa), Ladino clover (Trifolium repens), and sainfoin (Onobrychis viciaefolia). Grasses sampled were Fawn tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), Manchar brome (Bromus inermis), Greenar and Oahe intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium), wildrye (Elymus triticoides), Rush (Juncus sp.), and Sedge (Carex sp.). The Klamath samples were from an <b>Alta</b> tall <b>fescue</b> (Festuca arundinacea) -quack-grass (Agropyron repens) comparison and from 13 sites {{on a variety of}} pastures throughout the area. In addition to alfalfa, clover, sedge, rush, <b>Alta</b> <b>fescue</b> and quackgrass, the species sampled were Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), and meadow foxtail (Alopecuris pratensis). Most of the sites were clipped periodically to simulate grazing and were sampled at two week intervals from May through August. Plant analysis was valuable for indicating the type of livestock nutrition problem encountered in a particular area. The Burns forage contained high levels of Mo and a Mo-induced Cu deficiency is probable. The survey in the Klamath area identified two sites on muck soils with potentially toxic Mo levels. Several sites had such low Cu levels that uncomplicated Cu deficiency may be a problem in livestock. A wide range of values was encountered and forage analysis would be valuable for identifying problems on a local basis. Large differences were found in Cu and Mo levels between plant species. Legumes contained much higher levels of Cu and Mo than did grasses. Changes in maturity, or clipping interval, had different effects on Cu and Mo content for grasses and legumes. Alfalfa was found to decrease in Cu and Mo content with increased maturity. However, legumes in pastures maintained relatively constant levels through the grazing season. Many grasses were found to decrease markedly in Cu levels, and some to increase in Mo levels as the season progressed. This may result in a reduction in the Cu/Mo ratio through the season. Forage analysis was shown to be a valuable technique for identifying potential Cu and Mo livestock nutrition problems and for investigating environmental and management factors which may regulate Cu and Mo levels in forage plants...|$|R

Se estudiaron 37 escolares prepuberales obesos (IMC ? p 95), de ambos sexos, entre 6 y 12 años, con técnicas antropométricas, imagenológicas (US y TC) y de laboratorio (glicemia, insulinemia).

Childhood {{obesity is}} increasing {{over the world}} with serious health consequences. Intraabdominal fat is associated to some metabolic alterations in obesity. It does not exist a standard imaging method to measure adipose tissue in children. Objectives: In obese children to study the association between insulinemia and subcutaneous or intraabdominal fat evaluated by ultrasonographic (US) or computed tomography (CT). Subjects and Methods. 37 obese (BMI ? p 95) prepubertal obese children (ages from 6 to 12 years) were assessed using anthropometric, US and CT for fat areas and linear intrabdominal segments measurements. Laboratory techniques were also performed: insulinemia and glycemia. Results. We found good correlations between US and TC intra-abdominal adipose tissue measurements (r= 0, 79; p< 0, 001). US (r= 0. 56) and CT (r= 0. 53) visceral fat assessment had better correlations with insulinemia than anthropometric measurements (BMI, r= 0, 33; waist, r= 0. 42). Conclusions.
