25|$|After {{centuries of}} being mostly absent in post-medieval European culture, Morgan became {{very popular in}} the 20th and 21st century. Her {{character}} and role in the modern works varies greatly, but <b>usually</b> <b>she</b> is portrayed as a villain, often associated with Mordred as either being his mother or in different aspect.|$|E
25|$|The Chancellor's powers {{tended to}} be {{reinforced}} {{by the fact that}} wars required funds that were appropriated by the Senate. The richer nobles who controlled the Senate were usually loath to increase and levy taxes upon themselves, which meant that Poland herself very rarely declared wars. <b>Usually</b> <b>she</b> was attacked by her neighbors, and while she repelled all attacks till the end of the 18th century, she almost never exploited her victories. The army was undermanned and underequipped (since usually any suggestion to augment the military budget when an enemy was not on the Commonwealth's doorstep was labeled as warmongering) and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's lands were constantly ravaged by new invasions that crippled the economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty develop approximately at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within months. Depending upon the daily-life physical activities required of the woman, the breast augmentation patient usually resumes her normal life at 1-week post-operative. Moreover, women whose breast implants were emplaced beneath the chest muscles (submuscular placement) {{usually have a}} longer, slightly more painful convalescence, because of the healing of the incisions to the chest muscles. <b>Usually,</b> <b>she</b> does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for approximately 6 weeks. During the initial post-operative recovery, the woman is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arm to alleviate pain and discomfort; if required, analgesic indwelling medication catheters can alleviate pain Moreover, significantly improved patient recovery has resulted from refined breast-device implantation techniques (submuscular, subglandular) that allow 95 per cent of women to resume their normal lives at 24-hours post-procedure, without bandages, fluid drains, pain pumps, catheters, medical support brassières, or narcotic pain medication.|$|E
50|$|Clea Raymond is {{a talented}} photojournalist and the {{daughter}} of high-profile parents. <b>Usually</b> <b>she’s</b> in total control of her camera, but after Clea’s father disappears while on a humanitarian mission, eerie, shadowy images of a strange and handsome young man begin to appear in Clea’s photos—a man she has never seen in her life.|$|R

25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of taking any chance at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; <b>usually</b> <b>she</b> ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|E
500|$|Brooks tolerated Barney's casual affairs {{well enough}} to tease her about them, and had {{a few of her}} own over the years, but could become jealous when a new love became serious. [...] <b>Usually</b> <b>she</b> simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an {{ultimatum}} to choose between her and Dolly Wilde—relenting once Barney had given in. At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, {{she did not want to}} live with her as a full-time couple; she disliked Paris, disdained Barney's friends, hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived, and felt that she was fully herself only when alone. To accommodate Brooks's need for solitude they built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a dining room, which they called Villa Trait d'Union, the hyphenated villa. [...] Brooks also spent much of the year in Italy or travelling elsewhere in Europe, away from Barney. They remained devoted to one another for over fifty years.|$|E
