5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among <b>users</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on {{the setting of the}} cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E

Combining TIN with the topological interference management (TIM) framework that identifies optimal interference avoidance schemes, a baseline TIM-TIN approach is proposed which decomposes a network into TIN and TIM components, allocates the signal power levels to each <b>user</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TIN component, allocates signal vector space dimensions to each <b>user</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TIM component, and guarantees that {{the product of the}} two is an achievable number of signal dimensions available to each <b>user</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original network.

5|$|By {{the time}} Space Travel was fully ported to the PDP-7, Thompson had {{expanded}} his software suite to a full, basic operating system, {{in a way}} he had been unable to with the Multics project and the GE 635. The operating system he designed spread to other <b>users</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company, and formed the core of what would be named in 1970 the Unix operating system. Space Travel was one of the early mainframe games developed before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was never distributed beyond its initial locations. As a result, it had no effect on future video games, and its primary legacy is that of sparking the creation of Unix.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, a Spanish Learjet {{operated}} by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and {{collided with a}} van heading eastward on the A40 Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that both the crew's lack of understanding English and military air traffic control procedures had {{contributed significantly to the}} crash. Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, aggregate-filled safety pits were installed {{at each end of the}} runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road <b>users</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of another business jet or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway. The House of Commons Transport Select Committee considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and eventually progressed no further.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} <b>users</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more popular walking {{areas in the}} Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Certain rights of way have been damaged by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} industry in Croatia is {{regulated by the}} Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM). HAKOM was established by the Electronic Communications Act of 26 June 2008; pursuant to Article 5 of the act, HAKOM is tasked with promoting and safeguarding market competition {{and the interests of}} service <b>users</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of electronic communication services and infrastructure, while contributing {{to the development of the}} internal market of the European Union. HAKOM's goals include ensuring sustainable development of the electronic communications market at affordable prices for consumers, providing fair conditions for return on investment in the market and contributing to the quality of life in Croatia. Further regulation of the television is performed by the Electronic Media Council, which enacts mandatory regulation applying to both state-run and privately owned broadcasters based in Croatia. One such regulation, aimed at protection of minors, restricts depictions of violence, sexual intercourse, profanity, use of intoxicating substances and tobacco and other scenes which may be harmful to development of minors between seven in the morning and nine, ten or eleven in the evening, depending on rating of specific programmeadvising that the programme is not suitable for persons under 12, 15 or 18 years of age respectively.
