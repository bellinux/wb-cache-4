New chemicals measured for the first time include one serum polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), three serum polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), five polybrominated dioxins, and five polybrominated furans. Chemicals with updated data in this release are the serum dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like chemicals, serum PBDEs and PBB 153, serum organochlorine pesticides, urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites of organophosphorus pesticides, and urinary phytoestrogens and metabolites.

Specifically, for each DB table it extracts: DB <b>name,</b> <b>table</b> <b>name,</b> and a nominal descriptor (most DB management systems permit storing a description for tables); for each DB column it extracts: DB <b>name,</b> <b>table</b> <b>name,</b> column name, data type, an indication if the column participates in the primary key, and a nominal descriptor; and for each relation between tables it extracts: DB name, column <b>name</b> of the <b>table</b> referred, <b>name</b> of the <b>table</b> referred, column <b>name</b> of the referring <b>table,</b> and <b>name</b> of the referring table.|$|R
