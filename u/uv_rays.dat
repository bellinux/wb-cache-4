25|$|The shallowness of orca tanks forces orcas {{to spend}} a lot of time at the surface. So much time at the surface leads to {{prolonged}} exposure to ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>rays.</b> Prolonged exposure to the surface and <b>UV</b> <b>rays</b> is attributed to sunburns and the development of cataracts in orcas in captivity. Orcas in the wild would live at higher latitudes, meaning less intense sun, and spend more time in deeper, darker waters. While it is uncertain the effects of prolonged UV exposure to orcas' skin, since captive orca necropsies are extremely secretive, it seems logical that prolonged exposure to <b>UV</b> <b>rays</b> on unprotected skin would have the same negative effects such as melanoma (skin cancer) on orcas as it does on humans.|$|E

Blends of liquid crystal are of great interest because of their unique optical properties.

The polymerization process using uv curing techniques by irradiation <b>UV</b> <b>ray</b> and without irradiation <b>UV</b> <b>ray.</b> Polymerization of blending liquid crystal acrylate using initiator 2 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropane. Based on peak at GPC curve of polymerization by irradiation <b>UV</b> <b>ray,</b> type of that polymer is copolymer. Therefore the polymerization without <b>UV</b> <b>ray,</b> type of that polymer is homopolymer. SEM images of liquid crystal acrylate polymer showed lamella chain models that are characteristic of a polymer chains. Type of polymer liquid crystal acrylate {{was the type of}} Side Chain Liquid Crystalline Polymers (SCLCPs). Therefore acrylate polymer liquid crystal in this research has semi-crystalline phase, which contained crystalline phase and amorphous phase on the XRD pattern. The results of FT-IR spectroscopic characterization of the two monomers showed a peak at the wave number of 1600. 43 cm - 1 and 1622. 86 cm- 1 which indicates a double bond (C=C) were obtained from acrylation. While the spectroscopy on the product blending the wave number of the peak regions is reduced that shows that carbon double bonds (C=C) in the acrylate group has polymerized. It also strengthened with a very sharp peak for CC functional groups on the wave number of 2855. 15 cm- 1.
