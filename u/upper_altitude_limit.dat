This kind of transfer is particularly noted in the Rapa Valley. In general, the transition between the conifer forests and the ones consisting of birch is more or less gradual, with the number of birches present in the coniferous forests increasing along with the altitude until the conifers have completely disappeared.

40|$|Physical {{processes}} which affect {{stratospheric aerosol}} particles include nucleation, condensation, evaporation, coagulation and sedimentation. Quantitative studies of these mechanisms {{to determine if}} they can account for some of the observed properties of the aerosol are carried out. It is shown that the altitude range in which nucleation of sulfuric acid-water solution droplets can take place corresponds to that region of the stratosphere where the aerosol is generally found. Since heterogeneous nucleation is the dominant nucleation mechanism, the stratospheric solution droplets are mainly formed on particles which have been mixed up from the troposphere or injected into the stratosphere by volcanoes or meteorites. Particle growth by heteromolecular condensation can account for the observed increase in mixing ratio of large particles in the stratosphere. Coagulation is important in reducing the number of particles smaller than 0. 05 micron radius. Growth by condensation, applied to the mixed nature of the particles, shows that available information is consistent with ammonium sulfate being formed by liquid phase chemical reactions in the aerosol particles. The <b>upper</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limit</b> of the aerosol layer is probably due to the evaporation of sulfuric acid aerosol particles, while the lower limit is due to mixing across the tropopause...|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs) {{are subject}} to {{altitude}} propagation limits which are governed by the diffusion processes. Diffusion times and scales which exceed the wave period and wavelength define the limiting domain for AGWs. An expression is presented which defines the <b>upper</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limit</b> to which AGWs can propagate given vertical diffusion constraints of the atmosphere. Airglow, lidar, and radar measurements are combined to characterize the intrinsic AGW parameters in the 80 – 105 km altitude region. A subset of AGWs (17) observed by airglow imagers during the ALOHA‐ 93 were made when simultaneous wind measurements were available and intrinsic wave parameters were calculated. The limiting altitude of propagation for these measured monochromatic waves is calculated to range from 110 – 150 km (with a mean limiting altitude of 130 km). The altitude limit is necessarily lower for waves with short vertical wavelengths and longer intrinsic periods. This observation is important for {{a large number of}} issues including energetic considerations regarding thermospheric heating in models which consider upward propagating AGWs (and energy flux) of tropospheric origin. This limited data base should be expanded for statistical significance in future work...|$|E

40|$|Section Sideritis is an {{extremely}} diversi®ed group which is formed mainly by species growing at low altitude. The group of high altitude taxa of this section is polyphyletic and has been taxonomically divided in diVerent subsections in which these taxa appear normally associated with low-lying planitiary ones, the latter being the probable ancestors. The subsections comprising high altitude taxa are: subsect. Gymnocarpae, subsect. Fruticulosae; subsect. Hyssopi-foliae, subsect. Luridae; subsect. Borgiae and subsect. Aranensis.

40|$|NASA's Orion Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) Project {{is now in}} the {{qualification}} {{phase of}} testing, and the Adams simulation has continued to evolve to model the complex dynamics experienced during the test article extraction and separation phases of flight. The ability to initiate tests near the <b>upper</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limit</b> of the Orion parachute deployment envelope requires extractions from the aircraft at 35, 000 ft-MSL. Engineering development phase testing of the Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV) carried by the Carriage Platform Separation System (CPSS) at altitude resulted in test support equipment hardware failures due to increased energy caused by higher true airspeeds. As a result, hardware modifications became a necessity requiring ground static testing of the textile components to be conducted and a new ground dynamic test of the extraction system to be devised. Force-displacement curves from static tests were incorporated into the Adams simulations, allowing prediction of loads, velocities and margins encountered during both flight and ground dynamic tests. The Adams simulation was then further refined by fine tuning the damping terms to match the peak loads recorded in the ground dynamic tests. The failure observed in flight testing was successfully replicated in ground testing and true safety margins of the textile components were revealed. A multi-loop energy modulator was then incorporated into the system level Adams simulation model and the effect on improving test margins be properly evaluated leading to high confidence ground verification testing of the final design solution...|$|E
40|$|Backscatter data {{collected}} with a 398 MHz phased-array radar operated at Homer, Alaska (59. 72 deg N, 151. 53 deg W) have been analyzed {{for information on}} the height of radar auroral echoing. Altitude was resolved through the variation of backscattered power with antenna beam elevation angle. The mean height of backscattering could be determined with an accuracy of 1 - 2 km over small ((TURN) 20 x 20 km(2 ̆ 72)) areas and short ((TURN) 1 min) periods. In this thesis, the results are presented in the form of maps of the spatial distribution of echo height.;The data base encompassed approximately 40 hrs of observation carried out in 1973, 1976, and 1978. Echo activity most often spanned a 10 - 20 km range of height centered on 100 - 110 km. The echoing region was always sharply bounded from below at 96 - 98 km. The <b>upper</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limit</b> of echo activity was 115 - 120 km. The height range in events of the post-midnight sector was 97 - 110 km vs. 97 - 118 km in events of the pre-midnight sector. Echoing was restricted to directions nearly perpendicular to the geomagnetic field, giving rise to systematic spatial and temporal variations of height. Magnetic aspect control of echo height was weaker in events of discrete radar aurora.;The height range of the Homer echo activity is shown to be consistent with the onset of primary two-stream plasma instability within auroral electrojet current. The modulation of height within the altitude limits of echo activity by the magnetic aspect geometry is attributed to strong directional confinement of plasma wave growth. It is suggested that the spatial and temporal variabilities of radar auroral altitude derive from structure within auroral ionization and variability of auroral electrojet current...|$|E

40|$|The Space Station Freedom (SSF) {{altitude}} strategy provides {{guidelines and}} assumptions to determine an altitude profile for Freedom. The process for determining an altitude profile incorporates several {{factors such as}} where the Space Shuttle will rendezvous with the SSF, when reboosts must occur, and what atmospheric conditions exist causing decay. The altitude strategy {{has an influence on}} all areas of SSF development and mission planning. The altitude strategy directly affects the micro-gravity environment for experiments, propulsion and control system sizing, and Space Shuttle delivery manifests. Indirectly the altitude strategy influences almost every system and operation within the Space Station Program. Evolution of the SSF altitude strategy has been a very dynamic process over the past few years. Each altitude strategy in turn has emphasized a different consideration. Examples include a constant Space Shuttle rendezvous altitude for mission planning simplicity, or constant micro-gravity levels with its inherent emphasis on payloads, or lifetime altitudes to provide a safety buffer to loss of control conditions. Currently a new altitude strategy is in development. This altitude strategy will emphasize Space Shuttle delivery optimization. Since propellant is counted against Space Shuttle payload-to-orbit capacity, lowering the rendezvous altitude will not always increase the net payload-to-orbit, since more propellant would be required for reboost. This altitude strategy will also consider altitude biases to account for Space Shuttle launch slips and an unexpected worsening of atmospheric conditions. Safety concerns will define a lower operational <b>altitude</b> <b>limit,</b> while radiation levels will define <b>upper</b> <b>altitude</b> constraints.
