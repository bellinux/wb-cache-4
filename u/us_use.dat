In 1996, the U.S. had proven helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM). At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM {{per year in the}} U.S.; see pie chart below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of <b>U.S.</b> <b>use,</b> and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers.|$|E

25|$|To enforce speed limits, two {{approaches}} are generally employed. In the United States, {{it is common}} for the police to patrol the streets and use special equipment (typically a radar unit) to measure the speed of vehicles, and pull over any vehicle found to be in violation of the speed limit. In Brazil, Colombia and some European countries, there are computerized speed-measuring devices spread throughout the city, which will automatically detect speeding drivers and take a photograph of the license plate (or number plate), which is later used for applying and mailing the ticket. Many jurisdictions in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>use</b> this technology as well.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, ECT {{is usually}} given {{three times a}} week; in the United Kingdom, it is usually given twice a week. Occasionally it is given on a daily basis. A course usually {{consists}} of 6–12 treatments, but may be more or fewer. Following a course of ECT some patients may be given continuation or maintenance ECT with further treatments at weekly, fortnightly or monthly intervals. A few psychiatrists in the <b>US</b> <b>use</b> multiple-monitored ECT (MMECT), where patients receive more than one treatment per anesthetic. Electroconvulsive therapy is not a required subject in US medical schools and not a required skill in psychiatric residency training. Privileging for ECT practice at institutions is a local option: no national certification standards are established, and no ECT-specific continuing training experiences are required of ECT practitioners.|$|E
25|$|If {{energy for}} {{hydrogen}} production were available (from wind, solar, fission or fusion nuclear power etc.), {{use of the}} substance for hydrocarbon synfuel production could expand captive use of hydrogen {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10. Present <b>U.S.</b> <b>use</b> of hydrogen for hydrocracking is roughly 4Mt per year. It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil. Coal liquefaction would present significantly worse emissions of carbon dioxide than does the current system of burning fossil petroleum, but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in US oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in North America.|$|E

25|$|The National Center for Health Statistics {{says that}} {{national}} birth rates for teenagers are at historic lows – during 2007–2010, teen birth rates fell 17% nationally;. West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers. A study by West Virginia's Marshall University showed that 19% of babies {{born in the}} state have evidence of drug or alcohol exposure. This is several times the national rate, where studies show that about 5.9% of pregnant women in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>use</b> illicit drugs, and about 8.5% consume any alcohol. An Institute for Health Policy Research study determined that mortality rates in Appalachia are correlated with coal production. In twenty West Virginia coal counties mining more than 1 million tons of coal per year and having a total population of 850,000, there are about 10,100 deaths per year, with 1,400 of those statistically attributed to deaths from heart, respiratory and kidney disease from living in an Appalachian coal county.|$|E

The project was then taken over by the Ordnance Department and was tested at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in early 1943. Other, more robust light tanks were being produced at the time, and {{there was no need for}} stop-gap solutions so the prototypes were rejected for <b>U.S.</b> <b>use</b> in May 1943.|$|E

500|$|A report {{commissioned}} by the United Nations, based on a detailed review of published research up to mid-2009 {{as well as the}} input of independent experts world-wide, found that ethanol from sugar cane as produced in Brazil [...] "in some circumstances does better than just “zero emission”. If grown and processed correctly, it has negative emission, pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere, rather than adding it. In contrast, the report found that <b>U.S.</b> <b>use</b> of maize for biofuel is less efficient, as sugarcane [...] can lead to emissions reductions of between 70% and well over 100% when substituted for gasoline. Several other studies have shown that sugarcane-based ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 86 to 90% if there is no significant land use change.|$|E

Citing Mandela's speech in which he said, [...] "Let <b>us</b> <b>use</b> the universal language of music, to sing out our message around the world", Lennox wanted [...] "Sing" [...] to be an anthem and symbol of unity and empowerment, to help spread awareness in the world. [...] "Because the incidence of HIV AIDS {{is on the rise}} for women, especially in the pandemic across the whole of the African continent, I thought perhaps I could be of benefit by writing a song and empowering those women who do not have an international voice," [...] the singer clarified.|$|E
500|$|The {{first guest}} stars {{to appear on}} the show were actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway, reuniting for their first joint TV project in 33 years since the 1960s sitcom McHale's Navy. They {{appeared}} as SpongeBob's favorite superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively. Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's creative director, enjoyed the actors' roles in McHale's Navy, and they already wanted the two to provide the voices of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy when they were voice casting. Hillenburg and Drymon directly approached Borgnine and Conway, and the actors both accepted. When coming up for the right voice of Mermaid Man, Borgnine cracked his voice by mistake when he was saying [...] "evil!" [...] He said, [...] "By golly! We started something... and we kept [...] in." [...] Rock band Ghastly Ones were the first guest stars to appear as themselves, appearing to perform the song [...] "SpongeBob ScaredyPants" [...] in the first-season episode [...] "Scaredy Pants."

500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let <b>us</b> <b>use</b> the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'" [...] In an interview with the British magazine Rock Sound, Lee further explained the concept which was related with his departure: ...|$|E
