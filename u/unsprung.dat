5|$|For , Rindt's {{partner at}} Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill {{had left the}} team to drive for Rob Walker's {{customer}} franchise. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix {{of the season in}} South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, one {{on each side of the}} cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce <b>unsprung</b> weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.|$|E
5|$|When the Central London Railway {{opened in}} 1900, it used {{camel-back}} electric locomotives hauling six-car trains. The locomotives weighed 44 tons and were largely <b>unsprung,</b> causing severe vibration problems in properties near the line. In {{an effort to}} resolve the problem, four of the coaches were fitted with motors, in the first trial in Britain of the Sprague-Thomson-Houston multiple unit control system. The trials were a success, and multiple unit trains were running by 1903. Two of the trial cars, numbers 201 and 202, were retained {{and became the first}} ballast motor cars to work on the Underground. They worked in this form until about 1910, when batteries were fitted. They were renumbered L22 and L23 in 1929, and were scrapped in 1936 and 1937.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} railway opened, {{complaints}} about vibrations from passing trains {{began to be}} made by occupiers of buildings along the route. The vibrations were caused by the heavy, largely <b>unsprung</b> locomotives which weighed 44tons (44.7tonnes). The Board of Trade set up a committee to investigate the problem, and the CLR experimented with two solutions. For the first solution, three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension, so the weight was reduced to 31tons (31.5tonnes), more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations; for the second solution, two six-carriage trains were formed that had the two end carriages converted and provided with driver's cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive. The lighter locomotives did reduce the vibrations felt at the surface, but the multiple units removed it almost completely and the CLR chose to adopt that solution. The committee's report, published in 1902, also found that the CLR's choice of 100lb/yard (49.60kg/m) bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer bullhead rail on cross sleepers contributed to the vibration.|$|E
40|$|In-wheel type permanent-magnet {{synchronous}} motors {{for electric}} commuter cars {{are required to}} be compact and light to use limited wheel space effectively and reduce <b>unspringing</b> weight. Therefore, our previous papers presented a low-cost in-wheel axial-gap motor that uses ferrite permanent magnets. This motor adopted an open slot structure to reduce production costs. However, to achieve further size and weight reduction, we examine here in detail {{the adoption of a}} semiclosed slot structure instead of an open slot structure. Experimental results show that the semiclosed slot structure is effective in realizing size and weight reduction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a method}} for {{reducing}} <b>unspring</b> mass as well as improving safety and ride properties of vehicles driven by in-wheel motors will be provided. To begin with, the advantages of vehicles armed with in-wheel motors will be described, after which some drawbacks of this idea will be studied. Then, to getting a better analysis, quarter car model will be studied in frequency domain. Gain of body acceleration and wheel dynamic load, which can be equal to ride property and safety performance respectively, will be compared. Finally, an idea that makes the drive motor suspend will be proposed for enhancing the two properties and then a LQG controller will be provided for further optimization. Through the comparison in time domain and frequency domain, one can {{come to a conclusion}} that vehicles driven by suspended motors not only simplified the structures but also can be used as an absorber for vibration reduction...|$|R
5000|$|... 4. The camera {{displays}} a road with a pop-up steel grate intended {{to block the}} Road Runner; Wile tests its crank control successfully, but it fails to deploy against the speeding Road Runner. The Coyote unsuccessfully tries numerous methods of <b>unspringing</b> the grate, then resumes the chase in outrage and is soon stopped by a railroad crossing. The Road Runner taunts his nemesis as he slowly prances the tracks, and the coyote is lifted into the air by the striped divider. After falling back down, Wile E. chases the Road Runner down the tracks, which run through mountains. The two pass by opposite lanes and the Road Runner signals the coyote, who stops cold {{after a few seconds}} and turns back, and after again running past the bird, he reverses only to find the Road Runner has escaped to a lower track. When he finally pursues the bird across the correct track, Wile is stopped by a train, and dashes {{in and out of a}} rockface; he sees the train proceed across an inferior track, and sighs with relief until a second train approaches from inside the rock. The apoplectic coyote holds up a circular STOP IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY sign, but since Wile E. isnt human, nothing happens except for the crash.|$|R
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower <b>unsprung</b> weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
25|$|A serious {{design fault}} in these {{locomotives}} was their very high <b>unsprung</b> weight of 33 tons. Geared motors {{had not been}} used as it was {{thought they would be}} noisy in the confines of a tunnel. This resulted in serious problems with noise and vibration. Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the <b>unsprung</b> weight to 11 tons.|$|E
25|$|Formula One cars {{must have}} four {{uncovered}} wheels, all {{made of the}} same metallic material, which {{must be one of}} two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA. Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum <b>unsprung</b> rotating weight reduction.|$|E
40|$|In the article, {{the author}} {{analyzes}} the current {{problems of the}} struggles during {{the past six months}} in Ukraine, united by the common name «Euromaydan». The author proposed to distinguish «Euromaydan» from «Maydan» because of a change in the rhetoric of the requirements of <b>unsprings.</b> And also because of biopolitical nature of these requirements, a revolutionary anti – system direction of the protest movement of «Maydan» author recommended to take a biopolitical project «multitude» of  M. Hardt and A. Negri as basis for the analysis of the mentioned phenomena. The author analyzes these terms in detail: multitude is a new social object that formed due to {{the emergence of a new}} type of production that is not material. Multitude is opposed to the classical understanding of the masses and not translated only as «plurality». In multitude the singularities (individuals) do not lose their creative and productive character. They are capable of self­organization and included into multitude thanks to conception of common rather than identity. Structure of «Euromaydan» and «Maydan» is equal to network structure multitude which is without any center. «Informational Age» (M. Castells) allows to keep hyper ­ identity like changing identities, this hyper ­ identity is expressed in the relationship «multitude – singularity». Owing to social networks, which were used during the «Euromaydan» and «Maydan», singularities can keep the creative and active nature. The author emphasizes that the proposed analysis is not exhaustive, and such complete analysis is not possible because of the problem of completeness phenomena «Euromaydan» and «Maydan»...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and <b>unspring</b> parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of castle nuts, retaining washers, locking washers, serrated washers, check plates, disposable clamps. Using FS-nuts allow providing the rating rules for next generation of rolling stock. Besides the modern technologies of FS-nuts production provide their prolonged running time under the conditions of pollution, humidity, differential temperature and other adverse factors...|$|R
25|$|Many early {{implementations}} for automobiles {{located the}} brakes on the inboard side of the driveshaft, near the differential, while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An inboard location reduces the <b>unsprung</b> weight and eliminates a source of heat transfer to the tires.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} modification was the fitting of a stronger rear differential {{to handle the}} increased engine power. A Salisbury 4HU unit with inboard disc brakes to reduce <b>unsprung</b> weight was chosen instead of the old E.N.V. unit. It was the same unit used on the Jaguar E-Type.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{brakes on}} the RS4 are of two-piece construction. The cast iron discs are cross-drilled and radially ventilated and float on aluminium alloy disc hubs. The two-piece disc construction reduces <b>unsprung</b> mass and also reduces {{the transmission of}} heat generated by the brakes to the wheel bearings.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} of the 2CV was very soft; a person could easily rock the car side to side dramatically. The swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system with inboard front brakes had a much smaller <b>unsprung</b> mass than existing coil spring or leaf spring designs. The design was modified by Marcel Chinon.|$|E
25|$|The TRAXX P160 AC is the {{passenger}} {{version of this}} class, with a correspondingly higher top speed of 160km/h. A lower <b>unsprung</b> mass was achieved by using hollow shaft final drives instead of the axle hung motor arrangement of the 140km/h maximum speed versions. The bogies and drive unit {{are the same as}} used in the DBAG Class 146.0.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{improvements}} in the chassis include Tokico radial brake calipers, allowing smaller discs and therefore lower <b>unsprung</b> weight, translating into superior handling. Increased front braking power necessitated a sturdier lower triple clamp. The rear brake caliper {{was moved to the}} top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.|$|E
25|$|The SB-5 is a {{cantilever}} shoulder-wing monoplane with a plywood monocoque fuselage {{which has}} an outer fibre glass skin, a single spar wooden wing with plywood skinning, and a V-tail. Its wing, with a constant chord centre section and tapered outer panels, has 2.50° of dihedral and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes at 50% chord. The pilot has an enclosed cockpit with a Plexiglass canopy and the landing gear is a non-retractable, <b>unsprung</b> monowheel with a tailskid.|$|E
25|$|The M1 {{was very}} similar in {{construction}} and appearance to the 155mm Howitzer M1. The only significant difference was its tube of 4.5 inch (114mm) caliber. The tube had uniform right hand twist, with one turn in 32 calibers. The unbalanced weight of the barrel was supported by two equilibrator springs. The breach was of interrupted screw type; the recoil system hydropneumatic, variable length. The carriage was of split trail type, <b>unsprung</b> and had wheels with pneumatic tires. In firing position, the weapon {{was supported by a}} retractable pedestal. The gun was equipped with M12 panoramic sight.|$|E
25|$|Porsche's Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) are siliconized carbon fiber, {{with very}} high {{temperature}} capability, a 50% weight reduction over iron discs (therefore reducing the <b>unsprung</b> {{weight of the}} vehicle), {{a significant reduction in}} dust generation, substantially increased maintenance intervals, and enhanced durability in corrosive environments over conventional iron discs. Found on some of their more expensive models, it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense. It is generally recognized by the bright yellow paintwork on the aluminum six-piston calipers that are matched with the discs. The discs are internally vented much like cast-iron ones, and cross-drilled.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s the Red Army (RKKA) {{started to look}} for a {{replacement}} for the 152-mm howitzer M1909 and the 152-mm howitzer M1910. Those pieces, developed before World War I, had <b>unsprung</b> fixed trail carriages and short barrels, which meant poor mobility, insufficient elevation and traverse angles and short range. Although both pieces were eventually modernized, resulting in the 152-mm howitzer M1909/30 and the 152-mm howitzer M1910/37 respectively, these were relatively minor upgrades which brought only limited improvement in some areas and didn't address others. It was clear that a completely new design was needed. However, at that time Soviets had little experience in developing modern artillery pieces.|$|E
25|$|After Belgium, McLaren's Goodyear tyres {{suffered}} a slump in competitiveness {{and the team}} and their car fell behind rivals Graham Hill in his Lotus and Stewart in his Matra. At the Dutch Grand Prix McLaren crashed out and Hulme retired with ignition failure. After Lotus had begun the first experimentation with wings in Monaco and Ferrari and Brabham had debuted full height wings in Belgium, McLaren fitted a rear wing to their car for the French Grand Prix. However, mounted above the engine on the sprung mass of the car, {{it was not as}} effective as Lotus's wing mounted on the <b>unsprung</b> suspension components. In France Hulme was fourth, then fifth in Britain but both cars were out of the points-earning positions at the German Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|At its debut, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} model {{was shown in}} rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission. Three driving modes are featured, ranging from fuel-conserving Eco to Sport S and Sport S+ which facilitate more sporty transmission shifting and engine throttle settings, as well as suspension damper and steering adjustments. The chassis has been redesigned, and overall curb weight is reduced. To reduce <b>unsprung</b> mass the new GS utilizes aluminum for all its suspension components. The GS 350 F Sport adds a rear-wheel steering system for improved handling on rear wheel drive models. New larger 14-inch brakes come standard as well as 19-inch F Sport wheels, a new front bumper, rear spoiler, F Sport steering wheel, F Sport seats and a new suspension system with AVS adjustable dampers.|$|E
25|$|The Do 32 was {{structurally}} very simple, with {{a square}} section, tapering fuselage behind the pilot. The BMW 6012L turbine and compressor {{were placed on}} top of the fuselage, immediately behind the rotor pylon. Its exhaust impinged upon a large rectangular rudder, built to resist thermal stresses, for yaw control. The horizontal tailplane was swept. The pilot sat in front of the rotor pylon, on a simple seat, carried on the lower longerons. He controlled the plane of the two-bladed rotor directly with a long curved hanging arm, and its pitch with a conventional collective pitch lever by his left side. The rudder pedals were almost straight {{out in front of him}} on a strut that also carried, beyond his feet, some simple instruments. This member also formed part of the simple three-legged undercarriage, each strut ending with an <b>unsprung</b> foot.|$|E
25|$|Cracking {{is limited}} mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled {{near the edge}} of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of {{expansion}} in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as OEM typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the <b>unsprung</b> weight of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a heat sink, but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.|$|E
25|$|In {{racing and}} very-high-performance road cars, other disc {{materials}} have been employed. Reinforced carbon discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking {{systems such as}} those used on Concorde were introduced in Formula One by Brabham in conjunction with Dunlop in 1976. Carbon–carbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing <b>unsprung</b> weight, giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid 1990s for example, but need to reach a very high operating temperature before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use. The extreme heat generated in these systems is easily visible during night racing, especially at shorter tracks. It {{is not uncommon to}} be able to look at the cars, either live in person or on television and see the brake discs glowing red during application.|$|E
25|$|When {{the railway}} opened in 1900, it was {{operated}} by electric locomotives hauling carriages with passengers boarding via lattice gates at each end. The locomotives {{had a large}} <b>unsprung</b> mass, which caused vibrations that could be felt in the buildings above the route. After {{an investigation by the}} Board of Trade, by 1903 the carriages had been adapted to run as trailers and formed with new motor cars into electric multiple units. The Central London Railway trains normally ran with six cars, four trailers and two motor-cars, although some trailers were later equipped with control equipment to allow trains to be formed with 3 cars. Work started in 1912 on an extension to Ealing Broadway, and new more powerful motor-cars were ordered. These arrived in 1915, but completion of the extension was delayed due to the outbreak of World War I, and the cars stored. In 1917 they were lent to the Bakerloo line, where they ran on the newly opened extension to Watford Junction. Returning in 1920/21 and formed with trailers converted from the original carriages they became the Ealing Stock. In 1925–28 the trains were rebuilt, replacing the gated ends with air-operated doors, allowing the number of guards to be reduced to two. After reconstruction of the Central London Railway tunnels, the trains were replaced by Standard Stock transferred from other lines and the last of the original trains ran in service in 1939.|$|E
25|$|In late 1952 Bristol {{made the}} {{surprise}} announcement {{that the car}} was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running {{the length of the}} car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's double wishbone front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8ft 1¼ in (247cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4ft 3 in (130cm). Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced <b>unsprung</b> weight. These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered spanner, which could remove all five wheel nuts simultaneously. In {{much the same way as}} for modern Formula One wheel changes, the spanner would then retain the wheel nuts and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in <b>unsprung</b> weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
500|$|Bikes {{may have}} only front, only rear, full {{suspension}} or no suspension that operate {{primarily in the}} central plane of symmetry; though with some consideration given to lateral compliance. The goals of a bike suspension are to reduce vibration experienced by the rider, maintain wheel contact with the ground, and maintain vehicle trim. The primary suspension parameters are stiffness, damping, sprung and <b>unsprung</b> mass, and tire characteristics. Besides irregularities in the terrain, brake, acceleration, and drive-train forces can also activate the suspension as described above. Examples include bob and pedal feedback on bicycles, the shaft effect on motorcycles, and ...|$|E
500|$|The cart, {{constructed}} of native materials, {{could easily be}} repaired. A supply of shaganappi and wood was carried as a cart could break a half-dozen axles in a one-way trip. [...] The axles were unlubricated, as grease would capture dust which would act as sandpaper and immobilize the cart. [...] The resultant squeal sounded like an untuned violin, giving it the sobriquet of [...] "the North West fiddle". One visitor wrote that [...] "a den of wild beasts cannot be compared with its hideousness". [...] The noise was audible for miles. The carts were completely <b>unsprung,</b> and only their flexible construction cushioned the shocks transmitted from the humps and hollows of the trail.|$|E
500|$|The [...] Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, {{water-cooled}} engine produced [...] at 1,800rpm. Two {{fuel tanks}} were fitted, the main tank with {{a capacity of}} [...] was {{on the left side}} of the engine and the [...] auxiliary tank was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and [...] "Dynalkohol" [...] (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a front idler wheel, and four track return wheels. An <b>unsprung</b> road wheel was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after opening, {{the company}} {{received}} complaints that vibration was {{felt in the}} buildings above the route. The Board of Trade appointed an investigating committee in January 1901, which reported in May that the problem {{was due to the}} large <b>unsprung</b> mass of the 44-ton locomotives, and the track. An experiment in August showed the vibrations could be reduced by rebuilding locomotives to reduce the <b>unsprung</b> mass to [...] tons. The following month, after four of the carriages had been converted into motor cars and fitted with British Thomson-Houston control equipment that had been invented by Frank J. Sprague in Chicago, an electric multiple unit was tested.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body shell}} of the E46 was claimed by BMW to be 70% more rigid than its E36 predecessor, and {{aluminium}} was used for an increased quantity of suspension components, in order to decrease <b>unsprung</b> mass.
