Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), {{which is one}} type of electrical noise, is also defined and general techniques used for controlling EMI are described.

Today, <b>UTP</b> <b>cable</b> is the most popular networking cable supporting 10 G Ethernet. The most common effective methods for reduction of EMI effect on <b>UTP</b> <b>cable,</b> physical separation and use of shielding are described. EMI is caused by coupling mechanisms between source of interference and receptor. The two types of couplings are capacitive coupling and inductive coupling.

In this paper, the {{electromagnetic field}} emitted from <b>UTP</b> <b>cable</b> was calculated by the moment method and it was compared with the calculated results by the 4 -port network method. The wire grid model was developed to represent the propagation constants of <b>UTP</b> <b>cable.</b> The comparison of calculated and measured results confirms the validity of the model. A hybrid coupler was used to generate differential mode signal for the measurement.
