40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare and {{evaluate}} personal attitudes and perceptions, educational and vocational plans, activities and satisfaction among students of two basic groups selected for the study: a) financial aid recipients, b) non-financial aid recipients. Subgroups in each category consisted of over-achievers and under-achievers. Over-achievers were designated as those individuals whose grade point was. 15 or more above their predicted grade point average. Under-achievers were designated as those individuals whose grade point average was. 15 or more below their predicted grade point average. The data were gathered from the student's files in the Office for Student Affairs, Registrar's Office and from administration of the College Student Questionnaire, Part Two (CSQ). The data were subjected to statistical analysis to determine the validity of the following hypotheses: a) there is no significant difference in the proportions of students receiving financial aid and those not receiving financial aid whose achieved grade point averages are greater than or less than their predicted grade point average; b) there is no significant difference among the four groups used in the study on any of the eleven areas measured by the CSQ. The samples used in testing hypothesis one consisted of 159 financial aid recipients and 267 non-financial aid recipients. A statistical analysis was conducted comparing the two groups using the Chi square test of significance to determine if any significant difference existed in relation to academic achievement. Hypothesis one was rejected at the five percent level of confidence. Students receiving financial aid were performing academically better than the non-financial aid students. The samples for testing the other hypotheses consisted of four groups of students: 1) financial aid over-achievers - 55 students; 2) financial aid under-achievers - 52 students; 3) non-financial aid over-achievers - 53 students; 4) non-financial aid under-achievers - 53 students. Between the financial aid over-achievers and financial aid under-achievers, a significant difference was found at the one percent level of confidence in the area of study habits favoring the financial aid over-achiever. A significant difference favoring the financial aid <b>under-achiever</b> was found in the area of liberalism at the five percent level of confidence. A significant difference was found between non-financial aid over-achievers and under-achievers in the area of satisfaction with the faculty and administration at the five percent level of confidence favoring the non-financial aid over-achievers. A significant difference between financial aid over-achievers and non-financial aid over-achievers favoring the financial aid overachievers was found in the area of family independence at the one percent level of confidence. Significant differences between financial aid under-achievers and non-financial aid under-achievers were found at the one percent level of confidence in the areas of satisfaction with the faculty and administration and at the five percent level in the areas of family independence, extra-curricular involvement and cultural sophistication favoring the financial aid <b>under-achiever.</b> Analysis of the demographic data indicated that financial aid over-achievers were significantly different in age: the over-achievers were younger. There was also a significant difference in place of residence: the majority of over-achievers lived in the college dormitories, while the majority of under-achievers lived in off campus housing. There was a significant difference in achievement for students working more than 15 hours per week: more under-achievers than over-achievers were working 15 hours or more per week. There was no significant difference in achievement between financial aid and non-financial aid subgroups for students working up to 15 hours per week...|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} {{in the field of}} education have stressed the need for designing programs aimed to reduce adverse effects of anxiety on academic performance among high risk students. This study was designed to corroborate the relationship between academic performance and school anxiety reported in the literature, and to verify if the direction of this relationship is the same when behavioral indexes of school anxiety are employed. The study was conducted with 22 college students of a public university. They were subjected to 25 academic exams and three self rated measures which produced an average grade and a study index respectively. School anxiety was measured by means of a discrimination task based on a modified version of Stroop’s paradigm. Results showed that <b>under-achievers</b> produced the highest indicators of behavioral anxiety. Additionally, it was found that students who had been systematically located in the lower levels of the study index showed the highest levels of anxiety. Emotional arousal was registered by means of a systolic blood pressure measurement taken before or after the behavioral task depending on whether it was dealt with students who showed low-study indexes or low-average grades. The use of behavioral and physiological indexes of anxiety supports previous findings on the inverse relationship between anxiety and academic performance and the direct relationship between the academic self concept and school grades in a situation designed to minimize the emotional effect associated with the exposure to multiple exam...|$|R

The present study examined this issue by comparing parent and teacher behavioral ratings among groups of children diagnosed as having ADD/H, ADD/WO, and LD on symptoms of impul-sivity, inattention, and social withdrawal. The subjects were 77 outpatients in a diagnostic and referral-service clinic who were divided into three groups. Group 1 included children with a primary diagnosis of ADD/H (n = 35), Group 2 included children with a primary diagnosis of ADD/WO (n = 25), and Group 3 included children with a primary diagnosis of learning disabilities (n = 17). The results indicated that parents and teachers view children with ADD/H as more disruptive than children with ADD/WO or LD. Children with ADD/WO or LD were described as more underactive and shy and as daydreaming more often than children with ADD/H. Teachers rated children with ADD/WO and LD as being simi-lar to each other on symptoms of withdrawal and impulsivity, but both parents and teachers endorsed different symptoms of inattention for children with ADD/WO or LD.

40|$|AbstractLiteracy and {{mathematics}} are necessary skills that {{for different reasons}} unfortunately not everybody acquires sufficiently. In OECD countries {{there is also a}} gender gap; boys lag behind girls in literacy but often outperform girls in mathematics (OECD., 2012). ICT (Information and communication technologies) may contribute useful tools to address both these problems but in order to effectively create better educational conditions there is yet a need to develop effective methods that combine ICT with key factors for learning. This research contributes to this by measuring effects of the “Write to Learn” (WTL) method. WTL lets children from 1 st grade use several ICT tools to write texts and subsequently discuss and refine them together with classmates and teachers using digital real-time formative feedback and assessment. The central learning factor addressed, in mathematics as well as in literacy, is the written communication allowing the learners to interact with peers and teachers. WTL draws on methods from socio-cultural theory, including continuous social interaction and written real-time formative feedback among peers, using shared electronic forums for collaboration, thereby providing social meaning and increased learning of literacy {{and mathematics}}, among both boys and girls. The study uses quantitative methods and two control groups, one using traditional method (no ICT) and one using technology individually (without integrated social interaction and formative feedback), to compare results from 502 students in grade 3 national tests in mathematics and literacy. WTL yields by far best results; higher average score both in literacy and mathematics, smaller gender gap, and significantly better results for the <b>under-achievers.</b> The ITU method performs worst, which shows that ICT use must be well integrated into the pedagogy to be useful...|$|R
40|$|Proefskrif (DEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1981 The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of insufficient father-identification on scholastic achievement. Two methods of enquiry were used. A study of the available relevant literature was made in order to give an outline of former investigations on the father-child relationship and more specifically the father-son relationship. Subsequently the empirical method was used to test the validity of specific hypotheses. A cultural historical picture of the role played by the father in the father-son relationship of different cultures through the ages is given. The patriarchal family form prevailed in most cultures. The father was the strict head of the family. In many cases he had unlimited power and demanded obedience from the members of his family. In some cultures the father exerted an influence on the cognitive development of his son. It was even possible in other cultures for the son to have identified with the father. Nowadays, however, the father's most important contribution is to provide for his family economically. In the Republic of South Africa, however, the father still plays an important role. Even here some fathers are affected by economic prosperity, materialism and being busy which leads to their withdrawal from the home. This frequent absence is to the detriment of contact with his son. The father's influence on his son's academic achievement has to be considered in the educational context, and therefore the role of the father as educator in his son's development is discussed. Because the father, as familial educator in the family, plays an important part in his son's development, early contact between father and son is imperative. The father's role in the family setup is instrumentally superior and universal and he is superior in power whilst the mother's role is expressive and superior. Sex-role adoption is problematic for the boy in many aspects. The father has to assist the boy in adopting a satisfactory sex-role identity in order to avoid derailment, maladjustment and feminisation. Both the father's presence and his influence are necessary for the development of the boy's personality, especially his self-confidence, self-esteem and self-concept. The father makes an essential contribution to the boy's development in the emotional, social, sexual and moral fields. A study of the concept of identification as portrayed by the psychoanalysts as well as by the sociologists was made. Subsequently also father-identification is discussed. Identification is a complex process which takes place among humans. Under normal circumstances initial identification takes place in the family between parent and child. It begins when the child starts imitating certain characteristics of the parent and this eventually leads to the child's internalization of the characteristics, values and norms of the parents. The following exposition of the concept of identification was formulated for this investigation: Identification is the concept used for the chain of events which develops between an adult, the educator, and a child when the child, through observation and through experience, accepts and internalizes certain values, norms, actions, attitudes and characteristics of the adult as his own, to such an extent that the child often unconsciously, experiences and expressed them as his own. The child therefore consciously and unconsciously follows the example of the adult. He gradually thinks and feels like the adult; in this way he identifies with the adult. Identification is therefore a complex chain of events which initiates between child and parent and requires the active involvement of the parent. The parent's involvement and therefore also the identification-process continues at least until the child's developmental curve of growth has reached its maximum, i. e. until after adolescence. Although both parents serve as models for identification, the parent of the same sex is the most important. After the initial identification with his mother, the boy gradually becomes aware of the cultural requirements of his environment, namely masculine behaviour; so he turns to his father, and reverts from identification with his mother to identification with his father. The child's identification with his parents, more specifically the boy's identification with his father, provides him with a model according to which to develop his own identity and to internalize his own sex-role as part of his self-image. Internalizing the norms and values of a positive, well-balanced, affectionate, masculine father ensures eventual identification with a masculine sex-role. Identification with his father not only assists the boy in developing a self-identity, it also influences his social, emotional, sexual and moral maturation. The standard eight pupils involved in this investigation were in mid-adolescence. Because many adolescents experience an identity diffusion, this confusing era of a quest for identity which is often accompanied by intense affective cogniscence, is discussed. Special attention is paid to the affective experiences of the adolescent. Identity and identification are closely related - one implies the other. In his quest for identity and faced by an identity crisis, the adolescent is still dependent on his parents. The boy is dependent on his father. The adolescent's fast physical, psychological and cognitive development, his growth spurt, causes confusion but simultaneously introduces a vast field of new experiences. During this phase of development the adolescent has to develop his self-concept and self-identity and has to reinforce his sex-role identity. Identification with his father aids positive progress in this sphere of development. As this investigation is concerned with the scholastic achievement of boys, attention is given to the child's work-load at school. The theory of learning at school is discussed with special reference to the learning theory of Bloom. The affective entry characteristics with which the child enters the school task, largely determine the manner in which he will cope with the task. Because intelligence is used as an example of cognitive entry behaviour in the learning task, it is discussed briefly. The father can also contribute to the intellectual and cognitive development of the boy. Motivation and academic self-concept are affective entry characteristics in the learning task which largely influence the affective results of the school assignment. Because under- and over-achievers constitute a vital portion of this experimental research, the matter of under- and overachievement is discussed. Attention is paid to defining under- and over-achievers and their characteristics, their personality traits as well as the methods used to identify them. Underachievement is predominantly a male rather than a female problem which often starts before or during the early stages of primary school. Parents can have a marked influence on under- and over-achievement. Their behaviour can curb or foster this phenomenon. Three related research studies in connection with father-identification and under- and overachievement are discussed. The results differ considerably: * Ringness (1967) found that the high achievers tended to identify with their fathers to a greater extent than the low achievers. In a follow-up study, however, he could find no difference in the father-identification of high achievers, normal achievers and low achievers. * Danesino and Layman (1969) found that one group of high achieving male students identified with their fathers while another group identified with their mothers. They did, however, determine that high achieving male students tended to identify more closely with their fathers than the low achievers. * Shaw and White (1965) determined that male achievers identified with their fathers but <b>under-achievers</b> did not. In order to determine whether there is a relationship between father-identification and scholastic achievement a number of hypotheses were formulated and tested. The experimental research was conducted as follows: Three hundred and eighty seven Afrikaans speaking standard eight pupils were selected from twelve secondary schools in South-Western Transvaal by means of randomized, stratified cluster sampling. The test battery consisted of a number of available tests, tests compiled by the author as well as tests compiled by three doctoral students doing related research studies. Scholastic achievement, the dependent variable was operationalised to the average percentage in standerd seven with percentage for Afrikaans standard seven, percentage for English standard seven and percentage for Mathematics standard seven as additional components of scholastic achievement. Although standard eight pupils were used in this research, their final marks in standard seven were used because the questionnaires were completed towards the middle of the standard eight year and these standard seven marks were therefore regarded as more reliable than the mid-year standard eight marks. These marks as well as the I. Q. 's were obtained from the Ed. Lab. Cards. The following independent variables were used in the various analyses: a) Particulars of the subjects: Sex, age in months, non-verbal I. Q., verbal I. Q., number of schools attended. b) Aspects concerning the horne, the family and socio-economic status: * size of residence, number of children in the family, number of people in the residence; * completeness of the family, length of father's absence or length of period the child was fatherless; * age of child when parents were divorced, age of child when father died, age of child when mother died, substitute for parentis); * father's age, mother's age, educational level of the father, educational level of the mother, father's occupations mother's occupation; * identification with the home, home-adjustment, health-adjustment, submissiveness,|$|R
40|$|AbstractConservation {{resources}} are limited, {{making it impossible}} to invest equally in all threatened species. One way to maximise conservation gains is to focus upon those species with particular public appeal, using them to generate funding and support that could also benefit less charismatic species. Although this approach is already used by many conservation organisations, no reliable metrics currently exist to determine the likely charisma of a given species, and therefore identify the most appropriate targets for such campaigns. Here we use market research techniques on over 1500 people from five continents to assess the relative charisma of different mammals, which factors appear to drive it, and how these patterns vary between countries. Felids and primates emerged as highly favoured species for conservation, with the tiger (Panthera tigris) the top species by a wide margin. Using an information theoretic approach we develop models that successfully predict respondents’ preferences across the entire sample, suggesting global commonalities in the attributes that people prefer for conservation. However, by analysing each country separately we are able to improve our models, thus highlighting the importance of identifying locally specific flagships for conservation. The most important attributes were body size and IUCN status, although the extent of baldness, whether the species was a potential threat to humans and whether the eyes were forward or side facing were also widely important. Several of the key attributes revealed in this study could be extrapolated to nearly all terrestrial mammals, paving the way for a standardised global identification of species likely to prove effective for future conservation campaigns. The public preferred species with which they had affinity and familiarity, and we discuss how these aspects could be increased to promote the <b>under-achievers,</b> whilst maximising the funding potential of the highly charismatic mammals. While the felids are widely regarded as a popular taxonomic group, the great extent to which they appealed to our respondents emphasises their potential as ambassadors for conservation. Indeed, the big cats were so highly rated that we might think of them as one, Felis felicis: a globally powerful flagship for conservation...|$|R
40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis {{investigates the}} changes which have {{occurred}} in social studies in Victorian Technical Schools from 1938 to 1974. Social studies first appeared in Victoria when it was introduced into Preston Technical School during 1938. By the early 1940 s social studies was starting to replace history and geography in most Victorian Technical Schools. Its status was low, and its course of study was usually reserved for those technical students who were labelled as <b>under-achievers</b> who would probably not progress beyond forms 3 or 4. The boys were relegated into the trades, while the girls headed for domestic courses. The teaching of social studies during the 1950 s was undertaken by many teachers who had escaped from teaching subjects traditionally associated with an academic discipline, and by teachers who were unqualified. This situation remained virtually unchanged up until 1967. The whole "aura" of social studies and its curriculum went through something of a renaissance, which had its birth in 1967 at Burwood, Victoria, at the U. N. E. S. C. O. Seminar on the "Teaching of the Social Sciences at the Secondary Level". Immediately following the Burwood Seminar, the Victorian Advisory Committee on the Teaching of Social Science in Secondary Schools was established. In 1968 the Technical Schools Division set up a Standing Committee on Technical Schools Social Studies (SCOTSSS), {{and in the same}} year curricula autonomy was devolved, and the Director-General of Education in Victoria gave all schools in the state the right to determine their own curriculum. The Victorian Secondary Social Science Project (SSSP) was established in 1971 {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Victorian Advisory Committee, while the National Committee on Social Science Teaching (NCSST) held its first meeting in November 1971. In 1972 the Victorian Association of Social Studies Teachers (VASST) created a regular journal, Study of Society. Other key factors which have helped in the development of social studies have been the direct financial assistance from federal sources, overseas influence on social studies/ science teaching, a. rapid upsurge of student teachers completing social studies method courses, and a unique body of curriculum personnel working outside the Education Department. All of the above factors were instrumental in the re-birth of the subject of social studies in Victoria's Technical Schools since 1967. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|We {{are often}} {{inclined}} to emphasize only pure mathematical knowledge in its education. And {{we fail to}} enact it in students. Consequently, they fail to solve mathematical problems and forget it soon after paper and pencil tests. Recently, "metacognition" {{has come to be}} noticed as an important function of human cognitive activities among researchers of mathematics education as well as among professional psychologists. Roughly speaking, we could regard "metacognition" as the knowledge and skills which make the objective knowledge active in one's thinking activities. Our unique conception is that this "metacognition" is thought to be originated from and internalized by the teacher him/herself. We regard this internalized metacognition as a substitute to or a copy of the teacher from whom the students learn mathematics. In this context, we refer to "metacognition as "the inner teacher". In this paper, we investigate more deeply the concept of the inner teacher through the analysis of the responses to the questionnaire, specially designed for this research, from elemetary students in the 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th grades and those from junior high school students in their second year. We have obtained several findings as follows: 1. Analysing the number of responses to the questionnaire in each grade, we noticed two different conspicuous tendencies, one among the elementary students m the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th grades, and the other among the elementary school students in the 4 th, 5 th and the second-year junior high school students. Elementary school teachers, especially at lower levels, repeatedly talk to the students in terms of metacognition at all stages of problem solving. As a result, students come to have a strong impression about their teacher's utterances. Responses from students in upper grades tend to become stable {{in terms of the number}} of items. This is probably because teachers at uppergrades are inclined to limit their talk of metacognition to particular stages of problem solving. 2. In the middle (3 rd and 4 th) grades, marty over-achievers had a strong impression about such teacher utterances as impressed <b>under-achievers</b> in lower grades. In upper grades, many over-achievers tend to lose interest in those teacher utterances. This seems to indicate that the inner teacher makes a weak impression upon upper grade students, but we assume that this is in fact because it has become automatic for them. 3. The teacher utterances which impressed many over-achievers in middle grades were mainly those on mathematical reasoning and problem solving's strategy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between students' self-concepts of academic ability and achievement. More specifically, it investigated the differences in academic self-concept in students with similar levels of intelligence but with different levels of achievement. The study was designed {{to determine whether or not}} self-concept of ability was a significant factor in the achievement of junior high school students, and whether or not self-concept of ability functioned independently of measured intelligence in predicting school achievement. It attempted to identify the "significant others" related to school achievement, and it investigated the relationship between a student's academic self-concept and his educational expectations. The relationship between self-concept of ability and best and least liked subjects was also explored. [...] The sample used in the study consisted of 193 students of whom 97 were boys and 96 were girls. This number represented almost the total enrollment of Grade VIII pupils in Ferryland District which is a rural area on Newfoundland's southeast coast. [...] Data were collected during May and June, 1971, by means of a questionnaire, a standardized intelligence test, self-concept scales, and school records. [...] Descriptive and statistical analyses were made of the data collected. The statistical procedures used to test the hypotheses included the t test and Pearson product moment correlation. Partial Pearson product moment correlations were also used. [...] The major findings of the study revealed that self-concept of ability was significantly related to achievement when measured intelligence is controlled. Significant differences in the mean self-concept of ability scores of over- and <b>under-achievers</b> were found at all intelligence levels. Differences in the self-concept scores of boys and girls were significant only at low intelligence levels. [...] Parents were named by more than 99 percent of students as concerned with their school work, while teachers were mentioned by 78 percent. The mean self-concept of ability score of students who expected to attend college was significantly higher than the mean score of those who expected to complete high school. The mean self-concept of ability score was significantly higher in whatever subject the student liked best than it was in the one the student liked least. [...] These findings suggest the need for parents, teachers, and school counsellors to become more aware of the fact that a student's academic self-concept is closely related to his academic achievement. His performance depends not only on how intelligent the student actually is, but also on how intelligent he thinks he is. Counsellors and teachers, when devising or implementing new programs, should take the developmental approach to education. They should concern themselves with the prevention of negative self-concepts of ability in the formative years of students through early recognition and remediation of academic deficits. A measure of success should be afforded each student, for in terms of his future education and potential a sense of confidence and assurance is an important asset. With it the child can achieve much. Without it he will be handicapped despite the presence of even above average academic ability...|$|R
40|$|The Dutch “brede school” (BS) {{development}} {{originates in}} the 1990 s and has spread unevenly since: quicker {{in the primary}} than secondary educational sector. In 2007, there were about 1000 primary and 350 secondary BS schools {{and it is the}} intention of the government as well as the individual municipalities to extend that number and make the BS the dominant school form of the near future. In the primary sector, a BS cooperates with crèche and preschool facilities, besides possible other neighborhood partners. The main targets are, first, to enhance educational opportunities, particularly for children with little (western-) cultural capital, and secondly to increase women’s labor market participation by providing extra familial care for babies and small children. All primary schools are now obliged to provide such care. In the secondary sector, a BS is less neighborhood-orientated than a primary BS because those schools are bigger and more often located in different buildings. As in the primary sector, there are broad and more narrow BS, the first profile cooperating with many non-formal and other partners and facilities and the second with few. On the whole, there is a wide variety of BS schools, with different profiles and objectives, dependent on the needs and wishes of the initiators and the neighborhood. A BS is always the result of initiatives of the respective school and its partners: parents, other neighborhood associations, municipality etc. BS schools are not enforced by the government although the general trend will be that existing school organizations transform into BS. The integration of formal and non-formal education and learning is more advanced in primary than secondary schools. In secondary education, vocational as well as general, there is a clear dominance of formal education; the non-formal curriculum serves mainly two lines and objectives: first, provide attractive leisure activities and second provide compensatory courses and support for <b>under-achievers</b> who are often students with migrant background. In both sectors, primary and secondary, it is the formal school organization with its professionals which determines the character of a BS; there is no full integration of formal and non-formal education resulting in one non-disruptive learning trajectory, nor is there the intention to go in that direction. Non-formal pedagogues are partly professionals, like youth- and social workers, partly volunteers, like parents, partly non-educational partners, like school-police, psycho-medical help or commercial leisure providers. Besides that, the BS is regarded by government educational and social policy as a potential partner and anchor for community development. It is too early to make reliable statements about the effects of the BS movement in the Netherlands concerning the educational opportunities for disadvantaged children and their families, especially those with migrant background, and combat further segregation. Evaluation studies made so far are moderately positive but also point to problems of overly bureaucratized structures and layers, lack of sufficient financial resources and, again, are uncertain about long-term effects...|$|R
