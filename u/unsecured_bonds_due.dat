50|$|It was a {{discouraging}} {{time for}} negotiating loans, however, {{even on the}} most approved security, for {{it was at the}} height of the panic of 1857 when banks were failing by the score, and the oldest business houses were trembling on the verge of bankruptcy; but President Moran and his associates went to work- in earnest to place the new <b>bonds.</b> The <b>unsecured</b> <b>bonds</b> of the Company were low in the market being then quoted at about thirty-five and the terms of the new issue were favorable, but investors ignored it.|$|R

5000|$|On May 3, 2010, U.S. District Judge Victoria A. Roberts {{ordered all}} nine {{defendants}} {{to be released}} on bond, over the objection of Federal prosecutors. [...] "The order is silent as to any financial aspects of the bonds.

[...] The court ruled that five of the Hutaree remain in custody. The ruling applies to David Stone, Sr., Joshua Stone, Joshua Clough, Michael Meeks and Thomas Piatek.

50|$|Money was {{necessary}} to carry forward the improvements the Company had then in hand, but which were being delayed by lack of funds, so a scheme for a fourth mortgage loan was announced early in August, 1857. It was proposed to raise $3,000,000 by creating a stock for $6,000,000, half to be paid in cash and half in the <b>unsecured</b> <b>bonds</b> of the Company. The object of the loan was to fund the debt of the Company, and to obtain means to continue {{the construction of the}} Bergen tunnel, the depots, wharves and other improvements of the Long Dock property. It was calculated that the debt of the Company would be increased but about $1,000,000 by this plan.|$|R
40|$|On November 28 1986, the Ministry of Finance's Securities Exchange Advisory Council {{proposed}} a significant relaxation of restrictions on domestic corporate bond issuance. The number of corporations eligible for issuing <b>unsecured</b> straight <b>bonds</b> would triple, the issuing unit of privately placed bonds would quintuple, and firms {{would be permitted}} to issue {{at any time during}} the month instead of at month's end as formerly stipulated. Moreover, firms with a high enough corporate rating would be allowed to issue <b>unsecured</b> <b>bonds.</b> At first glance, this would appear to be a serious blow to the interests of the banking community: the easier it is for corporations to issue bonds, the less they must depend on banks loans for their external financing. In fact, however, most banks did not fight the change. This chapter will explain why not. Changes in the bond market help to explain the trend towards direct finance in Japan. Secondly, an examination of the process helps to generate more general propositions as to the how and why of financial deregulation. Thirdly, this case study affords a penetrating look at the government-business nexus in Japan...|$|R

25|$|New York's use of remand (pre-trial detention) and bail {{procedures}} have been criticized.
