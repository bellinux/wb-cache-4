30|$|Wool fiber {{strength}} and handle is damaged by holding for prolonged periods at normal dyeing temperatures (98  °C). Lower dyeing temperatures {{can be employed}} to color wool whilst reducing damage caused to the fiber. However, these lower temperature dyeing processes often have a long dyeing time and/or require the addition of chemicals to achieve adequate dye exhaustion and migration. The use of ultrasonic irradiation was used to reduce dyeing times and temperatures whilst increasing dye migration and fastness. It has used 30  kHz frequency level, effective power of 120 and 350  W heating power in <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machine.</b> In this work, wool dyeing was carried out on single jersey knitted fabric using an acid dye with and without ultrasonic irradiation at 60, 70, and 80  °C. Dye exhaustion was measured using UV/visible absorbance of the dye bath {{before and during the}} dyeing cycle. For the measurement of nodal/anti-nodal point of energy, at 60, 70, and 80  °C dyeing was done in open bath of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machine</b> with and without sonication at high liquor ratio. To compare the dye uptake (%) at high/conventional process, sample was dyed at 95  °C. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to measure the diameter and surface changes of the fiber, respectively. Wash and rub fastness was measured on the dyed fabrics after rinsing and drying. Ultrasonic irradiation during the dyeing of wool caused an increase in the dye exhaustion rate for acid dye. This change in rate {{is believed to have been}} caused by a reduction in the viscous boundary layer of liquor surrounding the fiber present in an ultrasonic irradiated environment. An increased dye migration due to cuticle cracking and fiber swelling was not deemed to have occurred as wet fiber diameter was not changed by submersion in the dye liquor in the presence of ultrasound and no surface cracking was evident in scanning electron microscopy images. Some cuticle structure changes occurred with turning up or ripping off of the cuticle tips evident. Both wash and rub fastness were improved for ultrasonically dyed fiber with dyeing temperatures of 70 and 80  °C being suitable for the low-temperature dyeing of wool.|$|E
30|$|This {{work has}} been {{designed}} to determine if the increased rate of dye uptake at lower temperatures using ultrasonic irradiation is achieved by an increase in the adsorption of the dye onto the fiber surface and/or by changes in the swelling of the wool fiber and/or changes in the morphology of the cuticle structure. It used dyeing and microscopy to confirm which was the contributing mechanism to dye exhaustion improvement. Though many research were done to study the effect of ultrasound on the dyeing behavior of wool fabric, the specialty of this project is that it used low-frequency level (30  kHz), effective power of 120  W and heating power of 350  W of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machine</b> which was lower than any other previous projects. This research has reduced not only the temperature but also increased the dye uptake% more than other projects.

This is a non-destructive, non-ionizing, high-sensitivity spectral system for synchronous coherent detection using samples weighing only approximately 0.2  g [17 – 20]. The THz spectral data and the corresponding weathering levels determined by means of the ultrasonic tests were combined as training and test samples. Last, a regression model for prediction of the weathering levels of the grotto walls was established based on these samples using a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). The LS-SVM employs a machine learning software package known for its quick operation, strong generalization, and ability to solve various practical problems, such as those involving small sample sizes, over-fitting, and high dimensions [21 – 23]. The LS-SVM regression model obtained as described above is a new, highly accurate, and economical method for predicting the weathering levels of stone relics based on experimental spectral data from weathered materials.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{miniaturized}} device and components is rapidly increasing in fields of aerospace, energy, optics, electronics and communication, automation and medical. Rotary <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Machining</b> (RUM) {{is capable of}} machining hard and brittle materials such as advanced ceramics, glass and silicon used in many industries. Rotary <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Machining</b> (RUM) is a hybrid machining process in which material is removed by conventional grinding and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machining.</b> Micro RUM is a downscaled version of a macro RUM and is similar to micro <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Machining</b> (micro USM), where the vibration takes place in work piece instead of tool. The goal of this thesis is to conduct a feasibility study and investigate material removal mechanism for micro rotary <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machining</b> (micro RUM). The effect of the spindle speed, tool tip geometry, static load, coolant, coolant concentration, work piece property on the material removal rate (MRR) and tool wear of micro RUM was studied. In RUM water is normally used as a coolant. In this study, milk was first introduced as new slurry in micro RUM and comparison experiments were conducted by adopting water with conventional polycrystalline diamond (PCD) powder mixture and water only as slurry. It was discovered that as MRR increase {{with an increase in}} the spindle speed, vibration amplitude and static load irrespective of type of working fluid. Milk as a working fluid resulted in the higher MRR, a better surface finish and less tool wear as compared to water, honey, coffee and PCD slurry as working fluids. Capability of micro RUM process for machining bovine bone was investigated. It was also found that viscosity of coolant plays a vital role in the material removal process. Temperature rise during machining was recorded using micro thermocouples. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) examination at higher magnifications revealed that using milk as the coolant showed a higher occurrence of ductile mode than water as a coolant. Milk was used as a working fluid during machining of bovine bone because viscosity of milk and blood is 20, 10 centipoises respectively. Surface quality of bone machined part using micro RUM is much better than other traditional and non-traditional machining methods. Finally, material removal rate predictive model was proposed and verified. Advisor: Kamlakar P. Rajurka...|$|R
40|$|Titanium and its alloys (Ti) are {{attractive}} for many applications {{due to their}} superior properties. However, they are regarded as hard-to-machine materials. Drilling is an important machining process since it is involved in nearly all Ti applications. It is desirable to develop cost-effective drilling processes for Ti and/or improve the cost-effectiveness of currently-available processes. Such development and improvement will be benefited by a comprehensive literature review of drilling processes for Ti. This paper presents a literature review on mechanical drilling processes for Ti, namely, twist drilling, vibration assisted twist drilling, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machining,</b> and rotary <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machining.</b> It discusses cutting force, cutting temperature, tool wear and tool life, hole quality (diameter and cylindricity, surface roughness, and burr), and chip type when drilling of Ti using these processes...|$|R
