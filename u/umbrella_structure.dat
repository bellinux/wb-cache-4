40|$|The {{innovative}} {{suggestion of}} this work is the usage of bended composite arms instead of complicated steel arms with hinges. The basic idea of the new structure is very simple, {{which is one of}} the best advantages of this structure. The bended arms could pre-stress the membrane surface and in the same time the membrane bends the arms, this interaction produces a harmonic structure with effective properties. The hinges can be avoided, because the open position of the umbrella created by the bend of the arms. Nowadays existing retractable funnel umbrellas are highly advanced, which is a result of decades of development, but the openingclosing process is quite complicated with very complex kinematics and complicated steel structure. Using the bended supporting elements a new structure for the retractable funnel umbrellas could be developed, which provides better structural behavior and simpler motion during the opening-closing process. The goal {{of this work}} is a development of a new type of convertible <b>umbrella</b> with innovative <b>structure,</b> which opens up new perspectives concerning the design of <b>umbrella</b> <b>structures.</b> The benefit of the new structure compared to the existing <b>umbrella</b> <b>structures</b> is a much easier working principle, which allows leaving the complex moving elements and joints.

We discuss the current approach of labour market reintegration both at national and local level, where organisational and policy learning is now an official ambition. Our argument starts from the perspective of policy feedback and reiterative policy development in experimental settings. Our case study is the pilot project of job reintegration, the so-called ‘Toonkamer-experimenten’. We discuss the conditions of these experiments, which were placed in a low-regulative environment, where professionals were challenged to invent new and more effective (in terms off reintegrating job seekers) working methods. Subsequently, we evaluate the relationship between vertical steering (planning and control) and horizontal adjustment (between the employment centres CWI, social security bodies UWV, and the municipal authorities) within the chain of work and income in terms of policy learning. The combination of learning and change at local and national level is what we subscribe as parallel innovation. ...|$|E

40|$|Conference Theme: Shaping New KnowledgesMedusa is a {{full scale}} built {{prototype}} for an <b>umbrella</b> <b>structure,</b> providing shade for public use. Three interlocking concrete legs describe a central void and articulate a continuous transition from column to slab; an alteration of a mushroom column archetype. The prototype reinterprets Felix Candela’s umbrella projects with radically different formwork methods, responses to material properties and construction procedures. The fabrication of the project explores means of conceiving concrete formworks that are more responsive and adaptive to the casting process by exploiting the short lived gap between liquid to solid. In doing so, the formwork is constructed {{from a range of}} materials, hard and soft, all accomplices in interacting with gravity loads, pressure and water seeping. On making ways: With a group of architecture students, we took residency in a large precast factory in the Pearl River Delta, a region of China often labeled the ‘the factory of the world’. There, for three weeks we lived and worked with factory workers, learnt from their various trades and fully experienced how such a plant, geared towards mass production of precast elements, operates professionally but also socially. By meeting half-way in the realization of the prototype, productive working relationships were forged between students and factory workers, at each stage of the process. On ways of making: The temporary formwork was constructed upside down to make full use of gravity. After curing, the concrete prototype was flipped in its intended position. The main intention for the project was to influence the process of architectural design in reverse; that is by synthesizing an architectural proposal from the findings emerging out of a succession of built experiments. Throughout a trial and error process, geometry is employed as regulator of a short lived liquid mass in space and not as form making. During the casting process, geometry orchestrated the different interactive roles, given to each elements of the formwork, until a solid formation was finally reached...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to answer one main research question: How could tertiary education quality be redefined and measured through the education production function model in developing countries. The study will use Indonesia as the target country {{to carry out research}} activities. Quality of tertiary education {{has been one of the}} most frequently discussed topics in relevant fields in academia and human development. As enrollment continuously increases and education systems expand in many developing countries, quality becomes their biggest concern. The purpose of this dissertation is to provide stakeholders a different and more practical approach to reevaluate tertiary education quality through quantifiable variables and to measure quality through educational input, equity and equality, labor market relevance, and system assurance factors. Human capital theory serves as the guiding theoretical framework for this dissertation. The education production function model is the foundation for quality redefinition. Within the four quantifiable variables, benefit incidence analysis is used to measure equity and equality, economic rate of return is used to measure labor market relevance of the tertiary education system, and returns to investment is used to evaluate how education outputs yield from inputs. The study {{is designed to}} have an <b>umbrella</b> <b>structure,</b> with tertiary education quality being at the top of the skeleton and educational input, equity and equality, labor market relevance, and system assurance being the four supporting pillars. With the redefinition of tertiary education quality, four main research questions will be answered respectively. Educational input in Indonesia has been improving in the past decade; however, it is still behind compared to peer ASEAN countries and countries with similar economic profiles. Indonesia's tertiary education access inequality is mainly caused by socioeconomic differences. The labor market absorbs a majority of tertiary graduates and yields much higher returns at the tertiary level, and it has been responding very positively toward the continuously expanding graduating class. The quality assurance system suffers from short-staffing, low financial support, low capacity, and weak government support. At its current accrediting pace, Indonesia's tertiary education institutions will not be able to improve as fast as they are willing to. ...|$|E
40|$|This is the author’s {{final version}} of a book chapter {{accepted}} for publication by Facet Publishing (www. facetpublishing. co. uk). Health care library and information services (LIS) face continual change. Nationally, geographical boundaries are altered and layers of management are introduced or jettisoned to impact ultimately on individual LIS. Locally, mergers between hospitals occur with previously unrelated library services being amalgamated. Within individual organisations, the reporting lines for the library can be completely changed resulting in new line management with different ideas and approaches. The librarian can find themselves {{part of a new}} <b>umbrella</b> <b>structure</b> with new colleagues and processes. Existing co-operative schemes can end with LIS being forced to locate new collaborators and partners. Software companies can develop new interfaces to databases necessitating wholesale changes to user education and documentation. As health professionals embrace evidence based practice, a new portfolio of services is required to support this trend. A larger organisation can decide that the library needs to physically move to new accommodation. The range of external environmental factors that can impact on libraries was documented in a complete issue of Health Libraries Review (Day and Walton, 1995). Most of the changes that were identified were unavoidable and required a response from the health LIS. This chapter explores change within the health LIS context and demonstrates the centrality of innovative practice. The drive to innovate has existed for many years. Indeed Machiavelli was aware of the pressure in the Middle Ages: "There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate new order of things. " Machiavelli's vision was limited by his failure to acknowledge that innovation can be managed as part of the change process. Innovation and change management are complex and intertwined concepts. Many books, articles and research projects have explored innovation and change. This chapter aims to provide a broad introduction to key trends and concerns. The nature of change in the 21 st century is described together with the imperative this places for innovative service development. There then follows an exploration of creativity within the context of innovation. Approaches to the facilitation and management of innovative services are outlined. The chapter concludes by discussing resistance to change, and ways in which such resistance can be overcome...|$|E
40|$|BRIDGE is an {{initiative}} {{funded by the}} Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) that aims to close the “funding gap” between basic and applied research in stand-alone projects with the primary objective of jointly developing the potential of basic and applied research. BRIDGE acts as an <b>umbrella</b> <b>structure</b> under which the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) coordinate two thematically open funding programmes: The FWF’s Translational Research Programme (TR) and the FFG’s bridging programme (BR). The two programmes differ from one another in respect of the research’s potential to lead to specific applications and in respect of their funding intensity, which since the second call {{has resulted in the}} division of BR into two sub-programmes (Bridge 1 and Bridge 2). · The TR programme funds projects that meet high international standards of scientific quality {{while at the same time}} offering innovation potential in terms of the expected application, but for which no commercially-oriented financing partner has been found. Applications may be made by individuals; the approved costs may be funded in full. · In the case of the BR programme, applications may be submitted by research institutes and companies but also by individual researchers. The consortium must include at least two partners (1 from science, 1 from industry). - Bridge 1 supports collaborative research projects where most of the project costs (at least 80 %) are borne by the research institute or the researcher. The enterprises that will potentially implement the results make a financial contribution and also provide material and manpower (maximum 20 %); the maximum amount of funding is 75 %. Applications may be made by institutions. - In the case of Bridge 2 much of the project work is still carried out by the scientific partner (at least 30 %). However, the corporate partner makes a greater contribution to the project in the form of material and manpower; the maximum funding quota here is 60 %. In the years 2004 - 2008 BRIDGE had a budget of EUR 92 million for seven calls, the equivalent of EUR 10 - 11. 6 million per year and programme line with two calls in each year. 7. Total funding of EUR 85 million was approved; EUR 40 million for 187 TR projects and EUR 44 million for 187 B 1 and 72 B 2 projects within the framework of BR. BR has a considerably higher average application approval rate (49 %) than TR (29 %). When the programme was launched it was agreed that BRIDGE would be subjected to a mid-term evaluation after three to five years in accordance with the recommendation made by the Austrian Council for Research and Technology Development. After being hired to carry out this evaluation in October 2008 Technopolis analysed the concept, implementation, processes and organisation, goal achievement, and as far as they could be determined, the impacts of the programme. In comparison with other programme evaluations, two questions are of particular relevance. The first concerns the perceived funding gap: Did it really exist? Was it necessary and appropriate to launch an additional programme? The second question concerns the culture of cooperation initiated between the FFG and FWF, which for the first time are managing research funding programmes under a joint name and with a joint programme advisory committee. Among other things, this evaluation examines the question of how productive this model is and to what extent it should be continued in the future. For this purpose, qualitative and quantitative methods were combined, including in particular an analysis of programme documents and material from the BRIDGE advisory committee, interviews with the programme managers and stakeholders, an analysis of the FWF and FFG monitoring data, an online survey of applicants for TR funding and the scientific partners in BR 1 and BR 2 applications (project leaders and partners), as well as four international case studies. Results 1. BRIDGE did close a funding gap, but sometimes also overlapped with other programmes. 2. The BRIDGE advisory committee serves as the bridge between the two funding agencies and is the backbone of the programme. 3. High percentage of new funding recipients at the two funding agencies 4. Mobilisation of new and existing partnerships 5. Importance of BRIDGE for the development of human resource...|$|E
