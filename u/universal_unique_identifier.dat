It is closely related to the authority that creates it, to the resolution service provider, and to the content provider {{in such a way that}} the same content may have different CRIDs depending on the field in which they are used (for example, a different one for each television operator that has the rights to broadcast the content).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Internet Search Environment Number (ISEN) is a {{proposed}} new Internet standard {{analogous to the}} International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and the International Standard Serial Number (ISBN) that would allow Internet searchers to locate more authoritative and reliable information sources than can be identified using conventional search engines. ISEN is also a metadata creation environment and a search engine. For end users, ISEN offers metadata-based basic and advanced search options, as well as features and functionalities that support database providers and ISEN editors and catalogers. In addition, ISEN is {{an environment in which}} external associations, businesses, and organizations can develop value-added services that build on the rich metadata provided by the ISEN service. In general, databases are dynamically driven and routinely updated, producing many versions of the initial database content on a regular basis. ISEN is intended to facilitate the identification of a variety of „search environments. A search environment can be defined as a body of structured information with its own search algorithm. These search environments include not only databases, but digital libraries, institutional repositories, knowledge bases, online public- access catalogs (OPACs) and peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems. At the core of the ISEN system is the Internet Search Environment Number (ISEN), which is a unique number based on the underlying technologies of Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), handles from the Handle System, and <b>Universal</b> <b>Unique</b> <b>Identifiers</b> (UUIDs). ISEN will be supported by metadata professionals who will provide the metadata for identified search environments...|$|R
40|$|As {{digital content}} {{services}} gain {{importance in the}} mobile world, this paper proposes Digital Rights Management implementation for android devices. EDRM (Enterprise Digital Rights Management) system provides a novel solution to control access to documents such as Microsoft word, PDF and images from unauthorized copying, modification, and re-distribution. The work protects user‟s personal digital content like photos, documents etc. This modeled design aims how security is been provided to mobile devices using password mechanism, hash function and encryption and it is been tested using 100 samples. The individualization, flexibility, efficiency and practicability issues will be assured. The implementation permits the mobile user to conduct a „preview-before-download ‟ activity and the digital content provider will not suffer from unauthorized mobile users accessing digital content. Proposed system uses a two level security using a <b>Universal</b> <b>Unique</b> <b>Identifier,</b> which is hashed using the (Simple Hashing Algorithm) SHA algorithm, then that key {{is used for the}} encryption of the content in Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The parameters used to measure system performance are response-time and throughput and were found out to be 0. 022 -sec/request and 45. 54 respectively. Thus the paper achieves better security and faster processing...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} Authenticated Byzantine Generals (ABG) aims to {{simulate}} a virtual reliable broadcast channel from the General {{to all the}} players via a protocol over a real (point-to-point) network {{in the presence of}} faults. We propose a new model to study the self-composition of ABG protocols. The central dogma of our approach can be phrased as follows: Consider a player who diligently executes (only) the delegated protocol but the adversary steals some private information from him. Should such a player be considered faulty? With respect to ABG protocols, we argue that the answer has to be no. In the new model we show that in spite of using <b>unique</b> session <b>identifiers,</b> if n < 2 t, there cannot exist any ABG protocol that composes in parallel even twice. Further, for n ≥ 2 t, we design ABG protocols that compose for any number of parallel executions. Besides investigating the composition of ABG under a new light, our work also brings out several new insights into Canetti's Universal Composability framework. Specifically, we show that there are several undesirable effects if one deviates from our dogma. This provides further evidence as to why our dogma is the right framework to study the composition of ABG protocols. Comment: 27 pages.

40|$|Website {{developers}} can use Adobe’s Flash Player {{product to}} store information locally on users’ disks with Local Shared Objects (LSOs). LSOs {{can be used}} to store state information and user identifiers, and thus can be used for similar purposes as HTTP cookies. In a paper by Soltani et al, researchers documented at least four instances of “respawning,” where users deleted their HTTP cookies only to have the HTTP cookies recreated based on LSO data. In addition, the Soltani team found half of the 100 most popular websites used Flash technologies to store information about users. Both respawning and using LSOs to store data about users can reduce online privacy. One year later, we visited popular websites plus 500 randomly-selected websites to determine if respawning still occurs. We found no instances at all of respawning in a randomly-selected group of 500 websites. We found two instances of respawning in the most popular 100 websites. While our methods are different from the Soltani team and we cannot compare directly, our results suggest respawning is not increasing, and may be waning. As in the Soltani study, we found LSOs with <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers.</b> In the 100 most popular websites, LSOs were set at 20, and 9 used their LSOs to store <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers.</b> In 500 randomly selected sites, LSOs were set at 41, and 17 used their LSOs to store <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers.</b> <b>Unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> may, or may not, be keys into back-end databases to perform cookie-style tracking. However, <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> could be benign, for example, uniquely identifying a specific animation or music clip. While we can use contextual information like variable names to guess what a given <b>unique</b> <b>identifier</b> is for, using our study methods we cannot conclusively determine how companies use <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers.</b> We cannot quantify how many, if any, sites are using <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> in LSOs for any purpose that might have privacy implications. Even assuming a pessimistic worst case where all websites with <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> in LSOs are using them to track users, the percentage of such sites studied is low— 9 % of the top 100, and only 3. 4 % of the randomly-selected 500 sites we studied. However, over 40 % of the LSOs in each data set used <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers,</b> and especially with the top 100 sites, many people could be affected. Because we found sites using LSOs as <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers,</b> we believe further study is needed to determine if these sites are using LSOs to evade users’ choices. However, without visibility into back-end databases, {{it is difficult to determine}} how <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> are used. We conclude our paper with policy options and a discussion of implications for industry self-regulation of Internet privacy...|$|R
