Thus comprehensive efforts have been made around the globe in the technological development of turbo machines where means of energy extraction is energized fluids. This development led the aviation industry to power boost due to better performing engines. Meanwhile, the structural conformability requirements relative to the functional requirements have also increased {{with the advent of}} newer, better performing materials. Thus {{there is a need to}} study the material behavior and its usage with the idea of selecting the best possible material for its application. In this work a gas turbine blade of a small turbofan engine, where geometry and aerodynamic data was available, was analyzed for its structural behavior in the proposed mission envelope, where the engine turbine is subjected to high thermal, inertial and aerodynamic loads. Multiphysics Finite Element (FE) linear stress analysis was carried out on the turbine blade. The results revealed the upper limit of Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) for the blade. Based on the limiting factor, high performance alloys were selected from the literature. The two most recommended alloy categories for gas turbine blades are NIMONIC and INCONEL from where total of 21 types of INCONEL alloys and 12 of NIMONIC alloys, available on commercial bases, were analyzed individually to meet the structural requirements. After applying selection criteria, four alloys were finalized from NIMONIC and INCONEL alloys for further analysis. On the basis of stress-strain behavior of finalized alloys, the Multiphysics FE nonlinear stress analysis was then carried out for the selection of the individual alloy by imposing a restriction of <b>Ultimate</b> <b>Factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Safety</b> (UFOS) of 1. 33 and yield strength.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> slice-wise <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> is {{introduced}} {{to investigate the}} state of both the whole slope and each slice. The assumption that the interslice force ratio is the same between any two slices is made and the eccentric moment of slice weight is also taken into account. Then four variables equations are formulated based on the equilibrium of forces and moment and the assumption of interslice forces, and then the slice-wise <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> along the slip surface can be obtained.

40|$|The {{stability}} of slopes {{is a major}} problem in geotechnical engineering. Of the methods available for the analysis of soil slopes such as limit equilibrium methods, limit analysis and numerical methods such as FEM and FDM, limit equilibrium methods are popular and generally used, owing to their simplicity in formulation and in evaluating the overall <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> slope. However limit equilibrium methods possess certain disadvantages. They do not consider whether the slope is an embankment or natural slope or an excavation and ignore the effect of incremental construction, initial stress, stress strain behavior etc. In the work reported in this paper, a comparative study of actual state of stress and actual <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> and Bishop's <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> is performed.

40|$|The {{design of}} pump and treat systems for {{groundwater}} remediation is often aided by numerical groundwater modelling. Model predictions are uncertain, with this uncertainty resulting from unknown parameter values, model structure and future system forcings. Researchers {{have begun to}} suggest that uncertainty in groundwater model predictions is largely dominated by structural/conceptual model uncertainty and that multiple conceptual models be developed in order to characterize this uncertainty. As regulatory bodies begin to endorse the more expensive multiple conceptual model approach, {{it is useful to}} assess whether a multiple model approach provides a signi cant improvement over a conventional single model approach for pump and treat system design, supplemented with a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> To investigate this question, a case study located in Tacoma, Washington which was provided by Conestoga-Rovers & Associates (CRA) was used. Twelve conceptual models were developed to represent conceptual model uncertainty at the Tacoma, Washington site and a pump and treat system was optimally designed for each conceptual model. Each design was tested across all 12 conceptual models with no <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> applied, and a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5 and 2 applied. Adding a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5 decreased the risk of containment failure to 15 percent, compared to 21 percent with no <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> Increasing the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> from 1. 5 to 2 further reduced the risk of containment failure to 9 percent, indicating that the application <b>of</b> a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> reduces the risk of design failure at a cost directly proportional to the value <b>of</b> the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> To provide a relatively independent estimate <b>of</b> a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> approach a single "best" model developed by CRA was compared against the multiple model approach. With a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5 or greater, adequate capture was demonstrated across all 12 conceptual models. This demonstrated that in this case using the single " model developed by CRA with a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> would have been a reasonable surrogate for a multiple model approach. This is of practical importance to engineers as it demonstrates that the a conventional single model approach may be su cient. However, it is essential that the model used is a good model. Furthermore, a multiple model approach will likely be an excessive burden in cases such as pump and treat system design, where the cost of failure is low as the system can be adjusted during operation to respond to new data. This may not be the case for remedial systems with high capital costs such as permeable reactive barriers, which cannot be easily adjusted...|$|R

The random finite element method is employed in conjunction with a Monte Carlo simulation to stochastically evaluate the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> {{and the size of the}} sliding mass. The results indicate that the mean value and the variability of these two quantities depend on both correlation length and coefficient of variation of the void ratio field.
