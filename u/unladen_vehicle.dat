The main objective of the survey was to provide estimates, at the national level, of such important economic indicators as the total tonnage of goods moved by road, the ton-mileage performed, vehicle miles travelled, etc. It was also the intention of course, from the outset, to provide the information in considerable detail, e. g. by <b>unladen</b> weight of <b>vehicle,</b> by region, by length of haul, etc. The absence of information of this kind has long been a major gap in the national statistics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} power {{steering}} {{is to reduce}} the driver’s effort at the steering wheel. Steering wheel that the spooked hand wheel {{at the top of the}} steering column of an automobile which actuates the steering gear. Such a system is used in heavy commercial vehicle and therefore, application of power steering in car, is the biggest question today is. Because as per norms of power steering, whose <b>vehicle</b> <b>unladen</b> weight is more than 1500 kgs, may affect as the proper norms. However, introducing of power steering in car, in terms of prefect steering is to a problem by means of dragging, while sudden applied of brake. Power steering mechanism employs Electrical Devices, Compressed Air and Hydraulic pressure. There are two types of power steering, i. e. integral and linkage. The integral type, the power steering systems forms part of the steering gear, where as linkage type, it forms part of the steering linkage...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method {{is used to}} {{calculate}} unsteady wind loadings acting on a railway vehicle. The method takes input data from wind tunnel testing or from computational fluid dynamics simulations (one example of each is presented in this article), for aerodynamic force and moment coefficients and combines these with fluctuating wind velocity time histories and train speed to produce wind force time histories on the train. This method is fast and efficient and this has allowed the wind forces to be applied to a vehicle dynamics simulation for a long length of track. Two typical vehicles (one passenger, one freight) have been modelled using the vehicle dynamics simulation package ‘VAMPIRE®’, which allows detailed modelling of the vehicle suspension and wheel—rail contact. The aerodynamic coefficients of the passenger train have been obtained from wind tunnel tests while those of the freight train have been obtained through fluid dynamic computations using large-eddy simulation. Wind loadings were calculated for the same vehicles for a range of average wind speeds and applied to the vehicle models using a user routine within the VAMPIRE package. Track irregularities measured by a track recording coach for a 40 km section of the main line route from London to King's Lynn were used as input to the vehicle simulations. The simulated vehicle behaviour was assessed against two key indicators for derailment; the Y/Q ratio, which is an indicator of wheel climb derailment, and the Δ Q/Q value, which indicates wheel unloading and therefore potential roll over. The results show that vehicle derailment by either indicator is not predicted for either vehicle for any mean wind speed up to 20 m/s (with consequent gusts up to around 30 m/s). At a higher mean wind speed of 25 m/s derailment is predicted for the passenger <b>vehicle</b> and the <b>unladen</b> freight <b>vehicle</b> (but not for the laden freight vehicle) ...|$|R
5000|$|The final RU to be {{delivered}} to a new customer was equipped with a Chloride sponsored battery-electric driveline and was called the [...] "Silent Rider". It was sold to SELNEC (later Greater Manchester) PTE who numbered it EX61 in its experimental series, registering it XVU387M. The Chloride battery pack weighed four tonnes and the <b>vehicle</b> (<b>unladen</b> but for those batteries) weighed 13 tonnes (almost double the unladen weight of the Gardner-powered version) so payload was limited, by the axles fitted, to one tonne which equalled a capacity of B41D + 9 standing and although it featured regenerative braking the bus (like Lucas battery-electric Seddon Midi EX62 XVU364M which followed in 1975) was not a success. The Silent Rider project alone cost £100,000 at mid-1970s values, promotional tours to Sheffield and Chicago, Illinois, United States may have been prestigious for the Executive and for the manufacturers of vehicle and batteries, who were both major employers of voters in the PTE area, but Cook County Transit and the South Yorkshire PTE were, lacking the electrical-charging and cell-care infrastructure installed in a Manchester garage {{as part of the}} project, able to get even less use out of the thing than Greater Manchester who tried to employ its advertised 100-mile range by using it sporadically on one morning and one afternoon peak-time journey on routes 202/3.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{interest}} for smaller, cheaper and more energy efficient vehicles hasincreased significantly. These vehicles are intended {{to be used in}} urban areas, where theactual need of large heavy cars is generally minor. The travelled distance is on average lessthan 56 km during a day and most often there is only one person travelling in the vehicle. Manyof the established car manufacturers have recently started to take interest into this marketsegment, but the majority of these small vehicles are still manufactured by smaller companiesat a low cost and with little or no research done on vehicle traffic safety. This may be becausethere are still no legal requirements on crash testing of this type of vehicles. This report will examine road safety for Urban Light-weight Vehicle (ULV) to find criticalcrash scenarios from which future crash testing methods for urban vehicles can be derived. The term ULV is specific to this report and is the title for all engine powered three- and fourwheeledvehicles categorized by the European Commission. Other attributes than the wheelgeometry is engine power and the <b>vehicles</b> <b>unladen</b> mass. The maximum allowed weight for athree-wheeled ULV is 1 000 kg and 400 kg for a four-wheeled one. By studying current crash test methods used in Europe by Euro NCAP it has beenconcluded that these tests are a good way of assessing car safety. For light-weight urbanvehicles it has been concluded that some of these tests need to be changed and that some newtest scenarios should be added when assessing road safety. The main reasons for this is linkedto that vehicle’s with a weight difference of more than 150 kg cannot be compared withcurrent test methods, and that crash tests are performed with crash objects with similar orequal mass in current safety assessment programs. This correlates poorly to the trafficsituation for light-weight urban vehicles since it would most likely collide with a far heaviervehicle than itself in an accident event. To verify the actual traffic situation in urban areas, accident statistics have beenexamined closely. The research has shown that there are large differences between rural andurban areas. For instance; 66 % of all severe and fatal traffic accident occurs in rural areaseven though they are less populated. Even the distribution of accident categories has showndifferent in rural and urban areas. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe(UNECE) has defined accident categories in their database which is widely used within theEuropean Union. By comparing each accident category’s occurrence, injury and fatality rate,the most critical urban accident categories were found in the following order. 1. Collision due to crossing or turning 2. Vehicle and pedestrian collision 3. Rear-end collision 4. Single-vehicle accident 5. Other collisions 6. Head-on collision Statistics also show that of all fatally injured crash victims in urban trafficapproximately; one third is travelling by car; one third by motorcycle, moped or pedal-cycle;and one third are pedestrians. This means that unprotected road travelers correspond to twothirds of all fatal urban traffic accidents, a fact that has {{to be taken into account}} in future crashtesting of urban vehicles. With all the information gathered a total of four new crash testscenarios for light-weight urban vehicles have been presented: • Vehicle-to-vehicle side impact at 40 km/h with a 1 300 kg striking vehicle to evaluate theoccupant protection level of the light-weight vehicle. • Vehicle-to-motorcycle side impact at 40 km/h with motorcycle rider protection evaluation. • Pedestrian protection assessment at 40 km/h over the whole vehicle front and roof area. • Rigid barrier impact at 40 km/h corresponding to an urban single vehicle accident with aroad side object or a collision with a heavier or similar sized vehicle...|$|R
