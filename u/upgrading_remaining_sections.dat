2500|$|The Bari–Barletta line is laid to {{standard}} gauge, with 3,000V DC overhead electrification. Since the 1990s the {{line has been}} refurbished, and is mostly upgraded to double track.

In 2005, the Scottish Executive declared that in line with plans to <b>upgrade</b> the <b>remaining</b> <b>section</b> of the A8 road to motorway standard, public transport links between Glasgow and Edinburgh must also be improved. Therefore, to create a fourth direct rail link between Glasgow and Edinburgh, the closed section of the Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway between [...] and the 1989 Drumgelloch station was re-opened, and the existing lines from Newbridge Junction to Bathgate and Drumgelloch to Airdrie were upgraded. The whole line is double track and electrified, with a maximum line speed of 80mph.
