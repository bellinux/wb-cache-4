40|$|Habitats of the {{multipurpose}} tree, Acacia nilotica, {{were identified}} along the coastline of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea, south of Iran. Four sites were randomly chosen {{and in each}} one, vegetation as well as climatic and soil characteristics were studied. Likewise, biometry of Acacia trees was conducted and compared in the sites. The fodder values in leaf and fruit of Acacia were determined and {{compared with those of}} in foliage of Medicago sativa being managed under an agro-forestry system. By analyzing data it was revealed that the biggest trees were found in Dashteyari region and the smallest in Bamani region (both in the Oman Sea coast). Values in most of nutritional elements were higher in foliage of Medicago than in leaf and fruit of Acacia, respectively. From this investigation it is concluded that in south of Iran where the site is favorable for Acacia plantation, cultivation of Medicago or other adaptable crops together with Acacia can be developed as agro-forestry systems (such as <b>undercropping</b> and intercropping) if water is available...|$|E
40|$|Vicia sativa L. (common vetch) is {{an annual}} {{cleaning}} crop mainly used in rotation with durum wheat, either for seed and forage yield, in purity or <b>undercropping</b> with other species, well {{adapted to the}} hot-dry climate and poor soils of Southern of Italy. Cultivar identification is done on distinctive traits relieved at variety registration following official protocols (UPOV). The peculiar traits of seeds of some vetch varieties allowed a clearly distinctiveness mainly on some seed features (shape, size, ground color of testa; brown and black ornamentation. Although seed identification process by specialized technicians is possible for some vetch varieties, it is slow and somewhat subjective giving results which {{may be difficult to}} quantify both for business and technological implications. Therefore it is important economically and technically to implement repeatable and quick automated methods to identify and classify seeds. To aid the visual inspection, or replace the human judge in distinguishing different varieties of common vetch, this work presents the development of an image analysis based tool, for the seeds identification of examined varieties.

40|$|ILCA (International Livestock Centre for Africa) {{trials in}} Ethiopia {{have shown that}} {{planting}} legumes under coffee trees can produce substantial amounts of high-quality forage and also increase yields of coffee. Coffee is the major cash crop of sub-humid, medium-altitude acid-soil areas of East Africa. In the traditional farmins~ systems around Soddo, Wolaita, Ethiopia, where livestock are also an important component, coffee trees are allowed to grow unpruned. Weeds grow thinly under the heavy shade of the canopy. The weeds are cut and fed to cattle just before the coffee is harvested, so that fallen berries may be retrieved. In times of fodder shortages - during drought, for instance - the weeds can be cut for feed more frequently. The areas under coffee offer an opportunity to further intensify the region's farming systems by introducing a forage legume <b>undercrop.</b> This produces a highquality forage {{and at the same}} time enhances soil fertility by biological nitrogen fixation. ILCA is currently experimenting with shade-tolerant legumes such as Desmodium intortum (Greenleaf), which grows well under coffee trees and regrows well after beins: cut back severely. Coffee yields have been found to be superior to those of trees with no legume <b>undercrop.</b> Dr. John Lazier ILCA PO Box 5689 Addis Ababa ETHIOPIAILCA (International Livestock Centre for Africa) trials in Ethiopia have shown that planting legumes under coffee trees can produce substantial amounts of high-quality forage and also increase yields of coffee.

40|$|Behaviour of radiocesium in {{ecosystems}} {{is described}} for two forest ecosystems in the Federal State of Rhineland-Palatinate. The patterns of distribution of radiocesium in forest ecosystem, mobility {{and availability of}} radiocesium in forest ecosystems {{and the role of}} different flows and processes of radiocesium transfer in forest ecosystems are given special attention. Eventual correlations of distribution patterns and transfers of radiocesium and the closely related bioelement sodium are checked. The study also investigates in howfar soil liming has an influence on the bio-availability of radiocesium and whether sodium fertilization can reduce radiocesium fallout after accidents and thus reduce contamination of forest fruit, mushrooms and game. Studies were conducted in a pine stand on quartzite under clay in the upper regions of the Hunsrueck mountains and in an oak Quercus petraea stand with beech <b>undercrop</b> on medium vanegated sandstone. Both forest ecosystems are typical for the Rhineland-Palatinate in terms of site, stocking, and immission.

40|$|Vicia saliva L. is {{an annual}} {{cleaning}} crop mainly used in rotation with durum wheat, both for seed production and for forage, {{either as a}} pure crop or as an <b>undercrop,</b> and is well adapted to the hot-dry climate and poor soils of Southern of Italy. Generally, cultivar identification is done {{on the basis of}} distinctive traits, such as shape, size, colour of the testa and ornamentations, identified during the variety registration, following official protocols. For some vetch varieties seed identification by specialized technicians is possible without difficulty, while for other varieties it is very difficult and sometimes impossible to achieve undoubted identification. Therefore, it is important, from both technical and economical points of view, to have a quick, reliable, repeatable, and non destructive method to be able to identify and classify seeds objectively. In order to promote computerised image analysis as a tool to aid visual inspection and replace human judgement in the discrimination of different seeds, this technique was applied to analyse and identify seeds of common vetch varieties. Seed size, shape and colour of nine Italian cultivars of common vetch (Vicia saliva L.) and one of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) were measured using digital images acquired by a flatbed scanner and, {{on the basis of a}} Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm, a statistical classifier able to identify the ten cultivars was implemented...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{commercial}} horticulture has provided {{an incentive to}} harvest mature Dicksonia stems from private and crown forests in Tasmania in order to supply Soft Tree Ferns at low prices domestically in Australia {{and to develop a}} very small market at high specially prices for export to Europe. Extraction and marketing of Dicksonia antarctica for export raised new issues of conservation and management of the native fern flora in Australia. At the same time, such an opportunity provided new avenues for research on the application of propagated growing stock and commercial silviculture of the tree fern within managed understoreys of fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations. Project Objectives (i) Preliminary investigation of regeneration biology and microclimate requirements for growth of Soft Tree Fern in native moist forest and in clearfelled plantation sites, notably to establish silvicultural requirements of the tree fern as a commercial understorey crop in Eucalyptus plantations, presently being widely established by large scale private forest companies in northern Tasmania. (ii) Development of suitable techniques for nursery propagation, micropropagation, species provenance and site tolerance trials, suitable to complement and progressively to replace existing salvage of mature Dicksonia from field harvest, prior to reduction of the private forest clearance programme for plantation establishment.

40|$|Inverse methods which {{conserve}} mass, {{heat and}} salt {{are applied to}} high resolution hydrographic data in the Southern Ocean and adjacent ocean basins. Dianeutral fluxes are incorporated into the inverse model by including a separate dianeutral flux unknown for each property. Further model development includes the addition of air-sea forcing (wind stress, air-sea heat flux and freshwater flux). The inverse model is then used to test different circulation hypotheses, including the estimated size of the heat loss over the Weddell Sea {{and the strength of}} the Malvinas Current. The accuracy of inverse methods are tested using the Fine Resolution Antarctic Model. This shows that the lateral and dianeutral fluxes are well determined by inverse methods and that the "true" effective diffusion across neutral surfaces in the inverse model can be much larger, and in some cases of opposite sign, to the explicit diffusion in the numerical model when layers outcrop or <b>undercrop.</b> The latter results has implications for how diffusivity estimates obtained from inverse models should be interpreted. In the initial inverse model the Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport varies from 133 ± 2 x 106 m 3 s- 1 at Drake Passage to 148 ± 4. 5 south of Australia., There is a - 15 ± 8 x 106 m 3 s- 1 southward transport through the Indian Ocean and a similar sized northward transport into the Pacific Ocean at 32 °S. The addition of air-sea fluxes results in a 5 x 106 m 3 s- 1 decrease in the southward, eastward and northward transport in the Indian ocean, south of Australia and across 32 °S in the Pacific. The imposition of a large northward Malvinas Current (60 x 106 m 3 s- 1), adjacent to the South American coast maintains a similar eastward transport at Drake Passage, south of Africa and south of Australia. The southward and northward transport through the Indian Ocean and across 32 °S in the Pacific is decreased further to - 8. 3 ± 5. lx 106 m 3 s- 1 and 8. 8 ± 14. 2 x 106 m 3 s- 1, respectively. By including air-sea forcing and interior dianeutral fluxes, the water mass production and modification that occurs in the regions defined by the hydrographic sections, can be quantified. In the Indian Ocean sector, the 1 Agulhas Current transports warm Indonesian throughflow thermocline water into the Southern Ocean. The thermocline water (10 x 106 m 3 s- 1) is transferred to SAMW by air-sea (cooling and evaporation) processes and interior dianeutral fluxes. As the SAMW moves eastward with the ACC, Antarctic surfaces water (16 x 106 m 3 s- 1) is converted to SAMW across the Polar Front Zone resulting in progressive cooling and freshening of SAMW. 10 x 106 m 3 s- 1 of the locally produced SAMW in the Southern Ocean Indian exits the region northward across 32 °S ventilating the subtropical gyre, while the remaining 15 x 106 m 3 s- 1 moves eastward with the ACC into the Southern Ocean Pacific sector. In the Southern Ocean Pacific sector 11 x 106 m 3 s- 1 of SAMW is transferred into thermocline water by air-sea fluxes and exported northward in the Pacific Ocean across 32 °S. This circulation path of thermocline water between the Indian and Pacific Oceans describes the Indonesian throughflow as a circum-Australia feature. North Atlantic Deep Water (20 x 106 m 3 s- 1) moves southward across 15 °S in the Atlantic and is the major source of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water. Lower Circumpolar Deep Water salinity and oxygen maxima are eroded during the eastward progression of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Strong deep overturning circulation are found in the Indian (26 x 106 m 3 s- 1) and Pacific (30 x 106 m 3 s- 1) Oceans. The northward transport of Antarctic Bottom Water and Circumpolar Deep Water into the Indian and Pacific Oceans is essentially balanced by the return of slightly less dense, low oxygen Indian and Pacific Deep water. The southward inflow of Indian and Pacific deep water to the Southern Ocean results in the formation of Upper Circumpolar Deep Water. The eastward flow of Antarctic Bottom Water, by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, into the Southern Ocean Pacific sector is not sufficient to balance the northward export of Antarctic Bottom Water into the Pacific Ocean across 32 °S. This implies there are sources of Antarctic Bottom Water within the Southern Ocean Pacific sector. The circulation results in a meridional heat flux at 30 °S of - 0. 51 PW. The southward heat flux is dominated by a large southward heat flux in the Indian Ocean (- 0. 94 ± 0. 18 PW), a northward heat flux in the Atlantic (0. 34 ± 0. 13 PW) and a small northward heat flux in the Pacific (0. 09 ± 0. 26 PW) ...|$|R
