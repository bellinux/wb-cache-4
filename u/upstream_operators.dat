Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery is a form of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is key to harvesting California’s heavy crude. Currently, California uses EOR to help produce about 60% of its crude output. By using solar power instead of natural gas to create steam for EOR, solar steam generation reduces the amount of emissions produced during oil extraction, thus lowering the overall carbon intensity of crude. California currently has two solar EOR projects in operation, one in McKittrick, operated by LINN Energy (formerly Berry Petroleum) using enclosed trough technology from GlassPoint Solar, and another in Coalinga operated by Chevron Corporation using BrightSource Energy power tower technology.

40|$|Shale gas {{development}} is transforming the energy landscape in the United States. Advances in production technologies, notably the dual application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, allow {{the extraction of}} vast deposits of trapped natural gas that, until recently, were uneconomic to produce. The objective of this work is to develop mixed-integer programming models to support <b>upstream</b> <b>operators</b> in making faster and better decisions that ensure low-cost and responsible natural gas production from shale formations. We propose a multiperiod mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model along with a tailored solution strategy for strategic, quality-sensitive shale gas development planning. The presented model coordinates planning and design decisions to maximize the net present value of a field-wide development project. By performing a lookback analysis {{based on data from}} a shale gas producer in the Appalachian Basin, we find that return-to-pad operations are the key to cost-effective shale gas development strategies. We address impaired water management challenges in active development areas through a multiperiod mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. This model is designed to schedule the sequence of fracturing jobs and coordinate impaired- and freshwater deliveries to minimize water management expenses, while simultaneously maximizing revenues from gas sales. Based on the results of a real-world case study, we conclude that rigorous optimization can support <b>upstream</b> <b>operators</b> in cost-effectively reducing freshwater consumption significantly, while also achieving effective impaired water disposal rates of less than one percent. We also propose a multiperiod MINLP model and a tailor-designed solution strategy for line pressure optimization in shale gas gathering systems. The presented model determines when prospective wells should be turned in-line, and how the pressure profile within a gathering network needs to be managed to maximize the net present value of a development project. We find that backoff effects associated with turn-in line operations can be mitigated through preventive line pressure manipulations. Finally, we develop deterministic and stochastic MILP models for refracturing planning. These models are designed {{to determine whether or not}} a shale well should be restimulated, and when exactly to refracture it. The stochastic refracturing planning model explicitly considers exogenous price forecast uncertainty and endogenous well performance uncertainty.

Multivariate analyses were employed to test multiple linear model relationship between a variable and series of other non-dependent variables, e. g. between project performance and other factors like total cost, project schedule, alliance strategy, contract strategy, and project complexity. Binary logistic regression models, analyzed for project performance prediction, generated a range of regression coefficients that indicate relative levels of impact. The results of the investigation provide performance models which are useful in predicting the relative effects of factors that could influence project performance.

40|$|In the {{chemical}} and petrochemical industry, it is quite common that the manufacturing of a final product {{is the result of}} several consecutive steps which can be owned and operated by one or many participants. Although not always practical, equal ownership among all partners along the value chain is often recommended as a way to simplify business structure, ensuring all partners share equally in {{the ups and downs of}} an uncertain market. In contrast to this approach, there are instances where more benefit can be derived from having different owners and operators along the value chain. Examples which are common practice in the industry are the supply of utilities (e. g., electricity), feedstock, and services. In these cases, the nonintegrated approach offers value as: It provides the <b>operator</b> of the <b>upstream</b> or utility plants the opportunity to specialize, for example, by operating very similar plants around the world. Such specialization enables the use of regional operating centers, minimum onsite cash costs, optimized operating conditions, minimized energy consumption, and the optimal use of other variable cost parameters. This article shows that if outsourcing results in a cash cost saving by an <b>upstream</b> <b>operator,</b> the benefit to the downstream owner will (in financial reward) be proportional to the cash cost saving achieved. In absolute terms, the magnitude of the benefit is moderated by the size of the downstream capital investment (The bigger the downstream investment relative to the upstream investment, the smaller the impact of the saving on the economics of the downstream company). As a “utility provider” an <b>upstream</b> <b>operator</b> benefits from lower risk in terms of offtake and market price uncertainties. Such owners benefit from a lower cost of capital, and as such also have lower return expectations than players further along in the value chain (who are exposed to all the uncertainties in volatile markets). This article shows that the positive impact of such benefits to the return of the downstream partner is directly proportional the difference in return expectations between the upstream and downstream company. Once again, the absolute magnitude of the saving becomes more substantial as the ratio of upstream capital investment increases relative to the downstream capital investment. Economy of learning may also enable a specialized upstream company to obtain an asset at a lower capital than a less specialized downstream operator. This article shows that the positive impact of such a benefit is very similar to that of a lower return expectation by the upstream company. [URL] Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli {{galactose}} operon {{contains an}} unusual array of closely spaced binding sites for proteins governing the expression {{from the two}} physically overlapping gal promoters. Based on studies of two gal promoter-up mutants we have previously suggested RNA-polymerase-induced DNA bending of gal promoter DNA. Here we present new evidence confirming and extending this interpretation. It was obtained by the circular permutation assay of gel electrophoretic mobility [Wu and Crothers (1984), Nature, 308, 509 - 513] applied to three analogous series of circularly permuted fragments derived from wild-type and two promoter-up mutant DNAs. The same circularly permuted DNA fragments have further been used to study the binding of gal repressor to its operator sites by electrophoretic mobility shift and by DNase I footprinting techniques. The main results are: (i) complexes carrying repressor either exclusively at the <b>upstream</b> <b>operator</b> O 1 or at the downstream operator O 2 exhibit different electrophoretic mobilities; (ii) binding to either one of the operators results in protein-induced DNA bending by the criteria of the circular permutation mobility assay; and (iii) occupation of both gal operators by gal repressor does not prevent cAMP-CRP-independent binding of RNA polymerase to the gal promoters, as judged by DNase I protection and gel retardation assays.

40|$|Abstract—In-network {{processing}} is {{touted as}} a key technology to eliminate data redundancy and minimize data transmission, which are crucial to saving energy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, operators participating in in-network pro-cessing are mapped to nodes in a sensor network. They receive data from downstream operators, process them and route the output to either the <b>upstream</b> <b>operator</b> or the sink node. The objective of operator tree placement is to minimize the total energy consumed in performing in-network processing. Two types of placement algorithms, centralized and distributed, have been proposed. A problem with the centralized algorithm {{is that it does}} not scale to large WSN’s, because each sensor node is required to know the complete topology of the network. A problem with the distributed algorithm is their high message complexity. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm to place a tree-structured operator graph, and present a distributed implemen-tation to optimize in-network processing cost and reduce the communication overhead. We prove a tight upper bound on the minimum in-network processing cost, and show that the heuristic algorithm has better performance than a canonical greedy algorithm. Simulation-based evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our heuristic algorithm. We also give an improved distributed implementation of our algorithm that has a message overhead of O(M) per node, which is much less than the O(NM log 2 M) and O(NM) complexities for two previously proposed algorithms, Sync and MCFA, respectively. Here, N is the number of network nodes and M is the size of the operator tree. Index Terms—Sensor networks, operator tree placement, heuristic algorithm. I...|$|R

We have found that NagC, binds to a single, high-affinity site overlapping the promoter of galP (galactose permease) gene and that expression of galP is repressed by a combination of NagC, GalR and GalS.

These features arise from the low volumetric energy density of natural gas and the significance of gas quality and pressure in supply chain operations. Contracts {{play a central role}} in the entire supply chain due to high capital cost, specificity and investment risks associated with gas infrastructure. An upstream production planning framework is crucial for supply-side optimization and scenario evaluation in the natural gas supply chain. The technical features of upstream systems imply that the most efficient mode of operation is by single entity central control of the system, while their economics favor involvement of multiple parties in ownership. To resolve this conflict, upstream systems are generally operated by a single operator on the basis of governing rules that stem from agreements between the <b>upstream</b> <b>operator,</b> multiple stakeholders and consumer facilities. These agreements govern production sharing, operational strategy and gas sales in the upstream system. A short-term operational planning framework (with a 2 - 12 weeks planning horizon) for upstream natural gas systems is presented that can help to maximize production infrastructure utilization and aid in its management, minimize costs and meet production targets while simultaneously satisfying governing rules. Its requirements are inspired by the Sarawak Gas Production System (SGPS), an offshore gas production system in the South China Sea, which supplies the liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant complex at Bintulu in East Malaysia. This is the first attempt to formulate a comprehensive modeling framework for an upstream gas production system that includes a production infrastructure model and a methodology to incorporate governing rules. (cont.) The model has two components: the infrastructure model is a model of the physical system, i. e., of wells, trunkline network and facilities while the contractual model is a mathematical representation of the governing rules, e. g., production-sharing contracts (PSC), customer specifications and operational rules. The model formulation and objectives are from the perspective of the <b>upstream</b> <b>operator.</b> The infrastructure model incorporates the capability to track multiple qualities of gas throughout the network and determine the optimal routing and blending of gas such that the quality specifications are satisfied at the demand nodes. Nonlinear pressure-flowrate relationships in wells and the network are included for predicting a sufficiently accurate pressure-flowrate profile thereby facilitating implementation of the production strategy on the network. Modeling of complex platform configurations with reversible lines, lines that can be shut-off in normal operation and compression facilities, further improve the realistic representation of the network. A simplified prediction of natural gas liquids (NGL) production is included to maximize NGL revenue. The contractual model represents the framework for modeling the governing rules that are central to the operation of upstream systems. Modeling of productionsharing contracts is a two-fold challenge: accounting for gas volumes and converting the logical rules as stated in the system operations manual to binary constraints. A PSC network representation is proposed to account for gas volumes as well as interactions between different PSC. PSC rules are expressed as logical expressions in terms of availability, priority and transfer Boolean-states, and converted to binary constraints. Additional logical constraints are required to model the inference and intent of the rules. Operational rules can be modeled within the same framework. (cont.) The resulting mathematical program is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) with nonconvex functions and can be solved with the current state-of-the-art global optimization approaches, provided careful attention is paid to the model formulation. A hierarchical multi-objective approach is proposed to address multiple objectives when operating upstream systems, by optimizing a lower priority objective over the multiple optimal solutions of a program with a higher priority objective to obtain a win-win scenario. A reproducible case study that captures all the features of natural gas upstream systems is constructed to facilitate future work in algorithm development for such problems. A preliminary comparison with the existing approach indicates that substantial benefits may be possible by using the proposed approach for short-term planning. The application of a reduced-space global optimization approach to planning in upstream gas networks has also been demonstrated, which can significantly lower the number of variables in the branch-and-bound algorithm. The lower bounding problem is implemented using McCormick (convex) relaxations of computer evaluated functions and solved by implementing a nonsmooth bundle solver as a linearization tool to obtain a linear programming relaxation. The upper bounding problem is implemented using automatic differentiation and a local NLP solver. Branch-and-bound with reduction heuristics and linearization propagation is used for global optimization. This approach has been found to be competitive with current state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms for upstream planning problems. by Ajay Selot. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{microorganisms}} to degrade L-tyrosine to phenol, pyruvate, and ammonia is catalyzed by the inducible enzyme L-tyrosine phenol lyase (EC 4. 1. 99. 2). To investigate possible mechanisms {{for how the}} synthesis of this enzyme is regulated, a variety of biochemical and genetic procedures was used to analyze transcription from the tpl promoter of Citrobacter freundii ATCC 29063 (C. braakii). By computer analysis of the region upstream of the tpl structural gene, two segments of DNA bearing strong homology to the known operator targets of the TyrR protein of Escherichia coli were detected. A DNA fragment of 509 bp carrying these operator targets plus the presumptive tpl promoter was synthesized by PCR and used to construct a single-copy tpl-lacZ reporter system. The formation of beta-galactosidase in strains carrying this reporter system, which was measured in E. coli strains of various genotypes, was strongly dependent {{on the presence of}} a functional TyrR protein. In strains bearing deletions of the tyrR gene, the formation of beta-galactosidase was reduced by a factor of 10. Several mutationally altered forms of TyrR were deficient in their abilities to activate the tpl promoter. The pattern of loss of activation function was exactly parallel to the effects of the same tyrR mutations on the mtr promoter, which is known to be activated by the TyrR protein. When cells carrying the tpl-lacZ reporter system were grown on glycerol, the levels of beta-galactosidase were 10 - to 20 -fold higher than those observed in glucose-grown cells. The effect was the same whether or not TyrR-mediated stimulation of the tpl promoter was in effect. By deleting the cya gene, it was shown that the glycerol effect was attributable to stimulation of the tpl promoter by the cyclic AMP (cAMP) -cAMP reporter protein system. A presumptive binding site for this transcription factor was detected just upstream of the - 35 recognition hexamer of the tpl promoter. The transcriptional start point of the tpl promoter was determined by chemical procedures. The precise locations of the TyrR binding sites, which were established by DNase I footprinting, agreed with the computer-predicted positions of these regulatory sites. The two TyrR operators, which were centered at coordinates - 272. 5 and - 158. 5 with respect to the transcriptional start point, were independently disabled by site-directed mutagenesis. When the <b>upstream</b> <b>operator</b> was altered, activation was completely abolished. When the downstream operator was altered, there was a fourfold reduction in reporter enzyme levels.

Site directed mutagenesis was used to extend the looping sequence between the operator and the promoter in single base pair increments, resulting in a library with operator distances (the center to center distance between the operators) between 61. 5 and 161. 5 bp. These constructs did not contain a binding site for cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which {{has been shown to}} be involved in loop formation in the wild type operon [2]. Mutagenesis was used to change or remove the main operator from these constructs. Constructs were verified by sequencing, and are available upon request. The sequences corresponding to these constructs and their variable looping sequences can be found in Tables S 3 ‐ 4. Constructs were integrated into the galK locus of E. coli strain HG 104 with the wild‐type lacI background through recombineering, as described in Garcia and Phillips [1]. To measure the unregulated level of expression for each construct, DNA looping constructs were transduced into strain HG 105, containing a deletion of the lacI gene, by P 1 transductio...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa can utilize {{arginine}} {{and other}} amino acids as both carbon and nitrogen sources. Earlier {{studies have shown}} that the specific porin OprD facilitates the diffusion of basic amino acids as well as the structurally analogous beta-lactam antibiotic imipenem. The studies reported here showed that the expression of OprD was strongly induced when arginine, histidine, glutamate, or alanine served as the sole source of carbon. The addition of succinate exerted a negative effect on induction of oprD, likely due to catabolite repression. The arginine-mediated induction was dependent on the regulatory protein ArgR, and binding of purified ArgR to its <b>operator</b> <b>upstream</b> of the oprD gene was demonstrated by gel mobility shift and DNase assays. The expression of OprD induced by glutamate as the carbon source, however, was independent of ArgR, indicating the presence of more than a single activation mechanism. In addition, it was observed that the levels of OprD responded strongly to glutamate and alanine as the sole sources of nitrogen. Thus, that the expression of oprD is linked to both carbon and nitrogen metabolism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|Some, but not all, Chlamydia spp. are {{predicted}} to encode a homolog of ArgR, a master regulatory molecule that modulates arginine biosynthesis and catabolism in bacteria {{in response to}} intracellular arginine levels. While genes for arginine biosynthesis are apparently missing in Chlamydia, a putative arginine transport system encoded by glnP, glnQ, and artJ is present. We found that recombinant Chlamydia pneumoniae ArgR functions as an arginine-dependent aporepressor that bound specifically to <b>operator</b> sequences <b>upstream</b> of the glnPQ operon. ArgR was able to repress transcription in a promoter-specific manner that was dependent on the concentration of the corepressor l-arginine. We were able to locate ArgR <b>operators</b> <b>upstream</b> of glnPQ in C. pneumoniae and Chlamydophila caviae but not Chlamydia trachomatis, which corresponded to the predicted {{presence or absence of}} ArgR in these chlamydial species. Our findings indicate that only some members of the family Chlamydiaceae have an arginine-responsive mechanism of gene regulation that is {{predicted to}} control arginine uptake from the host cell. This is the first study to directly demonstrate a species-specific mechanism of transcriptional regulation in Chlamydia...|$|R
40|$|The Bacillus subtilis zinc uptake {{repressor}} (Zur) regulates genes {{involved in}} zinc uptake. We have used DNA microarrays to identify genes that are derepressed in a zur mutant. In addition {{to members of}} the two previously identified Zur-regulated operons (yciC and ycdHI-yceA), we identified two other genes, yciA and yciB, as targets of Zur regulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments demonstrated that all three operons are direct targets of Zur regulation. Zur binds to an ∼ 28 -bp <b>operator</b> <b>upstream</b> of the yciA gene, as judged by DNase I footprinting, and similar operator sites are found preceding each of the previously described target operons, yciC and ycdHI-yceA. Analysis of a yciA-lacZ fusion indicates that this operon is induced under zinc starvation conditions and derepressed in the zur mutant. Phenotypic analyses suggest that the YciA, YciB, and YciC proteins may function as part of the same Zn(II) transport pathway. Mutation of yciA or yciC, singly or in combination, had little effect on growth of the wild-type strain but significantly impaired the growth of the ycdH mutant under conditions of zinc limitation. Since the YciA, YciB, and YciC proteins are not obviously related to any known transporter family, they may define a new class of metal ion uptake system. Mutant strains lacking all three identified zinc uptake systems (yciABC, ycdHI-yceA, and zosA) are dependent on micromolar levels of added zinc for optimal growth...|$|R
40|$|The dissimilatory nitrite reductase gene (nir) from denitrifying {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas stutzeri JM 300 {{was isolated}} and sequenced. In agreement with recent sequence information from another strain of P. stutzeri (strain ZoBell), strain JM 300 nir {{is the first}} gene in an operon and is followed immediately by a gene which codes for a tetraheme protein; 2. 5 kb downstream from the nitrite reductase carboxyl terminus is the cytochrome c 551 gene. P. stutzeri JM 300 nir is 67 % homologous to P. aeruginosa nir and 88 % homologous to P. stutzeri ZoBell nir. Within the nitrite reductase promoter region is an fnr-like operator very similar to an <b>operator</b> <b>upstream</b> of a separate anaerobic pathway, that for arginine catabolism in P. aeruginosa. The denitrification genes in P. stutzeri thus may be under the same regulatory control as that found for other anaerobic pathways of pseudomonads. We have generated gene probes from restriction fragments within the nitrite reductase operon to evaluate their usefulness in ecology studies of denitrification. Probes generated from the carboxyl terminus region hybridized to denitrifying bacteria from five separate genera and did not cross-hybridize to any nondenitrifying bacteria among six genera tested. The denitrifier probes were successful in detecting denitrifying bacteria from samples such as a bioreactor consortium, aquifer microcosms, and denitrifying toluene-degrading enrichments. The probes also were used to reveal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} patterns indicating the diversity of denitrifiers present in these mixed communities...|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori is {{dependent}} upon {{the production of the}} highly abundant and active metalloenzyme urease for colonization of the human stomach. Thus, H. pylori has an absolute requirement for the transition metal nickel, a required cofactor for urease. To investigate the contribution of genes that are factors in this process, microarray analysis comparing the transcriptome of wild-type H. pylori 26695 cultured in brucella broth containing fetal calf serum (BBF) alone or supplemented with 100 μM NiCl 2 suggested that HP 1512 is repressed in the presence of 100 μM supplemental nickel. When measured by comparative real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), HP 1512 transcription was reduced 43 -fold relative to the value for the wild type when cultured in BBF supplemented with 10 μM NiCl 2. When grown in unsupplemented BBF, urease activity of an HP 1512 ::cat mutant was significantly reduced compared to the wild type, 4. 9 ± 0. 5 μmol/min/mg of protein (n = 7) and 17. 1 ± 4. 9 μmol/min/mg of protein (n = 13), respectively (P < 0. 0001). In silico analysis of the HP 1511 -HP 1512 (HP 1511 - 1512) intergenic region identified a putative NikR <b>operator</b> <b>upstream</b> of HP 1512. Gel shift analysis with purified recombinant NikR verified nickel-dependent binding of H. pylori NikR to the HP 1511 - 1512 intergenic region. Furthermore, comparative real-time qPCR of four nickel-related genes suggests that mutation of HP 1512 results in reduced intracellular nickel concentration relative to wild-type H. pylori 26695. Taken together, these data suggest that HP 1512 encodes a NikR-nickel-regulated outer membrane protein...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of mepA, encoding the Staphylococcus aureusMepA multidrug efflux protein, is repressed by the MarR ho-mologue MepR. MepR dimers bind differently to <b>operators</b> <b>upstream</b> ofmepR andmepA, with affinity being greatest at the mepA operator. MepR substitution mutations may result inmepA overexpression, with A 103 V {{most common in}} clinical strains. Evaluation of the functional consequences of this and other MepR substitutions using a lacZ reporter gene assay revealed markedly reduced repressor activity {{in the presence of}} Q 18 P, F 27 L, G 97 E, and A 103 V substitutions. Reporter data were generally supported by susceptibility and efflux assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) confirmed compromised affinities of MepR F 27 L and A 103 V for themepR andmepA operators. One mutant protein contained two substitutions (T 94 P and T 132 M); T 132 M compensated for the functional defect incurred by T 94 P and also rescued that of A 103 V but not F 27 L, establishing it as a limited-range suppressor. The function of another derivative with 10 substitutions was minimally affected, and this may be an extreme example of suppression involving interactions among several residues. Structural correlations for the observed functional effects were ascertained by modeling mutations onto apo-MepR. It is likely that F 27 L and A 103 V affect the protein-DNA interaction by repositioning of DNA recognition helices. Negative func-tional consequences of MepR substitution mutations may result from interference with structural plasticity, alteration of helical arrangements, reduced protein-cognate DNA affinity, or possibly association of MepR protomers.
