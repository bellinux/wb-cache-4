25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} the letters in antiquity are {{majuscule}} forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: <b>uncial</b> <b>writing,</b> with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, {{as well as many}} connecting lines and ligatures between letters.|$|E
500|$|The <b>uncial</b> <b>writing</b> is continuous, {{with the}} {{punctuation}} consisting only {{of a single}} point, as in codices Alexandrinus and Vaticanus. The capitals at the beginning sections stand out in the margin as in codices Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Basilensis. Iota and upsilon, which in Alexandrinus and many other manuscripts have two dots over them (diaeresis) when they commence a syllable – sometimes only one dot – have in the Codex Ephraemi a small straight line in their place.|$|E
60|$|Besides the <b>uncial</b> <b>writing</b> on the convex {{side of the}} sherd at the top, {{painted in}} dull red, on {{what had once been}} the lip of the amphora, was the {{cartouche}} already mentioned as being on the scarabæus, which we had also found in the casket. The hieroglyphics or symbols, however, were reversed, just as though they had been pressed on wax. Whether this was the cartouche of the original Kallikrates,[*] or of some Prince or Pharaoh from whom his wife Amenartas was descended, I am not sure, nor can I tell if it was drawn upon the sherd {{at the same time that}} the uncial Greek was inscribed, or copied on more recently from the Scarab by some other member of the family. Nor was this all. At the foot of the writing, painted in the same dull red, was the faint outline of a somewhat rude drawing of the head and shoulders of a Sphinx wearing two feathers, symbols of majesty, which, though common enough upon the effigies of sacred bulls and gods, I have never before met with on a Sphinx.|$|E

6000|$|As for myself, I said nothing: {{my first}} idea being that my poor friend, being demented, had {{composed}} the whole thing, though it scarcely seemed likely {{that such a}} story could have been invented by anybody. It was too original. To solve my doubts I took up the potsherd {{and began to read}} the close <b>uncial</b> Greek <b>writing</b> on it; and very good Greek of the period it is, considering that it came from the pen of an Egyptian born. Here is an exact transcript of it:-- ...|$|R
50|$|The {{minuscule}} {{script was}} a Greek writing style which was {{developed as a}} book hand in Byzantine manuscripts during the 9th and 10th centuries. It replaced the earlier style of <b>uncial</b> <b>writing,</b> from which it differed in using smaller, more rounded and more connected letter forms, and in using {{a large number of}} ligatures. Many of these forms had previously developed as parts of more informal cursive writing. The basic letter shapes used in the minuscule script were the ancestors of modern lower case Greek letters.|$|E
50|$|Semi-uncial was {{the second}} type of writing, that had been {{developed}} from the 14th century and later replaced the uncial. This script is brighter and more roundish. Its letters are more shallow: they have many superscript marks and the whole system of punctuation marks. Letters are more flexible and wide in comparison with the <b>uncial</b> <b>writing</b> and have lower and upper elongations. The broad-pen technique used while writing the uncial is seldom applied in the semi-uncial. Semi-uncial was used with cursive and ligature in the 14th-18th centuries along with the other writing styles.|$|E
50|$|The <b>uncial</b> <b>writing</b> is continuous, {{with the}} {{punctuation}} consisting only {{of a single}} point, as in codices Alexandrinus and Vaticanus. The capitals at the beginning sections stand out in the margin as in codices Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Basilensis. Iota and upsilon, which in Alexandrinus and many other manuscripts have two dots over them (diaeresis) when they commence a syllable - sometimes only one dot - have in the Codex Ephraemi a small straight line in their place. The breathings and accents were added by a later hand. The nomina sacra tend to be contracted into three-letter forms rather than the more common two-letter forms.|$|E
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{once belonged}} to Maximus Panagiotes. The manuscript {{was added to the}} list of New Testament manuscripts by Scholz (1794-1852). Dean Burgon regarded it as a specimen between <b>uncial</b> and cursive <b>writing.</b> It was examined and described by Paulin Martin. C. R. Gregory saw the manuscript in 1885.|$|R
2500|$|The codex {{contains}} the complete {{text of the}} Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John on 157 parchment leaves ( [...] by [...] ). The leaves are arranged in quarto, that is four leaves folded in quires. The text is written in two columns per page, 23 lines per page. There are no spaces between letters, and the words are not separate but written in scriptio continua. The uncial letters are small, not beautiful and slanting. The letters are characterized by Slavonic <b>uncials.</b> The <b>writing</b> {{is similar to that}} of Codex Cyprius.|$|R
50|$|The codex {{contains}} {{a small part}} of the Gospel of Matthew 12:17-19.23-25; 13:32; 13:36-15:26 on five elegant parchment leaves (30 cm by 22 cm). It is written in one column per page, 20 lines per page, in large <b>uncial</b> letters. The <b>writing</b> is elegant, it uses breathings and accents. The letters are leaned into right.|$|R

5000|$|In essence, the {{uppercase}} form of epsilon looks {{identical to}} Latin E. The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from medieval Greek handwriting. One, {{the most common}} in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed [...] "3". The other, also known as lunate or uncial epsilon and inherited from earlier <b>uncial</b> <b>writing,</b> looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar. While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols. Computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them. In Unicode, the character U+03F5 [...] "Greek lunate epsilon symbol" [...] (ϵ) is provided specifically for the lunate form. In TeX, [...] (...) denotes the lunate form, while [...] (...) denotes the reversed-3 form.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the early Christian inscriptions, viewed from a technical and paleographical standpoint, give evidence of artistic decay: this applies especially to the tituli of the catacombs, which are, as a rule, less finely executed than the non-Christian work of the same time. A striking exception is formed by the Damasine letters introduced in the 4th century by Furius Dionysius Filocalus, the calligraphist of Pope Damasus I. The other forms of letters did not vary essentially from those employed by the ancients. The most important was the classical capital writing, customary {{from the time of}} Augustus; from the 4th century on it was gradually replaced by the <b>uncial</b> <b>writing,</b> the cursive characters being more or less confined to graffito inscriptions.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>uncial</b> {{letters are}} <b>written</b> separately, without breathings (rough breathing, smooth breathing) and accents. The initial letters are {{written on the}} margin. There is a {{punctuation}} and signs of interrogative. It does not use Iota subscriptum. The errors of itacism occur rarely, it uses N ephelkystikon, the abbreviations are used rarely. The text is divided according to the [...] (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{study of}} the writing, or [...] "hand" [...] in {{surviving}} manuscripts is termed palaeography. In the Western world, from the classical period through the early centuries of the Christian era, manuscripts were written without spaces between the words (scriptio continua), which makes them especially hard for the untrained to read. Extant copies of these early manuscripts written in Greek or Latin and usually dating from the 4th century to the 8th century, are classified according to their use of either all upper case or all lower case letters. Hebrew manuscripts, such as the Dead Sea scrolls make no such differentiation. Manuscripts using all upper case letters are called majuscule, those using all lower case are called minuscule. Usually, the majuscule scripts such as <b>uncial</b> are <b>written</b> with much more care. The scribe lifted his pen between each stroke, producing an unmistakable effect of regularity and formality. On the other hand, while minuscule scripts can be written with pen-lift, {{they may also be}} cursive, that is, use little or no pen-lift.|$|R
50|$|Alcuin {{made the}} abbey school into {{a model of}} {{excellence}} and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful calligraphy, the Carolingian minuscule based on round and legible <b>uncial</b> letters. He <b>wrote</b> many letters to his English friends, to Arno, bishop of Salzburg and above all to Charlemagne. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form {{an important source of}} information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of humanism during the Carolingian age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and it {{was in the midst of}} these pursuits that he died.|$|R
5000|$|Medieval Cyrillic {{manuscripts and}} Church Slavonic printed books have two variant {{forms of the}} letter Zemlja: з and [...] Only the form [...] {{was used in the}} oldest ustav (<b>uncial)</b> <b>writing</b> style; з {{appeared}} in the later poluustav (half-uncial) manuscripts and typescripts, where the two variants are found at proportions of about 1:1. Some early grammars tried to give a phonetic distinction to these forms (like palatalized vs. nonpalatalized sound), but the system had no further development. Ukrainian scribes and typographers began to regularly use З/з in an initial position, and [...] otherwise (a system in use till the end of the 19th century). Russian scribes and typographers largely abandoned the widespread use of the variant [...] in favor of з in the wake of Patriarch Nikon's reforms. They still used the older form mostly in the case of two З's in row: [...] (the system in use till the mid-18th century).|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{characteristic}} {{forms of the}} uncial type appear to {{have their origin in}} the early cursive, the two hands are nevertheless quite distinct. The uncial is a libraria, closely related to the capital writing, from which it differs only in the rounding off of the angles of certain letters, principally [...] It represents a compromise between the beauty and legibility of the capitals and the rapidity of the cursive, and is clearly an artificial product. It was certainly in existence by {{the latter part of the}} 4th century, for a number of manuscripts of that date are written in perfect uncial hands (Exempla, pl. XX). It presently supplanted the capitals and appears in numerous manuscripts which have survived from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, when it was at its height. By this time it had become an imitative hand, in which there was generally no room for spontaneous development. It remained noticeably uniform over a long period. It is difficult therefore to date the manuscripts by palaeographical criteria alone. The most that can be done is to classify them by centuries, on the strength of tenuous data. The earliest <b>uncial</b> <b>writing</b> is easily distinguished by its simple and monumental character from the later hands, which become progressively stiff and affected.|$|E
40|$|No romanization {{systems for}} Dzongkha {{have been put}} forward at the United Nations {{conferences}} on the standardization of geographical names or at sessions of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names. In 1991 the first phonological romanization for Dzongkha was introduced by the Dzongkha Development Commission. Roman Dzongkha as it was called, was intended to accurately and adequately represent the phonology of the living language and {{to serve as a}} standard for representing Dzongkha names and words in the international media. However, the system was not implemented, and later a simplified version of Roman Dzongkha was devised by the same Commission. Bhutan's Ministry of Home Affairs approved the implementation of Roman Dzongkha on May 29, 1997 and made it mandatory for all government institutions to use standardized spellings of geographical names and the guidelines for romanization. Dzongkha uses an alphasyllabic script (Uchen) which occurs in two main forms. The printed or <b>uncial</b> <b>writing</b> (tshum) is actually the same as is used in Tibetan. But Bhutanese longhand writing (formal version, jotshum, and cursive version, joyi) is unique to Dzongkha, making ample use of ligatures. Below only the printed form of characters is presented, for longhand writing one should refer to Dzongkha language manuals. 1 Relationship between script and pronunciation is complex and romanized names cannot be reverted to their original script forms. System of romanization The official romanization (1997) is as follows. ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next thing}} that I found was a {{parchment}} carefully rolled up. I unrolled it, and seeing {{that it was}} also in Vincey's handwriting, and headed, [...] "Translation of the <b>Uncial</b> Greek <b>Writing</b> on the Potsherd," [...] put it down by the letter. Then followed another ancient roll of parchment, that had become yellow and crinkled {{with the passage of}} years. This I also unrolled. It was likewise a translation of the same Greek original, but into black-letter Latin, which at the first glance from the style and character appeared to me to date from somewhere about the beginning of the sixteenth century. Immediately beneath this roll was something hard and heavy, wrapped up in yellow linen, and reposing upon another layer of the fibrous material. Slowly and carefully we unrolled the linen, exposing to view a very large but undoubtedly ancient potsherd of a dirty yellow colour! This potsherd had in my judgment, once been a part of an ordinary amphora of medium size. For the rest, it measured ten and a half inches in length by seven in width, was about a quarter of an inch thick, and densely covered on the convex side that lay towards the bottom of the box with writing in the later uncial Greek character, faded here and there, {{but for the most part}} perfectly legible, the inscription having evidently been executed with the greatest care, and by means of a reed pen, such as the ancients often used. I must not forget to mention that in some remote age this wonderful fragment had been broken in two, and rejoined by means of cement and eight long rivets. Also there were numerous inscriptions on the inner side, but these were of the most erratic character, and had clearly been made by different hands and in many different ages, and of them, together with the writings on the parchments, I shall have to speak presently.|$|R
