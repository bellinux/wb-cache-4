40|$|Purpose A {{possible}} complication after total disc replacement (TDR) is subsidence, presumably {{caused by}} asymmetric implantation, implant <b>undersizing</b> or reduced bone quality. This study aims {{to quantify the}} degree of subsidence of an SB Charité TDR, and investigate whether <b>undersizing</b> is related to subsidence. Methods A custom developed software package (Mathworks) reconstructed 3 D bone-implant geometry. A threshold for subsidence was determined by comparing penetrated bone volume (PBV) and rotation angles. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibilities were calculated. Subsidence was correlated to <b>undersizing.</b> Results High inter- and intra-observer correlation coefficients were found for the method (R 2 ̆ 6 gt; 0. 92). Subsidence was quantified as PBV 700 mm 3 combined with a rotation angle 2 ̆ 6 gt; 7. 5 °. A reduced risk of subsidence was correlated to 2 ̆ 6 gt; 60 and 2 ̆ 6 gt; 62...|$|R

This study evaluates the mechanical effects of <b>undersizing</b> and oversizing of stents on endothelial wall shear stress (WSS) and vessel wall stress to determine a possible biomechanical mechanism of in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Three-dimensional computational models of stents, artery, and internal fluid were created in a computer-assisted design package, meshed, and solved in finite element and computational fluid dynamic packages. The simulation results show that the effects of various degrees of <b>undersizing</b> on WSS, WSS gradient, and oscillatory shear index were highly nonlinear. As the degree of <b>undersizing</b> increased, the heterogeneity of WSS became smaller. The WSS distribution for the 20 % <b>undersizing</b> was smooth and uniform, whereas the 5 % case was very heterogeneous. The combination of lower WSS and higher WSS gradient and oscillatory shear index in the 5 % undersized case may induce neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. Additionally, the oversizing simulation results show that the maximum intramural wall stress of the 20 % oversizing case is significantly larger than the maximum stress for the 10 % and zero oversizing cases. Edge stress concentration was observed, consistent with the restenosis typically observed in this region. This study demonstrates that proper sizing of stent is important for reducing the hemodynamic and mechanical disturbances to the vessel wall. Furthermore, the present findings may be used to improve stent design to reduce endothelial flow disturbances and intramural wall stress concentrations...|$|R

40|$|This is a simulation-based warning {{note for}} {{practitioners}} {{who use the}} MGLS unit root tests {{in the context of}} structural change using different selection lag length criteria. With T= 100, we find severe oversize problems when using some criteria, while other criteria produce an <b>undersizing</b> behavior. In view of this dilemma, we do not recommend using these tests.

The ADFGLS test does not present an oversizing or <b>undersizing</b> problem. The only disadvantage of the ADFGLS test arises in the presence of MA(1) negative correlation, in which case the MGLS tests are preferable, but in all other cases they are very undersized.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{phased array}} results for 1 -D linear array probes of high frequency (7 - 10 MHz) in L-, and S-waves for detecting the crack shape {{and the last}} significant tip. Fatigue and stress-corrosion cracks with height ranging from 1. 6 mm to 20. 4 mm were detected in welded samples, piping welds and straight bars with thickness between 6 mm to 38 mm. The results of S-scan display are compared with different methods: optical, magnetic particles, fracture mechanics and metallography. The experimental results concluded the <b>undersizing</b> trend of PAUT in detecting the last crack tip or closure, in spite of using dynamic depth focusing, and/or focusing on crack tip. The average <b>undersizing</b> error is – 0. 4 mm. This error increases for cracks with depth> 12 mm. The largest errors occur when the crack is sized from outer surface coupled with initiation from the outside surface with propagation towards the inside surface.

40|$|A Mathcad {{computer}} program largely automates {{the design and}} analysis of the restraint layer (the primary load-bearing layer) of an inflatable vessel that consists of one or more sections having cylindrical, toroidal, and/or spherical shape(s). A restraint layer typically comprises webbing in the form of multiple straps. The design task includes choosing indexing locations along the straps, computing the load at every location in each strap, computing the resulting stretch at each location, and computing the amount of <b>undersizing</b> required of each strap so that, once the vessel is inflated and the straps thus stretched, the vessel can be expected to assume the desired shape. Prior to the development of this program, the design task was performed by use of a difficult-to-use spreadsheet program that required manual addition of rows and columns depending on the numbers of strap rows and columns of a given design. In contrast, this program is completely parametric and includes logic that automatically adds or deletes rows and columns as needed. With minimal input from the user, this program automatically computes indexing locations, strap lengths, <b>undersizing</b> requirements, and all design data required to produce detailed drawings and assembly procedures.

40|$|We {{study the}} way Lyot coronagraphs with unapodized {{entrance}} pupils respond to small, low order phase aberrations. This study is applicable to ground-based adaptive optics coronagraphs operating at 90 % and higher Strehl ratios, {{as well as}} to some space-based coronagraphs with intrinsically higher Strehl ratio imaging. We utilize a second order expansion of the monochromatic point-spread function (written as a power spectrum of a power series in the phase aberration over clear aperture) to derive analytical expressions for the response of a `band-limited' Lyot coronagraph (BLC) to small, low order, phase aberrations. The BLC possesses a focal plane mask with an occulting spot whose opacity profile is a spatially band-limited function rather than a hard-edged, opaque disk. The BLC is, to first order, insensitive to tilt and astigmatism. <b>Undersizing</b> the stop in the re-imaged pupil plane (the Lyot plane) following the focal plane mask can alleviate second order effects of astigmatism, at the expense of system throughput and angular resolution. The optimal degree of such <b>undersizing</b> depends on individual instrument designs and goals. Our analytical work engenders physical insight, and complements existing numerical work on this subject. Our methods can be extended to treat the passage of higher order aberrations through band-limited Lyot coronagraphs, by using our polynomial decomposition or an analogous Fourier approach.

40|$|In-stent {{restenosis}} and stent thrombosis remain {{clinically significant}} problems for bifurcation lesions. The {{objective of this}} study is to determine the haemodynamic effect of the side branch (SB) on main branch (MB) stenting. We hypothesize that the presence of a SB has a negative effect on MB wall shear stress (WSS), wall shear stress gradient (WSSG) and oscillatory shear index (OSI); and that the bifurcation diameter ratio (SB diameter/MB diameter) and angle are important contributors. We further hypothesized that stent <b>undersizing</b> exaggerates the negative effects on WSS, WSSG and OSI. To test these hypotheses, we developed computational models of stents and non-Newtonian blood. The models were then interfaced, meshed and solved in a validated finite-element package. Stents at bifurcation models were created with 30 ° and 70 ° bifurcation angles and bifurcations with diameter ratios of SB/MB = 1 / 2 and 3 / 4. It was found that stents placed in the MB at a bifurcation lowered WSS dramatically, while elevating WSSG and OSI. <b>Undersizing</b> the stent exaggerated the decrease in WSS, increase in WSSG and OSI, and disturbed the flow between the struts and the vessel wall. Stenting the MB at bifurcations with larger SB/MB ratios or smaller SB angles (30 °) resulted in lower WSS, higher WSSG and OSI. Stenosis at the SB lowered WSS and elevated WSSG and OSI. These findings highlight the effects of major biomechanical factors in MB stenting on endothelial WSS, WSSG, OSI and suggests potential mechanisms for the potentially higher adverse clinical events associated with bifurcation stenting...|$|R
