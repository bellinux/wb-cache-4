40|$|Different {{species of}} Daphnia show {{differences}} in their swimming behavior under different environmental conditions. We measured the three-dimensional swimming behavior of individual adult female Daphnia in the mesocosm-scale Plon plankton towers (6400 l) and in small (183 mi) observation chambers. Speed, sinking rate and turning angle were chosen as optimal variables for describing the free-swimming animals of four species. Speed, sinking rate and turning angle show <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> among treatments, and they are relatively independent. Light level and food level strongly affected swimming behavior. Light and food effects tended to be independent, although there were two instances of synergism (out of 12 possible interactions). Each of the four species (one clone per species) showed a unique response to food and light, which may reflect the diverse environmental origin of each clone. Swimming behavior was consistently different between the small-scale (183 mi) observation chamber and the mesocosm-scale (6400 l) plankton tower, suggesting that container size affects swimming behavior: in the smaller chamber, Daphnia, regardless of species, swam slower, sank slower and tended to move in straighter path...|$|E

However, {{little is known about the}} perspectives of such a selection strategy in beef cattle. Methods A two-step approach was applied to study the genetic heterogeneity <b>of</b> residual <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> weight gain from birth to weaning and long-yearling weight in a Nellore beef cattle population. First, an animal model was fitted to the data and second, the influence of additive and environmental effects on the residual <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> these traits was investigated with different models, in which the log squared estimated residuals for each phenotypic record were analyzed using the restricted maximum likelihood method. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to assess the reliability <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> component estimates from the second step and the accuracy of estimated breeding values for residual variation. Results The results suggest that both genetic and environmental factors have an effect on the residual <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> weight gain from birth to weaning and long-yearling in Nellore beef cattle and that <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> these traits could be improved by selecting for lower residual variance, when considering a large amount of information to predict genetic merit for this criterion. Simulations suggested that using the two-step approach would lead to biased estimates <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> components, such that more adequate methods are needed to study the genetic heterogeneity <b>of</b> residual <b>variance</b> in beef cattle. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Animal {{breeding}} {{programs have}} been very successful in improving the mean levels of traits through selection. However, in recent decades, reducing the variability of trait levels between individuals has become a highly desirable objective. Reaching this objective through genetic selection requires that there is genetic variation in the variability of trait levels, a phenomenon known as genetic heterogeneity <b>of</b> environmental (residual) <b>variance.</b> The aim <b>of</b> our {{study was to investigate}} the potential for genetic improvement <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> harvest weight and body size traits (length, depth, and width) in the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) strain. In order to quantify the genetic variation in <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> traits and estimate the genetic correlations between level and <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> the traits, double hierarchical generalized linear models were applied to individual trait values. Results: Our results showed substantial genetic variation in <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> all analyzed traits, with genetic coefficients of variation for residual variance ranging from 39 to 58 %. Genetic correlation between trait level and variance was strongly positive for harvest weight (0. 60 ± 0. 09), moderate and positive for body depth (0. 37 ± 0. 13), but not significantly different from 0 for body length and width. Conclusions: Our results on the genetic variation in <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> harvest weight and body size traits show good prospects for the genetic improvement <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> in the GIFT strain. A high and positive genetic correlation was estimated between level and <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> harvest weight, which suggests that selection for heavier fish will also result in more variation in harvest weight. Simultaneous improvement of harvest weight and its uniformity will thus require index selection. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Uniformity</b> <b>of</b> eggs is an {{important}} aspect for retailers because consumers prefer homogeneous products. One of these characteristics {{is the color of}} the eggshell, especially for brown eggs. Existence of a genetic component in environmental variance would enable selection for <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> eggshell color. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the genetic variance in environmental <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> eggshell color in purebred and crossbred laying hens, to estimate the genetic correlation between environmental <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> eggshell color in purebred and crossbred laying hens and to estimate genetic correlations between environmental variance at different times of the laying period. Methods: We analyzed 167, 651 and 79, 345 eggshell color records of purebred and crossbred laying hens, respectively. The purebred and crossbred laying hens originated mostly from the same sires. Since eggshell color records of crossbred laying hens were collected per cage, these records could be related only to cage and sire family. A double hierarchical generalized linear sire model was used to estimate the genetic <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> the mean of eggshell color and its environmental variance. Approximate standard errors for heritability and the genetic coefficient of variation for environmental variance were derived. Results: The genetic variance in environmental variance at the log scale was equal to 0. 077 and 0. 067, for purebred and crossbred laying hens, respectively. The genetic coefficient of variation for environmental variance was equal to 0. 28 and 0. 26, for purebred and crossbred laying hens, respectively. A genetic correlation of 0. 70 was found between purebred and crossbred environmental <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> eggshell color, which indicates that there is some reranking of sires for environmental <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> eggshell color in purebred and crossbred laying hens. Genetic correlations between environmental <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> eggshell color in different laying periods were generally higher than 0. 85, except between early laying and mid or late laying periods. Conclusions: Our results indicate that genetic selection can be efficient to improve <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> eggshell color in purebreds and crossbreds, ideally by applying combined crossbred and purebred selection. This methodology can be used to estimate genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred lines for <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> other traits and species. </p...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} for genetic variability in residual <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> livestock traits, which {{offers the potential}} for selection for increased <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> production. Different statistical approaches have been employed to study this topic; however, {{little is known about}} the concordance between them. The aim of our study was to investigate the genetic heterogeneity <b>of</b> residual <b>variance</b> on yearling weight (YW; 291. 15 ± 46. 67) in a Nellore beef cattle population; to compare the results of the statistical approaches, the two-step approach and the double hierarchical generalized linear model (DHGLM); and to evaluate the effectiveness of power transformation to accommodate scale differences. The comparison was based on genetic parameters, accuracy of EBV for residual variance, and cross-validation to assess predictive performance of both approaches. A total of 194, 628 yearling weight records from 625 sires were used in the analysis. The results supported the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity <b>of</b> residual <b>variance</b> on YW in Nellore beef cattle and the opportunity of selection, measured through the genetic coefficient of variation <b>of</b> residual <b>variance</b> (0. 10 to 0. 12 for the two-step approach and 0. 17 for DHGLM, using an untransformed data set). However, low estimates <b>of</b> genetic <b>variance</b> associated with positive genetic correlations between mean and residual variance (about 0. 20 for two-step and 0. 76 for DHGLM for an untransformed data set) limit the genetic response to selection for <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> production while simultaneously increasing YW itself. Moreover, large sire families are needed to obtain accurate estimates of genetic merit for residual variance, as indicated by the low heritability estimates (< 0. 007). Box-Cox transformation was able to decrease the dependence <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> on the mean and decreased the estimates of genetic parameters for residual variance. The transformation reduced but did not eliminate all the genetic heterogeneity <b>of</b> residual <b>variance,</b> highlighting its presence beyond the scale effect. The DHGLM showed higher predictive ability of EBV for residual variance and therefore should be preferred over the two-step approach. </p...|$|R

The calculation {{of the length of}} areas with missing seedlings in both drill and broadcast sowing can be achieved by using an area localization algorithm, which facilitated the comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence. Through a comparison between UAV images and the results of manual surveys used to gather data on the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0. 44 for broadcast sowing and 0. 64 for drill sowing. The RMSEs of the numbers of missing seedling regions for broadcast and drill sowing were 1. 39 and 3. 99, respectively. The RMSEs of the lengths of the missing seedling regions were 12. 39 cm for drill sowing and 0. 20 cm 2 for broadcast sowing.
