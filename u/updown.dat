Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse which had appeared in Herne and Swalecliffe but which been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in Harbledown during the 1850s, and one that had been active at Evington but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at Lower Hardres which had been active from at least the least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.|$|E

50|$|<b>Updown</b> Tetris can be {{considered}} as an extension of Classic Tetris; <b>Updown</b> Tetris is available in Story and Versus Modes, whereas Classic Tetris takes up what would be the Endless mode. The magical pieces are absent from this mode, and attacking the other player sends a number of lines to the other player; the lines rise from the bottom as filled lines with a one-block gap in a predetermined column and could be used as further lines to attack the opponent.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>Updown</b> Court {{was built}} in 1924 in the Queen Anne style and featured eight bedrooms, four sitting rooms, four bathrooms, a single swimming pool, and sat in 12 acres of grounds. Between 1962 and 1976 the property was home to Major General Sir Philip Ward, his wife Pamela and their four children, and during their ownership the gardens were {{open to the public}} to enjoy the spectacular woodland and roses. In 1977 <b>Updown</b> Court was acquired from the Wards by His Highness Prince Sami Gayed of Egypt.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Updown</b> Court (...) is a Californian style {{residence}} {{situated in}} the village of Windlesham in Surrey, England. The 103-room mansion has 58 acre of landscaped gardens and private woodland.

At Ribs Down in the north in private <b>Updown</b> Court and adjoining gardens land reaches 99 metres above sea level with a minimum descent (notch/col) of 31 metres, ranking 35th of 36 Surrey hills listed in the national hill-climbing database and the tallest private hill in Surrey.|$|E
50|$|In October 1987, {{the estate}} agency Knight Frank and Rutley were {{instructed}} to market the property for sale. On the morning after The Great Storm of 1987 (16 October), Antony Wardell, the agent, drove to the property to measure it up. Upon arriving, he discovered that during the storm the property had been destroyed by fire. Trees felled by the storm had brought down power lines, causing {{an explosion in the}} house and starting a fire. When Surrey Fire and Rescue Service had tried to reach <b>Updown</b> Court, they found their way blocked by more fallen trees and were unable to reach the house, which as a result was totally destroyed.|$|E

50|$|With Office 2010, Microsoft {{introduced}} VBA7, {{which contains}} a true pointer data type: LongPtr. This allows referencing 64-bit address space.

50|$|The Game Boy Color {{version is}} vastly {{different}} from the console versions. Magical and <b>Updown</b> Tetris {{are present in the}} game, plus new gameplay styles were added. All four characters are playable, alongside Pete, who is unlocked in Quest Mode, which replaces the console version's Story Mode. Due to limitations of the Game Boy's screen, the player can't see the adversary's gameplay and it is represented with a flashing laser {{on the left side of}} the screen, which height represents how tall the adversary's tetris pieces are stacked, and like it, reaching the top of the screen calls for a game over. This version also has the special meter, but only for some Tetris variants.|$|E
50|$|A spinner or numeric <b>updown</b> is a {{graphical}} {{control element}} with which a user may adjust a value in an adjoining text box by either clicking on an {{up or down}} arrow, or by holding an arrow down, causing the value in the text box to increase (if the up arrow is held down) or decrease (if the down arrow is held down). A spinner is typically oriented vertically. In most cases holding a button down causes {{the speed at which}} the associated value changes to increase. Usually, the value of the spinner is displayed in a text box next to the spinner, allowing the user to use the spinner to adjust the value, or to type the value into the text box.|$|E
50|$|This mode's {{main goal}} {{consists}} of a coin rally where the player has the goal of collecting coins that can be gathered by winning a match of Tetris; these are {{in the possession of}} certain characters or buildings, and each character has its unique way of playing Tetris. Once the player has all the coins that are needed to win the rally, he must get to the rally station before another player comes in with the coins collected. After beating Quest Mode three times, Pete can be unlocked as a playable character for all game modes. Tetris variants can also be unlocked to be played in single player mode by beating Quest Mode and waiting until the credits end; <b>Updown</b> and Standard Tetris are the only variants available in the start when playing single player.|$|E
50|$|With another {{mouth to}} feed, Allen-Vercoe started from scratch again, {{this time with}} a £4000 loan from a friend. He was able to grow this {{business}} until the property crash of the late 1980s sent him bust for a second time. With his wife having left him, he went East to seek new fortune and working in Oil and Gas with Ministry of Oil and Gas Construction (Zangas), re-established himself. By the time he entered public consciousness with <b>Updown</b> Court, Allen-Vercoe owned 42 private companies in the UK, flew a Jet Ranger helicopter, had assets including forests in Russia, coal mines in Ukraine, land in Latvia and Lithuania and estimated that his net worth was 'safely in excess of £50 million', despite not appearing on any of the many Rich Lists published each year.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, the {{property}} was completed and placed {{on the market for}} sale with Savills and Hamptons International. A leather-bound brochure, which in an effort to discourage timewasters, cost interested parties £500 to purchase, was produced and it is said that Savills were happy to arrange for prospective buyers to be driven to <b>Updown</b> Court in a Rolls Royce or flown in by helicopter for a viewing. Viewings, due to the size of {{the property}}, are said to have takend in excess of two and a half hours. In light of the buoyant property market at the time and a huge amount of press coverage, Allen-Veroe boasted in a 2005 interview that [...] "it will be gone in six months. We've already had interest from buyers from Russia and the Middle East. And three Chinese called to inquire just this morning".|$|E
50|$|Heatherside was {{put into}} the hands of an {{administrative}} receiver, Vivian Bairstow of Begbies Traynor. In 2002 Bairstow instructed FPDSavills and Knight Frank, to sell <b>Updown</b> Court to recover the company's assets and pay back creditors, who included an overseas lender. The guide price for the sale was £15 million and bids closed on 10 July 2002. A developer, Leslie Allen-Vercoe completed the purchase of the unfinished shell for £13 million (the approximate 2009 equivalent of £20 million) in January 2003. A planned further £30 million was to be spent finishing and redeveloping the property and the project was mainly funded by loans from the Irish Nationwide Building Society, who had loaned money to the previous developers; Heatherside Property Holdings. Allen-Vercoe engaged British architects Eades Hotwani, to replace John Scholz, and hired Italian craftsmen to lay the marble tiles and mosaics which adorned the interior of the property.|$|E
5000|$|During Magical and <b>Updown</b> Tetris, making {{lines and}} combos fills a special meter {{alongside}} the board called the Magic Meter, with the fill line initially {{set to the}} fourth row; when a player's meter is filled, all of the blocks drop, filling any gaps, and one predetermined column drops out; all the blocks above the meter are wiped clean, the meter resets, and play continues. The meter's fill level {{may or may not}} rise depending on the difficulty. If it does rise, it moves up two lines which makes it harder to fill and less effective. The meter can be reduced by two lines (to a minimum of two) by scoring an [...] "All Clear" [...] of completely clearing the board of pieces. In this way, the player is left with filled columns and one empty column, allowing either a Tetris or Pentris to be made easily using a straight piece.|$|E
50|$|Set in {{the centre}} of 58 acre of gardens and mature woodland, <b>Updown</b> Court is entered by a £2 million (3 million USD) heated marble driveway, has 103 rooms. 24 of these are bedrooms, {{each with its own}} marble en-suite bathroom.

40|$|Using the Braak staging for neurofibrillary {{changes as}} an {{objective}} {{indicator of the}} progression of Alzheimer's disease, we have performed a systematic search for global gene expression changes in the prefrontal cortex {{during the course of}} Alzheimer's disease. In the prefrontal cortex, senile plaques and neurofibrillary changes start to appear around Braak stage III, allowing for the detection of changes in gene expression before, during and after the onset of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Two distinct patterns of tightly co-regulated groups of genes were observed: (i) an increase in expression in early Braak stages, followed by a decline in expression in later stages (the <b>UPDOWN</b> clusters; containing 865 genes) and (ii) a decrease in expression in early Braak stages, followed by an increase in expression in later stages (the DOWNUP clusters; containing 983 genes). The most profound changes in gene expression were detected between Braak stages II and III, just before or at the onset of plaque pathology and neurofibrillary changes in the prefrontal cortex. We also observed an increase in intracellular beta amyloid staining from Braak stages I to III and a clear decrease in Braak stages IV to VI. These data suggest a link between specific gene expression clusters and Alzheimer's disease-associated neuropathology in the prefrontal cortex. Gene ontology over-representation and functional gene network analyses indicate an increase in synaptic activity and changes in plasticity during the very early pre-symptomatic stage of the disease. In later Braak stages, the decreased expression of these genes suggests a reduction in synaptic activity that coincides with the appearance of plaque pathology and neurofibrillary changes and the clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. The interaction of the ApoE genotype with the expression levels of the genes in the <b>UPDOWN</b> and DOWNUP clusters demonstrates that the accelerating role of ApoE-ε 4 in the progression of Alzheimer's disease is reflected in the temporal changes in gene expression presented here. Since the <b>UPDOWN</b> cluster contains several genes involved in amyloid precursor protein processing and beta amyloid clearance that increase in expression in parallel with increased intracellular beta amyloid load, just before the onset of plaque pathology in the prefrontal cortex, we hypothesize that the temporally orchestrated increase in genes involved in synaptic activity represents a coping mechanism against increased soluble beta amyloid levels. As these gene expression changes occur before the appearance of Alzheimer's disease-associated neuropathology, they provide an excellent starting point for the identification of new targets for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at the prevention of Alzheimer's diseas...|$|E
