25|$|Three <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses (1844) {{is a book}} by Søren Kierkegaard.|$|E
25|$|He {{published}} {{three books}} {{on the same day}} in 1843 and now, in 1844, he will publish four books in the month of June: Three <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, June 8, Philosophical Fragments, June 13, Prefaces, and The Concept of Anxiety, June 17. He had a plan in mind as he published these works.|$|E
25|$|He {{also wrote}} several more pseudonymous books in 1844: Philosophical Fragments, Prefaces and The Concept of Anxiety and {{finished}} the year up with Four <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, 1844. He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication {{in the rest of}} them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard {{published}} {{three more}} books {{about love and}} faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (Søren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries {{to see if the}} new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.|$|E
25|$|Though the Lord of the Isles {{had a large}} {{fleet of}} galleys in the 13th and 14th centuries, there appears little or no trace of a Scots navy during the Wars of Scottish Independence. With Scottish {{independence}} established, Robert the Bruce {{turned his attention to}} the <b>upbuilding</b> of Scots shipping and of a Scots navy. In his later days he visited the Western Isles, which was part of the domain of the powerful Lords of the Isles who owed only a loose allegiance to him, and established a royal castle at East Loch Tarbert in Argyll to overawe the semi-independent Islemen. The Exchequer Rolls of 1326 record the feudal services of certain of his vassals on the western coast in aiding him with their vessels and crews. Near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde he spent his last days in shipbuilding; and one royal man-of-war of the Viking type at least was equipped by him before he died in 1329.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with this}} work, Kierkegaard published, {{under his own}} name, Two <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses on May 16, 1843 {{intended}} to complement Either/Or, [...] "The Expectancy of Faith" [...] and [...] "Every Good and Every Perfect Gift is from Above". Kierkegaard also published another discourse during the printing of the second edition of Either/Or in 1849.|$|E
500|$|... "Ultimatium": The volume {{ends in a}} {{discourse}} on the <b>Upbuilding</b> in the Thought that: against God we are always in the wrong. His spiritual advice for [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] is that they make peace with each other. Here Kierkegaard quotes from the Gospel of Luke Chapter 19 verses 42 to the end for this discourse.|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard {{put an end}} to his own double-mindedness about devoting himself {{completely}} to aesthetics or developing a balance between the aesthetic and the ethical and going on to an ethical/Christian religious existence {{in the first part of}} his authorship (1843-1846) and then described what he had learned about himself and about being a Christian beginning with <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses in Various Spirits (1847). He learned to choose his own Either/Or.|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard, {{speaking}} {{in the voice of}} the <b>upbuilding</b> discourse at the end, says they are both wrong. They're both trying to find God in a childish way. Whatever they relate to in an external way will never make them happy or give them meaning. Art, science, dogma and ethics constantly change. We all {{want to be in the}} right and never in the wrong. Once we find what we desire we find that it wasn't what we imagined it to be. So Kierkegaard says to leave it all to God.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Ultimatium" [...] {{at the end}} of {{the second}} volume of Either/Or hinted at a future {{discussion}} of the religious stage in The Two <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, [...] "Ask yourself and keep on asking until you find the answer, for one may have known something many times, acknowledged it; one may have willed something many times, attempted it-and yet, only the deep inner motion, only the heart’s indescribable emotion, only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you, that no power can take it from you-for only the truth that builds up is truth for you." [...] This discussion is included in Stages on Life's Way (1845). The first two sections revisit and refine the aesthetic and ethical stages elucidated in Either/Or, while the third section, Guilty/Not Guilty is about the religious stage and refers specifically to Goethe's other book, The Autobiography of Goethe: Truth and Poetry, from My Own Life vol 1, 2 ...|$|E
500|$|Now {{he discovers}} that the self he chooses has a {{boundless}} multiplicity within itself inasmuch {{as it has}} a history, a history in which he acknowledges identity with himself. This history is of a different kind, for in this history he stands {{in relation to other}} individuals in the race, and to the whole race, and this history contains painful things, and yet he is the person he is only through this history. That is why it takes courage to choose oneself, for {{at the same time as}} he seems to be isolating himself most radically he is most radically sinking himself into the root by which he is bound up with the whole. This makes him uneasy, and yet it must be so, for when the passion of freedom is aroused in him-and it is aroused in the choice just as it presupposes itself in the choice-he chooses himself and struggles for this possession as for his salvation, and it is his salvation. Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216When a person turns and faces himself in order to understand himself, he steps, as it were, in the way of that first self, halts that which was turned outward in hankering for and seeking after the surrounding world that is its object, and summons it back from the external. In order to prompt the first self to this withdrawal, the deeper self lets the surrounding world remain what it is-remain dubious. This is indeed the way it is; the world around us is inconstant and can be changed into the opposite at any moment, and there is not one person who can force this change by his own might or by the conjuration of his wish. The deeper self now shapes the deceitful flexibility of the surrounding world in such a way that it is no longer attractive to the first self. Then the first self either must proceed to kill the deeper self, to render it forgotten, whereby the whole matter is given up; or it must admit that the deeper self is right, because to want to predicate constancy of something that continually changes is indeed a contradiction, and as soon as one confesses that it changes, it can of course, change in that same moment. However much that first self shrinks from this, there is no wordsmith so ingenious or no thought-twister so wily that he can invalidate the deeper self’s eternal claim. There is only one way out, and that is to silence the deeper self by letting the roar of inconstancy drown it out. Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, 1845, Hong translation, p. 314Just as a man changes his clothes for celebration, so a person preparing for the holy act of confession is inwardly changed. It is indeed like changing one’s clothes to divest oneself of multiplicity in order to make up one’s mind about one thing, to interrupt the pace of busy activity in order to put on the repose of contemplation in unity with oneself. And this unity with oneself is the celebration’s simple festive dress that is the condition of admittance. <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses in Various Spirits, Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong, p.19If a person whose life has been tried in some crucial difficulty has a friend and sometime later he is unable to retain the past clearly, if anxiety creates confusion, and if accusing thoughts assail him with all their might as he works his way back, then he may go to his friend and say, [...] "My soul is sick so that nothing will become clear to me, but I confided everything to you; you remember it, so please explain the past to me again." [...] But if a person has no friend, he presumably goes to God if under other circumstances he has confided something to him, if in the hour of decision he called God as witness when no one understood him. [...] And the one who went to his friend perhaps was not understood at times, perhaps was filled with self-loathing, which is even more oppressive, upon discovering that the one to whom he had confided his troubles had not understood him at all, even though he had listened, had not sensed what was making him anxious, but had only an inquisitive interest in his unusual encounter with life. But this would never happen with God; who would dare to venture to think this of God, even if he is cowardly enough to prefer to forget God-until he stands face-to-face with the judge, who passes judgment on him but not on the one who truly has God as a witness, because where God is the judge, there is indeed no judge if God is the witness. It by no means follows that a person’s life becomes easy because he learns to know God in this way. On the contrary, it can become very hard; it may become more difficult than the contemptible easiness of sensate human life, but in this difficulty life also acquires ever deeper and deeper meaning. Søren Kierkegaard, Four <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses August 31, 1844 [...] (Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses p. 324) ...|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard later {{referred}} to his concept of choosing yourself as the single individual in The Concept of Anxiety, June 17, 1844, and then in his , August 31, 1844, and once again in <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses in Various Spirits, 1847. William James echoed Kierkegaard in his lecture on The Sick Soul where he wrote, [...] "the man must die to an unreal life before he can be born into the real life." [...] You are outside yourself and therefore cannot do without the other as opposition; you believe that only a restless spirit is alive, and all who are experienced believe that only a quiet spirit is truly alive. For you a turbulent sea {{is a symbol of}} life; for me it is the quiet, deep water. Either/Or Part II p. 144, HongAnxiety is a qualification of dreaming spirit, and as such it has its place in psychology. Awake, the difference between myself and my other is posited; sleeping, it is suspended; dreaming, it is an intimated nothing. The actuality of the spirit constantly shows itself as a form that tempts its possibility but disappears as soon as it seeks to grasp for it, and it is a nothing that can only bring anxiety. More it cannot do as long as it merely shows itself. The concept of anxiety is almost never treated in psychology. Therefore, I must point out that it is altogether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom’s actuality as the possibility of possibility. For this reason, anxiety is not found in the beast, precisely because by nature the beast is not qualified as spirit. The Concept of Anxiety, Nichol p. 42 ...|$|E

2500|$|Three {{months after}} the {{publication}} of Either/Or, 16 May 1843, he published Two <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, 1843 and continued to publish discourses along with his pseudonymous books. These discourses were published under Kierkegaard's own name and are available as Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses today. David F. Swenson first translated the works in the 1940s and titled them the Edifying Discourses; however, in 1990, Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated the works again but called them the <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses. The word [...] "upbuilding" [...] was more in line with Kierkegaard's thought after 1846, when he wrote Christian deliberations about works of love. An <b>upbuilding</b> discourse or edifying discourse isn't the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself. The discourse or conversation should be [...] "upbuilding", which means one would build up the other person, or oneself, rather than tear down in order to build up. Kierkegaard said: [...] "Although this little book (which is called [...] "discourses," [...] not sermons, because its author does not have authority to preach, [...] "upbuilding discourses," [...] not discourses for <b>upbuilding,</b> because the speaker by no means claims to be a teacher) wishes to be only what it is, a , and desires only to remain in hiding".|$|E
2500|$|... (Swenson's {{translation}} {{has both}} titles while Hong's has only the latter, both Swenson and Hong translated Kierkegaard's Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses also) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1851 Kierkegaard {{wrote his}} Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays where he once more {{discussed}} sin, forgiveness, and authority using that same verse from 1 Peter 4:8 {{that he used}} twice in 1843 with his [...] Three <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, 1843.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{published}} his Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses {{throughout the years}} 1843 and 1844. He followed the Socratic Method by publishing his own view of life under his own name and different views of life under pseudonyms. His own view was that of [...] "a committed Christian trained for the ministry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard was so {{concerned}} that Regine might actually destroy herself {{because she said}} she couldn't live without him {{that he tried to}} give Regine advice in his Fourth <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourse of 1844. He wanted her to be able to stand on her own with or without him. He asked her: ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, in {{the same}} book, Kierkegaard deals with the {{question}} of sin and forgiveness. He uses the same text he used earlier in Three <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, 1843 Love hides a multitude of sins. (1 Peter 4:8). He asks if [...] "one who tells his neighbors faults hides or increases the multitude of sins".|$|E
2500|$|The goal of life, {{according}} to Socrates, {{is to know}} thyself. Knowing oneself means being aware of who one is, what one can be and what one cannot be. Kierkegaard uses the same idea that Socrates used in his own writings. He asks the one {{who wants to be}} a single individual the following questions in his 1847 book, <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses in Various Spirits ...|$|E
2500|$|His three discourses are {{dedicated}} [...] "To the late Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard formerly a clothing merchant {{here in the}} city My Father". All but one of his Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses were dedicated to his father. He also includes a dedication: [...] "to that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader". Regine Olsen is [...] "my reader" [...] according to some scholars. Here is his dedication for these discourses.|$|E
2500|$|An {{individual}} person, for Kierkegaard, is {{a particular}} that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in [...] "the public" [...] (or [...] "the crowd" [...] or [...] "the herd") or subsuming a human being as simply {{a member of a}} species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In Four <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, 1843 Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. In the hallowed places, in every <b>upbuilding</b> view of life, the thought arises in a person’s soul that help him to fight the good fight with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to encumber him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, {{if for no other reason}} than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law. Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses, by Soren Kiekegaard Hong, p. 143 ...|$|E
2500|$|Several of Kierkegaard's {{works were}} {{translated}} into German from 1861 onward, including excerpts from Practice in Christianity (1872), from Fear and Trembling and Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1874), Four <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses and Christian Discourses (1875), and The Lillis of the Field and the Birds of the Air (1876) according to Kierkegaard's International Reception: Northern and Western Europe: Toma I, by John Stewart, see p.388ff' The Sickness Unto Death, 1881 [...] Twelve speeches by Søren Kierkegaard, by Julius Fricke, 1886 Stages on Life's Way, 1886 (Bärthold).|$|E
2500|$|Many {{individuals}} {{want to be}} {{teachers of}} mankind but Kierkegaard has emphasized the teachers that accompany man {{from one generation to}} another. He wrote of Abraham, Job, The Apostle Paul, and Anna and Simeon as teachers of mankind in his Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses and Johann Goethe and Friedrich Hegel as teachers of aesthetics and ethics. But he's writing about the earnest confession before God, marriage, and death as teachers of another kind that accompanies mankind from generation to generation. Later he uses the [...] "lily of the field and the bird of the air" [...] to teach {{what it means to be}} a human being where he calls them the [...] "divinely appointed teachers".|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard's {{early work}} was written under various pseudonyms {{that he used}} to present {{distinctive}} viewpoints and to interact with each other in complex dialogue. He explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints, each under a different pseudonym. He wrote many <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses under his own name and dedicated them to the [...] "single individual" [...] who might want to discover the meaning of his works. Notably, he wrote: [...] "Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject." [...] While scientists can learn about the world by observation, Kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation could reveal {{the inner workings of the}} world of the spirit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{invention}} of the alphabet in 405 {{was the beginning of}} Armenian literature, and proved a powerful factor in the <b>upbuilding</b> of the national spirit. [...] "The result of the work of Isaac and Mesrop", says St. Martin, [...] "was to separate for ever the Armenians from the other peoples of the East, to make of them a distinct nation, and to strengthen them in the Christian Faith by forbidding or rendering profane all the foreign alphabetic scripts which were employed for transcribing the books of the heathens and of the followers of Zoroaster. To Mesrop we owe the preservation of the language and literature of Armenia; but for his work, the people would have been absorbed by the Persians and Syrians, and would have disappeared like so many nations of the East".|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard and {{the early}} Barth think that in Christianity, direct {{communication}} is impossible because Christ appears incognito. For them Christ is a paradox, and therefore one can know him only in indirect communication. They are {{fully aware of the}} importance of the moment when the human being stands before God, and is moved by him alone from time to eternity, from the earth to which (s)he belongs to the heaven where God exists. But Kierkegaard stressed the single individual in the presence of God in time in his early discourses and wrote against speculative arguments about whether or not one individual, no matter how gifted, can ascertain where another stood in relation to God as early as his Two <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses of 1843 where he wrote against listening to speculative Christians: ...|$|E
2500|$|During 1844, he {{published}} two, three, and four more <b>upbuilding</b> discourses {{just as he}} did in 1843, but here he discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the [...] "single individual" [...] who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for [...] "that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader" [...] The single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost. Reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} 1911 [...] {{to the editor}} (mentioned in the above section), he shared the {{progress}} the school has made and plans for growth. At the time. he and three other physicians {{were in charge of}} the medical school. He and his colleagues were teaching classes on anatomy, physics, ophthalmology, histology, and more. In 1912, while teaching, Dr. Cadbury met Sun Yat-sen. Sun Yat-sen had previously studied medicine at Canton Hospital under John G. Kerr, and like the other foreign teachers at Canton Christian College, Dr. Cadbury supported Sun Yat-sen's ideology and political views. By 1913, Dr. Cadbury had seen his students gain so much knowledge and experience at the school, and he proudly claimed that they were [...] "well educated young men of fine Christian character" [...] ready to [...] "do their share in the <b>upbuilding</b> of the great Chinese nation." [...] The same year, he also became a teacher at the Gongyi Medical School, which had reached out to the Canton government for help.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{published}} Eighteen <b>Upbuilding</b> Discourses {{between the}} years 1843 and 1844 {{as well as}} a number of pseudonymous books. [...] His category from Either/Or is to choose and his category from his discourses is the [...] "single individual". He has let the reader know that he or she should pay attention to the prefaces in his works and has one in this book which speaks about [...] "meaning" [...] and the [...] "appropriation" [...] of meaning and has repeatedly said that he didn't have the [...] "authority to preach or to teach." [...] Here, in his Preface, he wrote: [...] "This little book, which might be called a book of occasional addresses, although it has neither the occasion which creates the speaker and gives him authority, nor the occasion that creates the hearer and makes him a learner, is lacking in the legitimation of a call, and is thus in its shortcomings without excuse. It is without assistance from external circumstances, and thus quite helpless in its elaboration." ...|$|E
