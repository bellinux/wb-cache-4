40|$|Key forage species lie at {{the core}} of complex marine food webs, {{providing}} essential linkages among trophic levels. We examined the interactions of an important forage and commercial fish, capelin Mallotus villosus, and its primary avian predator, the common murre Uria aalge, in the NW <b>Atlantic.</b> <b>Murres</b> are capelin specialists and robust samplers of capelin biology. During the 1990 s, the coldest surface-water event in the past 50 to 100 yr occurred in the NW Atlantic (1991), and the eastern Canadian ground-fishery was closed (1992). Concordantly, the biology and behaviour of capelin has undergone very substantial changes. We examined parental food deliveries and production at the world’s largest common murre colony on Funk Island off the northeast coast of Newfoundland throughout the 1990 s. Murres delayed breeding and delivered smaller and lower quality capelin to their chicks. These changes, corroborated with independent fisheries data, resulted in poor condition of murre chicks, indicating significant effects of changing capelin demographics at higher trophic levels. The diets of the murre chicks indicate that the composition of the capelin population has shifted from high size diversity to mainly smaller capelin. We hypothesize that this change resulted from the elimination of the larger-sized and earlier spawning genotype and that the NW Atlantic capelin population is exhibiting signs of reduced reproductive potential that likely reflects lower spawning biomass...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between geopotential height anomalies at level of 500 hpa over North America and Europe, and the <b>USA</b> landfall <b>Atlantic</b> hurricanes activity. The decadal data {{of the number of}} hurricanes by category which stroked the mainland USA for each decade through the period (1851 - 2006) are used through the present study. The daily NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data composites for geopotential height at 500 hpa level over North America and Europe for the period of (1949 - 2006) are used too. Hurricane datasets and anomalies in geopotential height are analyzed and correlated together. The results revealed that there are significant positive correlations between the anomalies in geopotential height over North America and East Europe simultaneously, and existence of Atlantic hurricanes of category 3 that strike USA. In addition to that, significant positive correlations between the anomalies in geopotential height over North America and existence of major hurricanes (category 3, 4 and 5) that landfall USA is found too. However, significant negative correlations between the anomalies in geopotential height over North Atlantic and existence of all <b>USA</b> Landfall <b>Atlantic</b> Hurricane categories are existed else category 1. In general one can conclude that anomalies in geopotential height at 500 hpa level over North America and Europe are control the <b>USA</b> landfall <b>Atlantic</b> hurricanes activity...|$|R

30|$|Sand-layer stratigraphies from washover events due to TCs {{have been}} studied {{predominantly}} along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern and eastern United States. Liu and Fearn (2000) examined sand layers in lakes along the Florida and Alabama coasts, and Donnelly et al. (2015) studied similar deposits in New England and New Jersey along the <b>USA</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast. These deposits have also been examined in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean along with Japan (Woodruff et al. 2015; Woodruff et al. 2008). All these studies assume that the height and general nature of the barrier have remained unchanged over the length of the washover record. Such assumptions seem reasonable when separate sites some distance apart show the same chronology of events, or at least clusters of events, suggesting that some kind of regional factor influenced the behaviour of TCs at different times during the past.|$|R
40|$|There are {{two species}} of pilot whales in the Western Atlantic: the Atlantic or long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas, and the short-finned pilot whale, G. macrorhynchus. These species are {{difficult}} to identify to the species level at sea; therefore, some of the descriptive material below refers to Globicephala sp. and is identified as such. The species boundary {{is considered to be}} in the New Jersey to Cape Hatteras area. Sightings north of this area are likely G. melas. The short-finned pilot whale is distributed worldw ide in tropical to warm temperate waters (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). The northern extent of the range of this species within the <b>USA</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Exclusive Econo mic Zone (EEZ) is generally thought to be Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Sightings of these animals in <b>USA</b> <b>Atlantic</b> EEZ occur primarily within the Gulf Stream [Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) unpublished data], and prim arily along the continental shelf an d contine ntal slope in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Mullin et al. 1991; SEFSC unpublished data). There is no information on stock differentiatio n for the A tlantic population. POPULATION SIZE An abundance of 9, 800 (CV= 0. 34) for Globicephala sp. was estimated from a line transect sighting survey conducted during July 6 to September 6, 1998 by a ship and plane that surveyed 15, 900 km of track line in waters north of Maryland (38 ° N) (Figure 1; Palka et al. in review). Shipboard data were analyzed using the modified direct duplicate method (Palka 1995) that accoun ts for school size bias and g(0), the probability of detecting a group on the track line. Aerial data were not corrected for g(0).

40|$|The {{culture of}} exotic fishes {{contributes}} about 17 % to global food aquaculture production. Transplanted native species add substantially to the aquatic harvest {{of food and}} sport fishes in many countries. Some countries are very dependent on the cultivation of non-native species; yields of exotics exceed 25 % of the total harvest in China, 60 % of the freshwater harvest in the Philippines, and 50 % of the production in Brazil. Aquatic food production in Israel is predomi- nately from introduced fishes.

Countries of origin for globally important fishes include China (endemic carps), <b>USA</b> (<b>Atlantic</b> salmon and rainbow trout), Europe (common carp), and Africa (tilapias). The aquacul- ture production of food fish will become increasingly vital as oceanic capture fisheries continue to stagnate. Exotic and transplanted fishes that are widespread today will represent a greater proportion of future aquaculture production because technology for their culture is already well known and can readily be applied, and because these species are more easily domesticated and genetically improved...|$|R

40|$|There are two sp ecies of spo tted dolph {{in in the}} W estern Atlantic — the Atlantic sp otted dolp hin, Stenella frontalis, {{formerly}} S. plagiodon (Perrin et al. 1987), and the pantro pical spotted dolphin, S. attenua ta. These {{species are}} difficult to differentiate at sea. The pantropical spotted dolphin is distributed worldwide in tropical and some sub-tropical oceans (Perrin et al. 1987; Perrin and Hohn 1994). Sightings of this species in the northern Gulf of Mexico occur over the deeper waters, and rarely over the continental shelf or continental shelf edge (Mullin et al. 1991; SEFSC, unpublished data). Pantropical spotted dolphins were seen in all seasons during recent seasonal aerial surveys of the northern Gulf of Mexico, and during recent winter aerial surveys offshore of the southeastern <b>USA</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast (SEFSC unpublished data). Some of the Pacific populations have been divided into different geographic stocks based on morphological characteristics (Perrin et al. 1987; Perrin and Hohn 1994); however, there is no information on stock differentiation in the Atlantic population. POPULATION SIZE Total numbers of pantropical spotted dolphins off the <b>USA</b> or Canadian <b>Atlantic</b> coast are unknown, although three estimates from selected regions of the habitat do exist for select time periods. Because S. frontalis and S. attenuata are difficult to differentiate at sea, the reported abundance estimates, prior to 1998, are for both species of spotted dolphins combined.

40|$|Due to {{its light}} {{attenuation}} and scattering properties, aerosols influence radiance measured by satellite for ocean color remote sensing. Therefore, atmospheric correction algorithms require {{the estimation of}} aerosol parameters from the same satellite data.

The measurements were {{carried out in the}} coastal areas of the southern Baltic Sea during eight measurement campaigns between 1998 and 2003 and in Duck N. C. (<b>USA</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast) during the EOPACE campaign in 1999. The Baltic measurements were made simultaneously on shore and onboard the r/v Oceania using Microtops II sunphotometers and ozonometers, sun-radiometer Hires A, and a lidar system, which provided data regarding the vertical profiles of aerosol size distribution and concentrations. Several campaigns between 2000 and 2002 were aimed at the validation of data provided by the Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (MOS) onboard satellite IRS/P 3. Thus the measurements were made during and beside satellite overpasses. During all campaigns the full meteorological coverage was obtained from the in-situ measurements and the coastal meteorological stations. The air mass trajectories were obtained from the British Atmospheric Data Center. The ground-truth data from the Baltic studies have been successfully used to both radiometric validation of MOS satellite data and for product validation of optical aerosol parameters estimated by atmospheric correction algorithms...|$|R
