5|$|While in Mexico, Cameron began {{performing}} blood rituals in {{the hope}} of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion. When she learned that an <b>unidentified</b> <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> had been seen over Washington D.C.'s Capitol Building she considered it a response to Parsons' death. After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide. Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she came to understand his purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also came to believe that the spirit of Babalon had been incarnated into herself.

25|$|The base's current {{primary purpose}} is {{publicly}} unknown; however, based on historical evidence, it most likely supports {{the development and}} testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems (black projects).

25|$|In May 1955, Vallée first sighted an <b>unidentified</b> <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> {{over his}} Pontoise home. Six {{years later in}} 1961, while working {{on the staff of}} the French Space Committee, Vallée claims to have {{witnessed}} the destruction of the tracking tapes of an unknown object orbiting the earth. The particular object was a retrograde satellite – that is, a satellite orbiting the earth in the opposite direction to the earth's rotation. At the time he observed this, there were no rockets powerful enough to launch such a satellite, so the team was quite excited as they assumed that the Earth's gravity had captured a natural satellite (asteroid). He claims that an unnamed superior came and erased the tape. These events contributed to Vallée's long-standing interest in the UFO phenomenon.|$|E
