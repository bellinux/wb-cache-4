Ultrasonic technology was studied to evaluate the corrosion depth quantitatively. Three acidic environments with the pH level of 3. 5, 2. 5, and 1. 5 were simulated by the mixture of sulfate and nitric acid solutions in the laboratory. 354 prism specimens with the dimension of 150 [*]mm × 150 [*]mm × 300 [*]mm were prepared.

25|$|In general {{there are}} two ways to set up a {{transducer}} system to measure the sound velocity in a solid. One is a setup with two or more transducers where one is acting as a transmitter, while the other(s) is acting as a receiver. The sound velocity measurement can then be done by measuring the time between a signal is generated at the transmitter and when it is recorded at the receiver while assuming to know (or measure) the distance the acoustic signal have traveled between the transducers, or conversely to measure the resonance frequency knowing the thickness over which the wave resonate. The other type of setup is often called a pulse-echo system. Here one transducer is placed in the vicinity of the specimen acting both as transmitter and receiver. This requires a reflective interface where the generated signal can be reflected back toward the transducer which then act as a receiver recording the reflected signal. See <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>testing</b> for some measurement systems.|$|E

500|$|On 17 June 2000, a Class 73 train derailed at Nelaug Station on the Sørland Line. The {{train was}} {{traveling}} at slow speed and no-one was injured, but had the derailment happened at full speed, {{it could have}} been fatal. The derailment was caused by a fatigue failure in the front axle of the train. All Class 71 and 73 trains were immediately grounded, and were investigated by maintenance crews. The derailed train had recently had its axle checked for fatigue, but no cracks had been found. On 19 June, NSB stated that they had made insufficient tests during the [...] controls. Class 71 had been through <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>testing</b> and were therefore allowed to resume operation the day after the accident.

500|$|The {{most common}} pig is the scraper pig, which removes wax that {{precipitates}} {{out of the}} oil and collects {{on the walls of}} the pipeline. The colder the oil, the more wax buildup. This buildup can cause a variety of problems, so regular [...] "piggings" [...] are needed to keep the pipe clear. A second type of pig travels through the pipe and looks for corrosion. Corrosion-detecting pigs use either magnetic or ultrasonic sensors. Magnetic sensors detect corrosion by analyzing variations in the magnetic field of the pipeline's metal. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>testing</b> pigs detect corrosion by examining vibrations in the walls of the pipeline. Other types of pigs look for irregularities in the shape of the pipeline, such as if it is bending or buckling. [...] "Smart" [...] pigs, which contain a variety of sensors, can perform multiple tasks. Typically, these pigs are inserted at Prudhoe Bay and travel the length of the pipeline.

2500|$|Nevertheless, FSW is {{associated}} with a number of unique defects, if it isn't done properly. Insufficient weld temperatures, due to low rotational speeds or high traverse speeds, for example, mean that the weld material is unable to accommodate the extensive deformation during welding. This may result in long, tunnel-like defects running along the weld which may occur on the surface or subsurface. Low temperatures may also limit the forging action of the tool and so reduce the continuity of the bond between the material from each side of the weld. The light contact between the material has given rise to the name [...] "kissing-bond". This defect is particularly worrying since {{it is very difficult to}} detect using nondestructive methods such as X-ray or <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>testing.</b> If the pin is not long enough or the tool rises out of the plate then the interface at the bottom of the weld may not be disrupted and forged by the tool, resulting in a lack-of-penetration defect. This is essentially a notch in the material which can be a potential source of fatigue cracks.|$|E
