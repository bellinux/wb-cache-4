40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s, {{the food supply}} of the United States, Canada, and other {{countries}} has been fortified with folic acid to lower the incidence of neural tube defects (e. g., spina bifida, anencephaly). This fortification program has been highly successful in reducing both the prevalence of folate deficiency {{in the general population}} 1, 2 and the inci-dence of neural tube defects. 3 The success of the fortifi-cation program,however, has created a situation of excess folic acid consumption by a significant percentage of the general population, the negative ramifications of which, if any, are as yet undetermined. Geometric mean serum folate levels havemore than doubled in the US population (from ~ 12 to ~ 30 nmol/L) 4 and the prevalence of folic acid supplement users with intakes above the <b>upper</b> <b>tolerable</b> <b>intake</b> <b>level</b> (> 1 mg folic acid/day) has increased from ~ 1 % to ~ 11 %. 5 Because folate deficiency and anti-folate drugs are known to retard or prevent the prolifera-tion of tumors, some have raised the question of whether excess folic acid in the food supply may promote malig-nant progression. 6 Indeed, a recent analysis of data from the U.

40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{quantify}} the metallic ions released by various dental alloys subjected to a continuous flow of saliva and to estimate the nutritional and toxicological implications of such a release. Methods: Four pieces of three nickel-based, one noble, one high-noble and two copper-aluminum alloys were cast and then immersed in a continuous flow of artificial saliva for 15 days. To simulate three meals a day, casts were subjected to thrice-daily episodes, lasting 30 min each and consisting of pH decreases and salinity increases. After 15 days, the metallic ions in the artificial saliva were analyzed. Data were expressed as averaged release rate: microg/cm 2 /day of ion released for each alloy. The highest value of 95 % Cl of each ion was adapted to a hypothetical worst scenario of a subject with 100 cm 2 of exposed metal surface. The results were compared with the tolerable upper daily intake level of each ion. Results: The copper-aluminum alloys released copper, aluminum, nickel, manganese and iron. The nickel-based alloys essentially released nickel and chromium, while the beryllium-containing alloy released beryllium and significantly more nickel. The noble and high-noble alloys were very resistant to corrosion. The amount of ions released remained far below the <b>upper</b> <b>tolerable</b> <b>intake</b> <b>level,</b> with the exception of nickel, released by beryllium-containing nickel-based alloy, whose levels approach 50 % of this threshold. Significance: The daily amount of ions released seems to be far below the tolerable upper intake levels for each ion...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo examine if {{children}} use supplements to fill gaps in nutritionally inadequate diets or whether supplements contribute to already adequate or excessive micronutrient intakes from foods. Study designData were analyzed for children (2 - 18 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 - 2006, a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey (n = 7250). Diet {{was assessed using}} two 24 -hour recalls, and dietary supplement use was assessed with a 30 -day questionnaire. ResultsPrevalence of supplements use was 21 % (< 2 years) and 42 % (2 - 8 years). Supplement users had higher micronutrient intakes than nonusers. Calcium and vitamin D intakes were low for all children. Inadequate intakes of phosphorus, copper, selenium, folate, and vitamins B- 6 and B- 12 were minimal from foods alone among 2 - 8 year olds. However, among 9 - 18 year olds, a higher prevalence of inadequate intakes of magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamins A, C, and E were observed. Supplement use increased the likelihood of intakes above the <b>upper</b> <b>tolerable</b> <b>intake</b> <b>level</b> for iron, zinc, copper, selenium, folic acid, and vitamins A and C. ConclusionsEven {{with the use of}} supplements, more than a one-third of children failed to meet calcium and vitamin D recommendations. Children 2 - 8 years old had nutritionally adequate diets regardless of supplement use. However, in children older than 8 years, dietary supplements added micronutrients to diets that would have otherwise been inadequate for magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A, C, and E. Supplement use contributed to the potential for excess intakes of some nutrients. These findings may have implications for reformulating dietary supplements for children...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundEven {{in an era}} {{of obesity}} and dietary excess, {{numerous}} shortfall micronutrients have been identified in the diets of US children and adolescents. To help tailor strategies for meeting recommendations, {{it is important to know}} what foods contribute greatly to micronutrient intakes. Data are lacking on specific contributions made by added nutrients. ObjectiveOur aims were to examine the impact of fortification on nutrient adequacy and excess among US children and adolescents and to rank food sources of added nutrient intake and compare rankings with those based on total nutrient intake from foods. Design and statistical analysesData were from 7, 250 respondents 2 to 18 years old in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 - 2006. Datasets were developed that distinguished nutrient sources: intrinsic nutrients in foods; added nutrients in foods; foods (intrinsic plus added nutrients); and total diet (foods plus supplements). The National Cancer Institute method was used to determine usual intakes of micronutrients by source. The impact of fortification on the percentages of children having intakes less than the Estimated Average Requirement and more than the <b>Upper</b> <b>Tolerable</b> <b>Intake</b> <b>Level</b> was assessed by comparing intakes from intrinsic nutrients to intakes from intrinsic plus added nutrients. Specific food sources of micronutrients were determined as sample-weighted mean intakes of total and added nutrients contributed from 56 food groupings. The percentage of intake from each grouping was determined separately for total and added nutrients. ResultsWithout added nutrients, a high percentage of all children/adolescents had inadequate intakes of numerous micronutrients, with the greatest inadequacy among older girls. Fortification reduced the percentage less than the Estimated Average Requirement for many, although not all, micronutrients without resulting in excessive intakes. Data demonstrated the powerful influence of fortification on food-source rankings. ConclusionsKnowledge about nutrient intakes and sources can help put dietary advice into a practical context. Continued monitoring of top food sources of nutrients and nutrient contributions from fortification will be important...|$|E
