In this particular case, researchers used silkworms to identify and characterize mutations relating to SPR activity from an initial purified state created in the larvae of the silkworm. The researchers used genetic and biochemical approaches to demonstrate oral administration of BH4 and dopamine which increased the survival rates of the silkworm larvae.

The FeederAnt drives into the grass paddocks twice a day and position itself in a new location for each feeding. This will help to distribute the manure from the animals evenly over the grass paddock to prevent point leaching of nutrients. The FeederAnt replaces many stationary feeding tables and reduce the amount of daily manual feeding routines. Further, it is expected that the problem with vermins will be solved since no feed residues will be left within the pens. ...|$|R
