25|$|Lightoller and Wilde lowered Boat 12 at 1:30a.m. {{with about}} 30 people aboard. It was first manned only by Able-Bodied Seaman Frederick Clench and was {{subsequently}} {{put in the}} charge of Able Seaman John Poigndestre. A male passenger jumped into the boat as it was lowered past B Deck. Difficulty was encountered in <b>unhooking</b> the boat from the falls, requiring Poigndestre to use a knife {{to cut through the}} ropes. Several passengers from other boats were transferred into Boat 12 after the sinking and it was heavily overloaded by the time it reached Carpathia with at least 69 people aboard. It was the last lifeboat to be picked up by Carpathia, at about 8:15a.m.|$|E
25|$|After the day {{required}} to make the tank safe by purging remaining hydrogen gas with helium gas, NASA engineers prepared for disconnection of the vent arm and the significant number of lines prior to taking their {{first look at the}} GUCP. On the night of 9 November, technicians began disconnecting the GUCP by <b>unhooking</b> and lowering the hydrogen vent line. Teams performed an initial inspection of the flight seal and quick disconnect prior to sending them to labs for a thorough engineering analysis. Engineers reported an unevenly (asymmetrically) compressed internal seal and the quick disconnect hardware also seemed have a less concentric fit than pre-fueling measurements indicated. Inspections also confirmed the condition of the hardware did not match the observations documented when it was installed on the external tank inside the VAB.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{replacement}} may {{be done in}} one of two ways. Insert a new set of leads without {{removing the}} current leads (not recommended as it provides additional obstruction to blood flow and heart valve function) or remove the current leads and then insert replacements. The lead removal technique will vary depending on the surgeon's estimation of the probability that simple traction will suffice to more complex procedures. Leads can normally be disconnected from the pacemaker easily which is why device replacement usually entails simple surgery to access the device and replace it by simply <b>unhooking</b> the leads from the device to replace and hooking the leads to the new device. The possible complications, such as perforation of the heart wall, come from removing the lead{s} from the patient's body.|$|E

25|$|On {{board the}} rocket, the {{collapse}} of the gravity field causes Toby to reveal the mind of the Beast is still possessing him as he taunts the others while breathing out fire. Rose takes Captain Zach's bolt gun and shoots out the rocket's front window, <b>unhooking</b> Toby's safety harness to jettison the possessed man into space towards the black hole. The cabin is sealed by automatic shields but the rocket still lacks the power to escape the gravity well. Suddenly their ride smooths out and the rocket turns away from the black hole. The Doctor contacts Captain Zach, telling him that he is towing the rocket to safety with the TARDIS. The Doctor asks for Rose and jokingly offers to trade Zach back Ida, whom he rescued from the planet caverns, for Rose. The Doctor reports he did not have time to go back and save the Ood, who were innocent victims of the Beast's possession. Once safe, the respective crews depart on their separate ways. As they return to Earth, Captain Zach reads off the list of personnel that died, including the Ood.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{they have}} very sharp and {{numerous}} teeth, care is required in <b>unhooking</b> a pike. Barbless trebles are recommended when angling for this species, as they simplify <b>unhooking.</b> This is undertaken using long forceps, with 30-cm artery clamps the ideal tool. When holding the pike from below on the lower jaw, it will open its mouth. It should be {{kept out of the}} water for the minimum amount of time possible, and should be given extra time to recover if being weighed and photographed before release. If practicing live release, calling the fish [...] "caught" [...] when it is alongside a boat is recommended. Remove the hook by grabbing it with needle-nosed pliers while the fish is still submerged and giving it a flip in the direction that turns the hook out of the mouth. This avoids damage to the fish and the stress of being out of water.|$|E

One mad sheer and plunge, one terrible strain on the tackles as we sunk in the trough of the waves, tugged upon by the towing breaker, and our knives severed the tackle ropes--we hazarded not <b>unhooking</b> the blocks--our oars were out, and the good boat headed round, with prow to leeward.|$|E

[...] <b>Unhooking</b> his sword from a peg near the door, he buckled it on carefully and left the company without another word.

The Colonel's face was empurpled, the Colonel's chest was efflorescent and bursting, the Colonel had the general effect of being about to boil over the top button of his coat, but his manner was jauntily and daintily precise.|$|E
40|$|Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) {{are highly}} {{cytotoxic}} DNA lesions that block DNA replication and transcription by preventing strand separation. Previously, we {{demonstrated that the}} bacterial and human DNA glycosylases Nei and NEIL 1 excise <b>unhooked</b> psoralen-derived ICLs in three-stranded DNA via hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond between the crosslinked base and deoxyribose sugar. Furthermore, NEIL 3 from Xenopus laevis {{has been shown to}} cleave psoralen- and abasic site-induced ICLs in Xenopus egg extracts. Here we report that human NEIL 3 cleaves psoralen-induced DNA-DNA cross-links in three-stranded and four-stranded DNA substrates to generate <b>unhooked</b> DNA fragments containing either an abasic site or a psoralen-thymine monoadduct. Furthermore, while Nei and NEIL 1 also cleave a psoralen-induced four-stranded DNA substrate to generate two <b>unhooked</b> DNA duplexes with a nick, NEIL 3 targets both DNA strands in the ICL without generating single-strand breaks. The DNA substrate specificities of these Nei-like enzymes imply the occurrence of long uninterrupted three- and four-stranded crosslinked DNA-DNA structures that may originate in vivo from DNA replication fork bypass of an ICL. In conclusion, the Nei-like DNA glycosylases <b>unhook</b> psoralen-derived ICLs in various DNA structures via a genuine repair mechanism in which complex DNA lesions can be removed without generation of highly toxic double-strand breaks...|$|R

60|$|Directly, in that demoralised crowd, trouble broke out. Two {{men who had}} no {{business}} there had jumped into the boat under the pretence of <b>unhooking</b> the tackles, while some sort of squabble arose on the deck amongst these weak, tottering spectres of a ship's company. The captain, who had been for days living secluded and unapproachable in the chart-room, came to the rail. He ordered the two men to come up on board and menaced them with his revolver. They pretended to obey, but suddenly cutting the boat's painter, gave a shove against the ship's side and made ready to hoist the sail.|$|E

Then, going to her bureau, she took up her address book and looked for the name: Wing, 88, Frankland Street, Fulham. <b>Unhooking</b> her little bag from off the back of the chair, she put her cheque-book into it. Then, taking care to make no sound, she passed into the hall, caught up her sunshade, and went out, closing the door without noise.|$|E

Another minute and young Brooke stood on the deck. Without waiting an instant he leaped under the shelter of the stump of the mainmast beside the seaman. He was only just in time, for a wave burst in thunder on the weather side of the quivering brig, and, pouring over the bulwarks, almost dragged him from the belaying-pins to which he clung.|$|E
