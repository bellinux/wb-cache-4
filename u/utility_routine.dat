50|$|Within {{a couple}} of years of its founding, the company's first computer, the 820, was created as a special project for one customer. SEL's early computers, such as the 810A, the 8500, and the 8600, used wire-wrap {{construction}} to create the numerous system boards and backplane (called a swingplane). Components were low-scale resistor-transistor logic (RTL) integrated circuits comprising a few transistors per chip, and core memory was used. The 840A used all integrated circuit logic. It had up to 16K of 24-bit word core memory, all directly addressable. Cycle time was 1.75 microseconds. It also had three hardware index registers, priority interrupts with 60 levels, memory parity, and memory protect. By 1967, over 30 840A systems had been sold. Software included the 840A Real-Time Monitor, a FORTRAN IV compiler, MNEMBLER Assembler, Mathematical and <b>Utility</b> <b>Routine</b> Library, and Diagnostic Routines. Supported peripherals included: disc storage (24 Mbit, removable), 45-ips 9-track magnetic tape, card reader, card punch, 300 LPM line printer, and various data acquisition interfaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Prolonged {{sedation}} {{is common}} in mechanically ventilated patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We sought to determine the diagnostic value of head computed tomography (CT) in mechanically ventilated patients who remain unresponsive after discontinuation of sedation. Methods A retrospective review of adult (age > 18 years of age) patients consecutively admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care medical center. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation for management of respiratory failure for longer than 72 hours {{were included in the}} study group. A group that did not have difficulty with awakening was included as a control. Results The median time after sedation was discontinued until a head CT was performed was 2 days (interquartile range 1. 375 – 2 days). Majority (80 %) of patients underwent head CT evaluation within the first 48 hours after discontinuation of sedation. Head CT was non-diagnostic in all but one patient who had a small subarachnoid hemorrhage. Twenty-five patients (60 %) had a normal head CT. Head CT findings did not alter the management of any of the patients. The control group was similar to the experimental group with respect to demographics, etiology of respiratory failure and type of sedation used. However, while 37 % of subjects in the control group had daily interruption of sedation, only 19 % in the patient group had daily interruption of sedation (p Conclusion In patients on mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hours and who remain unresponsive after sedative discontinuation and with a non-focal neurologic examination, head CT is performed early and is of very limited diagnostic <b>utility.</b> <b>Routine</b> use of daily interruption of sedation is used in a minority of patients outside of a clinical trial setting though it may decrease the frequency of unresponsiveness from prolonged sedation and the need for head CT in patients mechanically ventilated for a prolonged period. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{technique}} to analyze and measure the reusability of object-oriented (OO) designs. The metrics {{can be incorporated into}} a design/development environment, so that reusability measurements, analysis, and improvements can be part of "business as usual" for an organization. Design reusability measurements also enable early identification of poor reuse potential, when it is still possible to modify/refine the design. The essential components of our approach are two reuse-specific characterizations of classes and hierarchies, and a set of metrics which objectively measures the dependencies among design components based on those reuse-specific characterizations. 1 INTRODUCTION Software components that are reused most often tend to be small components, since they are normally less specific (i. e., string functions, abstract data types (ADT), or <b>utility</b> <b>routines),</b> and thus, more likely needed by other systems.
