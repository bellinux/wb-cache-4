500|$|Co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman co-wrote the episode's teleplay, while Pinkner, Wyman, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman co-wrote the story. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director. A full season renewal of Fringe was announced on March 24, 2011. They {{had written the}} finale without knowing {{if there would be}} another season, but decided not to make any changes to the script even after hearing of its renewal. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] In an interview with the New York Post, Pinkner warned that events in the finale will [...] "unfurl in a very <b>unexpected</b> <b>way</b> for the characters and the audience". He also commented that the finale [...] "hopefully will make you sort of revisit and look at everything that's happened all year through a fresh pair of glasses".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the <b>unexpected</b> <b>way</b> Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides". He added, [...] "Santana has certainly been not-exactly-cuddly these past few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the context}} of Go, kiai (...) often {{translates}} as [...] "fighting spirit", i.e. aggressiveness or initiative, but not unthinking greed. Kiai means keeping sente, that is not letting the opponent have his or her way. A sensei might say, [...] "You play too passively — put some kiai in your moves!” A passive player may follow an opponent around the board responding to each move in turn. Kiai moves are the opposite of passive or submissive and a player showing kiai will dictate the flow of play. Kiai moves can catch an opponent off-balance and turn the game around. Examples of kiai moves include snatching sente away from the opponent; defending with a move that also counter-attacks; or answering a kikashi (forcing move) in an <b>unexpected</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The opening verse {{includes}} [...] as a {{name for}} Ganesha. [...] The simple meaning of this name, which would have seemed obvious to his readers, would be [...] "Protector of the Ganas", parsing the name in a straightforward way as [...] (group) + nātha (protector). [...] But Bhaskararaya demonstrates his skill in nirukta by parsing it in an <b>unexpected</b> <b>way</b> as the Bahuvrīhi compound [...] + atha meaning [...] "the one the enumeration (...) of whose qualities brings about auspiciousness. The word atha is associated with auspiciousness (...) [...]" [...] This rhetorical flourish {{at the opening of}} the sahasranama demonstrates Bhaskaraya's skills in nirukta at the very beginning of his commentary on a thousand such names, including a clever twist appropriate to the context of a sahasranama.|$|E
2500|$|They put the set {{so that it}} was {{upside down}} and {{attached}} the camera so that it looked like the room was right side up, then they poured gallons of red water into the room, because the normal film blood would not make the right effect for the geyser. [...] During the filming of this scene, the blood poured in an <b>unexpected</b> <b>way</b> causing the rotating room to spin. [...] Much of the blood spilled out of the bedroom window covering Craven and Langenkamp. The scene where Nancy is attacked by Krueger in her bathtub was accomplished with a special bottomless tub. The tub was put in a bathroom set that was built over a swimming pool. During the underwater sequence Heather Langenkamp was replaced with a stuntwoman. The [...] "melting staircase" [...] as seen in Nancy's dream was Robert Shaye's idea; it was created using pancake mix.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Department of Energy {{organized}} a special panel to review cold fusion theory and research. The panel issued its report in November 1989, concluding that results as of that date did not present {{convincing evidence that}} useful sources of energy would result from the phenomena attributed to cold fusion. The panel noted {{the large number of}} failures to replicate excess heat and the greater inconsistency of reports of nuclear reaction byproducts expected by established conjecture. Nuclear fusion of the type postulated would be inconsistent with current understanding and, if verified, would require established conjecture, perhaps even theory itself, to be extended in an <b>unexpected</b> <b>way.</b> The panel was against special funding for cold fusion research, but supported modest funding of [...] "focused experiments within the general funding system." [...] Cold fusion supporters continued to argue that the evidence for excess heat was strong, and in September 1990 the National Cold Fusion Institute listed 92 groups of researchers from 10 different countries that had reported corroborating evidence of excess heat, but they refused to provide any evidence of their own arguing that it could endanger their patents. However, no further DOE nor NSF funding resulted from the panel's recommendation. By this point, however, academic consensus had moved decidedly toward labeling cold fusion as a kind of [...] "pathological science".|$|E
