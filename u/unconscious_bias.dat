Findings from other studies on correction of the bias yielded mixed results. In a later review of the introspection illusion, Pronin suggests that the distinction is that studies that merely provide a warning of <b>unconscious</b> <b>biases</b> will not see a correction effect, whereas those that inform about the bias and emphasize its unconscious nature do yield corrections. Thus, knowledge that bias can operate during conscious awareness, is the defining factor in leading people to correct for it.|$|R

To reduce this risk of <b>unconscious</b> racial <b>bias,</b> we propose a policy change: Prosecutors should be blinded to the race of criminal defendants wherever feasible. This could be accomplished by removing information identifying or suggesting the defendant’s race from police dossiers shared with prosecutors and by avoiding mentions of race in conversations between prosecutors and defense attorneys. Race is almost always irrelevant to the merits of a criminal prosecution; it should be omitted from the proceedings whenever possible for the sake of justice...|$|R

Some participants within the report stated that there is an “over representation of white people among staff and students on some courses.” Furthermore, the BME participants highlighted the impact of the “whiteness of the curriculum than that of any other aspect of learning and teaching.” The report also stated that, “discussions dominated by ‘white male students’, made minority female students feel uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened” and that “Having white students voice dominate was especially frustrating when the discussion was about political or theoretical interventions of people of color, or about racist violence.” One BME student also had issues with “white teachers teaching white students about black/brown people.” Some BME students felt silenced also “by the pressure to communicate using academic language that – for reasons of structural racism – was closer to the everyday speech of middle-class, white students than their own.” The report recommended that “All academics must be prepared to acknowledge that, no matter their research specialism, they are capable of racism, and should be prepared to discuss how.” Other recommendations included “Introduce mandatory <b>unconscious</b> <b>bias</b> workshops for all assessors and staff on recruitment or promotion panels.” ...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Studies documenting racial/ethnic {{disparities in}} health care {{frequently}} implicate physicians’ <b>unconscious</b> <b>biases.</b> No study to date has measured physicians’ <b>unconscious</b> racial <b>bias</b> to test whether this predicts physicians’ clinical decisions. OBJECTIVE: To test whether physicians show implicit race bias and whether the magnitude of such bias predicts thrombolysis recommendations for black and white patients with acute coronary syndromes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An internetbased tool comprising a clinical vignette of a patient presenting to the emergency department with an acute coronary syndrome, followed by a questionnaire and three Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Study invitations were e-mailed to all internal medicine and emergency medicine residents at four academic medical centers in Atlanta and Boston; 287 completed the study, met inclusion criteria, and were randomized to either a black or white vignette patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IAT scores (normal continuous variable) measuring physicians’ implicit race preference and perceptions of cooperativeness. Physicians’ attribution of symptoms to coronary artery disease for vignette patients with randomly assigned race, and their decisions about thrombolysis. Assessment of physicians’ explicit racial biases by questionnaire. RESULTS: Physicians reported no explicit preference for white versus black patients or differences in perceived cooperativeness. In contrast, IATs revealed implicit preference favoring white Americans (mean IAT score= 0. 36, P<. 001, one-sample t test) and implicit stereotypes of black Americans as less cooperative with medical procedures (mean IAT score 0. 22, P<. 001), and less cooperative generally (mean IAT score 0. 30, P<. 001). As physicians’ prowhite implicit bias increased, so did their likelihood of treating white patients and not treating black patients with thrombolysis (P=. 009). CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first evidence of <b>unconscious</b> (implicit) race <b>bias</b> among physicians, its dissociation from conscious (explicit) bias, and its predictive validity. Results suggest that physicians’ <b>unconscious</b> <b>biases</b> may contribute to racial/ ethnic disparities in use of medical procedures such as thrombolysis for myocardial infarction...|$|R
