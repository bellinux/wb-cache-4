50|$|The name carbide saw {{came from}} the tool, a {{circular}} saw blade, with silver soldered carbide tips. It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS saws were developed, abrasive, friction or hot saws were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot saws. However, HSS blades <b>use</b> <b>coolant</b> and the cut surfaces don’t get hot, thus called cold saws. With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide circular saws, the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips. The cut surfaces stay cool. Therefore, carbide saws were also called cold saws. Other names include cold cut saws, cold circular saws, cold cut off saws or circular cold saws.|$|E
40|$|Genie”, a 40 KHZ {{sonofusion}} reactor {{consists of}} 2 opposing 40 KHz piezos separated by 4 mm of D 2 O, with a centered Ti target foil, with one piezo transmitting, the other receiving and taking that signal, amplifying it, then feeding {{it back to}} the transmitter as the resonating frequency of the reactor. This process makes for efficient watt input, Qi, where 80 % of these watts will be used as the acoustic input, Qa, to the “Genie ” sonofusion reactor. In the reactor the transient cavitation bubbles, TCBs, produce billions of low energy high density jets per second that accelerate deuterons into foil targets producing excess heat, Qx. The Qx is determined by calorimetric measurements of experiments that <b>use</b> <b>coolant</b> water circulated {{to the surface of the}} well insulated reactor and data collected in the form of T in and T out at steadystate temperatures and coolant flow rate. The total watts out, Qo, minus Qa ideally should equal zero, and we know that this calorimetry method has several losses that are not measured. This makes the method very conservative when looking for Qx. The Qx must make up those heat losses before making its presence known. The result from experiments of system I using flow x DT x 4. 184 for Qo–Qi = Qx shows that Qx values over unity are the norm. System II used a more realistic calculation for Qx where flow x DT x 4. 184 for Qo–Qa = Qx showed increased results. The calibration of the reactor with a Joule heater, JH, and substituting H 2 O for D 2 O produced measurements that showed the reactor calorimetry was close to zero Qx production as one would expect. These measurements showed that heat in = heat out, a good zero indicating no Qx, for the operation of the “Genie ” sonofusion reactor...|$|E

40|$|The cost of <b>using</b> <b>coolant</b> in {{machining}} industry world-wide is very high. Through a literature survey, it costs multi-billion Dollars for coolant acquisition and disposition in industrialized countries.

40|$|Strained {{environment}} {{is a global}} problem. In metal industries the <b>use</b> of <b>coolant</b> has become more problematic {{in terms of both}} employee health and environmental pollution. It is said that the <b>use</b> of <b>coolant</b> forms approximately 8 - 16 % of the total production costs. The traditional methods that <b>use</b> <b>coolants</b> are now obviously becoming obsolete. Hence, it is clear that using a dry cutting system has great implications for resource preservation and waste reduction. For this purpose, a new cooling system is designed for dry cutting. This paper presents the new eco-friendly cooling innovation and the benefits gained by using this method. The new cooling system relies on a unit for ionising ejected air. In order to compare the performance of using this system, cutting experiments were carried out.

30|$|It is {{concluded}} {{from this}} in vitro study that heat accumulation and transfer {{is dependent on}} the type of ultrasonic device, the <b>use</b> of <b>coolant,</b> and the implant type. The highest rise in temperature is seen when using the Satelec device without coolant on the smaller diameter implants. The EMS device causes limited rise in temperature when <b>used</b> without <b>coolant</b> for less than 10  s, but presumably delivers less energy to the tip, and consequently may be not as effective. A cooling down period is sensible. When <b>used</b> with <b>coolant</b> {{for a longer period of}} time, the clinician should anticipate a considerable rise in temperature after cessation of instrumentation, and post-operational cooling is advised.|$|R
