5|$|She {{dedicated}} The False Laurel, {{published in}} 1896, to Lionel Johnson. The plot features a poetess who {{falls in love}} with and marries an insipid young poet, giving <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> writing to attend to his needs. She becomes bored, writes a successful play, and then goes mad. The False Laurel was the least successful of her books, selling fewer than 200 copies. It received a poor review from The Bookman but a good one from The Athenaeneum.|$|E
5|$|After graduating Coffin {{was unable}} to find work with {{established}} architectural firms, due to widespread prejudice against a woman working in a male-dominated field. She set <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> practice in New York City in 1905, starting out by designing suburban gardens on Long Island. Her increasing fame led to larger commissions from wealthy and powerful East Coast families. By the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after landscape architects in the eastern United States. Coffin's clientele included some of the wealthiest and most famous families in the country, including the Fricks, the Vanderbilts, the Huttons, and the du Ponts.|$|E
5|$|Setting <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> {{publishing}} house Marsden House, Karen {{is relying on}} useless Ramona as personal assistant.

Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E

5|$|She {{moved to}} New York City {{with her mother}} and took rooms in the National Arts Club in Gramercy Park, Manhattan. Around 1905, Coffin set <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> office at the National Arts Club and began taking commissions, using her family {{connections}} to find work. She was ideally situated; it was the height of the Country Place Era, when wealthy East Coast Americans were eager to develop elaborate European-style gardens for their estates. Coffin was well-connected in such circles, widely traveled, came from a good family, was professionally trained and was known for her good taste. She also joined the American Society of Landscape Architects, which had two other female members at the time.|$|E
5|$|Though {{usually made}} to {{strengthen}} {{the position of the}} empire, there are examples of interdynastic marriages destabilising the emperor's authority. When Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos married his second wife, Eirene of Montferrat, in 1284 she caused a division in the Empire over her demand that her own sons share in imperial territory with, Michael, his son from his first marriage. She resorted to leaving Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, and setting <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> court in the second city of the Empire, Thessalonica.|$|E
5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> life for his. In fact, they {{spent a great deal}} of time away from each other and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E

5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, {{and her own}} management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital {{as a staff}} nurse on the general surgery ward, making a poor first {{impression}} by being disorganised and insolent. Mistakenly believing that living with her superior will ensure her an easy time at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> loan repayments. Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk. Mickie is disappointed when Donna states that it was just a one-night stand, but they are able to reconcile their friendship. When the general surgery ward is downsized, Donna is forced to reapply for her job. Although she gives a good interview and impresses Lisa, other candidates have more experience, so she is unable to retain her position and has to work as a bank nurse.|$|E
