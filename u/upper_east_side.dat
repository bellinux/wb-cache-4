It is the only museum in the United States devoted to historical and contemporary design. Its collections and exhibitions explore approximately 240 years of design aesthetic and creativity.|$|R
5|$|The {{locations}} of the station entrances are all south of 96th Street. In 2009, there was a debate over {{the placement of the}} location of the street entrances. Because 96th Street divides the neighborhoods of the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> to the south and East Harlem to the north, some residents of East Harlem stated that their neighborhood was not served by the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E
5|$|Bud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, {{including}} a penthouse on Manhattan's <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> and a trophy girlfriend, interior decorator Darien (Daryl Hannah).

Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadwayâ€“Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side)</b> would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation grates ubiquitous {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E
500|$|In [...] of Gossip Girl, Blair is {{introduced}} as the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side's</b> beautiful and popular Queen B. She {{is the daughter}} of Eleanor Waldorf, a famous fashion designer. She is dating Nate Archibald, and is best friends with Serena van der Woodsen. She also finds a close companion in Nate's best friend and her childhood friend Chuck Bass, who becomes a partner for her schemes. When Serena returns home from boarding school, Blair learns from Nate that he lost his virginity to a drunken Serena over a year ago. Blair retaliates by publicly revealing Serena's connection to a rehab hospital. She then learns that the actual patient is Serena's younger brother, Eric, who had been committed after a suicide attempt. Afterward, a remorseful Blair reconciles with Serena.|$|R

Serena finally tells Dan the whole truth about her past and about Georgina and they try to work things out. But Dan is guilt-ridden after having cheated on Serena with Georgina and wonders if it is already too late. An unexpected guest shows up at Lily and Bart's wedding. Also Blair manipulates matters so that Georgina goes [...] "somewhere where she can do no harm". As {{the end of the school}} year approaches, Blair plans to go somewhere with Chuck.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the Third Avenue El, opened from 1878 in sections, {{followed}} by the Second Avenue El, opened in 1879, linked the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side's</b> middle class and skilled artisans closely {{to the heart of}} the city, and confirmed the modest nature of the area to their east. The ghostly [...] "Hamilton Square", which had appeared as one of the few genteel interruptions of the grid plan on city maps since the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, was intended to straddle what had now become the Harlem Railroad right-of-way between 66th and 69th Streets; it never materialized, though during the Panic of 1857 its unleveled ground was the scene of an open-air mass meeting called in July to agitate for the secession of the city and its neighboring counties from New York State, and the city divided its acreage into house lots and sold them. From the 1880s the neighborhood of Yorkville became a suburb of middle-class Germans.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, Eleanor Roosevelt College, {{one of six}} {{undergraduate}} residential colleges at the University of California, San Diego, was founded.

50|$|Many of Atlantas neighborhoods {{experienced}} the urban flight that affected other major American {{cities in the}} 20th century, causing the decline of once <b>upper</b> and upper-middle-class <b>east</b> <b>side</b> neighborhoods including Grant Park, Inman Park, Candler Park and Virginia Highland. In the 1970s, after neighborhood opposition blocked two freeways from being built through the <b>east</b> <b>side,</b> the area became {{the starting point for}} Atlantas gentrification wave, first becoming affordable, hip but edgy neighborhoods attracting young people, and by 2000 having become relatively affluent areas attracting people from across Metro Atlanta to their upscale shops and restaurants.|$|R
5|$|The film's premise was {{inspired}} by a French couple in an open marriage whom Levin met in the 1980s. Though he completed the film's first draft in 2007, the project remained in development for seven further years due to casting issues. Diane Kruger was initially cast as Arielle but was replaced by Marlohe. Filming began in May 2013 in New York City and mainly took place on the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> of Manhattan. The film's score was composed by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans.|$|E
5|$|In April 1960, Roosevelt was {{diagnosed}} with aplastic anemia soon after being struck by a car in New York City. In 1962, she was given steroids, which activated a dormant case of tuberculosis in her bone marrow, and she died of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home at 55 East 74th Street on the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> on November 7, 1962, {{at the age of}} 78.

5000|$|In the film, Kathryn is wealthy, {{beautiful}} and popular, She {{is part of}} the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side's</b> social elite. Portrayed as a manipulative mastermind who uses and destroys people for her own amusement, she is also depicted as being addicted to cocaine, which she hides in her rosary, and may even suffer from Bulimia, as her ex-boyfriend Court states she's a [...] "Bulimic Headcase" [...] and Sebastian's private journal also states she's bulimic. She hides her true nature behind the facade of a deeply religious model student, fooling everyone she knows, except for her equally narcissistic step-brother Sebastian Valmont. Kathryn shows signs of sociopathic and narcissistic traits, treating the death of her supposedly [...] "loved" [...] brother with cold disdain, and gleefully enjoying destroying his life, {{as well as those of}} the people she perceives as threats or inferior to her. She has a strong superiority complex, but the extent of her interest in Sebastian is left ambiguous (she does cry when Sebastian's journal is made public, but whether this is because she finally saw how much Sebastian actually loathed/loved her, or if it is because people finally see her conniving, troubled mind, is left unanswered). Kathryn is the archetypal cold-hearted ice princess whose opulent bedroom is a cold, dark lair decorated in royal blue and silver with crystal embellishments. When she's not wearing black, gray or other dark, muted colors, she occasionally wears icy blue.|$|R
5000|$|The Occupy Homes {{movement}} {{has its roots}} in the early 1970s, when declining working-class incomes and a lack of bank financing for low-rent properties left thousands of New York City buildings abandoned and hundreds of former tenants squatted vacant buildings on Manhattan's <b>Upper</b> West <b>Side,</b> <b>East</b> Harlem, Chelsea, Chinatown, the Lower <b>East</b> <b>Side,</b> and the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.

Early successful actions included the delay of an eviction of a woman in Ohio when protesters camped out in her yard, ...|$|R
5|$|When Grant had {{returned}} to America from his costly world tour, he had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home. Wealthy friends bought him a home on Manhattan's <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side,</b> and to make an income, Grant, Jay Gould, and former Mexican Finance Secretary MatÃ­as Romero chartered the Mexican Southern Railroad, with {{plans to build a}} railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City. Grant urged Chester A. Arthur, who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881, to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico. Arthur and the Mexican government agreed, but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883. The railroad was similarly unsuccessful, falling into bankruptcy the following year.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{unification}} of the three subway companies that comprised the New York City Subway in 1940, elevated lines were being shut down {{all over the city}} and replaced by subways. The northern half of the Second Avenue Elevated, serving the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> and East Harlem, closed on June 11, 1940; the southern half, running through Lower Manhattan, East Midtown and across the Queensborough Bridge to Queens, closed on June 13, 1942. The demolition of the Second Avenue elevated caused overcrowding on the Astoria and Flushing Lines in Queens, which no longer had direct service to Manhattan's far East Side. Because of the elevated line's closure, as well as a corresponding increase in the East Side's population, the need for a Second Avenue subway increased.|$|E
5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side,</b> prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E

5|$|After {{discovering}} that Charlie {{has not been}} taking her medication, Serena and Vanessa reluctantly team up to find her. Chuck, Nate, Vanessa, and Serena soon encircle Dan, exclaiming that they need something from him. Chuck asks him where Blair is while Serena and Vanessa ask for Charlie's whereabouts. One of Blair's old friends reveals that Blair left the party. While accompanying Chuck to their apartment to look for Blair, Nate confesses that he told Raina (Tika Sumpter) everything behind her mother's death. Chuck reprimands Nate until Raina interrupts them to apologize. Blair is held hostage by Russell in Chuck's hotel. Pretending to escape, she calls Chuck on her phone, revealing her location. Russell explains his reason for kidnapping Blair: to burn down the hotel with her in it. A drunk Charlie is seen dancing wildly until Dan confronts her, but she escapes. Serena greets Headmistress Queller (Jan Maxwell), who expresses her concern with Serena's choice of staying in New York City, having hoped that Serena would find her place outside of the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side.</b> Georgina offers her aid in their scheme but Dan, Vanessa, and Serena reject her help, going their separate ways to find Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Having secured American visas in July 1946, the Wodehouses made {{preparations}} {{to return}} to New York. They were delayed by Ethel's insistence on acquiring suitable new clothes and by Wodehouse's wish to finish writing his current novel, The Mating Season, in {{the peace of the}} French countryside. In April 1947 they sailed to New York, where Wodehouse was relieved at the friendly reception he received from the large press contingent awaiting his arrival. Ethel secured a comfortable penthouse apartment in Manhattan's <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side,</b> but Wodehouse was not at ease. The New York that he had known before the war was much changed. The magazines that had paid lavishly for his stories were in decline, and those that remained were not much interested in him. He was sounded out about writing for Broadway, but he was not at home in the post-war theatre; he had money problems, with large sums temporarily tied up in Britain, {{and for the first time}} in his career he had no ideas for a new novel. He did not complete one until 1951.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to connecting the BMT Nassau Street and IND Sixth Avenue Lines, {{as well as}} the Sixth Avenue Line to the Manhattan Bridge, the Chrystie Street Connection {{is one of the few}} completed sections of the SAS. The Grand Street station was built to serve as a transfer point between the Sixth Avenue and Second Avenue lines. The connection was built this way because the original 1960s plans for the SAS had Second Avenue and Sixth Avenue Line trains sharing two island platforms in a four-track layout, with connections from the Second Avenue Line to the Sixth Avenue Line and the Manhattan Bridge. Because Second Avenue Subway construction was halted in 1975, this station has only served Sixth Avenue Line trains since its opening. As part of the contemporary Second Avenue Subway construction, a new station is planned for construction below the current station during the fourth and final phase of the project; Phase 1 of the project on the <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> opened on January 1, 2017, with Phase 2 in planning and two other phases with no funding commitments.|$|E
