5|$|While {{waiting for}} an {{opportunity}} to launch this operation, the Alsos Mission learned that uranium ore that had been taken from Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt, which was captured by the 83rd Infantry Division on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Boris Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium <b>uranate</b> and ferro-uranium weighing about 1,000 tons were taken away.|$|E
5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (<b>uranate)</b> and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E

5000|$|All uranates(VI) {{are mixed}} oxides, that is, {{compounds}} {{made up of}} metal(s), uranium and oxygen atoms. No uranium oxyanion, such as UO42− or U2O72−, is known.

The structures of uranates(VI) are unlike the structure of any mixed oxide of elements other than actinide elements. A particular feature {{is the presence of}} linear O-U-O moieties, which resemble the uranyl ion, UO22+. However, the U-O bond length varies from 167 pm, which is similar to the bond length of the uranyl ion, up to about 208 pm in the related compound α-UO3, so it is debatable as to whether these compounds all contain the uranyl ion.

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure of U(V) - and U(VI) -containing <b>uranates</b> NaUO 3 and Pb 3 UO 6 was studied {{by using an}} advanced technique, namely X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detection (HERFD) mode. Due to {{a significant reduction in}} core-hole lifetime broadening, the crystal-field splittings of the 5 f shell were probed directly in HERFD-XAS spectra collected at the U 3 d edge, which is not possible by using conventional XAS. In addition, the charge-transfer satellites that result from U 5 f–O 2 p hybridization were clearly resolved. The crystal field parameters, 5 f occupancy, and degree of covalency of the chemical bonding in these <b>uranates</b> were estimated by using the Anderson impurity model by calculating the U 3 d HERFD-XAS, conventional XAS, core-to-core (U 4 f– 3 d transitions) resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS), and U 4 f Xray photoelectron spectra. The crystal field was found to be strong in these systems and the 5 f occupancy was determined to be 1. 32 and 0. 84 electrons in the ground state for NaUO 3 and Pb 3 UO 6, respectively, which indicates a significant covalent character for these compounds.
