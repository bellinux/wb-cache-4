5|$|Krug {{began her}} library career in 1962 {{when she began}} working as a {{reference}} librarian at the John Crerar Library in Chicago. In 1963, she became a cataloguer for the Northwestern University Dental School. She became a research analyst for the American Library Association in 1965, and in 1967 she became director of its Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) upon its foundation. Krug described {{the role of the}} OIF as protection of the right of individuals in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> comprehensive availability of information, regardless of those who disapprove of the material itself.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in {{technological}} innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E
5|$|In article {{published}} by the Guardian newspaper, the community importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae a young girl {{at the age of}} 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare lung tissue disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a life or death operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Power Jam FM raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM joined forces to help; both of which helped raise thousands of pounds each. With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that {{had it not been for}} Power Jam FM, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, Sanjae would have died.|$|E

5|$|Ohio is {{commonly}} noted as the Nation's Industrial Capital, dating to {{its roots in}} the Rust Belt and Ohio's present-day intelligence and scientific dominance. Ohio was one of four states in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> areas make the Intelligent Community Forum's list of global Smart 21 Communities for 2014, with Columbus, Ohio receiving the honors. The state has 5 of the top 115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 2010 rankings, while the Ohio State University was ranked #10 by the same magazine for awarding degrees to Fortune 500 CEOs. The state was ranked #8 by the same magazine in 2008 for best high schools, while overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked #5 in the country by Education Week. However, by 2016 the state's high school rankings had slipped to #11 according to U.S. News and World Report, and #22 overall in quality by Education Week in 2017. It was second only to Texas in having the most U.S. cities in the top 30 best places for new college graduates, according to BusinessWeek in 2010. The year ending July 2011 saw the state ranked fourth in the nation in job creation behind Texas, California, and New York. By 2016 the state wasn't in the top 10 for job growth, and between 2015-2016, the state saw a decrease in job creation of 38,800. Since February 2010 state was 2.5% below the national average.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposition}} {{was made}} by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books {{of all the other}} members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.|$|E

25|$|As {{a supreme}} realist, Eakins {{appeared}} heavy and vulgar {{to a public}} that thought of art, and culture in general, largely {{in terms of a}} graceful sentimentality. Today he seems to <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> recorded his fellow Americans with a perception that was often as tender as it was vigorous, and to have preserved for us the essence of an American life which, indeed, he did not idealize — because it seemed to him beautiful beyond the necessity of idealization.|$|E
25|$|Multisensory integration, {{also known}} as {{multimodal}} integration, {{is the study of}} how information from the different sensory modalities, such as sight, sound, touch, smell, self-motion and taste, may be integrated by the nervous system. A coherent representation of objects combining modalities enables <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> meaningful perceptual experiences. Indeed, multisensory integration is central to adaptive behavior because it allows us to perceive a world of coherent perceptual entities. Multisensory integration also deals with how different sensory modalities interact with one another and alter each other's processing.|$|E
25|$|A scheme {{based on}} the grid {{focusing}} method has been developed {{that makes it possible}} to satisfy the requirement of large bath region and a fine grid resolution in channel {{at the same time in}} a computationally effective way.

25|$|Devi {{travelled}} {{the world}} demonstrating her arithmetic talents, including {{a tour of}} Europe in 1950 and a performance in New York City in 1976. In 1988, she travelled to the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, {{a professor of psychology}} at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance of several tasks, including the calculation of large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Devi provided the solution to the above mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook. Jensen published his findings in the academic journal Intelligence in 1990.|$|E
25|$|The direct realist {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} (mostly associated with Carol Fowler) {{is a part}} of the more general theory of direct realism, which postulates that perception allows <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> direct awareness of the world because it involves direct recovery of the distal source of the event that is perceived. For speech perception, the theory asserts that the objects of perception are actual vocal tract movements, or gestures, and not abstract phonemes or (as in the Motor Theory) events that are causally antecedent to these movements, i.e. intended gestures. Listeners perceive gestures not by means of a specialized decoder (as in the Motor Theory) but because information in the acoustic signal specifies the gestures that form it. By claiming that the actual articulatory gestures that produce different speech sounds are themselves the units of speech perception, the theory bypasses the problem of lack of invariance.|$|E
