5|$|Ariel is the fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of Uranus. Ariel orbits and rotates in the {{equatorial}} plane of Uranus, {{which is almost}} perpendicular to the orbit of <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> so has an extreme seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E

50|$|In Greek mythology, Hesiod {{mentions}} Themis {{among the}} six sons and six daughters of Gaia <b>and</b> <b>Uranus</b> (Earth <b>and</b> Sky). Among these Titans of primordial myth, few were venerated at specific sanctuaries in classical times.|$|R
5|$|Because {{observations}} of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for Voyager 1 was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below {{the south pole}} of Saturn {{and out of the}} plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had Voyager 1 failed or been unable to observe Titan, Voyager 2s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the Titan flyby, precluding any visit to <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> Neptune. The trajectory Voyager 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> Neptune, but could have been altered to avoid a Titan flyby and travel from Saturn to Pluto, arriving in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Ice giants, <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> Neptune, are {{primarily}} composed of low-boiling-point {{materials such as}} water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).|$|E
5|$|Margaret is {{the only}} known {{irregular}} prograde moon of <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> it currently has the most eccentric orbit of any moon in the Solar System, though Neptune's moon Nereid has a higher mean eccentricity. As of 2008, Margaret's eccentricity is 0.7979.|$|E

5|$|PSR B1620-26 b has {{a mass of}} 2.5 {{times that}} of Jupiter, and orbits at a {{distance}} of 23 AU (3.4 billion km), a little larger than the distance between <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> the Sun. Each orbit of the planet takes about 100 years.|$|E
5|$|So far {{the only}} {{close-up}} images of Umbriel {{have been from}} the Voyager 2 probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest distance between Voyager 2 and Umbriel was , the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 5.2km. The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 20% was photographed with the quality required for geological mapping. At {{the time of the}} flyby the southern hemisphere of Umbriel (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied. No other spacecraft has ever visited <b>Uranus</b> (<b>and</b> Umbriel), and no mission to <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> its moons are planned.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledging the problem, the IAU {{set about}} {{creating}} {{the definition of}} planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> Neptune), and {{a new class of}} dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).|$|E

5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, {{based on}} its {{interior}} chemistry, that the comet formed in the <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> Neptune Oort cloud region of the Solar System. A comet which forms farther from the Sun {{is expected to have}} greater amounts of ices with low freezing temperatures, such as ethane, which was present in Tempel 1. Astronomers believe that other comets with compositions similar to Tempel 1 are likely to have formed in the same region.|$|E
5|$|At 162km, Puck is {{the largest}} of the inner moons of <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> the only one imaged by Voyager 2 in any detail. Puck and Mab are the two {{outermost}} inner satellites of Uranus. All inner moons are dark objects; their geometrical albedo is less than 10%. They are composed of water ice contaminated with a dark material—probably radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds form {{on other}} planets, {{including}} Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> possibly Neptune. They {{have even been}} seen on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Some of these extraterrestrial cirrus clouds are composed of ammonia or methane ice rather than water ice. The term cirrus is also used for certain interstellar clouds composed of sub-micrometer-sized dust grains.|$|E

5|$|Planets are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited {{by one or more}} natural satellites.|$|E
5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of Uranus, which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (the smallest of the five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and geometric albedo in visible light of approximately 0.11.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is {{subdivided}} {{into the inner}} planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> Neptune. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend {{as far as a}} light-year.|$|E

5|$|The Sun {{has eight}} known planets. This {{includes}} four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (<b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> Neptune). The Solar System also {{has at least}} five dwarf planets, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, {{and a large number}} of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The Voronezh Front, {{commanded}} by Nikolai Vatutin, was tasked with defending the southern {{face of the}} salient. The Central Front, {{commanded by}} Konstantin Rokossovsky, defended the northern face. Waiting in reserve was the Steppe Front, commanded by Ivan Konev. In February 1943, the Central Front had been reconstructed from the Don Front, which {{had been part of}} the northern pincer of Operation <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> had been responsible for the destruction of the 6th Army at Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may be {{surrounded}} by dense metallic hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet. Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> Neptune.|$|E
