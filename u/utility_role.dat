5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{in spring training}} in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position.

50|$|When the Citabria was introduced, it was {{the only}} {{airplane}} being commercially produced in the United States which was certified for aerobatics. Citabrias were also popular as trainers—because of their conventional gear and their aerobatic capabilities—and as personal aircraft. They were also found in <b>utility</b> <b>roles</b> such as bush flying—thanks to their short take off and landing ability, agriculture, pipeline patrol, and as glider towplanes. Though variants of the design, and other better-suited designs have largely taken over the Citabria's <b>utility</b> <b>roles,</b> Citabrias remain popular as trainers, glider towplanes, and for personal use.|$|R

The moves seemed to leave Wiggins battling for an outfield spot, but after he hit [...]413 during spring training, Ripken made comments that suggested {{he was thinking of}} using Wiggins as a utility player. Just before the season started, Wiggins was not happy with Ripken's idea of using him in a <b>utility</b> <b>role,</b> feeling that his spring performance should have secured him a starting position. He believed that he could be an asset in the leadoff batting slot.|$|E
