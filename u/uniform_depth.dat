25|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction {{that the}} Moon exerts on Earth {{is the cause}} of tides in the sea; the Sun has a lesser tidal influence. If Earth had a global ocean of <b>uniform</b> <b>depth,</b> the Moon would act to deform both the solid Earth (by a small amount) and the ocean in the shape of an ellipsoid with the high points roughly beneath the Moon and {{on the opposite side of}} Earth. However, because of the presence of the continents, Earth's much faster rotation and varying ocean depths, this simplistic visualisation does not happen. Although the tidal flow period is generally synchronized to the Moon's orbit around Earth, its relative timing varies greatly. In some places on Earth, there is only one high tide per day, whereas others have four, though this is somewhat rare.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Die wear is {{regarded}} as a crucial factor which affects die life and quality of products. In hot extrusion process, finite-element method (FEM), BP neural network and genetic algorithm were combined together to optimize extrusion die profile which yielded more <b>uniform</b> wear <b>depth</b> distribution on die profile. A method of B-spline function interpolation was used to describe extrusion die profile. The temperature, pressure and velocity field of nodes that lied on extrusion die profile were gained by FEM simulation. Wear depth of extrusion die profile was calculated by modified Archard theory. The results were used to train BP neural network, so that nonlinear mapping relations between reference points of die profile and wear depth were obtained. In order to gain <b>uniform</b> wear <b>depth,</b> genetic algorithm was applied to optimize extrusion die profile.

It follows, as a consequence, that no prevalence of northerly winds can force the icebergs beyond 78 degrees of south latitude, as they invariably ground on reaching the outer edge of the polar bank.

Large cross-shore velocity asymmetries indicated: (1) Spatially extensive and temporally persistent offshore mean flows (up to 0. 18 m s- 1 across the landward slope of the linear outer bar) reflecting an undertow driven by a wave-induced setup.

40|$|The bed {{texture of}} a gravel-bed river {{is related to}} the size {{distribution}} and quantity of source sediments, the routing of sediment through the reach, and the distribution of flow velocity. A reach morphology that is consistent in depth with little lateral topographic variation will typically have a bed texture that is characterized by a fairly uniform grain size distribution. However, spatial variations in source sediments within a given watershed may impact the distribution of gravel-bed river sediments, even at the reach scale, such that two proximal reaches of the same river having the same general morphology can exhibit contrasting distributions of surface sediments. We collected extensive topographic and sedimentological data from two reaches of the Fall River in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. These were chosen for their simple morphology (both are straight reaches with fairly <b>uniform</b> <b>depths)</b> and contrasting location relative to alluvial fan deposits that were introduced into the valley in a dam-break event in 1982; the upstream reach was unaffected by the introduced sediments. Despite the long duration since this event, surveying in 2008 revealed that the fan sediment continues to coarsen the left and upstream portions of the affected reach relative to other regions of the channel. The persistent nonuniformity in bed texture in the downstream reach may eventually result in morphological adjustment by promoting differential routing of fine versus coarse bed load size fractions, which may induce meandering...|$|R
