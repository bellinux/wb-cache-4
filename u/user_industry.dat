40|$|This paper {{takes an}} initial look at early {{interactions}} between insurance as a <b>user</b> <b>industry</b> and vendors of computing equipment {{during the period}} {{from the end of the}} war into the mid- 1950 s, when first generation computers were adopted by many insurance firms. The transition of life insurance from tabulating to computing technology illustrates two forces evident at many points of technological change: co-evolution and continuity. The technology and its use in life insurance co-evolved, shaping each other in their interactions over the decade; at the same time, this major <b>user</b> <b>industry</b> and the nascent vendor industry similarly exerted influence on each other. In addition, relationships established and choices made during the tabulator era affected events and choices in the early computer era. In its core technology, the computer may have marked a point of discontinuity with what came before, but it clearly demonstrated continuities in many other areas, including market relations, the punched card as storage and input-output medium, and application areas in insurance. ...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{exposure}} to carbon black {{has occurred in}} the carbon black production industry and in several <b>user</b> <b>industries,</b> including the rubber, paint and printing industries. The risks for cancer associated with these three exposure circumstances have been evaluated previously (IARC, 1982, 1989, 1996). The Working Group considered that the epidemiological evidence concerning the risk for cancer in <b>user</b> <b>industries</b> where there has been no attempt to identify which of the workers may have been exposed to carbon black carries little weight in the present evaluation. Consequently, in this monograph, attention was restricted to those studies that explicitly attempted to identify workers who had been exposed to carbon black. Studies based on carbon black production workers and some studies of workers in <b>user</b> <b>industries</b> satisfied this criterion. From {{the point of view of}} exposure patterns, the greatest potential for elucidating the carcinogenicity of carbon black would seem to be in the carbon black production industry. A further advantage of studies among producers is the fact that, in this industry, carbon black was the dominant exposure in the industrial environment, whereas workers in other industries were often exposed to complex mixtures of substances, of which carbon black may in some circumstances have been a relatively minor component. 2. 1 Industry-based studies Table 2. 1 summarizes industry-based studies including cohort analyses and nested case–control analyses of workers exposed to carbon black. 2. 1. 1 Carbon black production The occurrence of cancer among employees at carbon black production facilities in the USA has been followed for different periods since 1935 and was initially described i...|$|R

It is also employed as a flavouring agent in many major food categories, alcoholic and soft drinks. Traditionally Geranium is used to staunch bleeding, healing of wounds, ulcers and skin disorders {{and also in the}} treatment of diarrohea, dysentry and colic. The oil has antibacterial and insecticidal properties and is profusely used in Aromatherapy. India imports 150 t of geranium oil annually. Scented Geranium (Pelargonium sp.) was grown successfully in Kashmir. Experiments conducted at RRL Field Station Bonera Pulwama revealed that the morphological characters, growth behaviour, herbage and oil yield/ha were more or less similar to the hilly areas of South India. The aerial parts (Fresh flowers, stalks and leaves) on steam distillation yielded an essential oil 0. 15 % on fresh wt. basis.

40|$|Today's {{concern of}} {{protecting}} the environment has encouraged the research {{and the use of}} environmental friendly products. Bio-edible oils are potential energy transport media in hydraulic and lubricating systems. The use of bio-edible or vegetable oils as hydraulic fluid would help to minimize hazardous pollution caused by accidental spillage, lower disposal costs of the used fluid, and help the <b>user</b> <b>industry</b> to comply with environmental safety regulations. In order to successfully use these oils, an understanding of the oil properties is necessary in order to overcome the possible failures or obstacles that might occur in real operating conditions. Rheological property {{is one of the most}} important parameters and for this reason this parameter was investigated. The present work evaluates the temperature and shear rate effects of food grade oils that include palm, coconut, canola, corn and sunflower oils. A couette-type viscometer was used to determine the flow behavior of the oils at different temperatures and discrete shear rates that are ranged 40 â€“ 100 Â°C and 3 â€“ 100 rpm, respectively. Various empirical models such as Ostwald de-Waele, Cross, Carreau, Herschelâ€“Bulkley and Arrhenius-type relationship were used to evaluate the experimental data. The influence of shear rate and temperature on the variation of viscosity was clearly observed but temperature has more significant influence. Interpretations of rheological models indicate that these food grade oils belong to pseudo-plastic category. The palm and sunflower oils are highly stable in terms of shear rate and temperature, respectively. The overall results suggest the potential substitution of food grade oils as an energy transport media. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a project}} conducted under {{a program of}} National Industrial Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics (NICE{sup 3 }). The program has the objective of developing and demonstrating industrial processes which simultaneously conserve energy and reduce environmental pollution in an economically attractive manner. This project addressed textile dyeing, specifically batch dyeing of nylon carpets with acid dyes, and focused on providing a technically and financially attractive solution which does not impose burdens on the <b>user</b> <b>industry,</b> such as requirements for additional labor or expertise at the production facility. The batch dyeing of carpet is an inherently wasteful process. After each dye cycle, all of the water, energy, and residual chemicals used to dye the carpets are dumped to the drain. Reuse of the spent dyebaths is a proven technique for reducing consumption of water, chemicals, and energy. However, implementation of reuse on a plant-wide or industry-wide scale is impeded by the human involvement required. This NICE{sup 3 } project developed and demonstrated a process for automated dyebath reuse, including a prototype automated analysis system. This required development of a modified dye cycle, incorporating hot-start and hot-termination for two different dye systems, as well as integration of the analysis system with the existing process control and production scheduling systems in the plant. The prototype analysis system was installed on a production beck in a commercial dyehouse, and automated dyebath reuse was demonstrated on carpets of both nylon 6 and nylon 6, 6 polymers {{in a variety of}} colors. The results of the trials show that the automated analysis system can successfully analyze concentrations of multiple dyes in spent dyebaths without operator assistance and that dyebaths can be reconstituted based on these analyses and reused without compromising the quality of the carpets produced. Economic benefits representing savings in water, energy, chemicals, and waste treatment were shown to be approximately three cents per pound of carpet dyed with a reused bath [...] a significant savings for a typical dyehouse processing tens of millions of pounds of carpet per year...|$|E

As experience with many software projects has already shown, leaving out testing and quality management from software development process can result in vast and critical customer issues, which usually invoke additional expenses for the software production company. In the course of time, software testing as a discipline has therefore seized an important position among other software development activities. And {{due to the fact that}} the software, thanks to rising customer demands and growing competing products portfolio, is getting more complex, the more advanced software testing procedures need to be implemented. Test strategy and iteration planning, implementation of multiple test types into the test suite, test automation, evaluation, administration and maintenance: these activities are commonly required within larger software development projects. Formalized software testing is, nevertheless, being introduced also to projects using agile management techniques which, by management decision or target <b>user</b> <b>industry,</b> are supposed to deliver products of highest quality. This initiates the high focus on the software testing discipline.

40|$|M. Sc. The study {{site for}} this project is New Clydesdale Colliery {{situated}} in the Witbank Coalfield, South Africa. The Witbank Coalfield is located within {{the northern part of}} the Karoo Basin where the major coal deposits in South Africa are located. Optimum ash fusion temperatures derived from coal in this region are approximately 1400 °C, and higher, although temperatures above 1300 °C are also acceptable. In certain coal seams the ash fusion temperatures drop well below this optimum temperature, leading at times to problems in the <b>user</b> <b>industry.</b> Ash fusion temperature which is the temperature at which the mineral matter in coal begins to soften, flow and fuse, is an important aspect relating to coal utilization but is little understood and under-studied in South Africa. The objective of this thesis is to attempt to determine what factors, mineralogical or inorganic chemical, influence variations in the ash fusion temperatures in certain coal samples. An understanding of this problem will have a bearing on the ultimate assessment of a coal for utilization purposes, in general, and ash deposition prediction in future boiler plants in particular. This study is somewhat pioneering as no detailed studies have been undertaken or published previously. Samples were collected at four sites from New Clydesdale Colliery. The sample sites were selected based on pre-existing knowledge of the ash fusion temperatures obtained from company analytical sheets. The sites were therefore representative of low and high ash fusion temperature coal. The first two sites were located in the opencast area where the No. 2 seam is actively being mined. The other two sites were located underground where mining has ceased. Conventional analyses conducted on the samples include proximate analyses, calorific values, percentage sulphur, and ash fusion temperatures. Further analyses performed included ash analyses (composition of ash), X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and petrographic studies. It was found that although complex relationships exist between ash fusion temperature and the various geological and coal parameters, positive results were obtained. These indicate a possible relationship between low ash fusion temperatures and i) finer size fractions, ii) an increase in iron content present in the form of pyrite and iii) the form in which pyrite is present, namely cleats. High ash fusion temperatures tend to correlate with i) the absence of pyrite or ii) pyrite present as framboids...|$|E
