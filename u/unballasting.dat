40|$|In {{this study}} {{tractive}} efficiency (TE) of MF 285 and U 650 tractors during moldboard plowing were evaluated and compared. Field experiments were {{conducted at the}} Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, using a randomized complete block design with a 3 * 3 factorial. The soil was sandy clay loam with an average moisture content of 18 % b. d. from zero to 30 cm depth. Test treatments were combinations of three tractor types or conditions (U 650, MF 285 liquid ballasted and MF 285 with no liquid or weight ballast) and three levels of plowing depth (10 - 15 cm, 15 - 20 cm and 20 - 25 cm). Plowing speed was kept constant at about 4 km/h throughout the experiment. The measured or calculated parameters included: tractor drawbar pull and rolling resistance, drive wheel slip and tractor tractive efficiency. Statistical analysis of the test {{results showed that the}} primary difference between the tractor types or conditions was in their wheel slip, such that the average wheel slip of U 650 was lowest (12. 6 %) while that of <b>unballasted</b> MF 285 was highest (27 %) and was reduced to 17. 7 % with liquid ballasting. Also, while growth of <b>unballasted</b> MF 285 wheel slip with increasing plowing depth was drastically high (11 % to 48 %), that of U 650 was quite moderate (9. 7 % to 16. 5 %). Analysis of the calculated values of TE showed that there was no significant changes in the TE of U 650 with increasing plowing depth and that with an average of 73. 8 %, it had a desirable performance. The TE of <b>unballasted</b> MF 285 that was over 75 % at shallow plowing, dropped to 46 % with increasing plowing depth, while water ballasting improved the decreasing trend of TE with plowing depth and raised its minimum value to about 63 %. The overall results of this study showed that <b>unballasted</b> MF 285 tractors had desirable TE only at shallow plowing and that for medium and deep plowing, U 650 or water ballasted MF 285 tractors should be used...|$|R

40|$|The {{results from}} a study aimed at {{improving}} the dynamic and aerodynamic characteristics of composite rotor blades {{through the use of}} extension-twist coupling are presented. A set of low twist model-scale helicopter rotor blades was manufactured with a view towards demonstrating the passive blade twist control concept. Hover testing of the blades was conducted to measure the change in blade twist as a function of rotor speed. The blades were spun through the 0 - 800 rpm range, with a corresponding sweep of collective pitch to determine the effect on the blade elastic twist. Hover data were obtained for both a ballasted and <b>unballasted</b> blade configuration in atmospheric conditions, where maximum twist changes of 2. 54 and 5. 24 degrees were respectively observed. These results compared well with those from a finite element analysis of the blade, which yielded maximum twists of 3. 01 and 5. 61 degrees for the <b>unballasted</b> and ballasted blade configurations, respectively. The aerodynamic-induced effects on the blade elastic twist, determined by testing a ballasted blade configuration in a near-vacuum condition, were found to be minimal with a maximum twist difference of 0. 17 degrees observed between the two test environments.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{release of}} ballast water from transoceanic vessels {{is a major}} vector for the introduc-tion of nonindigenous species into the Laurentian Great Lakes. This study {{assessed}} the effectiveness of treating <b>unballasted</b> transoceanic vessels using three different biocides: glutaraldehyde plus a surfactant adjuvant (Disinfekt 1000 ®), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and SeaKleen ™ (menadione and menadione metabisulfite 2 : 8). Efficacy against several classes of aquatic organisms was evaluated using 24 h acute toxicity experiments and 11 day ballast tank simulation experiments. The results indicate substantial, compound-specific variations in organism sensitivity. For water-only exposures, NaOCl and SeaKleen™ were most effective: NaOCl had the lowest LC 90 (90 % lethal concentration value) for the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus (1. 0 mg L– 1), while SeaKleen ™ had the lowest LC 90 for the amphipod Hyalella azteca (2. 5 mg L– 1). Sediments profoundly affected efficacy, particularly for NaOCl: At a 1 : 4 sediment-water ratio, the estimated LC 90 for L. variegatus was> 2, 000 mg L– 1. Sediment quality also impacted efficacy: Sediments with higher organic carbon content typically required greater biocide concentrations to achieve comparable toxicity. Efficacy was further evaluated with 11 day bioassays using sediments from <b>unballasted</b> vessels. Results indicated that NaOCl and Disinfekt 1000 ® were more effective than predicted based on small scale sediment-water exposures. Overall, the data suggest that although NaOC...|$|R

Furthermore, he deemed that a bridge had been constructed in a hasty manner with the result that, when tested, it exhibited very great deflection.

50|$|Having a short {{wheelbase}} and no leading bogie, the locomotives {{had a tendency}} to derail and they were ultimately restricted to a maximum speed of 40 km/h and relegated to shunting and branch line traffic. Driven slowly, they could negotiate the most appalling curves and badly maintained or <b>unballasted</b> tracks. They were therefore ideal in goods yards, such as Darling Harbour and Port Waratah with the last two withdrawn from the latter in August 1972. Branch lines such as those to Dorrigo, Batlow and Oberon where grades of up to 1 in 25 (4%) and curves as sharp as 100 m radius could be encountered were ideal for this class and these were the only locomotives permitted on these lines until dieselisation.|$|R

This is consistent with previous estimates showing that transfer efficiency in such regions is low.

5000|$|The {{flat-bottomed}} hull {{made these}} craft extremely versatile and economical. They could float {{in as little}} as 3 feet (1 m) of water and could dry out in the tidal waters without heeling over. This allowed them to visit the narrow tributaries and creeks of the Thames to load farm cargoes, or to dry out on the sand banks and mudflats to load materials for building and brickmaking (it was no coincidence that their use peaked while London was expanding rapidly). The main mast could be lowered to clear bridges. Furthermore, unlike most sailing craft, these barges could sail completely <b>unballasted</b> [...] - [...] a major saving in labour and time.

50|$|Multihulls use {{flotation}} and/or weight positioned {{away from}} the centre line of the sailboat to counter {{the force of the}} wind. This is in contrast to heavy ballast that can account for up to 90% (in extreme cases like AC boats) of the weight of a monohull sailboat. In the case of a standard catamaran, there are two similarly-sized and -shaped slender hulls connected by beams, which are sometimes overlaid by a deck superstructure. Another catamaran variation is the proa. In the case of trimarans, which have an <b>unballasted</b> centre hull similar to a monohull, two smaller amas are situated parallel to the centre hull to resist the sideways force of the wind. The advantage of multihulled sailboats is that they do not suffer the performance penalty of having to carry heavy ballast, and their relatively lesser draft reduces the amount of drag, caused by friction and inertia when moving through the water.|$|R
40|$|The current OECD Code 2 {{detailing}} the {{procedures for the}} hydraulic lift test of agricultural tractors, section 4. 3, published lift values that were sometimes unattainable. The static weight of 2 WD, two wheel drive, and MFWD, mechanical front wheel drive, tractors {{and the amount of}} lifting force have increased at a greater rate than the amount of static weight on the front axle. This increase in lifting force has led to a decrease in the percent of weight as the upward support force on the front axle of a tractor. Many of the 2 WD and MFWD <b>unballasted</b> tractors tested at the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory (NTTL) since 1995 were discovered to have lift forces sufficient to raise the front axle off of the ground given the current maximum achievable lifting capacity measured during testing. Equations for calculating the maximum realistic achievable lifting capacity of tractors were developed based on maintaining a minimum amount of upward support force on the front axle. A test to determine how much upward support force at the front axle was sufficient to maintain adequate steering control of tractors was developed. Operator feedback from this test determined that 20 % of the total tractor weight as the upward support force on the front axle had significantly greater steering control when compared to 15 %. A sample proposal was drafted to be sent to OECD to update the hydraulic lift test in Code 2 requiring limiting the maximum lifting force published such that a minimum of 0 % of the total <b>unballasted</b> tractor weight as the upward support force on the front axle for 2 -track tractors, and 20 % for 2 WD and MFWD, and 4 WD tractors. This proposal utilized a series of equations based on several different tractor characteristics to determine the maximum realistic achievable lifting capacity of agricultural tractors that were tested at OECD accredited test facilities. Ballasted weight configurations were also incorporated for maximum realistic achievable lifting capacity of tractors under this new proposal. A sample of what future publications with these changes could resemble was prepared for the John Deere 6150 M tractor. Advisor: Roger Ho...|$|R
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, <b>unballasted</b> wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|R
40|$|Correlations between {{particulate}} {{organic carbon}} (POC) and mineral fluxes in the deep ocean have inspired the inclusion of ‘ballast effect’ parameterizations in carbon cycle models. A recent study demonstrated regional variability in the effect of ballast minerals on the flux of POC in the deep ocean. We have undertaken a similar analysis of shallow export data from the Arctic, Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Mineral ballasting is of greatest importance in the high-latitude North Atlantic, where 60 % of the POC flux is associated with ballast minerals. This fraction drops to around 40 % in the Southern Ocean. The remainder of the export flux is not associated with minerals, and this <b>unballasted</b> fraction thus often dominates the export flux. The proportion of mineral-associated POC flux often scales with regional variation in export efficiency (the proportion of primary production that is exported). However, local discrepancies suggest that regional differences in ecology also impact the magnitude of surface export. We propose that POC export will not respond equally across all high-latitude regions to possible future changes in ballast availability...|$|R
