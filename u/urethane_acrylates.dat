40|$|A novel imprint process, called Disposable Master Technology {{has been}} {{developed}} using disposable masters replicated from nickel masters using roll-to-roll printing. The disposable masters consist of a polyester terephthalate film coated with a photosensitive resin containing the inverse structure of the nickel master. The use of hydrophobic and oleophobic additives was found to improve release after imprinting. This has enabled structures of deeply submicron periodicity to be imprinted on silicon wafers up to 4 " diameter with good reproducibility. Resist systems have been developed based on <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylates</b> plus a resist based on Oxetanyl Silsesquioxane which contains silicon for improved etch resistance, useful when transferring the imprinted structures into the substrate by reactive ion etching.

Silicone acrylate, used as an additive was found to improve the etch resistivity as well as also easing disposable master release. The generation of disposable masters from anodic porous alumina has been investigated.

40|$|Cationic photopolymerization of {{multifunctional}} epoxides is {{very useful}} for efficient cure {{at room temperature}} and has been widely used in coatings and adhesives. Despite excellent properties of the final cured polymers, cationic photopolymerizations of epoxides have seen limited application due to slow reactions (relative to acrylates) and brittleness associated with a highly crosslinked, rigid network. To address these issues, two reaction systems were studied in this thesis: photoinitiated cationic copolymerizations of a cycloaliphatic diepoxide with epoxidized elastomers and acrylate/epoxide hybrid photopolymerizations. Oligomer/monomer structures, viscosity, compositions, and photoinitiator system were hypothesized to play important roles in controlling photopolymerizations of the epoxide-based mixtures. A fundamental understanding of the interplay between these variables for the chosen systems will provide comprehensive guidelines for the future development of photopolymerization systems comparable to the epoxide-based mixtures in this research. For diepoxide/oligomer mixtures, the observed overall enhancement in polymerization rate and ultimate conversion of the cycloaliphatic diepoxide was attributed to the activated monomer mechanism associated with hydroxyl terminal groups in the epoxidized oligomers. This enhancement increased with increasing oligomer content. The mixture viscosity influenced the initial reactivity of the diepoxide for oligomer content above 50 wt. %. Real-time consumption of internal epoxides in the oligomers was successfully determined using Raman spectroscopy. Initial reactivity and ultimate conversion of the internal epoxides decreased with increasing the diepoxide content. This trend was more pronounced for the oligomer containing low internal epoxide content. These {{results indicate that the}} reactivity of the hydroxyl groups is higher toward cationic active centers of the diepoxide than those of the internal epoxides in the oligomers. These conclusions are consistent with physical property results. The enhanced fracture toughness and impact resistance were attributed to multimodal network chain-length distribution of copolymers containing the oligomer content between 70 % and 80 %. For acrylate/epoxide hybrid mixtures, diacrylate oligomers significantly suppressed reactivities of cycloaliphatic mono/diepoxides, which was attributed to high mixture viscosity and highly crosslinked acrylate network. In this case, the dual photoinitiator system did not favor the epoxide reaction. Depending on the monovinyl acrylate secondary functionalities, enhanced reactivity and ultimate conversion of the diepoxide were attributed to a combined effect of a reduced viscosity and the radical-promoted cationic polymerization associated with the dual photoinitiator. The retarded and inhibited diepoxide reactivities with ether and urethane secondary groups were attributed to solvation and nucleophilicity/basicity effects, respectively. The influence of the diepoxide on the acrylate reactivity was attributed to dilution and polarity effects. In this case, high concentration of the free-radical photoinitiator is required for the dual photoinitiator system. Physical properties of hybrid polymers also varied with acrylate structures and monomer composition. Dynamic modulation methods were proposed to enhance the diepoxide reactivity and final properties in the presence of <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylates...</b>|$|E

This graft polymerization {{was carried out}} on native substrates and on substrates pre-treated by wet oxidation, for different oxidation times. RESULTS: As the urethane monacrylate layer is crosslinked, its grafting efficiency was checked by dissolving the polyethylene substrates in hot toluene. Grafting was evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the obtained residues, which showed that both the characteristic <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylate</b> (3350 cm(- 1)) and polyethylene (2920, 730 and 720 cm(- 1)) bands were observable for any polyethylene oxidation time. For an oxidation time longer than 10 hours, acrylate grafting was homogeneous and the grafted surface was smooth with a roughness of less than 10 nm. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the residues revealed that O/C had an average value of 0. 19, which {{is lower than the}} value corresponding to pure acrylate (0. 42), whereas N/C had an average value of 0. 068, also lower than that of pure acrylate (0. 09), thus confirming the grafting.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} steady-state {{crack growth}} at interfaces between polymeric materials and hard substrates under quasi-static conditions. The polymeric material {{is taken to}} be an elastic nonlinear viscous solid while the substrate is treated as a rigid material. Void growth and coalescence in the rate-dependent fracture process zone is modeled by a nonlinear viscous porous strip of cell elements. In {{the first part of}} this paper, the polymeric background material surrounding the process zone is assumed to be purely elastic. Under fixed mode mixity, the computed interface toughness is found to be a monotonically increasing function of crack velocity; toughness also increases rapidly with higher rate sensitivity. This behavior can be explained in terms of voids growing in a strain-rate strengthened process zone. In the second part of the paper, the background material is also treated as an elastic nonlinear viscous solid. The competition between work of separation in the process zone and energy dissipation in the background material leads to a U-shaped toughness–crack velocity curve. Effects of mode mixity, initial porosity, rate sensitivity, as well as the initial yield strain on toughness are studied.

The moth-eye film has artificially formed nano-pillars, consisting of hydrophilic resin with <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylate</b> and polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives, all over its surface that replicates a moth's eye. Experiments were performed to compare the moth-eye film with a flat-surfaced film produced from the same materials. The JIS Z 2801 film-covering method revealed that the two films produced a decrease in Staphylococcus aureus and Esherichia coli titers of over 5 and 3 logs, respectively. There was no marked difference in the antibacterial effects of the two surfaces. However, the antibacterial effects were reduced by immersion of the films in water. These results indicated that a soluble component(s) of the resin possessed the antibacterial activity, and this component was identified as PEG derivatives by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). When a small volume of bacterial suspension was dropped on the films as an airborne droplet model, both films showed antibacterial effects, but that of the moth-eye film was more potent. It was considered that the moth-eye structure allowed the bacteria-loaded droplet to spread and allow greater contact between the bacteria and the film surface, resulting in strong adherence of the bacteria to the film and synergistically enhanced bactericidal activity with chemical components. The antibacterial effect of the moth-eye film has been thus confirmed under a bacterial droplet model, and it appears attractive due to its antibacterial ability, which is considered to result not only from its chemical make-up but also from physical adherence...|$|R

In order to achieve polymeric materials with higher modulus of elasticity, higher flexural strength and lower thermal expansion coefficient a further family of the above mentioned silane type, the <b>urethane</b> (meth) <b>acrylate</b> alkoxysilanes, has been developed to widen the possible range of properties...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there are}} growing trends in using palm oil as raw {{materials}} in radiation curable resins production. In this study, the acrylated palm oil resins i. e. the EPOLA (epoxidized palm oil acrylate) and the POBUA (palm oil based <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylate)</b> were synthesized using two different systems, i. e. the 25 liter pilot scale reactor synthesis system and the 2 liter (L) laboratory scale reactor synthesis system through chemical processes known as acrylation and isocyanation. In this paper, {{the property of the}} acrylated resins which were produced by these two systems were evaluated and compared between each other. Their properties were characterized using the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer for functional group identification; the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) for molecular weight (Mw) determination, the Brookfield viscometer for viscosity measurements, the acid values (AV) and the oxirane oxygen contents (OOC) analysis. As a result, the production process for both the 2 L and 25 L reactor system were found to be time consuming and the main advantages for the 25 L reactor was its higher productivity as compared with the 2 L reactor system with the same synthesis process parameters i. e. the temperatures and the experimental methods. Besides that, the 25 L reactor synthesis process was found to be safe, easy to control and served unpolluted process to the environments. The final products, the acrylated palm oil resins were formulated into ultraviolet (UV) curable compounds before subjecting them under UV irradiation. As a result, the UV-curable palm oil resins showed potential uses as pressure sensitive adhesives, printing inks including overprint varnishes (OPV) and coatings...|$|R
40|$|Selecting {{the right}} design of bioreactors {{is crucial for}} guaranteeing the {{reproducibility}} of bioprocesses. Up to now, conventionally designed bioreactors consist typically of melted or clamped joints. Since melting of borosilicate glass leads to large deformed areas along the joint, the desired geometric reproducibility is not ensured. Moreover, clamping complicates and greatly restricts the bioreactor design. Bonding, however, is advantageous in {{that it does not}} alter the material joined and it is easy to use. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that specially developed glass bonding techniques withstand multiple autoclaving cycles. The current research investigated practice-relevant parameters influencing the lifespan of epoxy-or (urethane) acrylate-bonded glass bioreactors. Hereby, the influence of cleaning and sensitivity to fermentation compounds (ethanol and acetic acid) was quantified using glass-glass and glass-stainless steel specimens. Whereas cleaning did not adversely affect the durability of glass bonds, high concentrations of the fermentation compounds ethanol and acetic acid resulted in accelerated corrosion and subsequent bond failure. Moreover, no effect of eight different epoxy and (<b>urethane)</b> <b>acrylate</b> adhesives was observed on selected model organisms Escherichia coli K 12 and Hansenula polymorpha wild type. Another objective {{of this study was to}} refine the design of two small-scale bioreactors (ca. 250 mL) by replacing clamps and melted joints by adhesive joints. It was found that the bonded bioreactors yielded a higher geometric reproducibility than that of conventional melted or clamped ones. In conclusion, bonded glass joints greatly enhance the geometric reproducibility of bioreactors and, in turn, the reproducibility of bioprocesses. As glass bonding is easy to handle, it opens up new opportunities to design bioreactors that had been previously too expensive and complicated...|$|R

Coatings composed of different binders incorporating NPs in various concentrations exhibited different superhydrophobic attributes when applied on polycarbonate (PC) and glass substrates and {{as a function of}} coating composition. It was found that the substrate surface characteristics and wettability affected the superhydrophobic characteristics of the coatings. Interfacial tension and spreading coefficient parameters (thermodynamics) of the coating components were used to predict the localization of the NPs for the different binders’ concentrations. The thermodynamic analysis of the NPs localization was in good agreement with the experimental observations. On the basis of the thermodynamic analysis and the experimental scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, profilometry, and atomic force microscopy results, it was concluded that localization of the NPs on the surface was critical to provide the necessary roughness and resulting superhydrophobicity. The durability evaluated by tape testing of the epoxy formulations was the best on both glass and PC. Several coating compositions retained their superhydrophobicity after the tape test. In summary, it was concluded that thermodynamic analysis is a powerful tool to predict the roughness of the coating due to the location of NPs on the surface, and hence can be used in the design of superhydrophobic coatings.

40|$|A new {{technique}} of fabrication of miniaturized fluidic devices was developed using a photoresin based on <b>urethane</b> and <b>acrylate</b> (UA) oligomers used to platemaking for flexographic printers on graphic industry. Fluidic mixers and reactors modules measuring 10 × 10 mm² were manufactured, with channels width in the 0. 25 to 1. 00 mm range and 0. 75 mm depth. Top covers 4. 00 mm thick, with 1. 26 mm diameter inlet and outlet holes {{were used to}} seal the channels. The sealed channel structures were formed using a film of photoresin as adhesive. Interconnections of 1. 20 mm diameter and 10 mm long steel tubes were fixed into inlet and outlet holes.
