While tensor factorizations {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popu-lar for learning on various forms of structured data, only very few theo-retical results exist on the generalization abilities of these methods. Here, we discuss the tensor product as a principled way to represent structured data in vector spaces for machine learning tasks. By extending known bounds for matrix factorizations, {{we are able to}} derive generalization er-ror bounds for the tensor case. Furthermore, we analyze analytically and experimentally how tensor factorization behaves when applied to over-and <b>understructured</b> representations, for instance, when two-way ten-sor factorization, i. e. matrix factorization, is applied to three-way tensor data...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to examine {{substance}} abuse and physical and mental health in an urban Aboriginal population. Data was collected through structured interviews (n = 202) with Aboriginals in the greater Montreal area. The majority were single, unemployed, and lived in the urban area for a long time (mean of 9. 96 +/-. 76 years). One third reported having a current substance abuse problem. Results indicated high levels of psychological distress augmented by substance abuse. Substance abusers {{were also more likely to}} have been the victims of abuse. Ethnographic interviews with urban Aboriginals and community workers were also conducted (n = 30). One third were victims of abuse and 6 reported having a current substance abuse problem. Psychological and biological <b>understructures</b> were used in defining addiction and explaining substance use among Aboriginal peoples. Cultural traditions were viewed as integral components of substance abuse treatment and the need for outpatient treatment facilities and aftercare programs were indicated...|$|R

2500|$|For {{the final}} {{dramatic}} scene involving Harcourt's demise, the rigged effects were handled in two stages. The first stage involved a dissolving head and body, {{while the second}} stage incorporated a flesh-less arm thrusting out of seawater. Rosengrant noted, [...] "While the dissolving makeup had to look extreme, it also had to appear realistic {{within the limits of}} the alien anatomy Winston's crew had designed. We wanted to avoid the amorphous 'blob-of-blood' look you see in so many of these slasher and monster pictures. We {{wanted to be able to}} see Harcourt's bone structure rather than just the glob hanging off of it." [...] For the visual appearance he added, [...] "Of course, we did use methocel slime to make it wet and nasty-looking, but the basic <b>understructure</b> was rooted in anatomy." [...] For Harcourt's facial disintegration, the coordinators came up with a foam rubber base makeup superimposed with a layer of gelatin appliances. Elek explained, the crew [...] "dug out chunks from the foam rubber pieces, filled the holes with Bromo Seltzer, then laid the gelatin appliances over the whole thing and colored them so you could not see the holes below. Once the stuntman, the camera and everyone else was in position, we took a large syringe filled with hot water and injected it into each of the Bromo Seltzer pockets as the camera started rolling. As the Bromo Seltzer started to fizzle, the hot water began eating its way through the gelatin skin and his face appeared to bubble and melt." [...] In the end, Mahan remarked, [...] "We figured that going from something like the alien queen in Aliens to these straight prosthetic makeups would be simple, but it was really a lot of work." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{thermodynamics}} of the liquid–vapor interface by direct {{calculation of the}} surface entropy, enthalpy, and free energy from extensive molecular dynamics simulations using the two-phase thermodynamics (2 PT) method. Results for water, acetonitrile, cyclohexane, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexanol, N-methyl acetamide, and toluene are presented. We validate our approach by predicting the interfacial surface tensions (IFT—excess surface free energy per unit area) in excellent agreement with the mechanical calculations using Kirkwood–Buff theory. Additionally, we evaluate the temperature dependence of the IFT of water as described by the TIP 4 P/ 2005, SPC/Ew, TIP 3 P, and mW classical water models. We find that the TIP 4 P/ 2005 and SPC/Ew water models do a reasonable job of describing the interfacial thermodynamics; however, the TIP 3 P and mW are quite poor. We find that the underprediction of the experimental IFT at 298 K by these water models results from <b>understructured</b> surface molecules whose binding energies are too weak. Finally, we performed depth profiles of the interfacial thermodynamics which revealed long tails that extend far into what would be considered bulk from standard Gibbs theory. In fact, we find a nonmonotonic interfacial free energy profile for water, a unique feature that could have important consequences for the absorption of ions and other small molecules...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} first-principles Monte Carlo {{simulations}} in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble {{were carried out}} for liquid water at ambient conditions (T = 298 K and p = 1 atm). The Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) exchange and correlation energy functionals and norm-conserving Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials were employed with the CP 2 K simulation package to examine systems consisting of 64 water molecules. The fluctuations in the system volume encountered in simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble require a reconsideration of the suitability of the typical charge-density cutoff and the regular grid-generation method previously used for the computation of the electrostatic energy in first-principles simulations in the microcanonical or canonical ensembles. In particular, {{it is noted that}} a much higher cutoff is needed and that the most computationally efficient method of creating grids con result in poor simulations. Analysis of the simulation trajectories using a very large charge-density cutoff at 1200 Ry and four different grid-generation methods point to a significantly underestimated liquid density of about 0. 8 g cm(- 3) resulting in a somewhat <b>understructured</b> liquid (with a value of about 2. 7 for the height of the first peak in the oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function) for BLYP-GTH water at ambient conditions. In addition, a simulation using a charge-density cutoff at 280 Ry yields a higher density of 0. 9 g cm(- 3) showing the sensitivity of the simulation outcome to this parameter...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHollow-sphere {{structures}} {{could represent}} {{an alternative to}} classical cellular materials, such as metal foams or honeycombs, for various structural applications; such stainless steel random structures {{are already on the}} market. One advantage of hollow-sphere structures unlike metal foams ensues from the possibility to stack the spheres regularly, even if in the literature there are only examples of limited size regular stackings for the moment. Higher mechanical properties than those of random cellular structures are expected for such regular structures according to modelling studies. Nevertheless, because of the difficulty in processing perfect regular stackings, it seems to be critical to study the influence of architectural defects on the overall mechanical behaviour of these cellular structures. Emphasis is on geometrical defects by introducing some dispersions on the sphere thickness and the meniscus size. Influences of both the magnitude of dispersion and the distribution of the defects on the mechanical behaviour of hollow-sphere structure are investigated. Especially, collapse mechanisms resulting from plasticity and their inhomogeneous localisation in the structure are studied in details. The case of periodic defects is addressed too in order to compare the mechanical response of infinite stackings to that of finite ones. This work highlights the significant influence of the defects on the effective mechanical behaviour of hollow-sphere structures. Most of the time, geometrical dispersion and defects are detrimental for the stacking behaviour, especially when <b>understructures</b> made of the defective hollow spheres or menisci are observed...|$|R

40|$|Relational {{learning}} {{is concerned with}} learning from data where information is primarily represented in form of relations between entities. In recent years, this branch of machine learning has become increasingly important, as relational data is generated in an unprecedented amount and has become ubiquitous in many fields of application such as bioinformatics, artificial intelligence and social network analysis. However, relational {{learning is}} a very challenging task, due to the network structure and the high dimensionality of relational data. In this thesis we propose that tensor factorization can {{be the basis for}} scalable solutions for learning from relational data and present novel tensor factorization algorithms that are particularly suited for this task. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we present the RESCAL model [...] a novel tensor factorization for relational learning [...] and discuss its capabilities for exploiting the idiosyncratic properties of relational data. In particular, we show that, unlike existing tensor factorizations, our proposed method is capable of exploiting contextual information that is more distant in the relational graph. Furthermore, we present an efficient algorithm for computing the factorization. We show that our method achieves better or on-par results on common benchmark data sets, when compared to current state-of-the-art relational learning methods, while being significantly faster to compute. In the second part of the thesis, we focus on large-scale relational learning and its applications to Linked Data. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of relational data, an efficient computation of RESCAL can scale up to the size of large knowledge bases, consisting of millions of entities, hundreds of relations and billions of known facts. We show this analytically via a thorough analysis of the runtime and memory complexity of the algorithm as well as experimentally via the factorization of the YAGO 2 core ontology and the prediction of relationships in this large knowledge base on a single desktop computer. Furthermore, we derive a new procedure to reduce the runtime complexity for regularized factorizations from O(r^ 5) to O(r^ 3) [...] where r denotes the number of latent components of the factorization [...] by exploiting special properties of the factorization. We also present an efficient method for including attributes of entities in the factorization through a novel coupled tensor-matrix factorization. Experimentally, we show that RESCAL allows us to approach several relational learning tasks that are important to Linked Data. In the third part of this thesis, we focus on the theoretical analysis of learning with tensor factorizations. Although tensor factorizations have become increasingly popular for solving machine learning tasks on various forms of structured data, there exist only very few theoretical results on the generalization abilities of these methods. Here, we present the first known generalization error bounds for tensor factorizations. To derive these bounds, we extend known bounds for matrix factorizations to the tensor case. Furthermore, we analyze how these bounds behave for learning on over- and <b>understructured</b> representations, for instance, when matrix factorizations are applied to tensor data. In the course of deriving generalization bounds, we also discuss the tensor product as a principled way to represent structured data in vector spaces for machine learning tasks. In addition, we evaluate our theoretical discussion with experiments on synthetic data, which support our analysis...|$|R
