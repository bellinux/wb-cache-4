Any competitor may rent office space in an incumbent's central office, place equipment to interconnect with their network, or purchase other related services. The company can offer the same deal to a competing company requesting use of their network and facilities. The new entrant has a right to purchase access to the incumbent on an unbundled basis.

Mile the generation sector moves towards a truly competitive market, the utilities' transmission and distribution functions are undergoing a transition to <b>unbundled</b> <b>services</b> and prices. These changes will affect the competition between distributed and central-station generation technology. Although the ultimate market potential for distributed generation may be significant, the market will be fragmented and heterogeneous. Distributed generation will likely succeed in some small and only a few medium-sized market segments, each narrowly defined by the segment's unique operating requirements. The largest potential market segment is for distributed generation technology with operational and economical characteristics suitable for peak shaving. Unbundling of utility costs and prices will make base-load and intermediate load equipment, such as fuel cells, significantly less attractive in the largest market segments unless capital costs fall substantially below $ 1, 000 per kilowatt. ...|$|E

They bring with them multiple challenges that impact {{on the quality of}} justice that they, as well as other parties, obtain. They have substantial impact on court management, and potentially on judicial impartiality. The provision of unbundled legal services, where the lawyer provides limited legal support for parts of the case, is one proposed solution to these impacts. The US, UK, and Canada have all introduced detailed procedures that enable lawyers to provide flexible legal services for self-represented litigants (SRLs). Recognising the considerable risks arising out of limited services, these procedures focus on client care, quality of service, and risk management. This article examines the challenge of SRLs, and the policy initiatives that have been addressed in other international jurisdictions.

40|$|Twenty years ago, the Alaska Bar Association adopted Ethics Opinion No. 93 - 1 which {{permitted}} {{attorneys to}} 2 ̆ 2 ghostwrite 2 ̆ 2 pleadings and provide other undisclosed services to pro se litigants. The {{goal of this}} ethical guidance was to enable attorneys to assist low-income individuals who could not otherwise afford representation. Ethics Opinion No. 93 - 1 construed 2 ̆ 2 ghostwriting 2 ̆ 2 broadly as an attorney 2 ̆ 7 s undisclosed assistance to a pro se client whether by providing legal advice or drafting pleadings or other documents. This Note argues that, despite the moral allure of its theoretical justifications, ghostwriting is unnecessary, provides little demonstrable benefit to pro se litigants, and potentially conceals the unethical practice of law.

40|$|The {{restructuring}} of retail gas services has followed a typical pattern for previously heavily regulated industries: large customers are initially given rights to purchase <b>unbundled</b> <b>services</b> from different entities, {{with the same}} rights dispersed over time to smaller customers. For about ten years now industrial customers in most states {{have been able to}} {open_quotes}play the market{close_quotes}. Since the passage of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 636 in 1992, interest has centered on expanding service unbundling to small retail customers, including residential customers. Importantly, the Order prohibited pipelines from providing bundled sales service. This is not surprising - in the telecommunications industry, for example, the unbundling of wholesale services was a strong stimulant for developing competition in the local exchange market. The push for small-customer service unbundling has derived from the basic but politically attractive idea that all retail customers should directly benefit from competitive forces in the natural gas industry. When one looks at the movement of prices since 1985, {{it is easy to see}} that large retail customers have enjoyed more favorable prices than other retail customers. For example, over the period 1985 to 1994 gas prices to industrial customers and electric utilities fell around 23 percent and 36 percent, respectively. In comparison, gas prices to residential customers increased by around 5 percent while gas prices to commercial customers decreased slightly by about 1 percent.

40|$|As {{private firms}} become {{increasingly}} {{involved in the}} development of key infrastructure, redefining the role of government from that of serviceprovider to regulator presents both challenges and opportunities. The factors that give rise to sector reforms color how much policymakers invest in regulatory design during the reform process. Nevertheless, two factors are essential to sustainable sector and regulatory reform. First, the right structure must be established for the industry concerned, a structure that allows competition appropriate for that industry. Second, the objectives of regulation must be well defined, with a clear distinction between policymaking, policy implementation, and operations. The extent to which competition can be harnessed to help make regulation efficient, effective, and sustainable depends on the intrinsic technical characteristics of the sector. Each decision affects the sustainability of the regulatory regime {{in the face of the}} threat of regulatory capture (both political and commercial). Careful regulatory design is crucial not only for successful sectoral reform but also to balance the interests of various actors (government, consumers, developers, investors, and financiers). One model that has been relatively successful combines new entry, <b>unbundled</b> <b>services,</b> and the unambiguous spelling out of the legal rights and duties for both public and private service providers, administered by an autonomous regulatory authority. Problems with regulation often result as much from inadequate attention to sector structure and fostering competition as from weaknesses in the regulatory authority's institutional capacity. As for the tools of regulation, despite differences in some details between licenses and concessions (and their many contractual variations), these are basically instruments that establish the rights and obligations of contracting parties. Choices about where these rights and obligations are located in the legal hierarchy are shaped by a country's institutional capacity and legal traditions. But the existence of instruments to establish those rights and obligations does not eliminate the need for institutionsto administer them, and thus carry out the regulatory function. Establishing effective sectorwide regulation can be difficult in a developing country, but it is necessary. Policymakers will be able to create effective regulatory regimes where adequate attention is given to sector structure, competition, and institution-building.

40|$|Network {{activities}} typically involve collecting a good {{or service}} (such as electric utilities, phone services, and rail transportation) from many producers or distributing them to many users. Producers and users are often widely scattered, geographically. Close financial integration of networks is justified {{on the basis of}} economies of scope and scale and the benefits from pooling and coordinating. In many countries, network operators are completely integrated publicly-owned firms (private firms being deemed insufficiently efficient or equitable). Challengers of this practice contend that the inefficiency resulting from lack of competition outweighs the gain from economic integration. With reform, some competitive mechanisms can be introduced even when monopoly seems the best option for delivering a service. But conflicts between policymakers'objectives -including efficiency, equity, speed, speed of reform, and signaling- influence the design of concession contracts for infrastructure network services (including communications and transportation services). Competition begins with the unbundling of various stages of delivery. Then competitive bidding is popular, with the public authority keeping property rights on productive assets but conceding their operation to a private firm. The winner gets the right to maximize profits, within limits (having to provide universal services, for example, and avoid price discrimination). In liberalizing the delivery of a service, policymakers must consider not only efficiency but also social and fiscal feasibility. The authors discuss how relevant information asymmetry is in contract design and the award and regulatory processes. They also discuss how to design pricing to accommodate the obligation to provide universal service. To illustrate, they describe Argentina's experiment in liberalization, which is increasingly viewed as a model for changing private sector and government involvement in infrastructure services. Beginning in 1989, Argentina began privatizing utilities and transport services, because the government had decided that it could no longer afford to subsidize those services or finance the investments needed for their effective operation. To introduce competition, the government <b>unbundled</b> <b>services</b> and introduced competitive bidding. It also created sector-specific regulatory agencies to protect consumers from private monopolies and to protect the private concessionaires from government micromanagement. Making concession-based reform and contracted-based regulation of private monopolists sustainable will require strengthening regulatory agencies, clarifying their terms of reference and accountability, and better separating the responsibilities of sector ministers and regulators.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a longstanding puzzle involving the <b>unbundling</b> of <b>services</b> {{that has occurred}} over {{more than two decades}} in the U. S. advertising agency industry: How can the shift from the bundling to the <b>unbundling</b> of <b>services</b> be explained and what accounts for the slow pace of change? Using a cost-based theoretical framework of bundling due to Evans and Salinger (2005, 2008), we develop a simple model of an advertising agency’s decision to <b>unbundle</b> its <b>services</b> as a tradeoff between the fixed cost to the advertiser of establishing and maintaining a relationship with an advertising agency and pecuniary economies of scale available in providing media services. The results from an econometric analysis of cross-sectional and pooled data collected by the U. S. Census Bureau for quinquenial censuses conducted between 1982 and 2002 support the key predictions of the model. We find that advertising agency establishments are more likely to unbundle if they are large and diversified in their service offerings and are less likely to do so with increasing age and greater geographical scope. We also find a strong trend toward unbundling over time, a result that is partially explained by increases in media prices over time. ...|$|R
40|$|Limited scope {{attorneys}} {{specializing in}} alternative dispute resolution (2 ̆ 2 ADR 2 ̆ 2) procedures could help clients like these {{achieve their goals}} and resolve their disputes in a timely manner. If more attorneys would consider providing these types of limited services, additional clients (i. e. people considered 2 ̆ 2 nobody 2 ̆ 7 s clients 2 ̆ 2 now) could be served {{in the way that}} matters most to them. This Article suggests a new model for attorney representation based on the combined use of limited scope representation and ADR processes to give otherwise unrepresented parties greater access to justice. Although none of these three concepts (i. e., access to justice, <b>unbundled</b> <b>services,</b> and ADR) are new, tying them together in this manner has yet to be considered in the scholarly literature. In addition to providing new resources for clients, attorneys could expand their practices, gain additional clients, and increase their revenue, all while helping represent the otherwise unrepresentable. As discussed in more detail below, these ideas could also alleviate the court systems as well as provide additional avenues for law schools and legal aid providers to provide services. Limited scope representation is well within the bounds of the ethical practice of law. The Model Rules of Professional Conduct have long allowed attorneys and clients to limit the scope of the representation. Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1. 2 (c) provides: 2 ̆ 2 (c) A lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives informed consent. 2 ̆ 2 A concise definition of 2 ̆ 2 limited scope representation 2 ̆ 2 is hiring an attorney to perform a 2 ̆ 2 discrete task 2 ̆ 2 and nothing else. Recently, the ABA endorsed limited-scope representation, or 2 ̆ 2 unbundling, 2 ̆ 2 in a Resolution, encouraging more attorneys to engage in this practice. 2 ̆ 2 Prior to this Article, most clients, attorneys, and scholars considered those 2 ̆ 2 discrete tasks 2 ̆ 2 to be litigation tasks, such as document drafting and hearing appearances. This Article shows how that type of thinking is short-sighted (perhaps even misguided) and should be broadened to better serve clients and client interests. Part II of this Article considers the inefficiencies present in the area of pro se representations, and the benefits of working with counsel, even on a limited basis. Part III of this Article discusses just how the themes of ADR, limited scope representation, and access to justice can be woven together as a new way to practice law. Part IV presents concrete examples of the types of representation services that could be offered on a limited scope basis. Part V discusses the policy reasons supporting and challenging this proposal in the views of the many different stakeholders at issue, including potential clients, attorneys, courts, and pro bono service providers, including law college clinics. Finally, Part VI concludes by tying together the ideas of limited scope representation, alternative dispute resolution and access to justice. This Article suggests that courts, lawyers, and law schools begin to offer these services more regularly, ultimately creating additional consumer awareness on the part of potential clients. The ultimate goal is to provide more services to those who cannot otherwise afford them, to increase attorney revenue, and to reduce court congestion all at the same time...|$|E
