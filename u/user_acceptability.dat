40|$|International audienceAt the Pervasive Computing area, {{end users}} expect {{to receive a}} {{multimedia}} service with an acceptable quality, anytime, and anywhere. Measuring this acceptability is usually referred to Quality of Experience (QoE). Unlike Quality of Service (QoS) which focuses on allocating expected systems and network resources, QoE is concerned with optimizing the perceived quality of a service by end-users. The appraisal of the <b>user's</b> <b>acceptability</b> thresholds is a key factor for service providers to perform adaptation decisions on their products (VoD, IPTV, online games, etc). While QoE is individualized, no study has yet examined to what extent. In this paper, we report an empirical study to understand if QoE should be managed globally, per cluster of users, or personally.

50|$|Sound masking must be {{acceptable}} to the listener. Masking that is truly background is most acceptable see below). Incorporating advanced functions, noted above, improves <b>user</b> <b>acceptability.</b> Masking should accomplish the privacy goal by having acceptable levels. This is a more difficult factor as the system installer seldom has control over the other two factors that determine privacy. Information exchange between team members during design helps to improve acceptability. Realistic privacy goals are critical. When the other privacy factors cannot be combined with reasonable levels of sound masking to achieve the desired privacy, the privacy goal must be changed.|$|E
30|$|As mentioned, a {{practical}} concern of voice-tag technology is <b>user</b> <b>acceptability.</b> Extending recognition coverage from dozens {{to hundreds of}} entries without maintaining or improving recognition and user convenience is not a viable approach. <b>User</b> <b>acceptability</b> mandates {{that the number of}} sample utterances required to create a voice-tag during enrollment be minimal, with one sample utterance being most favorable. However, in a speech recognition application with a large number of voice-tags, the recognition accuracy of each voice-tag tends to increase as its number of associated sample utterances increases. So, in order to achieve acceptable performance, more than one sample utterance is typically required during enrollment. Generally, a compromise of two to three sample utterances is usually considered acceptable.|$|E

40|$|<b>User</b> <b>acceptability</b> {{has become}} a {{critical}} issue for the successful implementation of transport pricing measures and policies. Although several studies have addressed the public acceptability of road pricing, little evidence can be found {{of the effects of}} pricing strategies. The acceptability of alternative schemes for a toll network already in operation is an issue to be tackled. This paper contributes to the limited literature in this field by exploring perceptions toward road-pricing schemes among toll road users. On the basis of a nationwide survey of toll road users in Spain, the study developed several binomial logit models to analyze <b>user</b> <b>acceptability</b> of three approaches: express toll lanes, a time-based pricing approach, and a flat fee (vignette) system. The results show notable differences in <b>user</b> <b>acceptability</b> by the type of charging scheme proposed. Express toll lanes were more acceptable by travelers who perceived greater benefits from saving travel time. The acceptability of time-based approaches (peak versus off-peak) decreased for users who felt forced to use the toll road, whereas this was not an aspect that significantly influenced users’ support for flat fee schemes. In addition, a flat fee strategy was more acceptable for long-distance trips and truck drivers who regularly used the toll facilities. The results from this analysis can inform policy makers and planners for the promotion of more efficient, socially inclusive, and publicly acceptable road-pricing schemes...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{sanitation}} policy and development has undergone a paradigm shift away from heavily-subsidized, supply-driven approaches towards behavioral-based demand-driven approaches. These current approaches to increase sanitation demand are multi-faceted, requiring multiple stakeholders {{with varying degrees of}} interest, knowledge, and capacity. Although efforts exist to increase sanitation access by incorporating engineering design principles with implementation planning approaches, these groups generally work independently without strong connections, thus reducing the potential of their impact. As a result, the design of appropriate sanitation technology is disengaged from the implementation of acceptable technology into communities, disconnecting user preference integration from sanitation technology design and resulting in fewer sanitation technologies being adopted and used. To address these challenges in developing successful interventions, this research examined how user preferences for specific attributes of appropriate sanitation technologies and their respective implementation arrangements influence their adoption and usage. Data for the study included interviews of 1002 sanitation users living in a peri-urban area of South Africa; the surveyed respondents were asked about their existing sanitation technology, their preferences for various sanitation technology design attributes, as well as their perspectives on current and preferred sanitation implementation arrangements. The data revealed that <b>user</b> <b>acceptability</b> of appropriate sanitation technology is influenced by the adoption classification of the users. Through the identification of motives and barriers to sanitation usage that were statistically significant, it exhibited the need to differentiate users who share private sanitation from those use communal sanitation facilities. Results also indicated that <b>user</b> <b>acceptability</b> of appropriate sanitation systems is dependent on the technical design attributes of sanitation. The development of utility functions detailed the significance of seven technical design attributes and determined their respective priorities. An agent-based simulation examined how user preferences for sanitation technology design and implementation influence its adoption and usage. Findings suggest that <b>user</b> <b>acceptability</b> of sanitation technology is dependent on both the technology design and the implementation arrangement being preferred. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|International audienceService <b>acceptability</b> {{rate and}} <b>user</b> {{satisfaction}} are becoming key factors to avoid client churn {{and secure the}} success of any Software as a Service (SaaS) provider. Nevertheless, the provider must also accommodate fluctuating workloads and minimize the cost it pays to rent resources from the cloud. To address these contradicting concerns, most of existing works carry out resource management unilaterally by the provider. Consequently, end-user preferences and her subjective acceptability of the service are mostly ignored. In order to assess user satisfaction and service acceptability recent studies in the domain of Quality of Experience (QoE) recommend providers to use quantiles and percentile to gauge <b>user</b> service <b>acceptability</b> precisely. In this article we propose an elastic, load-spike proof, and adaptive one-to-many negotiation mechanism to improve the service acceptability of an open SaaS provider.

Today, a number of electronic prescribing applications (EPAs) are available on mobile and web platforms but <b>user</b> <b>acceptability</b> and satisfaction of the platform to access such applications is highly imperative to realizing the primary objective of automating the prescription service. In this paper, the end-user’s most preferred platform for accessing EPAs developed for web and mobile platforms is investigated.
