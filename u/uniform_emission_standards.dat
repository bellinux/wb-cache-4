I then empirically examine these issues using evidence from a particulate permits market in Santiago, Chile...|$|E

In this paper, we theoretically examine the relationships among the stringency of effluent limits imposed on individual polluting facilities, environmental protection agencies’ monitoring decisions, and the ambient quality of the local environment. We then extend the theoretical analysis by exploring the establishment of effluent limits when (1) the national <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> represents only an upper bound on the local issuance of limits and (2) negotiation efforts expended by both regulated polluting facilities and environmentally concerned citizens play a role. We find that the negotiated discharge limit depends on the political weight enjoyed and the negotiation effort costs faced by both citizens and the regulated facility, along with the stringency of the national standard and local ambient quality conditions...|$|R
40|$|Emissions trading {{programs}} have been recommended by economists and implemented by policy makers because {{they are expected to}} keep compliance costs low; but, studies on actual savings are limited. This paper is the first to conduct a comprehensive ex post analysis of the cost savings from the Acid Rain Program (ARP), the largest emissions trading program to be implemented in the U. S. In Chapter 2, I provide a brief overview of the Acid Rain Program. I then discuss other policies that are relevant to evaluating the ARP including the New Source Performance <b>Standard</b> and local <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> I conclude the chapter by analyzing the determinants of local <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> and arguing that it is safe to treat these standards as exogenous. In Chapter 3 I illustrate the cost savings from a cap-and-trade system such as the ARP, and discuss factors affecting the potential gains from trade and the determinants. I then estimate a discrete choice model of coal procurement and scrubber installation to recover structural parameters of compliance cost functions at the generating unit level. Using the model I predict compliance choices under a <b>uniform</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> that yields the same aggregate emissions as the ARP. In Chapter 4, I estimate cost savings under the ARP to be about 265 - 380 million (1995 USD) per year. The numbers are much smaller than in previous literature (Carlson et al., 2000; Ellerman et al., 2000). I propose that lower transport costs reduced cost heterogeneity across generating units, and that improvements in scrubbing technology and state policies may have also contributed to a decrease in cost savings...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Flexible {{instruments}} are preferred over {{command and control}} to regulate environmental problems since they allow sources to reduce the costs of compliance. Usually, flexibility is synonym to market based incentives (MBI’s) : tradeable permits or emission fees. However, when regulating many different facilities that emit a toxic substance, each impacting different localities, flexibility-and consequently cost reductions- can be obtained through <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> Additionally if risks are imposed through other media, risk management can be an interesting policy instrument. In this context, where MBI’s are not applicable, these instruments can be more cost effective than an ambient standard or technology imposition. Just how much is gained through increased flexibility depends on the specific conditions of the problem. Chile has serious problems with arsenic concentrations associated to emissions from its seven copper smelters, located {{in different parts of}} the country. In one locality-where one of the most polluting facilities is located- arsenic intake from water is an important health hazard. To regulate airborne emissions, an ambient concentration standard, applicable to the whole country, is being proposed. However, the costs of inefficient regulation, resulting from inflexible policies or not considering risk management among media, can be very high. In this context, this paper evaluates the risks and costs of four alternative policy instruments-uniform quality <b>standard,</b> flexible <b>emission</b> <b>standard,</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> and risk management- to determine (i) the costs of compliance under each policy; and (ii) propose a cost-effective policy for regulating arsenic in Chile. The results are based on information generated by a three year project that included the participation of the affected facilities. Very significant differences among each policy instrument are obtained, consequently the results of this research will allow regulators to incorporate key information for the development of an arsenic regulation appropriate for Chile...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{feasibility}} study on the sustainable reduction of CO 2 emissions as well as particle and NO 2 emissions by using LNG (liquefied methane and bio methane) for the Danube inland navigation. The study serves as preliminary planning for an experimental development project for a retrofit solution, contributing to short-and medium-term achievement of the Austrian climate targets. The transportation by barge in comparison to other kinds of transport shows considerably specific lower energy requirements. Additional benefits are shown concerning the noise impact of residents near traffic roads {{as well as a}} discharge of the road system. However, CO 2 emissions resulted of diesel combustion could be reduced significantly by using low-carbon fuels such as methane and bio methane once again. Due to the high age of marine propulsion systems up to 30 years, these ones show nowadays unusual high local emissions of particulate matters (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOX). For this reason a trend towards climate and environmentally friendly drive systems applied the inland waterway transportation sector can be simply recognized conditionally. In 2005 <b>uniform</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for all member states of the EU regarding new barges were introduced. The specific emission limits contained therein do not conform to the standard, which is applied to comparable categories of engines for other modes. By use of "clean fuels", a sustainable reduction of climate-altering emissions as well as local emissions directly harmful to humans and the nature could be achieved especially in environmentally sensitive areas such as the Austrian Danube valley...|$|E

40|$|In the USA, each {{individual}} vehicle {{is required to}} meet <b>uniform</b> per-mile <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> The <b>uniform</b> standard system does not allow vehicle manufacturers flexibility in achieving overall emission reduction goals for motor vehicles. The system provides manufacturers {{with little or no}} incentive to control vehicle emissions beyond what is required. In this paper, an incentive-based marketable permit system is proposed to replace the uniform standard system. Under the marketable permit system, vehicle manufacturers are required to meet corporate average emission standards; they are allowed to buy or sell vehicle emission reduction credits among themselves to meet corporate average standards; and they are allowed to bank vehicle emission reduction credits that are accumulated in earlier years and to use the credits for meeting average standards in later years. It is estimated in this study that relative to the current uniform standard system, the marketable permit system can reduce vehicle emission control costs by $ 150 to $ 400 million per year in California, or 13 - 30 % of the costs currently spent on vehicle emission control. ...|$|R
40|$|Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) {{established}} {{a market for}} transferable sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emission allowances among electric utilities. This market offers firms facing high marginal abatement costs the opportunity to purchase the right to emit SO 2 from firms with lower costs, {{and is expected to}} yield cost savings compared to a command and control approach to environmental regulation. This paper uses econometrically estimated marginal abatement cost functions for power plants affected by Title IV of the CAAA to evaluate the performance of the SO 2 allowance market. Specifically, we investigate whether the much-heralded fall in the cost of abating SO 2, compared to original estimates, can be attributed to allowance trading. We demonstrate that, for plants using low-sulfur coal to reduce SO 2 emissions, technical changes and the fall in low-sulfur coal prices have lowered marginal abatement cost curves by over 50 % since 1985. The flexibility to take advantage of these changes is the main source of cost reductions, rather than trading per se. In the long run, allowance trading may achieve cost savings of $ 700 -$ 800 million per year compared to an "enlightened" command and control program characterized by a <b>uniform</b> <b>emission</b> rate <b>standard.</b> The cost savings would be twice as great if the alternative to trading were forced scrubbing. However, a comparison of potential cost savings in 1995 and 1996 with actual emissions costs suggests that most trading gains were unrealized {{in the first two years}} of the program. ...|$|R

40|$|In its waning days, the Clinton {{administration}} {{decided that}} it was appropriate to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, but left the specifics of that task to the incoming Bush administration. The Bush administration considered two approaches for regulating mercury emissions from power plants. The first was to establish <b>uniform</b> <b>emission</b> rates across existing utilities, and more restrictive emission rates for new utilities. The second was to establish less restrictive <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for new and existing sources, and to also establish a cap on mercury emissions while allowing emissions trading {{in order to reduce the}} cost of achieving the goal. This paper makes two contributions. First, we summarize the costs and benefits of controlling mercury emissions from power plants under the two approaches. We find that, for both approaches, the benefits of the mercury regulation are likely to fall far short of the cost. However, the emissions trading proposal is roughly $ 15 billion less expensive than the command-and-control proposal. Second, we examine the role of politics and economics in the determination of environmental policy. ...|$|R
