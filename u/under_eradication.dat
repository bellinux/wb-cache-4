40|$|US {{agricultural}} and companion animals are very {{vulnerable to the}} introduction of exotic and emerging animal diseases (EEAD). These diseases could occur through unintentional introduction (the risk of outbreaks grows as free trade increases), could occur through the deliberate introduction of disease agents (bio-terrorism or agro-terrorism), or could emerge as new diseases. EEAD, {{for the purpose of this}} course, are defined as those animal diseases that are reportable in the US. This includes diseases on the Office international des épizooties (OIE) List A, selected diseases on List B that either are not found in the US or are reportable, and selected emerging diseases. Some of the exotic and emerging diseases are considered to be foreign animal diseases because they do not occur in the US. Others are found in the US but are <b>under</b> <b>eradication</b> programs. Some are zoonotic and must be monitored and controlled to protect human health. Many of these diseases are important causes of animal suffering and are economically very important.

40|$|The {{boll weevil}} (Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman) is {{currently}} <b>under</b> <b>eradication</b> in the U. S. The eradication program is implemented {{by means of}} area-wide applications of malathion ULV. Frequent applications of this insecticide result in high mortality of many beneficial insects, and {{a greater risk of}} secondary pest outbreaks. Notable among the latter are the outbreaks of beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua H?bner) and cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in 1995. The present study (i) compared densities of beneficial and pest insect and spider populations between cotton fields in eradication and non-eradication areas; (ii) evaluated the use of beneficial cotton arthropod population densities as indicators of pest damage risks from cotton aphid, beet armyworm, bollworm (Helicoverpa zea Boddie), and other worms (Estigmene acrea Drury, Pseudoplusia includens Walker, and Trichoplusia ni H?bner); and (iii) evaluated the effects of malathion ULV on the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) a key arthropod predator in cotton agroecosystems. Studies were conducted in central Texas, in the vicinities of College Station and Dallas, during 2002 and 2003. Results showed that a majority of cotton predators were negatively impacted by malathion ULV applications. However, convergent lady beetle (Hippodamia convergens Gu?rin-M?neville) densities were greater in active eradication fields than inactive fields. Stepwise regression analyses identified densities of lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens) larvae and lady beetle larvae (H. convergens, Coleomegilla maculata De Geer, Harmonia axyridis Pallas, and Coccinella septempunctata L.) as predictors of cotton aphid density, and density of total spiders as predictors of bollworm density. Predictors of beet armyworm or other worm densities could not be determined. This study demonstrated malathion ULV was highly toxic to fire ants, and could repel ants from treated surfaces. Malathion ULV reduced the number of foraging fire ants in the cotton canopy for three weeks and reduced fire ant predation of beet armyworm eggs. Predictors of secondary pest densities have been suggested which, if utilized, may help to prevent the occurrence of secondary pest outbreaks under boll weevil eradication. Validation of these predictors should be preformed before implementing them into an eradication program...|$|E

The invasion growth function is non-convex and control costs depend on the invasion size, resulting in a non-classical dynamic optimization problem. We characterize the long run dynamic behavior of an optimally controlled invasion and the corresponding implications for public policy.

50|$|Coffee, another {{principal}} cash crop, was {{the second}} most important agricultural export after timber. As the primary substitute crop offered to coca growers <b>under</b> the <b>eradication</b> program, coffee was of particular importance. Coffee production reached 13,000 tons in 1988, nearly double the 1987 output, which was damaged by disease in western Bolivia. Over 20,000 hectares were devoted to coffee and Bolivia consumed 25 percent of its coffee crop locally in 1988, with the balance exported both legally and clandestinely. Legal exports of 102,000 bags, sixty kilograms each as measured by the International Coffee Organization (ICO), were equivalent to Bolivia's export quota for 1988, which was over US$15 million. An ICO member since 1968, Bolivia was permitted to export 170,000 of the sixty-kilogram bags in 1989. Approximately 25 percent of coffee exports left the country illegally in the late 1980s. Most coffee was grown by small farmers in the valleys or by large farmers in the lowlands. Most commercial farmers were members of the Bolivian Coffee Committee (Comité Boliviano del Café—Cobolca), which allocated ICO quotas. The coffee industry also received technical assistance from the Bolivian Institute of Coffee (Instituto Boliviano de Café), an autonomous government agency established in 1965 to run model farms and help control disease.|$|R
40|$|Eradication of Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{has been}} variably {{associated with a}} platelet response in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Responses occur in approximately half of ITP patients infected with this bacterium, more frequently in Japan and Italy than in other countries. For those with severe ITP (platelet count < 30 × 109 /L) and a long duration of disease, eradication therapy seems to be less effec-tive. Despite extensive efforts, distinctive clinical features and factors predicting the response to eradication therapy have not been consistently identified. There is no established mechanism to explain how H pylori could be implicated in the pathogenesis of an immune-mediated platelet destruction. Several theories have been proposed to explain the platelet response to anti–H pylori therapy, including molecular mimicry, platelet aggregation, and the induction of a Th 1 phenotype that favors the onset and/or persis-tence of ITP. The role of bacterium-related factors, such as the CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) protein, are still <b>under</b> investigation. <b>Eradication</b> therapy is simple and inexpensive, with limited toxicity and the advantage of avoiding long-term immunosuppressive treatment for those who respond. Although the evidence and follow-up are limited, it appears reasonable to routinely screen patients with ITP for H pylori, particularly in those populations with a high background prevalence of H pylori infection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Citrus canker was {{established}} in Florida in the 1990 s. The disease causes losses of yield and closure of some export markets. The U. S. government introduced an eradication policy in which growers are required to remove infected trees and receive compensation payments for doing so. Recent hurricanes have spread the disease and re-established it. This chapter examines the economic impacts of citrus canker in oranges and the eradication policy in Florida, {{taking into account the}} relationship between costs and benefits of eradication and the spatial and dynamic aspects of infestation. We evaluate both the costs of the disease and the benefits from eradication. In this evaluation we consider the implications of a future hurricane, which spreads citrus canker, for the decision about whether to adopt a strategy of eradicating initially, or after the hurricane, or both. We find that producers as a group benefit from both the disease and the eradication program, but at the expense of taxpayers, consumers and the nation as a whole. Producers benefit at the expense of consumers because both the disease and the policy to eradicate it reduce supply and drive up the price and the gross value of production. Producers also benefit at the expense of taxpayers, who pay to compensate them for their losses for having to remove trees <b>under</b> the <b>eradication</b> policy...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To provide recent {{guidelines}} {{to reduce the}} incidence of diarrheal diseases. We discuss the definition, clinical aspects, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention of persistent diarrhea. Sources: Electronic search of the MEDLINE database, Google search.

Temperatures inside tobacco cases approximated the 7 -day moving averages of outside temperatures but were about 1 °C higher. To disinfest the larvae living inside, tobacco cases should be exposed to outside temperatures lower than 6 °C for 7 to 8 weeks and 5 °C for 3 to 4 weeks. Near the critical conditions, larger diurnal temperature ranges resulted in higher winter survival rates.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{potential}} benefits of coordinating infectious disease eradication programs that use campaigns such as supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) should not be over-looked. One example of a coordinated approach is an adaptive "sequential strategy": first, all annual SIA budget {{is dedicated to the}} eradication of a single infectious disease; once that disease is eradicated, the annual SIA budget is re-focussed on eradicating a second disease, etc. Herd immunity suggests that a sequential strategy may eradicate several infectious diseases faster than a non-adaptive "simultaneous strategy" of dividing annual budget equally among eradication programs for those diseases. However, mathematical modeling is required to understand the potential extent of this effect. Methods Our objective was to illustrate how budget allocation strategies can interact with the nonlinear nature of disease transmission to determine time to eradication of several infectious diseases under different budget allocation strategies. Using a mathematical transmission model, we analyzed three hypothetical vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in three different countries. A central decision-maker can distribute funding among SIA programs for these three diseases according to either a sequential strategy or a simultaneous strategy. We explored the time to <b>eradication</b> <b>under</b> these two strategies under a range of scenarios. Results For a certain range of annual budgets, all three diseases can be eradicated relatively quickly under the sequential strategy, whereas <b>eradication</b> never occurs <b>under</b> the simultaneous strategy. However, moderate changes to total SIA budget, SIA frequency, order of eradication, or funding disruptions can create disproportionately large differences in the time and budget required for <b>eradication</b> <b>under</b> the sequential strategy. We find that the predicted time to eradication can be very sensitive to small differences in the rate of case importation between the countries. We also find that the time to eradication of all three diseases is not necessarily lowest when the least transmissible disease is targeted first. Conclusions Relatively modest differences in budget allocation strategies in the near-term can result in surprisingly large long-term differences in time required to eradicate, {{as a result of the}} amplifying effects of herd immunity and the nonlinearities of disease transmission. More sophisticated versions of such models may be useful to large international donors or other organizations as a planning or portfolio optimization tool, where choices must be made regarding how much funding to dedicate to different infectious disease eradication efforts. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean forest {{regions of}} Australia {{predominantly}} comprise native mallee scrub, eucalypt woodlands, exotic Pinus plantations, and commercial eucalypt plantations. Native forests have, so far, remained largely free of invasive exotic insects. The exotic pines, however, have five well-established and significant invasive pest insects: the bark beetles Ips grandicollis, Hylastes ater, and Hylurgus ligniperda (Coleoptera: Curculiondae), Monterey pine aphid, Essigella californica (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and Sirex woodwasp, Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae), {{with the latter}} not yet present in Western Australia (WA). The exotic giant pine scale, Marchalina hellenica (Hemiptera: Margarodidae), was recently detected on pines in Adelaide and Melbourne and is <b>under</b> an <b>eradication</b> program. Many of the established pest species have had classical biological control programs implemented. European house borer, Hylotrupes bajulus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a pest of untreated softwood, is established in areas around Perth, WA, and {{has been found in}} dead and live trees, as well as untreated timber. African black beetle, Heteronychus arator (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a major exotic agricultural and forestry pest in wetter parts of the Mediterranean forest regions in WA, where it was first recorded in 1938. Several other exotic polyphagous horticultural pests are occasionally associated with eucalypts. Australia is the origin of major insect pests on Eucalyptus species grown in Mediterranean regions across the globe. However, populations of these insects are generally effectively controlled by native species of natural enemies in Australia. At least five species endemic to eastern Australia, Gonipterus platensis and G. sp. nov. 2, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Paropsisterna m-fuscum (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Phylacteophaga froggatti (Hymenoptera: Pergidae) and Cardiapsina fiscella (Hempitera: Psyllidae), have been introduced to Mediterranean regions of WA, where they initially caused extensive and severe damage to plantations of introduced eucalypt species (predominantly E. globulus) in the region.

40|$|Not {{long after}} the {{introduction}} of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) and the subsequent dramatic decreases in AIDS death rates, clinicians and patients alike became very interested in stopping HIV therapy. Once the notion of viral <b>eradication</b> <b>under</b> HAART was deemed impossible and the specter of viral drug resistance to potent HIV therapy was confirmed, our therapeutic paradigm for HAART changed. We realized that, depending on a patient’s disease status, HIV drugs may be less like the lifelong, uninterrupted therapy we were first told about and more like a precious resource that must be used wisely to attain maximum benefit. Unfortunately, drug toxicities complicated the HIV therapy equation even more. Consequently, a veritable explosion of treatment interruption research studies ensued. Reasons behind studying treatment interruptions have varied from “autovaccination ” (the hypothesis that alternately start-ing and stopping HAART might enhance immune responses to HIV) to minimizing drug toxicities and side effects.

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis is {{responsible}} for clinically important chronic inflammatory diseases of humans, including trachoma and pelvic inflammatory disease. Persistent infection of mucosal sites {{may contribute to the}} development of these chronic inflammatory diseases. Standard clinical therapy results in satisfactory cure rates of acute infections; however, chronic infection associated with persistence has been suggested to be less responsive to antibiotic therapy. We report the efficiency of two first-line chlamydial antibiotics, azithromycin and doxycycline, <b>under</b> conditions of <b>eradication</b> of C. trachomatis persistent infection using the in vitro model of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) -mediated persistence and reactivation from persistence. Doxycycline was superior in eradicating acute (minimal bactericidal concentration [MBC] 100 = 2. 5 to 5. 0 μg/ml) compared to persistent (MBC 100 = 10 to 50 μg/ml) infection. In contrast, azithromycin was significantly more effective in eradicating persistent infection (MBC 100 = 2. 5 to 5. 0 μg/ml) than acute infection (MBC 100 = 10 to 50 μg/ml). The superior bactericidal effect of azithromycin against persistent infection was found to correlate with the enhanced uptake of the drug by IFN-γ-treated infected epithelial cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that azithromycin should be a particularly efficacious anti-infective agent for the eradication of IFN-γ-induced chlamydial persistent infection in vivo...|$|R

40|$|The {{approach}} {{to the treatment of}} Helicobacter pylori infection has changed during the last years. In fact, during the last decade, the success rate of usual eradication regimens, based on a proton pump inhibitor plus clarithromycin associated with amoxicillin or metronidazole, declined from over 90 % to about 80 %, a critical threshold <b>under</b> which the <b>eradication</b> rate is considered unsatisfactory, according to current guidelines. This finding is mainly due to the raising prevalence of clarithromycin resistance, which is in turn linked to the widespread use of this antibiotic for respiratory tract infections. Therefore, obtaining a personal history negative for a previous use of macrolides is now mandatory, before administering clarithromycin-based antibiotic therapy. Should history data be uncertain, local resistance rates (if available) may be considered, with levels higher than 20 % precluding the use of clarithromycin. In this case, alternative antibiotic combinations, previously used in the rare instances of failure of clarithromycin-based therapy, should be used. We examined also the possible additional beneficial effect of some novel non antibiotic agents such as lactoferrin, probiotics and natural substances. Other advances in the treatment of the infection are represented by the discovery that some extragastric disorders such as unexplained iron deficiency anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, may be causally linked to Helicobacter pylori, and that eradication therapy may lead to their regression in many cases. Finally, some "gray areas" (nonulcer dyspepsia, concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) which are the subject of debate as far the indication to treatment is concerned, have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Self-replicating gene drives {{that can}} spread {{deleterious}} alleles through animal populations have been promoted as a much needed but controversial 'silver bullet' for controlling invasive alien species. Homing-based drives comprise an endonuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA) that are replicated during meiosis via homologous recombination. However, their efficacy for controlling wild populations {{is threatened by}} inherent polymorphic resistance {{and the creation of}} resistance alleles via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) -mediated DNA repair. We used stochastic individual-based models to identify realistic gene-drive strategies capable of eradicating vertebrate pest populations (mice, rats and rabbits) on islands. One popular strategy, a sex-reversing drive that converts heterozygous females into sterile males, failed to spread and required the ongoing deployment of gene-drive carriers to achieve <b>eradication.</b> <b>Under</b> alternative strategies, multiplexed gRNAs could overcome inherent polymorphic resistance and were required for eradication success even when the probability of NHEJ was low. Strategies causing homozygotic embryonic non-viability or homozygotic female sterility produced high probabilities of eradication and were robust to NHEJ-mediated deletion of the DNA sequence between multiplexed endonuclease recognition sites. The latter two strategies also purged the gene drive when eradication failed, therefore posing lower long-term risk should animals escape beyond target islands. Multiplexing gRNAs will be necessary if this technology is to be useful for insular extirpation attempts; however, precise knowledge of homing rates will be required to design low-risk gene drives with high probabilities of eradication success.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{factors that}} may influence {{the success or failure}} of powerful antiretroviral regimens to eradicate HIV- 1 or to maintain viral loads at low levels. Methods: A mathematical model is constructed that tracks the dynamics of CD 4 + T cells, a population of cells that remains long-lived when productively infected by HIV- 1, and two viral strains (wild-type and drug-resistant mutant), under a combination regimen of reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. A mathematical analysis of the long-term (steady-state) and short-term (transient) behavior of the model is undertaken, and various scenarios are illustrated. Results: The transient behavior of the cells and virus and the eventual eradication of the virus are dictated by two factors: the strength of the combination therapy and the maximum achievable increase in the uninfected CD 4 + T cell concentration. A simple formula is given which suggests <b>under</b> what conditions <b>eradication</b> might occur. Conclusions: For eradication to occur, therapy needs to be nearly as efficacious (roughly 60 - 90 % of potential infectious virus production needs to be blocked) against mutant strains of virus as it is against the wild-type strain. The eradication condition for maintenance therapy is the same as the eradication condition for induction therapy, despite the fact that induction therapy is apt to be faced with a higher viral load. If induction therapy is unable to achieve eradication then the steady-state viral load and CD 4 + T cell count resulting from maintenance therapy are independent of the timing of the switch to maintenance therapy. Drug therapy is unlikely to maintain viral loads at low levels; it is apt to either eradicate the virus or allow the viral load to return to near its pre-treatment level...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Lymphatic {{filariasis}} (LF), {{a neglected}} tropical disease (NTD) preventable through mass drug administration (MDA), {{is one of}} six diseases deemed possibly eradicable. Previously we developed one LF elimination scenario, which assumes MDA scale-up to continue in all countries that have previously undertaken MDA. In contrast, our three previously developed eradication scenarios assume all LF endemic countries will undertake MDA at an average (eradication I), fast (eradication II), or instantaneous (eradication III) rate of scale-up. In this analysis we use a micro-costing model to project the financial and economic costs {{of each of these}} scenarios in order to provide evidence to decision makers about the investment required to eliminate and eradicate LF. Methodology/Key findings Costing was undertaken from a health system perspective, with all results expressed in 2012 US dollars (USD). A discount rate of 3 % was applied to calculate the net present value of future costs. Prospective NTD budgets from LF endemic countries were reviewed to preliminarily determine activities and resources necessary to undertake a program to eliminate LF at a country level. In consultation with LF program experts, activities and resources were further reviewed and a refined list of activities and necessary resources, along with their associated quantities and costs, were determined and grouped into the following activities: advocacy and communication, capacity strengthening, coordination and strengthening partnerships, data management, ongoing surveillance, monitoring and supervision, drug delivery, and administration. The costs of mapping and undertaking transmission assessment surveys and the value of donated drugs and volunteer time were also accounted for. Using previously developed scenarios and deterministic estimates of MDA duration, the financial and economic costs of interrupting LF transmission under varying rates of MDA scale-up were then modelled using a micro-costing approach. The elimination scenario, which includes countries that previously undertook MDA, is estimated to cost 929 million USD (95 % Credible Interval: 884 m- 972 m). Proceeding to eradication is anticipated to require a higher financial investment, estimated at 1. 24 billion USD (1. 17 bn- 1. 30 bn) in the eradication III scenario (immediate scale-up), with eradication II (intensified scale-up) projected at 1. 27 billion USD (1. 21 bn- 1. 33 bn), and eradication I (slow scale-up) estimated at 1. 29 billion USD (1. 23 bn- 1. 34 bn). The economic costs of the eradication III scenario are estimated at approximately 7. 57 billion USD (7. 12 bn- 7. 94 bn), while the elimination scenario is projected to have an economic cost of 5. 21 billion USD (4. 91 bn- 5. 45 bn). Countries in the AFRO region will require the greatest investment to reach elimination or eradication, but also stand to gain the most in cost savings. Across all scenarios, capacity strengthening and advocacy and communication represent the greatest financial costs, whereas mapping, post-MDA surveillance, and administration comprise the least. Conclusions/Significance Though challenging to implement, our results indicate that financial and economic savings are greatest <b>under</b> the <b>eradication</b> III scenario. Thus, if eradication for LF is the objective, accelerated scale-up is projected to be the best investment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Human {{behavior}} influences {{infectious disease}} transmission, and numerous "prevalence-behavior" models have analyzed this interplay. These previous analyses assumed homogeneously mixing populations without spatial or social structure. However, spatial and social heterogeneity {{are known to}} significantly impact transmission dynamics and are particularly relevant for certain diseases. Previous work has demonstrated that social contact structure can change the individual incentive to vaccinate, thus enabling eradication of a disease under a voluntary vaccination policy when the corresponding homogeneous mixing model predicts that eradication is impossible due to free rider effects. Here, we extend this work and characterize the range of possible behavior-prevalence dynamics on a network. Methods We simulate transmission of a vaccine-prevetable infection through a random, static contact network. Individuals choose {{whether or not to}} vaccinate on any given day according to perceived risks of vaccination and infection. Results We find three possible outcomes for behavior-prevalence dynamics on this type of network: small final number vaccinated and final epidemic size (due to rapid control through voluntary ring vaccination); large final number vaccinated and significant final epidemic size (due to imperfect voluntary ring vaccination), and little or no vaccination and large final epidemic size (corresponding to little or no voluntary ring vaccination). We also show that the social contact structure enables <b>eradication</b> <b>under</b> a broad range of assumptions, except when vaccine risk is sufficiently high, the disease risk is sufficiently low, or individuals vaccinate too late for the vaccine to be effective. Conclusion For populations where infection can spread only through social contact network, relatively small differences in parameter values relating to perceived risk or vaccination behavior at the individual level can translate into large differences in population-level outcomes such as final size and final number vaccinated. The qualitative outcome of rational, self interested behaviour under a voluntary vaccination policy can vary substantially depending on interactions between social contact structure, perceived vaccine and disease risks, and the way that individual vaccination decision-making is modelled. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{benefits}} of the unique intradermical test (UIT) and interferon gamma test (INF) in the diagnostic of bovine tuberculosis, evaluated both tests in 155 animals from two milk farms in the area of Lima and Callao for the program <b>under</b> control and <b>eradication</b> of bovine tuberculosis of agriculture ministry. They found that 51 (32. 9 %) animals were positive to UIT and 32 (20. 6 %) to the INF test; in the same way, they could determine that 27 animals were positives to INF test of the 51 positive animals to UIT and 5 from 104 negative animals to UIT. Evaluated for Kappa and McNemar statistical test, they observed that a moderate agreement exists between the diagnostical tests and they could not be replace mutually between them. The differences would be because of the low sensibility of UIT and cross-reactions in front of similar no-pathogen agents for bovines, just when the tests, with characteristics of UIT, advance and the programs of control decrease the prevalence of the disease and increase the false positives. Key Words: unique intradermical test, interferon gamma, tuberculosis, bovinePara comparar las bondades de la prueba intradérmica única (PIU) y la prueba de gamma interferón (INF) en el diagnóstico de la tuberculosis bovina, se evaluaron ambas pruebas en 155 animales de dos establos lecheros del área de Lima y Callao bajo el Programa de control y erradicación de tuberculosis bovina del Ministerio de Agricultura. Se halló que 51 (32. 9 %) animales resultaron positivos a la PIU y 32 (20. 6 %) a la prueba de INF; asimismo, se pudo determinar que 27 animales resultaron positivos a INF de los 51 animales positivos a PIU y 5 entre los 104 animales negativos de la PIU. Evaluados bajo la prueba estadística de Ïndice de Kappa y Chi- 2 de Mc Nemar se observó que existe una concordancia moderada entre las pruebas diagnósticas y que no se pueden reemplazar mutuamente entre ellas. Las diferencias se deberían a la baja sensibilidad del PIU y a reacciones cruzadas ante agentes afines no patógenos para los bovinos, toda vez que las pruebas, con características de PIU, al avanzar los programas de control y aumentan los falso positivos.
