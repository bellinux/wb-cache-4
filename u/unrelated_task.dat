50|$|The {{difference}} between multicommunicating and multitasking can be confusing since {{both of the}} terms talk about people participating in two events at the same time. Scholars {{in the field of}} communication have made clear definition of the relationship between these two phenomena. They believe that multitasking has broader scope than multicommunicating which is one complex form of multitasking. Multitasking refers to a user engaging in multitasking behavior when s/he performs more than one <b>unrelated</b> <b>task</b> concurrently, which simply emphasizes task independence and performance concurrency. Multicommunicating, however, involves people participating in two simultaneous conversations, which not only requires adequate attention on both tasks, but also coordination between the two.|$|E

In one of the experiments they primed participants with words related to the elderly and found they walked slower leaving the experiment than controls. [...] Dijksterhuis started investigating the link between perception and behavior, but instead of direct behavior he wanted to measure ability. Over multiple studies, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg primed subjects with the stereotype of professor (thought of as intelligent), and the stereotype of soccer hooligans (thought of as stupid). In the last study, they also primed them directly with intelligent or stupid, rather than just using a stereotype. In a supposedly <b>unrelated</b> <b>task,</b> they used a general knowledge measure to test for effects of the priming. In all of the studies, participants primed with intelligence, by stereotype or directly, did better than controls. The opposite is true for those primed with stupidity. The duration of priming (9 minutes vs 2 minutes) affected performance {{with those in the}} long condition performing better than those in the short condition.|$|E

50|$|One can attempt {{learning}} {{a group of}} principal tasks using a group of auxiliary <b>tasks,</b> <b>unrelated</b> to the principal ones. In many applications, joint learning of <b>unrelated</b> <b>tasks</b> which use the same input data can be beneﬁcial. The reason is that prior knowledge about task relatedness can lead to sparser and more informative representations for each task grouping, essentially by screening out idiosyncrasies of the data distribution. Novel methods which builds on a prior multitask methodology by favoring a shared low-dimensional representation within each task grouping have been proposed. The programmer can impose a penalty on tasks from different groups which encourages the two representations to be orthogonal. Experiments on synthetic and real data have indicated that incorporating <b>unrelated</b> <b>tasks</b> can result in significant improvements over standard multi-task learning methods.|$|R

40|$|We casually observe many {{interactions}} {{that do not}} really concern us. Yet sometimes {{we need to be}} able to rapidly appraise whether an interaction between two people represents a real threat for one of them rather than an innocent tease. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated whether small differences in the body language of two interacting people are picked up by the brain even if observers are performing an <b>unrelated</b> <b>task.</b> Fourteen participants were scanned while watching 3 -s movies (192 trials and 96 scrambles) showing a male person either threatening or teasing a female one. In one task condition, observers categorized the interaction as threatening or teasing, and in the other, they monitored randomly appearing dots and categorized the color. Our results clearly show that right amygdala responds more to threatening than to teasing situations irrespective of the observers' task. When observers' attention is not explicitly directed to the situation, this heightened amygdala activation goes together with increased activity in body sensitive regions in fusiform gyrus, extrastriate body area-human motion complex and superior temporal sulcus and is associated with a better behavioral performance of the participants during threatening situations. In addition, regions involved in action observation (inferior frontal gyrus, temporoparietal junction, and inferior parietal lobe) and preparation (premotor, putamen) show increased activation for threat videos. Also regions involved in processing moral violations (temporoparietal junction, hypothalamus) reacted selectively to the threatening interactions. Taken together, our results show which brain regions react selectively to witnessing a threatening interaction even if the situation is not attended because the observers perform an <b>unrelated</b> <b>task...</b>|$|E
40|$|Vision {{research}} has been shaped by the seminal insight that we can understand the higher-tier visual cortex {{from the perspective of}} multiple functional pathways with different goals. In this paper, we try to give a computational account of the functional organization of this system by reasoning from the perspective of multi-task deep neural networks. Machine learning has shown that tasks become easier to solve when they are decomposed into subtasks with their own cost function. We hypothesize that the visual system optimizes multiple cost functions of <b>unrelated</b> <b>tasks</b> and this causes the emergence of a ventral pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to vision for action. To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on either two related or two <b>unrelated</b> <b>tasks,</b> using an identical stimulus set. Results show that the network trained on the <b>unrelated</b> <b>tasks</b> shows a decreasing degree of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing. We conjecture that the method we propose can be used to analyze the anatomical and functional organization of the visual system and beyond. We predict that the degree to which tasks are related is a good descriptor {{of the degree to which}} they share downstream cortical-units. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|People need to {{allocate}} their limited cognitive resources to {{current and future}} tasks. We provide evidence that anticipating the resource demands of a future task creates a "get ready mind-set" that mobilizes these resources.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether motivational orientations for a new motor task could be {{triggered}} by unconscious determinants.

Behavioral, physiological and self-reported indicators of motivation for this task were assessed. Overall, results indicated a significant impact of the priming condition on all these indicators; while the priming of autonomous motivation led to positive outcomes, the priming of controlled motivation led to negatives outcomes when compared to the neutral condition. Implications regarding the priming of unconscious determinants of motivation for sport and exercise are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Are {{difficult}} decisions best made after a momentary diversion of thought? Previous research addressing this important question has yielded dozens of experiments {{in which participants}} were asked to choose the best of several options (e. g., cars or apartments) either after conscious deliberation, or after a momentary diversion of thought induced by an <b>unrelated</b> <b>task.</b> The results of these studies were mixed. Some found that participants who had first performed the <b>unrelated</b> <b>task</b> were more likely to choose the best option, whereas others found no evidence for this so-called unconscious thought advantage (UTA). The current study examined two accounts of this inconsistency in previous findings. According to the reliability account, the UTA does not exist and previous reports of this effect concern nothing but spurious effects obtained with an unreliable paradigm. In contrast, the moderator account proposes that the UTA is a real effect that occurs only when certain conditions are met in the choice task. To test these accounts, we conducted a meta-analysis and a large-scale replication study (N = 399) that met the conditions deemed optimal for replicating the UTA. Consistent with the reliability account, the large-scale replication study yielded no evidence for the UTA, and the meta-analysis showed that previous reports of the UTA were confined to underpowered studies that used relatively small sample sizes. Furthermore, the results of the large-scale study also dispelled the recent suggestion that the UTA might be gender-specific. Accordingly, we conclude that there exists no reliable support for the claim that a momentary diversion of thought leads to better decision making than a period of deliberation...|$|E

30|$|Multi-task {{learning}} is a statistical spatial feature mapping framework where identical input data from different tasks are jointly learned.

40|$|A {{primary concern}} in {{implicit}} memory {{research is the}} degree to which implicit memory tests are dependent on the perceptual characteristics of the information encoded during study. Perceptual or data-driven implicit memory tests tap into recent experiences incidentally (i. e., in the absence of instructions to recollect) by requiring subjects to identify stimuli that have undergone some form of deg-radation. Most research in this area has used implicit tests that employ verbal materials presented in a visual format.

The NVGP and NVGPH groups will then train for one week in an action video game playing environment. They will then be re-tested for attentional efficiency.

40|$|Neural {{networks}} {{suffer from}} interference {{when they are}} evolved for different and <b>unrelated</b> <b>tasks.</b> This interference causes the networks to forget previously learned behaviours and worsens the more the network is trained in the new task, preventing networks being able to engage in such different <b>unrelated</b> <b>tasks.</b> This report proposes that a cause for this {{may be that the}} regular ANN architecture is too simple and that some additional enhancements may be needed. It is then proposed that modularity could be used for such purpose, protecting network structures responsible for particular behaviours. Further, it is proposed a selection scheme intended to handle the selection of modules based on input to the primary network. This module-with-selection scheme is tested and shows that modularity provide some benefits such as simplifying the search space and also enabling symmetric and repeating structures through module connectivity and reuse. The selection mechanism is also shown to be evolvable, something not readily apparent. It is further suggested that this selection mechanism can in the future enable networks to operate in fractured domains. Also the scheme has support for module within module structures, enabling a bottom-up approach to constructing networks through incremental evolution, and with the modules acting as safeguards against interference as the network becomes more complex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{scheduling}} of real-time tasks on a uniprocessor {{system has}} evolved from Rate Monotonic Scheduling, Earliest Deadline First Scheduling of <b>unrelated</b> <b>tasks</b> to tasks that share resources and communicate[4][1].

A distributed real-time system consists of computation nodes connected by a real-time network where the messages transfer time between the nodes is bounded. Each node may execute a distributed real-time kernel which provides the local and remote interprocess communication and syncronization as well as the usual process management functions and input/output management. The goal of our ongoing work is to investigate balancing of the static load over this distributed environment. Formally, if T = ft...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} making choices that involve {{conflicts}} between self-interest and otherregarding concerns may deplete cognitive resources and willpower and thus reduce individuals' ability to exert self-control. In a lab experiment we use a series of modified dictator games to manipulate whether subjects are exposed to tradeoffs between their self-interest and the interest of others: in a Conflict treatment the option that maximizes the dictator's payoff always minimizes the recipient's payoff, whereas in the NoConflict treatment dictator's and recipient's payoffs are aligned. We then measure how decision-making in the dictator games affects subjects' performance in a subsequent and <b>unrelated</b> <b>task</b> that requires exertion of willpower. We find that subjects in the Conflict treatment perform significantly worse than those in NoConflict. This effect is particularly marked for dictators who experienced a stronger conflict during the dictator games...|$|E

While another person present in the room evaluated photographs of beautiful women or landscapes by beauty/attractiveness, female participants had to perform a combination of digit-categorization and spatial-compatibility task. There, before every trial, one of the women or landscape pictures was presented. Results showed selective performance impairments: the numerical distance effects increased on trials that followed women pictures but only, if another person concurrently evaluated these women pictures. In a second experiment, using the affective priming paradigm, the authors show that female pictures have a more negative connotation when they are concurrently evaluated by another person (social-evaluative context) than when they are not evaluated (neutral context). Together, these results suggest that the social-evaluative context triggers mild negative affective reactions to women pictures which then impair performance in an <b>unrelated</b> <b>task...</b>|$|E
