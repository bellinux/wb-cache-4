40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine if proprioceptive signals are perceived more readily in terms of limb segment inclinations to the vertical than as joint angles. Subjects attempted to match arm positions with the <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> <b>supported</b> at different inclinations. Constant error data showed that, when instructed to match forearm inclinations to the vertical, subjects were very accurate. When required to match elbow joint angles, however, errors were strongly biased {{in the direction of}} matching forearm inclinations. The results support a view of proprioception as a system in which afferent signals related to the gravitational torques acting at joints lead to the perception of limb orientation rather than joint angles. Such a system would allow more efficient determination of the relationship of limb segments to external objects than would one based purely on joint angles...|$|R

[...] In 1917, Emile Schlick patented the first commercially produced crutch; the design consisted of a walking stick with an <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> <b>support.</b> Later, A.R. Lofstrand, Jr. developed the first crutches with a height-adjustable feature making the crutches customizable. Through time, the design of crutches haven't changed much such that the classic design still is most commonly used. However, some modern inventor's have worked to develop innovative designs of this ancient assistive device in hopes to better address different types of patients.In 1997, forearm crutches got a boost when President Bill Clinton started wearing them after tearing his right quadriceps tendon. He called the forearm crutches his [...] "Stealth" [...] crutches. In a news conference, Clinton said, [...] "I think they were developed as an offshoot of B-2 technology... I like them quite a lot." ...|$|R
