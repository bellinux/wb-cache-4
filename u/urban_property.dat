All land titles must be registered, but there is no accurate information as to the extent of registration. Real estate could only be owned by Saudi citizens until 2000, when the property laws were amended to allow foreigners to own property in Saudi Arabia. Property investments by non-Saudis of more than 30 million Saudi riyals require approval of the Council of Ministers and foreigners remain prohibited from owning property in Medina and Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Henry III {{added to}} the {{endowment}} left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, <b>urban</b> <b>property</b> in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems {{on the cost of}} providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty.|$|E

40|$|The {{trend to}} {{interpret}} the discipline of the Civil Code with a Constitution-based perspective is confirmed by the most recent jurisprudence on the term of lease of <b>urban</b> <b>properties</b> contracted by the usufructary. The art. 999 of the Civil Code, that is also applicable to <b>urban</b> <b>properties</b> lease, is grounded on the general clause of property’s social function. In a constitutional system {{based on the principle}} of solidarity and the full development of the person, the reference to the social function has a promotional role in order to realize such values, particularly the right of occupancy...|$|R
25|$|By 1825, Jewish {{population}} in Wallachia (almost completely Sephardi) {{was estimated at}} between 5,000 and 10,000 people - of these, the larger part resided in Bucharest (probably as much as 7,000 in 1839); around the same time, Moldavia was home to about 12,000 Jews. In parallel, the Jewish {{population in}} Bukovina rose from 526 in 1774 to 11,600 in 1848. In the early 19th century, Jews who sought refuge from Osman Pazvantoğlu's campaign in the Balkans established communities in Wallachian-ruled Oltenia. In Moldavia, Scarlat Callimachi's Code (1817) allowed {{members of the community}} to purchase <b>urban</b> <b>property,</b> but prevented them from settling in the countryside (while purchasing town property became increasingly difficult due to popular prejudice).|$|E

Echeverría was again {{secretary}} of the treasury, still under Bustamante (27 July 1839 to 23 March 1841). This was after the Pastry War with France, and the treasury was bankrupt. His commercial firm lent 662,000 pesos to the government in copper, receiving payment in silver. He was much attacked for this in the press. He imposed a tax of 3 per 1,000 on rural and <b>urban</b> <b>property</b> and raised the consumption tax 10%. He wanted to amortize the copper coinage through an agreement with the tobacco firms. By these and other measures he greatly improved the situation of the treasury.|$|E
25|$|With a {{sensitive}} change of leadership approaching in 2012 and popular uprisings against authoritarian regimes occurring across the Middle East, the ruling Chinese Communist Party {{showed no signs}} of loosening its grip on power in 2011. Despite minor legal improvements regarding the death penalty and <b>urban</b> <b>property</b> confiscation, the government stalled or even reversed previous reforms related to the rule of law, while security forces resorted to extralegal forms of repression. Growing public frustration over corruption and injustice fueled tens of thousands of protests and several large outbursts of online criticism during the year. The party responded by committing more resources to internal security forces and intelligence agencies, engaging in the systematic enforced disappearance of dozens of human rights lawyers and bloggers, and enhancing controls over online social media.|$|E

25|$|The Benedictine Rule was not austere in {{comparison}} with the discipline of the Cistercians and Augustinians, and Shrewsbury Abbey was markedly less isolated than its competitors, located {{as it was in the}} suburbs of a major town. Because of good management, the abbey did not get into serious difficulties in the 12th century, despite the underlying problems with many of its endowments. Even in the early 12th century the abbey owned a number of properties in and around the town: orchards, a vineyard and a sand-pit. In the 13th century the integration with Shrewsbury became closer still, as the abbey expanded its holdings of <b>urban</b> <b>property</b> in the Abbey Foregate, the market, and elsewhere in the town. The great majority of the rural holdings were let to small farmers or cultivated as demesne lands; only rarely did the community let entire manors to laymen, and it was reluctant to tolerate leases of more than one lifetime. The demesnes were managed by lay bailiffs and stewards on behalf of the abbey; there is no evidence that the monks themselves ever cultivated the land.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, under Mengistu's leadership, the Derg regime {{began an}} {{aggressive}} program of changing Ethiopia's system from a mixed feudo-capitalist emergent economy to an Eastern Bloc-style command economy. Shortly after coming to power, all rural land was nationalized, stripping the Ethiopian Church, the Imperial {{family and the}} nobility of all their sizable estates and {{the bulk of their}} wealth. During this same period, all foreign-owned and locally owned companies were nationalized without compensation in an effort to redistribute the country's wealth. All undeveloped <b>urban</b> <b>property</b> and all rental property was also nationalized. Private businesses such as banks and insurance companies, large retail businesses, etc. were also taken over by the government. All this nationalized property was brought under the administration of large bureaucracies set up to administer them. Farmers who had once worked on land owned by absentee landlords were now compelled to join collective farms. All agricultural products were no longer to be offered on the free market, but were to be controlled and distributed by the government. Despite progressive agricultural reforms, under the Derg, agricultural output suffered due to civil war, drought and misguided economic policies. There was also a famine in 1984, which was the 10th anniversary of the Derg.|$|E

50|$|Elites {{invested}} {{their fortunes}} in real estate, mainly in rural enterprises {{and to a}} lesser extent <b>urban</b> <b>properties,</b> with the Roman Catholic Church functioning as a mortgage bank.

2500|$|Earl Roger and his {{associates}} added several estates and other sources of income to Shrewsbury Abbey's endowment, which had been valued at £46 18s. in 1086, before the first abbot was appointed. As well as rural manors, the abbey had <b>urban</b> <b>property,</b> mills, and the tithes and advowsons of many churches. However, Orderic, a shrewd observer, tells us that Roger only [...] "moderately endowed with lands and rents" [...] (terris ac redditibus mediocriter locupletavit). Moreover, {{there was a long}} wait ahead before some of the endowments were to materialise.|$|E
2500|$|During his office, much <b>urban</b> <b>property</b> {{that had}} been taken from the church was returned, most notably the return of the campus and the library of Holy Trinity Theological College, and the College was reopened. Abuna Paulos built a new Patriarchal office and {{residence}} complex {{at the site of the}} old one, and reformed the bureaucracy of the Patriarchate. [...] He traveled widely, strengthening the ties of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church with other sister churches. [...] He reluctantly acquiesced to the breaking away of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church when that country declared independence. [...] Abune Paulos also took the initiative to the series of peace meetings between all Ethiopian and Eritrean religious leaders in 1998, 1999 and 2000 in an effort to bring peace between the two countries in response to a bitterly fought border war. Patriarch Abune Paulos and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church were extensively involved in the support of war-displaced and drought-hit Ethiopians, making the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church one of the major relief organizations in the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{share of}} urban borrowers kept slowly {{increasing}} to about 30% of all loans {{but those were}} riskier loans. The share of loans to merchants, who were mostly Jewish, was particularly low – just 2.2% in 1889 when the average of other banks was 13.5%. A big jump in urban loans was seen in 1892 due to the agricultural crisis (from 8 million to 13.4 million). These loans helped industrialisation, but were blamed for a construction boom which later resulted in a bust. From 1901 to 1907, the bank auctioned 659 <b>urban</b> <b>properties</b> but managed to sell only 452 and suffered 2 million rubles in losses. There were no restrictions of Catholic nobles or Jews on acquiring <b>urban</b> <b>properties.</b> In 1902, to reign in the perceived abuses, the government limited urban loans to 30% of outstanding loans. Despite the losses and regulations, the bank continued to lend to city residents and the outstanding loans amounted to 35.9 million and represented 2,891 properties in 1915.|$|R
