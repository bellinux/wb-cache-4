Finally, for the past 20 years, increasing efforts have been directed toward in vivo imaging of gene expression and enzyme activity, particularly in oncology research.

The CT scan was used to ac-curately identify the location of 18 F-FDG uptake. Of the 20 sub-jects, 10 were randomly selected to perform a low-level muscle activity during the 1 -h 18 F-FDG <b>uptake</b> <b>phase.</b> The PET/CT im-ages were fused, and the location and intensity of metabolic ac-tivity were described for all subjects.

30|$|The {{results of}} this study {{confirms}} the presence of increased radionuclide <b>uptake</b> in late <b>phase</b> bone SPECT/CT imaging in approximately one third of asymptomatic wrists. The prevalence and intensity of uptake in asymptomatic wrists was significantly lower compared to symptomatic wrists. In AW only 1 case (2 %) of increased early <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> was observed in contrast to 7 (16 %) symptomatic patients with increased early <b>phase</b> <b>uptake.</b> This confirms the understanding that early <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> reflects primarily active disorders like active inflammation, osteoarthritis or traumatic lesions which are prone to be symptomatic and often require therapy. In contrast incidentally observed late <b>phase</b> SPECT/CT bone <b>uptake</b> in AW showed no diagnostic or therapeutic impact during follow-up time of our patients. Similar observations where previously stated in the literature: Bhure et al. demonstrated the correlation of morphology, SPECT/CT uptake and symptoms in 24 wrists of 21 patients with suspected carpal boss and the considerable number of wrists had discordant findings: absence of local pain with low grade scintigraphic uptake was observed in 3 wrists and moderate uptake in one wrist; local pain without scintigraphic uptake was seen in 6 wrists (Bhure et al. 2015). Chong et al. recently investigated bone tracer uptake in the accessory navicular bone patients and observed that 8 (27 %) patients had grade 1 and 2 patients (3 %) grade 2 uptake (Chong et al. 2016). These results with a prevalence of approximately one third of increased uptake in the foot in asymptomatic patients were in line with our findings in the wrist. Moreover, Avengen et al. investigated patients with knee arthroplasties and found, in general, higher SPECT/CT uptake in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic knees (Awengen et al. 2016). Accordingly, increased radionuclide uptake was also observed in asymptomatic patients. The finding in our study that patients with asymptomatic uptake due to osteoarthritis where significantly older than patients without osteoarthritic uptake supports the theory that joint degeneration increases with age and is often asymptomatic because of missing active inflammation. We know from the large Framingham study with over 1000 participants that about 13.3 % of older men and 26.2 % of older women have at least one hand joint affected by symptomatic osteoarthritis (Zhang et al. 2002). Interestingly, the prevalence of osteoarthritis of at least one affected joint (symptomatic and asymptomatic) on hand x-rays was extremely high (88, 6 % in men and 94.4 % in women), showing that the correlation of morphologic osteoarthritis with clinical symptoms of the hand/wrist is even worse than correlation of scintigraphic uptake with clinical symptoms. Over the age of 70  years, approximately 5 % of women and 3 % of men have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the first carpo-metacarpal joint. There are many different factors contributing to pain in osteoarthritis, which are extensively discussed in the article of Hunter et al. in 2008 (Hunter et al. 2008). The two factors, which are probably mainly responsible for increased uptake on bone scans are the associated arthritis/synovitis causing early <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> and the damage to the subchondral bone causing late <b>phase</b> <b>uptake.</b> Besides osteoarthritis there are various conditions which might cause increased bone turnover and uptake on bone scan like older trauma, benign bone lesions like enchondroma or osteonecrosis.|$|R

Toadfish accumulated 109 Cd predominantly from water (85 %) and 75 Se predominantly from food (62 %), although the latter was lower than expected. For both the water and food exposures, 109 Cd was predominantly located in the gut lining (60 e 75 %) {{at the end of the}} <b>uptake</b> <b>phase,</b> suggesting that the gut may be the primary pathway of 109 Cd uptake. This may be attributed to toadfish drinking large volumes of water to maintain osmoregulation.

The micropylar seed end is the major entry point of water. The micropylar endosperm and the radicle show the highest hydration. Germination of tobacco follows a distinct pattern of events: rupture of the testa is followed by rupture of the endosperm. Abscisic acid (ABA) specifically inhibits endosperm rupture and <b>phase</b> III water <b>uptake,</b> but does not alter the spatial and temporal pattern of phase I and II water uptake.

In vivo 13 C-magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy showed that seed oil mobilization is not inhibited by ABA. ABA therefore does not inhibit germination by preventing oil mobilization or by decreasing the water-holding capacity of the micropylar endosperm and the radicle.

Spectrophotometric quantification of LY accumulation {{was performed in}} {{the presence or absence}} of transferrin, a marker of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Internalization of LY showed a curvilinear kinetics: the high initial rate of LYuptake (575 ng LY/ mg protein /hr) decreased almost 5 -fold within 15 min, reaching plateau at 126 ng/ mg protein /hr. Transferrin induced a small increase (7. 5 %) in the fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> rate (after 5 min) followed by a small decrease at longer incubation times. Lucifer Yellow and transferrin (visualized by streptavidin– FITC) were localized in Paramecium by 3 -D reconstruction by confocal microscopy. LY showed a scattered, diffuse fluorescence typical of fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> whereas transferrin accumulated in membrane-surrounded endosomes. Wortmannin did not affect LY accumulation but decreased it when transferrin was present in the incubation medium. This suggests an effect on the transferrin uptake pathway, presumably on the stage of internalization in “mixing” endosomes to which transferrin and LY were targeted. Phorbol ester diminished LY accumulation by 22 % and this effect persisted up to 25 min of incubation. PKC inhibitor did not affect LY uptake. However, in the presence of transferrin, the LY uptake increased within the first 15 minutes followed by a rapid 20 % decrease in comparison to the control.

To elucidate their itinerary through endothelial cells (ECs), we labelled ApoA-I and HDL either fluorescently or with 1. 4 nm nanogold and investigated their cellular localization by using immunofluorescent microscopy (IFM) and electron microscopy (EM). HDL as well as ApoA-I is taken up by ECs into the same route of intracellular trafficking. Time kinetics and pulse chase experiments revealed that HDL is trafficked through different vesicles. HDL partially co-localized with LDL, albumin, and transferrin. HDL did not co-localize with clathrin and caveolin- 1. Fluorescent HDL was recovered at small proportions in early endosomes and endosome to trans-golgi network vesicles but not at all in recycling endosomes, in late endosomes or lysosomes. EM identified HDL mainly in large filled vesicles which however upon IFM did not colocalize with markers of multivesicular bodies or autophagosomes. The uptake or cellular distribution of HDL was altered upon pharmacological interference with cytochalasine D, colchicine and dynasore.

Using artificially distorted DCE-MRI breast images it is shown that the proposed algorithm is able to correct for movement and distortions over a larger range than is likely to occur during routine clinical examination. In addition, using a clinical DCE-MRI data set with an expertly labeled suspicious region, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the variability of the enhancement curves at the pixel level yielding more pronounced <b>uptake</b> and washout <b>phase...</b>|$|R
30|$|Secondly, {{concerning}} the tissue phase {{after the initial}} blood phase, our results demonstrated that a frame duration of 30  s seems to be optimal. The optimal sampling for the tissue phase is slower than the optimal sampling for the blood phase, which {{could be explained by}} the low variations in the tracer <b>uptake</b> during this <b>phase</b> and also by the lower count rate detected during the tissue phase than the count rate detected during the blood phase, so a longer time frame is needed in this phase. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results because no clinical validation was performed for this tissue phase in our study.|$|R
40|$|The uptake of galactosides into Escherichia coli via the lactose {{permease}} was {{studied in}} the time range 0. 01 - 10 s by rapid mixing and quenched flow. An initial transient was observed under two conditions. Firstly, a lag in the approach to the steady state was observed at low galactoside concentrations (less than Km). Secondly, a burst of uptake was observed when anaerobic cell suspensions were mixed with aerobic substrate solutions. However, {{the cause of the}} burst of uptake appears to be a burst in the rate of respiration. The rate of galactoside <b>uptake</b> during this <b>phase</b> is 10 -fold greater than during the steady state...|$|R
