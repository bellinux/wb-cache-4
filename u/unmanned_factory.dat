Particular attention was given to the identification and the assessment of the DPS development based on the systems and control theory. The obtained models of the DPS development were analyzed and discussed. The studies were obtained model of the development of the DPS, and on the basis of is knowledge of the structural and parametrical changes of system development.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of information and communication technology (ICT) since the 1970 s and its effect on the manufacturing transnational corporation (MTNC) in four key areas: management control, design, manufacturing process, and the office. Management control is examined in two areas: the coordination and monitoring of functions. ICT assists in both the improvement of policy decisions and in added flexibility and negotiating power. The design area relates the usage of CAD/CAM to the collaboration on design work. The manufacturing process reviews the introduction of Numerical Control (NC) machines, robotics, flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) thereby leading to the <b>unmanned</b> <b>factory</b> using an FMS linked with the electronic office and other information systems. The effects of ICT on the office environment, considered the area most affected, include personnel losses and the introduction of the knowledge worker. The conclusion is that the primary effects of electronic-based technology in the factory and office are associated with rationalization and efficiency rather than expansion. The modern manufacturing industry is being dramatically changed by developments in microelectronic...|$|E

Product lines chosen for analysis were: (1) turbine blades, (2) tungsten targets for X-ray machines, (3) 1 sub G subclass separation by electrophoresis, and (4) high-price exotic crystals. The turbine blade, and 1 sub G products are considered promising candidates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Tool wear {{monitoring}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial and inevitable processes in present-day manufacturing systems. With the growth of <b>unmanned</b> <b>factories,</b> the need for on-line monitoring systems is well recognized. Artificial intelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and the neuro-fuzzy technique have proved their potential in monitoring the manufacturing processes. In shop-floor control, the condition of the cutting tool is of more concern than the actual tool wear value but, in research activities, the estimation of the actual value of the tool wear occupies a prominent place. The present work is concerned with the assessment of the tool condition and also the estimation of the tool wear value. In the present paper, artificial intelligence techniques are applied to estimate the tool condition and tool wear value on line. Kohonen’s self-organizing map is applied in neural networks for estimating the tool condition. Fuzzy logic and the neuro-fuzzy technique are implemented by triangular membership functions. To assess the tool wear value, a back-propagation neural network is applied. In fuzzy logic and neuro-fuzzy techniques, the centroid method of defuzzification is applied to obtain the flank wear value. Experimental data are generated by machining EN- 8 steel with a high-speed steel cutting tool. The obtained data are used to train and test the networks. To make the monitoring system user friendly, a user interface is developed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6. 0...|$|R
40|$|An {{economic}} analysis using econometric and {{cost benefit analysis}} techniques was performed to determine the feasibility of space processing of certain products. The overall objectives of the analysis were (1) to determine specific products or processes uniquely connected with space manufacturing, (2) to select a specific product or process {{from each of the}} areas of semiconductors, metals, and biochemicals, and (3) to determine the overall price/cost structure of each product or process considered. The economic elements of the analysis involved a generalized decision making format for analyzing space manufacturing, a comparative cost study of the selected processes in space vs. earth manufacturing, and a supply and demand study of the economic relationships of one of the manufacturing processes. Space processing concepts were explored. The first involved the use of the shuttle as the factory with all operations performed during individual flights. The second concept involved a permanent <b>unmanned</b> space <b>factory</b> which would be launched separately. The shuttle in this case would be used only for maintenance and refurbishment. Finally, some consideration was given to a permanent manned space factory...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to pass on {{experience}} in setting up a CIM system for training and, demonstration on a restricted budget, in order to simulate real conditions in industry. The conclusions drawn {{are relevant to the}} restructuring of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing industry, especially relating to Advanced Manufacturing. To begin with, a history of the project from concept to realisation is given, including participants involved, project objectives, and a description of the system. Hence the paper covers the manufacturing abilities of the ACME FMS, a section on integration and control aspects, a cost analysis, information on training directions, as well as suggested future directions. The project, and the related training programmes, focus equally on the commercial side of manufacturing, including management information systems and quality management approaches - as well as the technical side. The major conclusion to be drawn is that Australia 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing industry need not be wary of CIM, a mature technology, that CIM does not mean an <b>unmanned</b> <b>factory,</b> and that the level of integration of the communication network only needs to meet projected requirements - provided the system installed, which can be PC-based, may be suitably expanded when and as required. The paper also shows that major limitations include not only a lack of suitably trained personnel, but also a lack of industry standards in the PC/CNC/PLC/robotics communications area, especially at basic or entry PC level...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabricating}} craftsmanship and {{the artificial}} intelligence are considered as the service-robot realm {{in the development}} of humanoid robot. However, the stability, reliability, and the loading effects are hard to be realized during the commercialized process. Traditionally, the robot can be categorized into the industrial robot and the intelligent/homecare robot from the academic and commercialized viewpoints. Integrated implementation of both kinds of the development industrial and intelligent robots has become increasingly popular since 2000. In this project, the project investigator (PI) is dedicated to integrate major achievement of the robot biomimetic techniques in the past five years, such as the key technology of the arm control, the walking balance, embedded control, caterpillar moving platform, LiFePO 4 cell-balance, and the PLC-based inexpensive automation, etc. On the other hand, the proposed project is focused on developing a manned control and navigating platform of the industrialized caterpillar robot for the commercialized purpose within the next three years. Research work in the 1 st year: Research schedule in the 1 st year:will be focused on the head/neck biomimic mechanism of the robot organs, the artificial skin, the artificial muscle, LiFePO 4 power scheduling, loading estimation, discharge cell-balance, battery power saving. Thus, the lead-acid battery can be replaced on the automatic guiding vehicle (AGV) and graphically user interface (GUI) PC-based panel displayers of the residual electricity. The cruising range can be broadened without the limitation of the robot loading effects and the discharging instability. Research work in the 2 nd year: Research schedule in the 2 nd year will be focused on the Image identification, helicopter 3 D navigating technique, etc. Besides the fabrication of the artificial muscle, biomimetic mechanism, and caterpillar moving platform, the proposed project is dedicated to develop the interactive and simulating algorithm of the audio/video identification/tracking. The detection of the artificial vision includes the image grasping, identification, processing, and recording on the humanoid robot. In this project, the sampling rate will be twice faster than the sound frequency (4000 Hz) with a high-frequency filter to avoid the aliasing phenomenon. Research work in the 3 rd year: Research schedule in the 3 rd year will be focused on the facial tracking and PLC-based industrial control. Multi-face dynamic image can be identified by applying the false rejection ratio within the speed 10 frame/sec. The localization of the artificial vision includes facial detection, grasping, recording, and the image processor of the comparing algorithm and theory. While, the core technologies of the power and communicating interface will be integrated under the network of CANBus (Control Area Network) and the moving navigation on the proposed industrialized humanoid robot. The caterpillar platform can be navigated in the campus with the loading of 80 - 100 kg in 6 km/hr and with the range of 5000 meters. The caterpillar platform with 3 D-video/audio-identified helicopter mentioned above may take the place of the automatic guiding vehicle (AGV) in the <b>unmanned</b> <b>factory</b> or the homecare robot in the urban community. The research goal may be accomplished by promoting the “manned intelligent caterpillar-robot”. The proposed project can be achieved by the teamwork of the intelligent robotics R & D center within the year 2011 - 2014.

40|$|Many {{applications}} {{exist for}} <b>unmanned</b> vehicles, <b>factory</b> maintenance, planetary exploration, in reactor inspection etc. Robotic systems will inhabit a world which will contain obstacles, these obstacles will threaten {{their pursuit of}} a successful goal. In {{all but the most}} simple and benign environment these obstacles will be in motion. The presence or location of an obstacle will not be known a priori. Therefore in order to build practical, useful robots a means of sensing the environment in order to determine traversable/non-traversable space needs to be developed. In addition, to prevent them from becoming lost, practical robots will be required to generate an estimate of where they are in the world in relation to known features, this capability is referred to as localisation. Clearly the primary sense for determining traversable spaces is sight. However current research into machine vision has produced systems that are either too slow, too specific (i. e. related to a particular problem domain rather than a general one) to too unreliable. These factors have lead to the development of an active sensor, the motion structured light sensor. This sensor solves the ill-posed problem and the problem of large data rates by illuminating the world with a laser sheet and determining 3 D topography from the image of the intersection of this sheet and the world. The sensor has been developed to detect and track moving obstacles over time and has also been used as a means of vehicle localisation with respect to an a priori map. Although vision, and in particular structured light, is a useful source of topographic information, other sensors offer the ability to determine the presence of geometric features in a scene, such as ultrasonic sensors and laser rangefinders. Motivated by the desire to generate richer descriptions of world state from disparate information sources the research area of Multi Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF) is addressed. A mechanism for combining information based on the first and second order statistics available from the Kalman filter is presented. The MSDF system is applied i) in simulation to a second order plant and ii) to a laboratory based robot. This approach leads to greater accuracy of state estimation which leads to greater system robustness and robustness with respect to sensor failure / sensor error. This thesis therefore presents a method of generating more accurate estimates of state by using multiple sources of information. This enables systems to be built that are more robust, not only {{due to the fact that}} state estimates are more accurate but also due to the fact that these systems will possess mutliple redundancy through the use of multiple sensors. It is shown that the use of multiple sensors also enables the system to become more robust with respect to the poor chose of noise models required by the Kalman filter...|$|R
