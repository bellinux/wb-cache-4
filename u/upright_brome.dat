5|$|South-west of {{the town}} is the Friar's Oven SSSI which {{is the site of}} herb-rich {{calcareous}} grassland classified as the <b>Upright</b> <b>Brome</b> (Bromus erectus) type, and north-east is the Windsor Hill Quarry geological SSSI, and also the Windsor Hill Marsh biological SSSI, a marshy silted pond with adjacent damp, slightly acidic grassland of interest for its diverse flora, in large part down to the varied habitats present within the small area. Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: Flat-sedge (Blysmus compressus) and Slender Spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis). Other marshland plants found there include Purple Loosestrife, Yellow Flag (Iris pseudacorus), Hard Rush (Juncus inflexus), Soft Rush (J. effusus), Flowering Rush (Butomus umbellatus), Devil's-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), three species of Horsetail Equisetum spp. and seven sedges Carex spp.|$|E
25|$|The SSSI {{designation}} for {{the site}} arises due to interest in the biodiversity and species present upon the earthworks of the fort themselves, with the inner and surrounding parts of the site being of improved agricultural grassland of little interest. The earthworks support a rich chalk grassland flora, including for several rare species. There are 16 species of grass and sedge recorded; with <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus erectus), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), quaking grass (Briza media), crested hair-grass (Koeleria cristata), and dwarf sedge (Carex humilis).

The area {{has a significant}} population of orchids, including the bee orchid, fragrant orchid and frog orchid.|$|E
50|$|The hillsides at {{this site}} have short, herb-rich grassland, and the flatter areas, taller vegetation. The main species in the plant {{communities}} here are <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus erectus), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), quaking-grass (Briza media), and downland herbs such as burnet-saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga), salad-burnet (Sanguisorba minor), common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris) and dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule). Other plant species found include squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica).|$|E
50|$|The main {{species of}} grass is <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus erectus), though {{tor-grass}} (Brachypodium pinnatum) is also common. In areas of heavy grazing, sheep fescue (Festuca ovina) and meadow oat-grass (Helictotrichon pratense) can take over. Blue sedge (Carex flacca), spring sedge (Carex caryophyllea), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), burnet saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga), and devilâ€™s bit (Succisa pratensis) are also common.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} {{is dominated}} by grasses such as <b>upright</b> <b>brome,</b> sheep's fescue, {{and there is little}} tor-grass. The latter makes the common different from others in the region. Herbs include rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil, salad burnet and wild thyme. Orchids are in abundance including autumn lady's tresses, green-winged orchid and fragrant orchid, particularly in the quarry areas. There are scrub areas of hawthorn and there some trees such as ash.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} plateau supports tor-grass, <b>upright</b> <b>brome,</b> sheep's fescue and quaking grass. This area {{is relatively}} short {{as it is}} grazed and there is recreational use. The slopes support a higher sward {{and this is the}} area for insect life. Herbs recorded include chalk milkwort, clustered bellflower, kidney vetch and autumn gentian. There are several species of orchid which include frog orchid, bee orchid and musk orchid. The rare pasqueflower is recorded at this site.|$|E
50|$|The small {{site is a}} {{steeply sloping}} area of meadow and woodland, {{and it has been}} {{designated}} an SSSI as a rare example of unimproved chalk grassland. Grass species include <b>upright</b> <b>brome,</b> false brome and sheep's fescue, and there are many orchids, especially common twayblade and common spotted orchid. There are also many butterflies, such as marbled white and the rare Duke of Burgundy. The woodland has birds such as green woodpeckers and finches.|$|E
50|$|A {{diversity}} of soil types, slope, aspect and {{past and present}} land-use {{has given rise to}} various grassland communities. Historical evidence suggests that large areas of grassland are of great antiquity, and areas which were cultivated {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century have experienced nearly 100 years of chalk grassland re-colonisation. Parts of East Salisbury Plain and the periphery of Central and West comprise areas of grassland currently managed for grazing pasture and hay-cutting, whilst the middle of Centre and West are ungrazed. A large proportion of Salisbury Plain supports <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus erectus) species-rich grassland, within which a continuous floristic variation is seen. A widespread type on the plain is characterised by an abundance of red fescue (Festuca rubra), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), lady's bedstraw (Galium verum), rough hawkbit (Leontodon hispidus), common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium) and dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris). The high constancy of this last species is a distinctive feature of the <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> grasslands on Salisbury Plain and is otherwise only known from one other site in Hampshire. Where <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> is less dominating, plants such as small scabiosa (Scabiosa columbaria), clustered bellflower (Campanula glomerata), dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) are characteristic associates.The rare and notable plants which occur here include burnt-tip orchid (Neotinea ustulata), slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), field fleawort (Senecio integrifolius) and the nationally scarce British endemic early gentian (Gentianella anglica). Particularly associated with long established turf on thin rendzina soils, and rabbit-grazed areas of the eastern and central ranges, are low-growing perennials including squinancy-wort (Asperula cynanchica), chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), wild thyme (Thymus praecox), the nationally scarce bastard toadflax (Thesium humifusum) and purple milk-vetch (Astragalus danicus) in its most southerly British station.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of unimproved species-rich chalk grassland {{on the edge}} of Salisbury Plain, parts of it with over forty plant species per square metre, and supports some uncommon butterflies. Its slopes of the Lower Chalk mostly face south-west, and there are two combes. The sward is notable for <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus erectus) and sheepâ€™s fescue (Festuca ovina). Other plants include quaking grass! crested hair-grass, Birdâ€™s-foot-trefoil, dwarf thistle, small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and hoary plantain (Plantago media).|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} chalk {{grassland}} which {{is rich in}} both plant and invertebrate species which have sharply declined nationally. The areas vary, with the dominant grass being sheep's fescue in some, which have the greatest variety of plants, while others with deeper soils have coarser grasses such as <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> and tall oat-grass. Flowers include bee and fly orchids, the latter of which is becoming scarce. Invertebrates include a variety of butterflies, harvest spiders and slow-worms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{grassland}} {{is generally}} dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), red fescue (Festuca rubra), and <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus erectus). There are also several varieties of herbs, characteristic to the Wiltshire downland, including for devil's bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), and chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea). There are also many other native and site specific plants, including for orchids, meadow grasses, nettles, and other flora. On the steep slopes horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), Thymus, and Asperula is plentiful ...|$|E
50|$|Plants which grow on {{the western}} scree include {{pyramidal}} orchid, autumna gentian and wild mignonette. The areas of the quarry which are now grassed support tor-grass and <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> mixed with other species. These include fairy flax, harebell, dropwort, field scabious, lady's bedstraw, quaking-grass and woolly thistle. It is recorded that the bare limestone rubble, {{which is on the}} face of the main excavation area, used to support the rare perfoliate or Cotswold pennycress. This has not been seen for some time.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} plants is wide and {{includes}} bee orchid, horseshoe vetch and chalk milkwort. The site supports an abundant population of pyramidal orchids. Typical plants which flourish {{on the site}} are cowslip, salad burnet, common rock-rose, yellow-rattle, burnet-saxifrage, oxeye daisy, spring-sedge (Carex caryophyllea) and marjoram. Grasses include <b>upright</b> <b>brome,</b> quaking-grass, sweet vernal-grass, crested hair-grass, yellow oat-grass and sheep's fescue. Tor-grass is dominant but in small areas. Devil's-bit scabious is present on the lower slopes. Sainfoin has entered the site from surrounding fields.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{management method}} of sheep grazing {{is used to}} control the growth of tor-grass and <b>upright</b> <b>brome.</b> This encourages the wild flowers to flourish and to spread. Cattle grazing helps to control scrub, the clearance and control of which is important to maintain the open areas of pasture. The correct grazing balance has to be maintained - too much will overgraze the site and too little will allow the vigorous grasses to flourish {{to the detriment of}} the flowers.|$|E
5000|$|... "Where the sward {{has been}} more lightly grazed <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> Bromus erectus, hairy {{oat-grass}} Avenula pubescens, cock's-foot Dactylis glomerata and false oat-grass Arrhenatherum elatius become more predominant. Associated with these are herbs such as yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, greater knapweed Centaurea scabiosa and common knapweed Centaurea nigra as well as species common to the whole site like salad burnet and cowslip. In these areas there are also colonies of meadow saxifrage Saxifraga granulata and small populations of both greater butterfly orchid Platanthera chlorantha and adder's-tongue Ophioglossum vulgatum." ...|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of a small area of species-rich magnesian limestone grassland, a vegetation type that is rare nationally and mainly restricted to County Durham and Tyne and Wear. There are two distinct plant communities, the larger of which, dominated by blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, and small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria, is known only from east Durham. The other community, dominated by <b>upright</b> <b>brome,</b> Bromus erectus, is common on limestone in southern England but is at its northern limit in Durham, {{where there are no}} other protected sites.|$|E
50|$|The hill's {{vegetation}} is species-rich chalk grassland, {{dominated by}} <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> and false oat-grass, but with many species characteristic of this habitat, including a strong {{population of the}} rare knapweed broomrape. This vegetation {{has led to a}} 2.3 ha area of the site being notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, this notification initially being given in 1965. The site is unique in that its slopes have 360-degree aspects, allowing comparison between growth of the flora on the differently-facing slopes of the hill.|$|E
