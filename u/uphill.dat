5|$|In 1986, Weston General Hospital {{was opened}} {{on the edge of}} <b>Uphill</b> village, {{replacing}} the Queen Alexandra Memorial Hospital on The Boulevard, which was opened in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The {{very short}} prologue {{contained}} three sharp corners. The first two kilometers were slightly <b>uphill,</b> {{the third one}} was slightly downhill and the rest was flat.|$|E
50|$|Skaters {{routinely}} achieve downhill {{speeds of}} 60 km/h (37 mph), similar to cyclists. Compared to cyclists, though, skaters particularly suffer on <b>uphills,</b> when the drafting advantage disappears.|$|R
50|$|The film depicts {{not only}} the life style of the upper Dolpo people of the mid western <b>uphills</b> of Nepal but also their {{traditional}} customs, for example celestial burial.|$|R
50|$|The {{aerodynamic}} shape causes {{somewhat higher}} weight, even if carbon fiber is used. In very hilly races {{where a lot}} of time is spent in slow <b>uphills,</b> a low-weight traditional road bicycle might be preferred.|$|R
5|$|Weston-super-Mare has {{expanded}} to include the established villages of Milton, Worle, <b>Uphill,</b> Oldmixon, West Wick and Wick St. Lawrence, {{as well as new}} areas such as St. Georges and Locking Castle.|$|E
5|$|Against this background, in 1768 a {{committee}} of men commissioned James Brindley to survey a route, {{in the form of}} a canal, between Taunton and Exeter; and the survey was duly carried out by Robert Whitworth in 1769. This was to have been called the Exeter to <b>Uphill</b> Canal; as it involved a route from Topsham or Exeter to Taunton, then the use of the River Tone and a second canal from Burrow Bridge, via Bridgwater, Glastonbury, Wells and Axbridge, to <b>Uphill,</b> near Weston-super-Mare. Nothing further came of the plan until the 1790s, when various canal engineers were consulted, and in 1794 John Rennie was asked by a different committee, the Grand Western Canal Committee, to make another survey, which was adopted, and formed the basis for a planned Act of Parliament. Opposition from the City of Exeter, who feared it would compete with the Exeter Canal for transportation of coal, was eventually softened; and the Act was passed on 24 March 1796.|$|E
5|$|In September, a poll {{conducted}} by the Goldwater campaign revealed that Johnson had a comfortable lead over him. Indeed, Goldwater's campaign was an <b>uphill</b> battle against an incumbent administration during a prosperous economy. In {{the wake of the}} death of John Kennedy, who had been leading in polls for reelection in 1964, there lingered the possibility that Johnson had the sympathy of the media and voters.|$|E
5000|$|Being able {{to tackle}} hills {{efficiently}} {{can be a}} [...] "Race Winner" [...] for anyone. Because downhills can be decided in seconds, <b>uphills</b> takes minutes, and being a good climber {{makes it possible to}} drop several riders behind.|$|R
5000|$|Jaigaon {{is located}} at [...] Jaigaon has a hilly and sloppy terrain. The town is {{situated}} at the India-Bhutan border with Phuentsholing. There are several streams coming from the <b>uphills</b> and joining the river Toorsa at the downtown.|$|R
50|$|The {{film has}} also {{been shot in the}} <b>uphills</b> of one of the oldest army cantonments in India, Roorkee Cantonment. The Dramatics Team of the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee also helped in the several scenes shot in the cantonment.|$|R
5|$|Magnetic Hill is on {{the northwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Moncton {{and is now the}} city's most famous attraction. It is a gravity hill optical illusion, where the local topography gives the impression that you are going <b>uphill</b> when in fact you are going downhill.|$|E
5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with {{an abundance of}} deer. Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer would be when they are moving <b>uphill</b> (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
5|$|The floods {{also hit}} the Church of England primary school, with the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service {{evacuating}} pupils and staff {{from the school}} in life rafts. The evacuation used four rafts, rescuing pupils and teachers from the school through windows. The 165 people (140 pupils and 25 members of staff) were taken <b>uphill</b> to the parish hall, where blankets and sleeping bags had been provided.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{frequent}} bus service in the town Monday to Saturday. There is no Sunday service available. The buses serve the <b>uphills</b> of Gainsborough, downhills and Morton. The bus numbers 1 and 1a service goes around Gainsborough and to Morton. The number 2 bus serves the <b>uphills</b> only. The buses are operated by Stagecoach. There are services to number of places, including the hourly 100 services going to Lincoln and Scunthorpe, the 106 and 107 going to Lincoln, and the 95 and 97, going to Retford. There are also buses, the service 98, that goes to Doncaster running approximately every 2 hours Monday to Saturday [...] The town's bus station is located on Hickmen Street.|$|R
50|$|The 2013 race {{starts and}} {{finishes}} at Lumbermen's Arch in Stanley Park. The courses consist rolling terrain, forest trials, bridges, <b>uphills</b> and downhills. The current route begins at Lumbermen's Arch, passes Lost Lagoon, {{and then goes}} through the forest trials in Stanley Park.|$|R
500|$|A {{course is}} {{expected}} to test the skier's technical and physical abilities, to be {{laid out in a}} manner that takes advantage of the natural terrain, and to provide smooth transitions among <b>uphills,</b> downhills and [...] "undulating" [...] terrain—distributed approximately evenly among the three. The manual advocates that courses present a variety of <b>uphills,</b> varying in lengths and gradients between 6% and 12%, which are arrayed efficiently within the venue. It cites two types of stadium, the horseshoe (preferred for television) and the [...] "ski in, ski out" [...] layout. It emphasizes the importance of accommodating television coverage at the start, finish, and exchange zones for equipment or relays. In addition, television coverage requires a variety of facilities to support the activities of the press.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} list numbers {{the locks}} from the River Avon in Bristol to the River Thames. It includes one lock {{that has been}} removed (98, Ufton Lock) and two that have been combined to form a single deep lock (8 and 9, now Bath Deep Lock). Travelling from Bristol to Reading, locks 1 to 54 are <b>uphill,</b> and locks 55 to 107 are downhill.|$|E
5|$|The illness-enforced layoff left Craig {{facing an}} <b>uphill</b> battle {{to regain his}} place in the {{national}} team. Prior {{to the start of the}} 1959–60 season, Craig recovered his health and toured South Africa with a Commonwealth XI, where he scored 276 runs at 55.20 including a century against a combined Transvaal XI.|$|E
5|$|Although {{called an}} offstream storage {{reservoir}} by USBR, the reservoir floods {{part of the}} San Luis Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, is not the primary water source for the reservoir. Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O'Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and <b>uphill</b> into San Luis Reservoir, which functions as an additional water source during dry periods.|$|E
2500|$|A {{course is}} {{expected}} to test the skier's technical and physical abilities, to be {{laid out in a}} manner that takes advantage of the natural terrain, and to provide smooth transitions among <b>uphills,</b> downhills and [...] "undulating" [...] terrain (distributed approximately evenly among the three). The manual advocates that courses present a variety of <b>uphills,</b> varying in lengths and gradients between 6% and 12%, and which are arrayed efficiently within the venue. Terms include: definitions of climbs—major (9-18% for more than 30 m), short (9-18% for 10 to 29 m) and steep (greater than 18% for less than 10 m)—and definitions for maximum climb, total climb and for various differences in height, along the way. Course widths vary among 3, 6, 9 and 12 m, depending on the event.|$|R
2500|$|Cross Country Mountain Bike Trail is [...] long. It {{features}} creek crossing, dirt roads, singe track {{riding and}} long <b>uphills</b> and downhills. It {{is divided into}} three loops and runs outside the park into Ozark National Forest. Riders are required to carry a permit from the park offices to ride the trail.|$|R
5000|$|Enduro in {{its most}} basic {{definition}} {{is a type of}} mountain bike racing where the downhills are timed, and the <b>uphills</b> are not. Riders are timed in stages that are primarily downhill, with neutral [...] "transfer" [...] stages in between. The transfer stages usually must be completed within a time-limit, but {{are not part of the}} accumulated time.|$|R
5|$|Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, {{the band}} {{completed}} the concert film The Song Remains the Same {{and the accompanying}} soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an <b>uphill</b> battle to recapture the public's affection.|$|E
5|$|Like Williams, Smith {{knew the}} Mad Dogs would face an <b>uphill</b> battle {{attracting}} fans once the traditional American football season started. As {{was the case}} in Birmingham, Smith persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sundays to avoid competing against high school and Tennessee/Ole Miss football. It was to no avail; late in the season the Mad Dogs struggled to attract more than 10,000 people. Like Williams, Smith publicly blamed community apathy and media hostility for the lackluster attendance. The team went 9–9 in their only year.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The <b>uphill</b> take-off was more difficult and the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E
50|$|Observatory Road {{is located}} in the Tsim Sha Tsui area of the Kowloon Peninsula and is about 200 metres in length. Despite its {{relatively}} short length, however, it is a significant historical area especially since some buildings from the old era still stand alongside the newer imposing structures of modern Kowloon. The road runs <b>uphills</b> and downhills on the Observatory Hill.|$|R
50|$|Its name {{etymology}} {{indicated that}} it is located on a volcanic plateau and the area affected by past lava flows. The area around Achada Furna and <b>uphills</b> are surrounded by smaller hills, once that were small volcanoes made out of the early eruptions up to as early as thousands or {{tens of thousands of}} years ago. Northeast of the village is a hill with a caldeira and is partly terraced.|$|R
50|$|The player {{controls}} Hiroki Koukami, a wanderer driver. He is able {{to defeat}} every rival and challenges every Slashers from Hakone, Haruna, Nikko, Omote Rokko and Irohazaka. After he beats Speed King, Iroha's <b>Uphill's</b> Slasher, he challenges Hamagaki, aka Kaido President, who drives a yellow Pantera GTS (black Acura NSX-R in US Version) and holds the title of «Emotional King». As he defeats him, he takes his title, become the new Emotional King, while Hamagaki lost it and becomes a merely Trickster.|$|R
5|$|The {{courses of}} the rivers Parrett, Somerset Axe, Brue and Cary {{run across the}} Somerset Levels and have {{generally}} been changed to improve the flow. The River Axe rises from Wookey Hole Caves, due to water draining into the ground at swallet holes {{on top of the}} Mendips. The river passes through Panborough Moor, Wedmore Moor, Ox Moor, Stoke Moor and Mark Moor and reaches the sea at <b>Uphill</b> (near Weston-super-Mare) on Bridgwater Bay.|$|E
5|$|The mainly flat {{landscape}} of Weston {{is dominated by}} Worlebury Hill, 109 metres (357ft), which borders the entire northern edge of the town, and Bleadon Hill, 176 metres (577ft) which together with the River Axe, and Brean Down at <b>Uphill</b> form its southern border. In {{the centre of the}} town is Ellenborough Park a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the range of plant species found there.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continued}} past Redbird {{into the}} town of Stockton, where it left Cassadaga Creek and headed <b>uphill</b> as it curved to the west. In Centralia, NY380 met CR54 and CR57 at a four-way intersection. Here, NY380 {{turned back to the}} north and descended into another valley surrounding the Bear Lake Outlet. The route crossed the outlet and followed the waterway into the hamlet of Stockton, centered on the intersection between NY380 and NY424 (now part of CR58).|$|E

Moreover, he ran in the gruelling Comrades Marathon, a 90 km event between the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, and came fourth of 92 entrants. Dodds' time was 6 hours, 25 minutes and 15 seconds and he won the novices' trophy, an award given to the fastest first time entrant. Of the race he commented: [...] "The downhills bothered me more than the <b>uphills.</b> My legs became so jarred that I thought I {{would not be able}} to finish." ...|$|R
