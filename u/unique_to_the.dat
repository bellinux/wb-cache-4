5|$|Bristol, {{the largest}} city in South West England, has an eclectic {{combination}} of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, was developed, and several examples have survived.|$|E
40|$|Consider the {{nonlinear}} matrix equation X-sum_{i= 1 }^{m}A_{i}^{*}X^{- 1 }A_{i}=Q. This paper {{shows that}} there exists a unique positive definite solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equation without any restriction on A_{i}. Three perturbation bounds for <b>the</b> <b>unique</b> solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equation are evaluated. A backward error of an approximate solution for <b>the</b> <b>unique</b> solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equation is derived. Explicit expressions of the condition number for <b>the</b> <b>unique</b> solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equation are obtained. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples.

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{musical instrument}} of the Toraja is a bamboo flute called a Pa'suling (suling is an Indonesian word for flute). This six-holed flute (not <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Toraja) is played at many dances, such as the thanksgiving dance Ma'bondensan, where the flute accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. The Toraja have indigenous musical instruments, such as the Pa'pelle (made from palm leaves) and the Pa'karombi (the Torajan version of a jaw harp). The Pa'pelle is played during harvest time and at house inauguration ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron hosts {{numerous}} sailing regattas featuring clinker built boats <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area; {{there is}} a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone. Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and coley can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and mackerel are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} major Final Fantasy game for mobile devices, Before Crisis was {{designed}} as a gameplay and multiplayer experience <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platform. It is {{the first major}} project directed by Hajime Tabata, who created the initial concept at the request of Tetsuya Nomura for a game that had the Turks as protagonists. The music was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, originally a sound arranger at Square Enix. It was highly successful upon release, registering 200,000 users and being accessed over one million times. Western critics have generally praised the title, but due to issues involving the capacity of mobile devices in the west, it has not been released outside Japan.|$|E

During the mid-19th century Bristol Byzantine, a style <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most architectural periods of the United Kingdom {{can be seen in the}} city. Surviving elements of the fortifications and castle date to the medieval period, and the Church of St James dates back to the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Cross Days is {{a visual}} novel. These are {{essentially}} played by watching {{and listening to}} episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, clickable actions or responses when they are presented to the player. These choices are intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing {{the direction of the}} story as each is made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. <b>Unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game are yaoi routes, in which the protagonist crossdresses as a maid and engages in homosexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Gordon Guymer of the Queensland Herbarium {{published}} a taxonomic revision of Brachychiton; he classified B. rupestris {{in the section}} Delabechea along with the related and newly described Proserpine bottle tree. A third species, from southeast Queensland, has been recognised but not yet described. <b>Unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> section, all three species have bulbous trunks and can have large cavities in the vertical wood parenchyma. The genus Brachychiton lies within an Australasian clade within the subfamily Sterculioideae (previously family Sterculiaceae) in a large broadly defined Malvaceae. It is only distantly related to Sterculia, belonging to a different clade within the Sterculioideae.|$|E

5|$|In Proto-Indo-European religion, {{the moon}} was personified as the male god *Meh1not. The ancient Sumerians {{believed}} that {{the moon was}} the god Nanna, who {{was the father of}} Inanna, the goddess of the planet Venus, and Utu, the god of the sun. Nanna was later known as Sîn, and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery. In Greco-Roman mythology, the Sun and the Moon are represented as male and female, respectively (Helios/Sol and Selene/Luna); this is a development <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern Mediterranean and traces of an earlier male moon god in the Greek tradition are preserved in the figure of Menelaus.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore shape, the species is readily identified {{with the use of}} a microscope because of its setae. Setae are a kind of unusual cystidia <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the hymenium. In shape, the setae are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (underdeveloped cystidia) can be found in the species, but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E

Although this property is not <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of rhyme for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu is a {{multi-ethnic}} city. Its original core population {{consisted of}} Bushmen aboriginals, and later Cushitic, Arab and Persian migrants. The mixture of these various groups produced the Benadiri or Reer Xamar (“People of Mogadishu”), a composite population <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> larger Benadir region. In the colonial period, European expatriates, primarily Italians, would {{also contribute to}} the city's cosmopolitan populace.|$|E
