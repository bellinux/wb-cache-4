5000|$|In December 2015, another {{commemorative}} 100 ruble banknote {{was issued}} {{to celebrate the}} [...] "reunification of Crimea and Russia". The banknote is printed on light-yellow coloured cotton paper. One side of the note is devoted to Sevastopol, the other one - to Crimea. А wide security thread is embedded into the paper. It comes out on the surface on the Sevastopol side of the banknote in the figure shaped window. A multitone combined watermark {{is located on the}} <b>unprinted</b> <b>area</b> in {{the upper part of the}} banknote. Ornamental designs run vertically along the banknote. The Sevastopol side of the note features the Monument to the Sunken Ships in Sevastopol bay and a fragment of the painting by I.K. Aivazovsky [...] "Russian Squadron on the Roads of Sevastopol". The Crimea side of the note features the Swallow’s Nest, a decorative castle and local landmark. In the lower part of the Sevastopol side of the banknote in the green stripe there is a QR-code containing a link to the Bank of Russia's webpage, which lists historical information related to the banknote. The predominant colour of the note is olive green.|$|E

The present study was conducted to eliminate or reduce the dye deposition to the <b>unprinted</b> <b>area</b> of printed polyamide 6 fabrics, during the washing process. It was found that by the use of specially selected cationic surfactant, syntans and weak alkaline conditions during the washing process the staining problem could be prevented...|$|E
40|$|Polyvinylchloride (PVC) {{has several}} uses {{and one of}} these is as the {{principal}} constituent of containers used in the storage of pharmaceutical solutions. It has been shown previously that the use of PVC containers for some liquid pharmaceutical systems has not been satisfactory in that the solute may lose potency with time. Similarly, the use of PVC as a tubing is not always desirable. In this work, the effect of each of three physicochemical variables, solute concentration, electrolyte concentration and temperature on the uptake of a number of model solutes by PVC infusion bags has been investigated. Additionally, a study on the kinetics of the sorption of the model solutes by PVC tubing has been carried out and the influence of factors such as solute concentration, flow rate, tubing diameter and tubing length on the extent of solute uptake by PVC tubing has also been investigated. It has been shown that the extent of solute uptake by PVC infusion bags is independent of the inital concentration of the solute and that both temperature and electrolyte concentration have significant effects on the extent of solute loss. The Arrhenius equation is used to describe the temperature effect on solute uptake into PVC bags. The extent of solute uptake from solution in the presence of electrolytes without large ions is a function of increasing ionic strength. A prediction model based on the diffusion model is used to describe the sorption profile of the model solutes. It is suggested that the sorption number which has been used to predict solute uptake by PVC bags needs to be adjusted by the use of correction factors for temperature and for vehicle ionic strength. A well-stirred compartment model and a well-stirred diffusion model are examined for their ability to describe the uptake of the model solutes from aqueous solutions infused through PVC tubings. It is shown that a biexponential model which is a simplified form of both the well-stirredcompartment model and the well-stirred-diffusion model can be used to adequately describe the sorption profiles of the model solutes during a 24 -hour infusion period. Furthermore, it is found that, at a certain time after the beginning of an infusion, the first exponential term of the biexponential model will approach zero and the biexponential formula will be reduced resulting in the monoexponential form which is a general form of the equation used to describe the uptake of all solutes regardless of their affinity for PVC tubings. The solute uptake by PVC tubings {{has been found to be}} independent of the initial concentration of the infusion solution while it is shown to be a function of flow rate, tubing diameter, and tubing length. In order to describe the difference in the extent of sorption between two separate kinetic runs conducted with differing flow rate, tubing diameter, and/ or tubing length, a model based on chemical similarity theory was developed. This allows for an approximation of the rate and extent of solute uptake in one system from a knowledge of the uptake in a separate system operating under different conditions. Results reported previously by other investigators for a number of drugs and those predicted using the proposed model are presented. An attempt was made to correlate the extent of sorption of the model solutes by PVC infusion bags, or by PVC tubing, with selected physicochemical properties of the solutes such as octanol-water partition coefficient, dipole moment, intrinsic molecular volume and solvatochromic parameters. The plasticizers used in the formulations of PVC bags and tubings being studied were identified. The infrared spectra and ultraviolet absorption spectra of the methanolic extracts of the PVC sheets cut from an <b>unprinted</b> <b>area</b> of PVC bag and tubing reveal that the phthalate-type plasticizer, DEHP, was used in both formulations. Therefore, the DEHPwater partition coefficients were determined for the model solutes and the utility of this value in predicting the uptake of the model solutes by PVC materials was evaluated. Some attempts to relate chemical structure and chemical interaction to solute sorption by PVC infusion bags are described...|$|E

30|$|The {{suitability}} of paper-based arrays for biofilm formation studies by Staphylococcus aureus is demonstrated. Laboratory-coated papers with different physicochemical properties {{were used as}} substrates. The array platform was fabricated by patterning the coated papers with vinyl-substituted polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -based ink. The affinity of bacteria onto the flexographically printed hydrophobic and smooth PDMS film was very low whereas bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation occurred preferentially on the <b>unprinted</b> <b>areas,</b> i.e. in the reaction arrays. The concentration of the attached bacteria was quantified by determining the viable colony forming unit (CFU/cm 2) numbers. The distribution {{and the extent of}} surface coverage of the biofilms were determined by atomic force microscopy. In static conditions, the highest bacterial concentration and most highly organized biofilms were observed on substrates with high polarity. On a rough paper surface with low polarity, the biofilm formation was most hindered. Biofilms were effectively removed from a polar substrate upon exposure to (+)-dehydroabietic acid, an anti-biofilm compound.|$|R

40|$|Printing; is {{the process}} of {{reproduction}} rapid transfering of the images, inscriptions, figures and graphics on to a surface in the original format. The dampened system offset printing is the smooth printing system. Smooth printing is based on the principal of repelling of the water by the oil inside the ink and not to be mixed with. The printed and unprinted surfaces on the plate has a chemical characteristic. The process of printing occurs in the way that. The <b>unprinted</b> <b>areas</b> captures water and repell ink, the printed areas captures ink and repell water. The dry offset system is; the combination of the flexo and dampened system offset methods. In the method the relief part of the plate transfers the image to the smooth surfaced rubber printing cylinder and the image is transferred to the material by the cylinder. Water is not needed for humidification. So the plate is not wetted before printing. The pictures or positive dias are not printed by dry ofset method but, the hand dravings, very detailed desings and quite small texts could be printed to the range of six colors. In this study, an evaluation of the comparison of the process stages and reproduction results of the two techniques is conducted...|$|R
40|$|A {{robust and}} {{objective}} {{algorithm is proposed}} for the thresholding of halftone dot images during image processing. The algorithm is based upon detection of geometric features in the frequency histogram of grey level values. Images with a strong contrast between the halftone dots and the <b>unprinted</b> background <b>area</b> {{tend to have a}} bimodal histogram, and the threshold is defined as the position of the minimum between the two peaks in the histogram. Images with a weaker contrast between the halftone dots and the background tend to have an unimodal histogram. With unimodal histograms it is necessary to determine the point of inflexion on the histogram. The algorithm automatically selects between these two approaches. The algorithm can also detect those histograms where no threshold exists...|$|R
30|$|Paper is a {{sustainable}} and recyclable material, and its physicochemical properties (topography, roughness, stiffness, surface energy, polarity, porosity and pore geometry) {{can be modified}} quite conveniently by various coating materials and methods and surface treatments (Ihalainen et al. [2012]). Furthermore, the surface of paper can be functionalized by printing of not only graphical inks but also e.g. functional polymers and biomaterials (Siegel et al. [2009]; Määttänen et al. [2011]; Tian and Shen [2011]; Li et al. [2012]; Wang et al. [2012]). By patterning paper for instance with a PDMS-based ink, printable paper-based alternatives for conventional plastic microtiter plates can be fabricated (Määttänen et al. [2011]; Juvonen et al. [2013]). The role of the low surface energy PDMS film can be to confine the liquids or, to direct biomaterial adhesion and growth of e.g. human ARPE- 19 cells on the <b>unprinted</b> (PDMS-free) <b>areas</b> as recently demonstrated (Juvonen et al.

40|$|International audienceThe {{experimentation}} {{with new ideas}} and techniques in contem-p o r a ry art can lead to substantial conservation issues in the near f u t u re, especially when the artist tries to fuse two incompatible materials into one object. This {{is the case with}} the 'Print of thre e rusted iron plates', created by the French contemporary art i s t B e rn a rd Pagès and now in the Museum of Modern Art, Saint Etienne, France. Although contemporary, this print alre a d y shows serious damage caused by the presence of iron in the p a p e r. It was so brittle that it could no longer be handled nor be displayed. This type of artefact raises fundamental questions for paper conservators: its degradation is extremely rapid and inherent to the combination of its constituents (iron compounds and paper) that obviously cannot be separated. It also necessitates investigation into the possibilities of using available chemical t reatments in order to limit the degradation mechanisms while keeping in mind that the visual appearance should re m a i n unchanged. Historical Background 'Print of three rusted iron plates' is one of the series of prints and drawings created in the 1970 's by Bern a rd Pagès while he was working {{under the influence of the}} avant-garde, Support s / S u r-faces' gro u p (Abadie 1999; Exhibition catalogue, 19 91, 2002). A s an established sculptor, he worked with raw materials and tried to escape from personal expression by using printing methods that place the object in the centre of the creation process. These methods consisted of etching a hydrochloric acid solution on steel plates in order to encourage the formation of rust. These plates were then pressed on the paper, producing prints of ru s t. F i n a l l y, the artwork was completed with graphite pencil and black ink lines that emphasised the borders of the central plate (Fig 1). Description of the Arte f a c t F rom a chemical point of view, the work is in fact a thick ru s t layer embedded in a contemporary wove paper, commonly known as 'Vélin d'Arches' and manufactured by C a n s o n. One edge features a watermark, 'Dessin-Ja-Arches-France'. The paper is now very brittle and fractured in many places. Two pieces are missing. The sharpness of the edges shows that the frac-t u res are due to loss of paper flexibility. Raking light observ a t i o n revealed undulations. <b>Unprinted</b> <b>areas</b> are light brown and hig-' E m p reinte de trois plaques de fer rouillées' (Print of three ru s t e d i ron plates) was produced in the 1970 's by the artist Bern a rd Pagès according to a specific protocol: steel plates were etched with a hydrochloric acid solution then pressed onto paper to create ru s t prints. Although contemporary, this work of art already shows serious damage caused by the presence of iron in the paper. Various conservation treatment possibilities were explored to pre-s e rve the artefact. Replicas were made and used to evaluate the dif-f e rent options. The application of the calcium phytate tre a t m e n t, initially developed for iron gall ink corroded manuscripts, was investigated and it turned out to be efficient in preventing degradation of the replicas. The addition of alcohol to the treatment solutions was also considered, but was eventually not tested, as it tends to decrease the treatment effectiveness. It was finally decided to use pure aqueous solutions and to float the artefact during the treatment. The treatment was undertaken twice without inducing any visual changes to the artefact. Some free iron (II) still remained in the paper after treatment but to a much lesser extent than before treatment. This suggests that the intervention was at least partially effective. As the artefact re q u i red consolidation and lining, the capabilities of several commonly used adhesives that change paper sensitivity to water were evaluated and compare d. Gelatine was finally chosen for consolidation as it renders the paper the most hydrophobic compared with starch, hydro x y p ro-pylcellulose or methylcellulose. After lining, the artefact was mounted in a frame specially designed for safe display...|$|R
