Their history, choreography and variations are comparatively investigated across the common law jurisdictions including the impact of statutory interventions. The principal argument is that the judicial and legislative treatment of these <b>uxorial</b> privileges has been inconsistent or erratic {{so that they are}} not the products of any systematic, modern development {{in the criminal}} law. This thesis proposes that there is no justification for their continued retention in common law legal systems. Archival, Parliamentary, and other sources have been used to identify the factors impinging upon the creation of specific statutory <b>uxorial</b> privileges. The diaspora of these laws throughout the other common law jurisdictions is investigated. The discussion is illustrated by examination of the particular issues raised by polygamy, customary law concubinage as well as by gender-reassignment. This thesis examines whether both gender-specific and marriage-specific criteria are valid constituents within the parameters of substantive criminal law. It traces the genesis of these special defences within the criminal law available exclusively to women, from the time of King Ine of the West Saxons c 712, to examine the current status of such laws throughout common law jurisdictions. The investigation explores factors shaping the creation of a statutory defence of marital coercion by the British Parliament in 1925 and outlines the challenges generated by that law and its extraordinary resilience. This thesis demonstrates the failure of the criminal law to provide an overarching construct to implement emergent gender equality...|$|E
40|$|The political, {{social and}} {{cultural}} histories of Wales before 1282, which focus on themes associated with the evolution of nationhood — namely conquest, coexistence and change — are incomplete because treatments of a collective Welsh identity fail to address women’s experiences. This thesis examines the sources largely associated with Wales during the Age of Princes, analysing how married women are identified and what types of agency are associated with them. An investigation into the <b>uxorial</b> lifecycle helps to highlight the gendered cultural and social expectations that women faced more generally. Comparing and contrasting conventional gender constructs found in medieval Welsh sources with evidence of women’s employment of agency highlights {{the status of women}} in society and provides a more balanced assessment of Wales before 1282. Chapter 1 discusses Welsh native sources and traditions. It examines the complexities of analysis concerning the dissemination of gender ideals found in sources composed largely during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, many of which were influenced by oral tradition. Chapter 2 looks at the development of <b>uxorial</b> identity. It investigates the lifecycle of the wife defined in native law, including discussions on the commodification of gender and the practice of concubinage. An examination of how the <b>uxorial</b> lifecycle is constructed in the Welsh chronicles and the identification of the most idealized <b>uxorial</b> traits found across the sources is also discussed. Chapter 3 considers the concept of native Welsh queenship and the status of wives as queens. Three key issues are explored: to what extent there was an ideal of queenship in native Wales; the core ideologies and expectations of the office of the queen; and how the use of titles and other designations denotes status. Chapter 4 reviews evidence of Welsh queenship in practice by looking at the political agency rulers’ wives exercised. Chapter 5 examines charter evidence concerning female land ownership and women’s involvement within their family lordships, localities and against a wider political backdrop...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the vastness}} {{and variety of}} Leon Battista Alberti's work, the theme of love seems to pose a rather {{intractable}} problem, approached so far as a mere expression of his chameleonic versatility and, as such, as a juvenile example of his rhetorical mastery. And yet, the pervasiveness of the theme of love [...] amicable love, fraternal love, paternal love, <b>uxorial</b> love, but also sentimental love [...] in his writings claims {{for a more detailed}} account. This article aims at discussing Alberti's personal treatment of love by focusing on his Deifira, the first love dialogue ever written in the Italian vernacular, in accordance with its intellectual outline, its phenomenological design, and its philosophical significance, in order to illuminate what can be understood as an archeology of the emotional experience [...] an archeology of the emotional gestures and of the emotional words concealed in Alberti's amorous writings...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The perscr. dtive {{threshold}} of adulthood among late-medieval Venetian patricians appears very different {{for men and}} for women, centering on social (i. e., public) puberty as the gauge of male adulthood, physiological (ie., childbearing) puberty that of fimale. Yet in practice men did not inevitably achieve the normative patriarchal outcome of a graduated, formalized adolescence; nor did adokscence end for all women with leenaged marriage and motherhood. Non-patriarchal male adulthoodr and the graduated phases of the <b>uxorial</b> cycle for women modifv the impression of sharp gender contrast that results from viewing age at marriage M the pivot of adulthood. Graduated adulthood in both sexes gave {{men and women alike}} the possibility of varied adult identities, responding to a range of choice and circumstance. In 1474, Agnesina da Mula Loredan, a Venetian patrician woman pregnant with her fourth child, took pen in hand to write her will. As her residuary heirs she named her three children and "the creature I am making, " but she ordered that none of them were to get their bequests "until they became their own masters, that is, my sons at twenty and my daughters at sixteen; at that point they may dispose of their Stonley Chojnacki received his PhD. in history from the University of Colifornia, Berkefey.
