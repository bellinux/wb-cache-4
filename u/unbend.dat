The direction of the macroscopic motion could be controlled by the polarization direction. The bending occurred because the free surface of the material contracted more than {{the inside of the}} thin film (due to absorption of laser light as it passes through the film).|$|E

40|$|Wenderoth and O’Connor (1987 b) {{reported}} that, although matches to {{the straight}} edge of two triangles placed apex to apex revealed an apparent bending {{in the direction}} of the chevron formed by the hypotenuse pair (the Bourdon effect), no perceptual <b>unbending</b> of the bent chevron occurred. Using subjective contour figures, Walker and Shank (1988 b) found large and approximately equal bending and <b>unbending</b> effects, consistent with two theories that they proposed. In Experiment 1, using adjustable chevron matching and subjective contours, we found that Bourdon effects, equivalent in magnitude to those reported by Walker and Shank, were 4 - 5 times larger than <b>unbending</b> effects. In Experiment 2, we used a variation of Walker and Shank’s measurement technique, in which subjects selected a matching angle from a graded series. We obtained Bourdon effects similar to those in Experiment 1, but much larger <b>unbending</b> effects. Nevertheless, Bourdon effects were significantly larger than <b>unbending</b> effects in one set of data; and in another, Bourdon test means were larger than <b>unbending</b> test means. In both data sets, there was a large and significant pretest bending effect, which enhanced the magnitude of <b>unbending</b> test minus pretest scores. These results were consistent with our theory but not the theories of Walker and Shank. The variance of <b>unbending</b> test matches, 3 - 4 times that of Bourdon test matches, reflected the task difficulty. We propose that subjective obtuse angle contraction that exceeds real obtuse angle contraction explains the fact that <b>unbending</b> effects are larger in subjective than in real contours...|$|R

An acidic indole was detected in hook diffusates by fluorometry; triiodobenzoic acid, an inhibitor of auxin transport, prevented red light-induced <b>unbending,</b> and indoleacetic acid can be substituted for tissue just above the elbow region as an inhibitor of opening. Indoleacetic acid also stimulated growth of shank cells, and red light increased the sensitivity of this tissue to the hormone.

5000|$|Structural {{biologists}} achieve {{resolutions of}} a few ångströms (up from a to few nanometers {{in the past when}} samples used to be negatively stained) for membrane forming proteins in regular two-dimensional arrays, but prefer the usage of the programs 2dx, EMAN2, and IPLT. These programs are based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) image processing programs [...] and possess additional functionality such as the [...] "unbending" [...] of the image. As the name suggests, <b>unbending</b> of the image is conceptually equivalent to [...] "flattening out and relaxing to equilibrium positions" [...] one building block thick samples so that all 2D periodic motifs are as similar as possible and all building blocks of the array possess the same crystallographic orientation with respect to a cartesian coordinate system that is fixed to the microscope. (The microscope's optical axis typically serves as the z-axis.) <b>Unbending</b> is often necessary when the 2D array of membrane proteins is paracrystalline rather than genuinely crystalline. It was estimated that <b>unbending</b> approximately doubles the spatial resolution with which the shape of molecules can be determined Inorganic crystals are much stiffer than 2D periodic protein membrane arrays so that {{there is no need for}} the <b>unbending</b> of images that were taken from suitably thinned parts of these crystals. Consequently, the CRISP program does not possess the <b>unbending</b> image processing feature but offers superior performance in the so-called phase origin refinement.|$|R

40|$|Research objective. To define methodological {{approaches}} to pedagogical control of dynamics of motor and functional readiness of girls aged 15 - 16. Research methods. To solve the tasks set, the study used the following methods: analysis {{of scientific and}} methodological literature, pedagogical testing and methods of mathematical statistics of data reduction. The testing program consisted of the commonly known tests: jumping with “increases f weight” (number of jumps in the given corridor), evaluation of time parameters of movement (error in re-creating the duration of five-second running in place), evaluation of perception of strength movement parameters (the error in re-creating the efforts is 0. 5 of the maximum), shuttle run 4 × 9 m (s), bending and <b>unbending</b> of arms from the lying position (times), bending and <b>unbending</b> of arms in suspension (times), bent suspension (s), standing long jump (cm). Research results. The girls aged 15 show statistically significantly better readiness {{by the results of}} the tests: No.   1 “Jumping with ‘increases of weight’, times”, No.   3 “Bending and <b>unbending</b> of arms from the lying position, times”, No.   5 “Bent suspension, s”, and by the indicators of functional tests (p < 0. 05). The most informative indicators for the routine control of the motor readiness of girls aged 15 are the following tests: “Bending and <b>unbending</b> of arms from the lying position” (, 951), Ghencea test (, 929), “Standing long jump (cm) ” (, 930), “Shuttle run 4 × 9 m, s” (, 911). The most informative indicators for the routine control of the motor readiness of girls aged 16 are the following tests: Ghencea test (, 945), “Bending and <b>unbending</b> of arms in suspension” (, 883), “Bending and <b>unbending</b> of arms from the lying position” (, 823) ...|$|R
