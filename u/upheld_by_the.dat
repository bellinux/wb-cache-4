5|$|In 1977, another {{investigation}} was {{undertaken by the}} States forensic labs of the Netherlands using up-to-date techniques, including gas chromatography, to formally confirm the origin of six van Meegeren forgeries that had been alleged to be genuine Vermeers, including the Emmaus and the Last Supper. The conclusions of the 1946 commission were again reaffirmed and <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dutch judicial system.|$|E
5|$|The State Attorney's {{appeal was}} heard {{by a panel}} of three judges of the Prague High Court, chaired by judge Jiří Lněnička. The hearing took place in Blythe's absence. Blythe's {{acquittal}} was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> panel on June 5, 2013.|$|E
60|$|Gautier de Brusac was {{spokesman}} for the timid ones; Joan's side was resolutely <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> d'Alencon, <b>the</b> Bastard, La Hire, the Admiral of France, the Marshal de Boussac, {{and all the other}} really important chiefs.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 in a {{case that}} was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Railway Commission and the US Supreme Court prices were raised. Increased sales to the city {{interested}} the CWC because they purchased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of water used and not <b>by</b> <b>the</b> land size.|$|R
50|$|The ensuing {{controversy}} {{caused a}} statewide referendum {{to be passed}} by 63% that changed the way Regents were appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Governor and was <b>upheld</b> unanimously <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hawaii Supreme Court.|$|R
5|$|According to {{a verdict}} {{delivered}} by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death. However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held criminally liable, {{and most of the}} blame lay with promoters and security members. The acquittal was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Prague High Court on June 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{judicial}} district included his native Pulaski County, {{as well as}} Rockcastle, Wayne and Clinton counties. During his tenure, blacks were allowed to serve on trial juries in the district for the first time. Of the first 16 opinions he issued during his time on the bench, 15 were <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Court of Appeals, Kentucky's court of last resort at the time.|$|E
50|$|The appellate {{decision}} was <b>upheld</b> unanimously <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court. While it generally agreed with that decision, the court detailed {{what it felt}} to be the correct reasoning in arriving at the result.|$|R
60|$|The {{principle}} of making all lawful expenses of a charge, not upon the candidate, but upon <b>the</b> locality, was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> two of <b>the</b> best witnesses (pp. 20, 65-70, 277).|$|R
50|$|The {{advocacy}} organization has continued working with Michael Goodwin on this case. Los Angeles subsequently filed charges in 2004 and Goodwin was tried in 2006 for the murders. In 2007, Goodwin was convicted. He appealed in 2014 and <b>the</b> conviction was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Appellate Court and the California Supreme Court.|$|R
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|Portland, Oregon police {{officers}} searched {{the home of}} James Butler Elkins, ostensibly for obscene material, and seized tape recordings that Elkins had made from illegal wiretaps. He was subsequently convicted in federal court of intercepting and divulging telephone communications, but appealed his federal conviction {{on the grounds that}} state police had gathered the evidence against him in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. His conviction was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The November 2011 general {{election}} delivered a landslide victory to the People's Party, whose leader Mariano Rajoy {{said that he}} opposed same-sex marriage, but any decision about repealing the law could be made only after the ruling of the Constitutional Court. On 6 November 2012, the law was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Court with 8 support votes and 3 against. Minister of Justice Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón announced that the Government will abide the ruling and the law will not be repealed.|$|E
50|$|Lou Brown {{played for}} City {{on his return}} from Wigan, causing a protest from Newton who he had {{previously}} played for. <b>The</b> complaint was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Auckland Rugby League and the New Zealand Rugby League and Brown was suspended for three weeks until {{he returned to the}} competition for Newton.|$|R

50|$|On April 16, 2010, {{the law was}} {{overturned}} by Circuit Court Judge Chris Piazza in the case Arkansas Department of Human Services v. Cole. The ruling was <b>upheld</b> unanimously <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas Supreme Court on April 7, 2011.|$|R
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{substantial}} {{revision of the}} election law came in February 2015, and was partially <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not only {{for a list of}} candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E
5|$|Two Deputy Returning Officers {{were charged}} by the DGEQ with violating {{elections}} laws, but in 1996 were found not guilty (a decision <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Quebec Court of Appeal), after {{it was found that}} the ballots were not rejected in a fraudulent or irregular manner, and that there was no proof of conspiracy. A Quebec Court judge acquitted a Deputy Returning Officer charged with illegally rejecting 53% of the ballots cast at his Chomedey polling district.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was lawful. The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait, who moved to Australia in 2000 and applied for a temporary protection visa. The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.|$|E
50|$|The college's largest {{problem was}} its indebtedness. The synodical {{commission}} had chosen Princeton as the college's {{site on the}} strength of local pledges of support amounting to at least $15,000, but few of <b>the</b> pledges were <b>upheld.</b> <b>By</b> 1837 <b>the</b> college was $12,000 in debt, and five years later it was still indebted more than $5,600.|$|R
50|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} by Doubleday in March 1946, and about 60,000 copies were sold. In July, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice lodged a complaint, and 130 copies were seized from four bookstores owned by Doubleday and from the New York Public Library. The ban was challenged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> publisher, but <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> 2-1, <b>the</b> dissenter being Nathan D. Perlman.|$|R
2500|$|After {{developing}} the element stiffness matrix {{in the global}} coordinate system, they must be merged into a single “master” or “global” stiffness matrix. [...] When merging these matrices together there are two rules that must be followed: compatibility of displacements and force equilibrium at each node. [...] These rules are <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> relating <b>the</b> element nodal displacements to the global nodal displacements.|$|R
5|$|Bradley {{spent the}} entire 2003 {{campaign}} with the Indians. Despite being placed on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring and missing the final six {{weeks of the season}} with a lower back injury, he led the team in stolen bases, with 17. On August 30, while on the DL with a back injury, he was ticketed for speeding in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. After being stopped, he refused the ticket and sped away. He pleaded not guilty to speeding and fleeing charges on September 12, but was sentenced to a three-day jail term. The ruling was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of Ohio in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|Families of 45 of the 47 {{passengers}} sued Comair for negligence. (Families of {{the other}} two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation.) Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E
50|$|On July 1, 2005, Commissioner Bud Selig {{suspended}} Rogers for 20 {{games and}} fined him $50,000. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers {{appeared at the}} 2005 All-Star Game in Detroit. The suspension was subsequently <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> Selig. <b>The</b> commissioner was later overruled by independent arbitor Shyam Das, allowing Rogers to return to play after sitting out 13 games.|$|R
50|$|The Australian kelpie {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{to be the result of}} crossing dingos with English herding dogs, but this (the dingo blood) is not <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> breed documentation. <b>The</b> Australian cattle dog and stumpy-tail cattle dog breeds are known to have been influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dingo.|$|R
50|$|Snape {{was one of}} the {{principals}} in the Bangorian controversy, and in numerous pamphlets he attacked <b>the</b> principles <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> Benjamin Hoadly. <b>The</b> first of his Letters to the Bishop of Bangor passed through seventeen editions in the year of its publication, 1717.|$|R
5|$|In 2008 Bamber lost a High Court appeal {{against the}} whole-life tariff before Mr. Justice Tugendhat. This was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Court of Appeal in 2009. Bamber {{and three other}} British whole-life prisoners appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, but the appeal was {{rejected}} in 2012. Bamber and two prisoners, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore, appealed that decision too, and in 2013 the European Court's Grand Chamber ruled that keeping the prisoners in jail with no prospect of release or review may not be compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Al-Kateb {{applied for}} a {{protection}} visa, {{on the grounds that}} the United Nations 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons obliged Australia to protect him. His application was rejected, a decision <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia. In June 2002, Al-Kateb stated that he wished to voluntarily leave Australia and be sent to Kuwait or to Gaza. However attempts by the Government of Australia to remove Al-Kateb to Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria, and the Palestinian territories (which would have required the approval of Israel) failed.|$|E
5|$|In June 2001, the Brussels Correctional Court {{declared}} itself incompetent to {{hear the}} case, as it related to political misconduct. In February 2003, the Brussels Appellate Court followed and gave a similar judgement. The original plaintiffs then appealed, and the case {{was sent to the}} Court of Appeals in Ghent, which upheld the complaint; the Vlaams Blok non-profit organisations were fined, and it was deemed that the Vlaams Blok was an organisation that sanctioned discrimination. The Vlaams Blok lodged an appeal which was rejected, and in November 2004, the ruling was made definite, when it was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Court of Cassation. The ruling meant that the party would lose access to state funding and access to television, effectively shutting the party down.|$|E
5000|$|For Marx himself, the [...] "labour {{theory of}} value" [...] {{referred}} {{only to the}} theory of value <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> some of <b>the</b> classical political economists from William Petty to David Ricardo, who regarded human labour as the real substance of product value.|$|R
50|$|November 2, 2009 - The 2nd Circuit United States Court of Appeals, in a 7-4 decision, <b>upheld</b> <b>the</b> ruling <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{district}} court.|$|R
25|$|The Illinois Circuit Court {{decided that}} the search was {{unlawful}} based on the test established in the Supreme Court ruling in Spinelli v. United States. In essence, the affidavit did not provide enough evidence to establish probable cause, {{which led to the}} exclusion of evidence obtained on the basis of that warrant. This ruling was <b>upheld</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Illinois Appellate Courts and the Supreme Court of Illinois.|$|R
