40|$|Software {{components}} promise easy reuse, dependability, and simplified development. Problems {{arise when}} implicit {{assumptions about the}} use of the component are encoded in the implementation but not communicated to the user. One solution to this problem is to formally specify these constraints about a component's use. Once specified, these <b>usage</b> <b>constraints</b> can be statically verified or dynamically enforced. This dynamic enforcement code can be provided by either the developer or automatically generated. Our research project, lips, is a language for specifying <b>usage</b> <b>constraints</b> and a toolset for automatically generating dynamic code to enforce them. In this paper we present the notion of a virtual client and show how this is critical for ensuring correct usage of a component. We discuss our experiences providing automatic enforcement of <b>usage</b> <b>constraints</b> for CORBA components: While much of the needed support can be provided easily using a container concept, support for virtual clients requires more fundamental changes in a component model such as CORBA. 1...|$|E

40|$|Two {{formulations}} for continuum {{topology optimization}} of structures taking buckling considerations into account are developed, implemented, and compared. In the first, the structure undergoing a specified loading is modeled as a hyperelastic continuum at finite deformations, and is optimized {{to maximize the}} minimum critical buckling load. In the second, the structure under a similar loading is modeled as linear elastic, and the critical buckling load is computed with linearized buckling analysis. Specific issues addressed include usage of suitable "mixing rules", a node-based design variable formulation, techniques for eliminating regions devoid of structural material from the analysis problem, and consistent design sensitivity analysis. The performance of the formulations is demonstrated {{on the design of}} different structures. When problems are solved with moderate loads and generous material <b>usage</b> <b>constraints,</b> designs using compression and tension members are realized. Alternatively, when fairly large loads together with very stringent material <b>usage</b> <b>constraints</b> are imposed, structures utilizing primarily tension members result.

This dissertation addresses key issues involved in the design of such a system: (1) the interface to the external world, (2) the internal system design, (3) support for legacy applications, and (4) resource management across administrative domains. An operational prototype, the Purdue University Network Computing Hubs (PUNCH), is presented. The interface to the external world is based on a unique network desktop that provides Web access to computing services by treating URLs as locations in a dynamic, virtual, and side-effect based address-apace. The internal system design accounts for scalability and reliability, works across administrative domains, and employs a novel encoding mechanism that allows O(1) access to all managed information. The internal architecture is designed around a three-level hierarchy with replicatable components, a choice driven {{by the nature of the}} information associated with run-time tradeoff decisions. Unmodified (legacy) applications are supported by way of a highly flexible tool-specification language and a metaprogramming environment specifically designed to adapt to the needs of different tools (to date, forty tools developed by four vendors and eight universities have been installed on PUNCH). Resource management across administrative domains is enabled by a metaprogramming environment that allows administrators to specify <b>usage</b> <b>constraints</b> and policies for users and resources; cost/performance decisions are made by the network-computing system at run-time on the basis of predicted resource-usage characteristics and specified <b>usage</b> <b>constraints</b> and policies. ...|$|E

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} {{equipped with}} energy harvesting (EH) devices have attracted great attentions recently. Compared with conventional sensor networks powered by batteries, the energy harvesting {{abilities of the}} sensor nodes make sustainable and environment-friendly sensor networks possible. However, the random, scarce and non-uniform energy supply features also necessitate a completely different approach to energy management. A typical EH wireless sensor node consists of an EH module that converts ambient energy to electrical energy, which is stored in a rechargeable battery, and {{will be used to}} power the sensing and transmission operations of the sensor. Therefore, both sensing and transmission are subject to the stochastic energy constraint imposed by the EH process. In this dissertation, we investigate optimal sensing and transmission policies for EH sensor networks under such constraints. For EH sensing, our objective is to understand how the temporal and spatial variabilities of the EH processes would affect the sensing performance of the network, and how sensor nodes should coordinate their data collection procedures with each other to cope with the random and non-uniform energy supply and provide reliable sensing performance with analytically provable guarantees. Specifically, we investigate optimal sensing policies for a single sensor node with infinite and finite battery sizes in Chapter 2, status updating/transmission strategy of an EH Source in Chapter 3, and a collaborative sensing policy for a multi-node EH sensor network in Chapter 4. For EH communication, our objective is to evaluate the impacts of stochastic variability of the EH process and practical battery <b>usage</b> <b>constraint</b> on the EH systems, and develop optimal transmission policies by taking such impacts into consideration. Specifically, we consider throughput optimization in an EH system under battery <b>usage</b> <b>constraint</b> in Chapter 5...|$|R

We explain how wavelength continuity <b>constraint</b> and wavelength <b>usage</b> <b>constraint</b> affect network performance. Based on our research, we infer that, in practical WDM networks with wavelength <b>usage</b> <b>constraint,</b> increasing the total number of available wavelengths in a fiber is an attractive alternative to employing wavelength conversion.;We investigate traffic grooming performed in IP layer, where the sub-wavelength level IP packets are grouped together in electrical domain before they are sent to the WDM layer. We study IP traffic grooming problem with the objective to minimize the number of transmitters and receivers needed in the WDM layer.

40|$|It is {{the thesis}} of this work that many {{computer}} software systems being built today are similar and should be built out of reusable software components. The appropriate use of software components is investigated by analogy to the classical engineering question of whether to build an object out of custom-made parts or standard parts and assemblies. The same analogy is used to {{explain some of the}} problems with previous work on reusable software. The result of reasoning with the engineering analogy is that the reuse of software results only from the reuse of analysis, design, and code; rather than just the reuse of code. The concept of domain analysis is introduced to describe the activity of identifying the objects and operations of a class of similar systems in a particular problem domain. A domain analysis is represented by a domain-specific language, a prettyprinter, source-tosource transformations, and software components. A domain's software components map statements from the domain into other domains which are used to model the objects and operations of the domain. Software components represent implementation choices. The components are managed using a module interconnection language to insure <b>usage</b> <b>constraints.</b> The source-to-source transformations represent domain-specific optimizations, independent of any implementation, which are used to optimize statements in the domain. The transformations are useful primarily when the domain is used as a modeling domain. A method of automatically producing metarules for a set of transformations is described. The metarules remove the burden of having to suggest individual transformations from the user.
