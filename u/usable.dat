5|$|A {{receiver}} {{that takes}} the signal from the channel and converts it back into <b>usable</b> information for the recipient.|$|E
5|$|Parts {{can be made}} by hot {{pressing}} from four commercial grades of h-BN. Grade HBN contains a boron oxide binder; it is <b>usable</b> up to 550–850°C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a calcium borate binder and is <b>usable</b> at 1600°C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder and can be used up to 3000°C.|$|E
5|$|The Theater of the Clouds {{configuration}} seats 6,500, with 16 of the 70 luxury boxes being <b>usable.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} citrus plants yield pressed oils. Some, such as lemon and orange oil, {{are used as}} {{essential}} oils, which is uncommon for pressed oils. The seeds of many if not {{most members of the}} citrus family yield <b>usable</b> oils.|$|E
5|$|As far as {{the ground}} water {{necessary}} for the conversion could penetrate, the pyrite-carbonate was converted to a <b>usable</b> brown hematite iron ore along the outcrops and near the bedrock surface.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the number}} and value of notes printed during Operation Bernhard vary from a total of £132,610,945 (of which £10,368,445 {{were sent to the}} RHSA central office), up to £300 million (of which £125 million were <b>usable</b> notes).|$|E
5|$|Following the crash, the aircraft's cockpit voice {{recorder}} was recovered from the wreckage and the data recorded found to be intact and <b>usable.</b> Under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 Air Taxi rules, no flight data recorder was required {{for this type of}} flight and one had not been installed.|$|E
5|$|For burnt bone, {{testability}} {{depends on}} {{the conditions under which}} the bone was burnt. If the bone was heated under reducing conditions, it (and associated organic matter) may have been carbonized. In this case the sample is often <b>usable.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{strongly}} recommended by diver training organisations and {{codes of practice}} that {{a portion of the}} <b>usable</b> gas of the cylinder be held aside as a safety reserve. The reserve is designed to provide gas for longer than planned decompression stops or to provide time to resolve underwater emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Many guitar picks {{employ the}} Reuleaux triangle, as its shape {{combines}} a sharp point to provide strong articulation, {{with a wide}} tip to produce a warm timbre. Because all three points of the shape are <b>usable,</b> {{it is easier to}} orient and wears less quickly compared to a pick with a single tip.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} in {{fermentation}} to produce ethanol, and in biogas reactors to produce methane. Scientists are researching the use of algae to produce liquid fuels, and bacteria to convert various forms of agricultural and urban waste into <b>usable</b> fuels.|$|E
5|$|The French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the crash; it was joined by its German counterpart, the Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU), and was assisted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hours after the crash, the BEA sent seven investigators to the crash site; these were accompanied by representatives from Airbus and CFM International. The cockpit voice recorder, which was damaged but still <b>usable,</b> was recovered by rescue workers and was examined by the investigation team. The following week, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin announced that the flight data recorder, which was blackened by fire but still <b>usable,</b> had also been found. Investigators isolated 150 sets of DNA, which were compared with the DNA of the victims' families.|$|E
5|$|The freighthouse {{was closed}} in 2004 due to safety concerns. In early 2009, {{the city of}} Ypsilanti and the Friends of the Ypsilanti Freighthouse {{received}} more than $600,000 for repairs to make the freighthouse <b>usable</b> again.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} scholar Yōichi Katagiri concluded, on {{the lack}} of surviving evidence, that, while it is possible that Narihira and Ono no Komachi knew each other and were lovers, there was no <b>usable</b> evidence to say conclusively either way.|$|E
5|$|The ore {{was easily}} located and worked from shallow pits and shafts, {{but once the}} <b>usable</b> upper {{deposits}} were removed, or if a mine shaft entered the bed too far below the surface, only unusable unconverted pyritic deposits were found.|$|E
5|$|Also if {{assuming}} a radius of one AU, then {{there may not}} be sufficient building material in the Solar System to construct a Dyson shell. Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily <b>usable</b> building material in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|Architects who {{push the}} {{boundaries}} of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed {{the expectations of the}} public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently <b>usable</b> buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} an {{important}} industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, new construction added approximately 137,000 square meters (1.5 million square feet) daily of <b>usable</b> floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. More than 1,300 people move into the city daily, bolstering the economy by approximately 100 million Yuan.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as <b>usable</b> material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not <b>usable</b> by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also <b>usable</b> items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is one of}} the few metals {{that occur}} in nature in {{directly}} <b>usable</b> metallic form (native metals) as opposed to needing extraction from an ore. This led to very early human use, from c. 8000 BC. It was the first metal to be smelted from its ore, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.|$|E
5|$|During Activision's {{press conference}} at the 2008 E3 convention, it was {{announced}} that a long-standing dispute between Activision and Electronic Arts over the use of guitar controllers in their respective games had been resolved; Guitar Hero: Aerosmith on the 360 was patched after released to allow the use of the Rock Band controller within the game, while all such instruments will be <b>usable</b> in Guitar Hero World Tour. Guitar Hero and Rock Band guitar controllers for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are also compatible with the Playstation 2 version of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.|$|E
5|$|From arms caches {{hidden in}} 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades. However, {{due to their}} {{inadequate}} preservation, which had had to be improvised in {{the chaos of the}} September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were <b>usable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Her main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} six BL 9.2-inch Mk X guns in single turrets, {{two on the}} centreline and two on each beam, giving a broadside of four 9.2 in guns. Her secondary armament of ten BL 6-inch Mark XI guns was arranged in single casemates. They were mounted amidships on the main deck and were only <b>usable</b> in calm weather. Twenty Vickers QF 3-pounders were fitted, six on turret roofs and fourteen in the superstructure. The ship also mounted three submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World Energy Council {{published}} {{an estimate of}} the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is <b>usable</b> by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,575–49,837EJ per year (see table below).|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, the June 27 {{flow from}} the ongoing {{eruption}} threatened to enter the town of Pahoa, and to cut Highway 130, the only route {{into and out of}} Lower Puna. As a result, work was begun to reopen Chain of Craters Road, initially as a one-lane gravelled surface, and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road <b>usable</b> as emergency routes. However the flow stopped just short of entering Pahoa, and by March 2015, the threat to the town was much reduced.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger {{than at any other time}} in history, and almost every <b>usable</b> horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to be}} repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide <b>usable</b> space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
5|$|Jetman's only <b>usable</b> {{weapon in}} his laser. Weapon {{upgrades}} may also spawn around a map, which once picked up will give Jetman various upgrades to his weapon. Upgrades include as a wider fire spread, faster projectiles or higher damage. The player starts {{the game with}} three nuclear devices, which once used will eliminate all enemies from the screen. Jetman also {{has the ability to}} boost, which will temporarily make him move at a much faster speed, although boosts will need to recharge once they are depleted.|$|E
5|$|KC-33A – A {{proposed}} 747 {{was also}} adapted as an aerial refueling tanker and was bid against the DC-10-30 during the 1970s Advanced Cargo Transport Aircraft (ACTA) program {{that produced the}} KC-10A Extender. Before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran bought four 747-100 aircraft with air-refueling boom conversions to support its fleet of F-4 Phantoms. There is a report of using a KC-33A in H-3 airstrike during Iran–Iraq War. It is unknown whether these aircraft remain <b>usable</b> as tankers. Since then, other proposals have emerged for conversion of later 747-400 aircraft for this role.|$|E
5|$|Musashi {{was built}} with a Type 0 {{hydrophone}} system in her bow. It was only <b>usable</b> while stationary or at low speed. In September 1942 a Type 21 air-search radar was {{installed on the}} roof of the 15-metre rangefinder at the top of the forward superstructure. Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943. During repairs in April 1944, the Type 21 radar was replaced by a more modern version and a Type 13 early-warning radar was fitted.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6's {{propulsion}} system experienced a serious malfunction {{during the second}} crew residency in 1978 and was not <b>usable</b> again {{for the remainder of}} the station's lifespan. As a consequence, it was limited to firing its attitude control thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew residency ended, it was necessary for Progress and TKS spacecraft to boost the station into a high orbit so it wouldn't decay until the next residency began.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Kansas Multi-Agency Task Force {{was called}} to conduct an arson {{investigation}} on the Prairie Village house on October 24. Staffed by fire investigators and search teams from throughout the area, they focused on determining the origin and cause of the fire, searching through debris for <b>usable</b> evidence and interviewing witnesses. A dog trained to detect the scent of fire accelerants {{was brought in to}} assist in searching the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Thistle {{has always been}} prone to {{landslides}}. Pre-historic landslides created the more gentle slopes that made the area <b>usable</b> as a transportation corridor across the Wasatch Mountains. Minor landslides have been frequently observed, and continue to occur. The largest recorded landslides are the 1983 slide which destroyed the town, and a smaller one in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The chief Roman {{contributions}} to architecture were the arch, vault and the dome. Even {{after more than}} 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand, {{due in part to}} sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete. Roman roads are considered the most advanced roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade. The roads were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Even {{after the collapse of the}} central government, some roads remained <b>usable</b> for more than a thousand years.|$|E
