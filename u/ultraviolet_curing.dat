The company then closed many old-style integrated manufacturing plants in favor of large automated metal-processing centers and separate can-assembly operations situated near its customers' plants.

40|$|Archivists, conservators and librarians are {{concerned}} with paper permanence. Tests have shown that paper permanence is affected by light (especially ultra violet), temperature and humidity changes, acidity, in sects and rodents, and by general use. Environmental damages are often insidious. The objective {{of this study is}} to find whether <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>curing</b> and evaporative drying as experienced in the printing industry would affect paper permanence. Glen G. Gray 2 ̆ 7 s procedure for finding the reaction rate (the rate at which chemical reactions are completed) of paper is followed. This method relies on the fact that a chemical reaction occurs at speeds which depend on the molecules present and their levels of excitation. Gray compared this method to TAPPI Standard 453, concluding that the single-temperature TAPPI standard is not a reliable permanence test to compare papers with different activation energies. In Gray 2 ̆ 7 s multi-temperature procedure, plots of reaction rates at several temperatures are computed through the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation relates reaction rate and temperature. The findings of this study showed a positive correlation between an increase in aging-oven temperature and a loss of folding endurance. The evaporative drying group consistently endured fewer folds than the ultraviolet-cured group although this does not clearly indicate that heat is more damaging than ultraviolet light. In conclusion, the evaporative drying and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>curing</b> techniques at the levels presently used in this study were found not to be harmful to the paper tested...|$|E

40|$|Transparent {{conducting}} oxides have {{a unique}} combination of properties as they are both optical transparent in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and obtain a near-metallic conductivity. This makes them extensively used {{in a wide variety}} of technological applications. The industrial demand for developing better, cheaper, and faster methods for producing these materials is increasing continuously. Thus, the motivation for this master thesis is to find a cheaper and faster way to produce transparent conductive oxides while still retaining the optoelectronic properties. A possible way of doing this is by replacing the conventional furnace heat-treatment step of sol-gel derived transparent conductive oxides with photochemical activation. The aim of this work is hence to compare the quality of sol-gel derived indium tin oxide and indium zinc oxide thin films cured using thermal and ultraviolet radiation methods. Indium tin oxide and indium zinc oxide thin films were prepared by spin coating a sol synthesized by an environmental friendly Pechini method onto glass and silicon substrates. The thin films were subsequently characterized with respect to crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, and electrical properties. The thermally cured indium tin oxide and indium zinc oxide thin films obtained a non-directional phase pure cubic bixbyite crystal structure, while the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>curing</b> at room temperature and 150 &# 176;C gave an amorphous structure. By studying the morphology of the thin films it could be observed that the thermal curing gave the highest homogeneity, while the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>curing</b> at 150 &# 176;C gave the lowest homogeneity. The same trend was also found for surface roughness, where the lowest roughness was obtained for the thermally cured films. The thin films obtained a high optical transparency with an average value of 88 - 97 % in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. No clear trend could be seen with regards to the effect of the different curing methods on the absolute value of the transparency, whereas an evident trend was seen for the curve shape. The transmission curves had an absorption band edge at about 300 nm, and a band gap of 3. 8 eV and 3. 7 eV was observed for indium tin oxide and indium zinc oxide, respectively. The optical constants refractive index and extinction coefficient indicates a difference in the optical properties for indium tin oxide and indium zinc oxide. For the thermally cured indium tin oxide thin films the lowest resistivity values obtained on glass and silicon substrates were 2. 8 &# 215; 10 - 3 &# 937; cm and 2. 2 &# 215; 10 - 3 &# 937; cm, respectively, while the lowest resistivity values obtained for the indium zinc oxide thin films on glass and silicon substrates were 0. 4 &# 937; cm and 0. 1 &# 937; cm, respectively. It was not possible to obtain resistivity measurements for any of the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>curing</b> methods, indicating that these films are non-conducting.

40|$|Caloric {{restriction}} {{extends the}} lifespan in several model animals, including fruit flies, but less {{is known about}} the influence upon endurance and sensory-motor performance. For this experiment, all flies will be raised on standard media. At the point of eclosion, they will be transferred to rich, standard, or restricted media. The endurance of a fruit fly can be tested by monitoring how long it is able to maintain active flight. Flight power is quantified by measuring wing beats per second and total wing stroke amplitude. Sensory-motor performance is measured by the animal’s ability to actively fixate on a black bar using closed-loop feedback within an electronic visual flight simulator. We hypothesize that flies raised on restricted media (0. 5 % yeast) will have higher mechanical power output, and flight duration than flies raised on standard media (2. 5 % yeast) or rich media (5. 5 %yeast). We tested adult female Drosophila melanogaster between 5 days post eclosion, Flies were tethered under cold sedation (~ 3 ˚C) to tungsten pins using <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>cured</b> epoxy. Experiments were performed with a computer controlled cylindrical flight area composed of light emitting diodes (LEDs). Subjects were selected for their ability to frontally fixate a vertical black bar {{for the duration of the}} experiment. The average amount of time that the 24 standard flies raised on standard diet containing 2. 5 % yeast flew for is 109 minutes. The average flight time for the 5 rich media flies raised on 5. 5 % yeast is 57 minutes. We have yet to test flies raised on a dietary restriction diet, but since the rich media flies have performed worse in every category, mirroring the results from a similar experiment the previous year, it can be assumed that the dietary restricted flies will outperform its contenders again.

40|$|Daughter {{products}} of vegetable oils {{can be used}} as binders and additives. The author presents a research project carried out at iLF Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft Lacke und Farben mbH (Magdeburg, Germany). Within the scope of this research project the daughter {{products of}} vegetable oils are used as binders of lacquers. Especially, the author investigates cationically and radically <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>cured</b> lacquer systems and binary materials whose components are connected thermally by vinolygic addition reactions or epoxide-amine addition reactions. Source materials are rapeseed oil, rapeseed methyl ester, linseed oil, ricinus oil, dragon's head oil, oligomerized derivates of linseed oil and alkyd resins of linseed pil. The PRILESHAEV reaction with buffered peracetic acid provides the best results with respect to the production of epoxidized vegetable oils. This type of reaction is not suitable for the synthesis of conjuene oils such as calendula oil. Epoxides and epoxyacrylates are synthesized on the basis of rapeseed oil and dragon's head oil. The properties of these epoxides and epoxyacrylates are comparable to the properties of commercial epoxides or epoxyacrylates of soya oil or linseed oil. Polyols as intermediates are prepared from epoxidized vegetable oil. Due to ether bridges in polyol molecules, polyols have higher molecular weights and less hydroxyl groups as theoretically expected. These polyols are transfered into acetoacetate functionalized binders by transesterification with tert-butyl acetoacetate. A consecutive reaction with n-butyl amine yields to corresponding enamines. Vegetable oil acetoacetates as well as the enamines of the vegetable oils can be cross-linked thermally by vinylogic addition reactions with acrylates. The mechanical and chemical resistance of the epoxides and epoxyacrylates depends on the cross-linking density. In the light of the use of vegetable oils as a lacquer ressouce, one should look at a high functionality, low viscosity and a minimal molecular size.
