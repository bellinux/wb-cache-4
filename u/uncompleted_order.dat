In 2012 Czech Railways cancelled the order. A reduced order of seven viaggio comfort trainsets was agreed in August 2012.|$|E

50|$|McDonnell {{set about}} {{designing}} {{a new class}} of express passenger locomotives, which incorporated a number of departures from established NER practice. Some of these were significant, {{such as the use of}} a leading bogie on an express locomotive; others were purely cosmetic, such as the shape of the chimney. The biggest change was that the driving position was placed on the left-hand side of the cab, instead of the right - the drivers did not like this change at all, and found fault with most of the other unfamiliar features. So much pressure was put on McDonnell that he resigned in September 1884. Despite this, <b>uncompleted</b> <b>orders</b> were allowed to stand, apart from the last batch of eight which were cancelled; components which had already been manufactured for these were incorporated into some 0-6-0T locomotives which Henry Tennant's locomotive committee designed; these became the '8' class (LNER J74).|$|R

In this paper, we discuss a novel heuristic called Polynomial Max-Min Skeleton (PMMS) developped by Tsamardinos et al. in 2005. PMMS was proved by extensive empirical simulations to be an excellent trade-off between time and quality of reconstruction compared to all constraint based algorithms, especially for the smaller sample sizes. Unfortunately, there are two main problems with PMMS: it is unable to deal with missing data nor with datasets containing functional dependencies between variables. In this paper, we propose a way to overcome these problems. The new version of PMMS is first applied on standard benchmarks to recover the original structure from data. The algorithm is then applied on the Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) made up from only 1289 <b>uncomplete</b> records in <b>order</b> to shed some light into the statistical profile of the population under study.

This research {{based on the fact that}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s possession right nowadays is not appropriately or properly used within the agrarian reform. One of the causes of such situation is the vagueness of the authority basis of the state 2 ̆ 7 s possession right. Up to now, the implementation of the agrarian reform as major agenda is still <b>uncompleted.</b> since new <b>order</b> ruling government, many regulations enacted are incompatible with the article 33 of Indonesian constitution of 1945, act of agrarian and act of land reform. Today, government has set up a national agrarian reform program which is basically and contextually different from which act of agrarian and act of land reform mandate. The huge thing to which people focusing their attention is both the interpretation and application of the state 2 ̆ 7 s possession right to assume has been employed in the wrong track, i. e. for the sake of investment, mining, industry and forestry...|$|R
