40|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} into the feasibility of speech in aircraft cockpits, but little in human supervisory control tasks. Speech displays can provide a number of benefits over conventional, visual displays, particularly {{as a means of}} providing alarm information. We discuss the term 'alarm', and suggest that different alarm situations will have different information requirements. Thus, a single type of alarm display may not be suitable for the complete range of situations encountered in the control room. We investigated the use of speech for different 'alarm-initiated actions': recording, <b>urgency</b> <b>rating,</b> location identification, and action specification. These tasks varied in terms of difficulty, and this affected performance. We also varied the quality of speech, comparing synthesized with human speech. While speech quality affected performance on the recording task, we found that task difficulty interacted with speech quality on the other tasks. This means that definable 'trade-offs' exist between the use of speech and the situation in which it is to be used...|$|E

40|$|Purpose 					To {{assess the}} ratio of {{patients}} lost to follow-up (FU) after midurethral 						sling surgery, to evaluate their success rate and current status, and to 						identify the reasons for FU loss. 				 				 					Materials and Methods 					Two-hundred thirty-eight patients who received trans-obturator tape (TOT) 						surgery were reviewed. For patients lost to FU within 3 months, Stamey&# 8217;s 						outcome questionnaire and questions regarding the reasons for FU loss were 						submitted via phone interview. 				 				 					Results 					 One hundred forty-three (60. 1 %) patients (FU loss group) were lost to FU 						within 3 months postoperatively. In the FU loss group, phone interviews were 						conducted with 117 (81. 8 %) patients. Aside from the <b>urgency</b> <b>rate</b> (59. 3 % vs. 						 72. 3 %, p= 0. 049), {{there were no significant}} statistical differences in 						preoperative profiles between two group. The success rate of the FU loss 						group (80. 3 %, 94 of 117 patients) was lower than that of the FU group 						(95. 8 %, 91 of 95 patients) (p= 0. 001). The success rates in the FU loss group 						with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) were significantly lower than in the 						FU group with MUI.

A clinical <b>urgency</b> <b>rating</b> scale was used to assign a recommended maximum waiting time (RMWT) to each patient retrospectively, but this was not used in the queuing process. RMWTs and actual waiting times for patients in the 3 referral groups were compared; the influence clinical and nonclinical variables had on the actual length of time patients waited for coronary angiography was assessed; and possible predictors of adverse events were examined. RESULTS: Of 357 patients referred to Sunnybrook, 22 (6. 2 %) experienced adverse events while in the queue. Among those who remained, 308 (91. 9 %) were in need of coronary angiography; 201 (60. 0 %) of those patients received one within the RMWT. The length of time to angiography was influenced by clinical characteristics similar to those specified on the <b>urgency</b> <b>rating</b> scale, leading to a moderate agreement between actual waiting times and RMWTs (kappa = 0. 53). However, physician affiliation was a highly significant (p < 0. 001) and independent predictor of waiting time. Whereas 45. 6 % of the variation in waiting time was explained by all clinical factors combined, 9. 3 % of the variation was explained by physician affiliation alone.

40|$|Abstract Background The Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS) is a patient-reported outcome {{instrument}} {{intended to}} measure the intensity of urgency associated with each urinary or incontinence episode. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess the content validity, test-retest reliability, and acclimation effect of the PPIUS in overactive bladder (OAB) patients. Methods Patients undergoing treatment for OAB were recruited to participate in a non-interventional study by completing a three-day micturition diary including the PPIUS for three consecutive weeks. Following completion of the three-week study, participants from two select sites also completed a cognitive interview to assess their comprehension of the PPIUS. Results Thirty-nine participants successfully completed the three-week test-retest study; twelve of these participants completed the cognitive interview. Test-retest reliability was high based on intra-class correlation coefficient of 0. 95. Among stable patients, the difference between the mean ratings of any two weeks was non-significant. Among the twelve interview participants, nine found it simple to choose a PPIUS rating for each of their micturition episodes and most found the <b>urgency</b> <b>rating</b> definitions consistent with their urgency experiences. Conclusions The results demonstrated content validity based on qualitative interviews, and excellent test-retest reliability among stable patients. In addition, no acclimation effect was observed among stable patients. These findings support the use of the PPIUS as a reliable measure of urgency in both clinical trial and real life settings. The validity of PPIUS could be further established with future studies investigating the relationship between discretely graded urgency and incontinence continuum. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{perceived}} {{urgency of}} 2000 consecutive patients attending the Accident and Emergency Department of the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, {{was assessed using}} a Linear Analogue Scale. Each patient was assessed by the receptionist, the receiving nurse and the treating doctor. The distribution of <b>urgency</b> <b>rating</b> produced for this patient group was shown to be comparable for each status of assessor, and to correlate with other outcome criteria such as admission and referral rates. The linear scale was also shown to correlate with retrospective assessment using a time-guided category scale. The {{accident and emergency department}} workload is predominantly of low urgency (90 % less than 5 on a 0 - 10 scale). Older patients tend to have higher urgency ratings than younger patients and those referred by ambulance, either via general practitioner or 999 calls, have similarly higher urgency distributions. This study provides a basis {{for the development of a}} guided category scale for functional triage of accident and emergency departments. Other scoring systems have attempted to similarly quantify the medical component of the workload (Coira & Rothstein, 1983; Peel et al., 1962). However, the complexity of many of these scales, together with the difficulty in usage of so many different scales, begs a reappraisal of the overall triage of patients attending the emergency department. The aim of this study was to look at the perceived urgency distribution of patients presenting to the emergency department. We wished to compare the relative assessment of urgency by various levels of treating staff and to compare those assessments with the referral and outcome of these patients to provide the basis for the development of a comparative Triage Scale...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{review the}} New Zealand {{coronary}} artery bypass priority score instituted in May 1996, and specifically {{to determine whether it}} prioritises patients at high risk of cardiac events while waiting. The New Zealand score is compared with the Ontario <b>urgency</b> <b>rating</b> score, and waiting times for surgery are compared with the maximum times recommended by the Ontario consensus panel.  DESIGN—Retrospective review of patients accepted for isolated {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery between 1  January 1993  and 31  January 1996.  SETTING—Green Lane Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Waiting time, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and cardiac readmission.  RESULTS—The median waiting times were five days for hospital cases (n =  721) and 146  days for out of hospital cases (n =  701). Of the latter group, 28 % waited more than a year, 33 % had their surgery expedited because of worsening symptoms, and 19 % failed to meet the cut off point set by the New Zealand score for acceptance onto the list. Twenty two patients died, 18  on the outpatient waiting list (waiting list mortality 2. 6 %, risk 0. 28 % per month of waiting), and 132  were readmitted, 12 % with myocardial infarction and 76 % with unstable angina. Risk factors for a composite end point of death or myocardial infarction and/or cardiac readmission were: previous coronary artery bypass surgery (p =  0. 001), class III or IV angina (p =  0. 002), and hypertension (p =  0. 005). The New Zealand score did not identify those at risk. Excluding hospital cases, 32 % had surgery within the time recommended by the Ontario consensus panel.  CONCLUSIONS—Waiting times for coronary artery bypass surgery in New Zealand are considerably longer than those in Ontario, Canada. By using a numerical cut off point, implementation of the New Zealand priority scoring system has restricted access to coronary surgery on the basis of funding constraints rather than clinical appropriateness. The score does not add greatly to the clinicians' prioritisation in predicting those patients who will suffer events while waiting.    Keywords: coronary artery bypass surgery; prioritisatio...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} major adverse events among patients awaiting coronary revascularization; to assess the match between referring physicians' estimates of urgency, a computer-generated multifactorial <b>urgency</b> <b>rating</b> score and actual waiting times; to {{determine the}} changes in waiting times as capacity for bypass surgery increased; and to evaluate the influence of choice of procedure or operator on waiting times. DESIGN: Consecutive case series. SETTING: Greater Toronto region. SUBJECTS: All 571 patients referred to an organized referral office by cardiologists at hospitals without on-site revascularization facilities between Jan. 3, 1989, and June 30, 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction; proportions of patients waiting longer than the maximum period recommended for their urgency rating; mean waiting times for various subgroups; and correlations among referring physicians' urgency ratings, computer-generated multifactorial urgency scores and waiting times. RESULTS: Of the 496 patients accepted for a procedure 5 had fatal cardiac events and 3 nonfatal myocardial infarction. Events occurred three times more often in patients with left mainstem disease than in those in other anatomic categories (relative risk [RR] 3. 05, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 48 to 6. 27, p = 0. 03). Both the computer-generated scores and the referring physicians' scores were correlated with the actual waiting time (r = 0. 46 and 0. 57 respectively). Waiting times {{and the proportion of}} patients with excessive waiting times fell during the study period (p < 0. 0001). However, urgent cases were much less likely to be done "on time" than those with a recommended waiting time of more than 2 weeks (RR 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 25, p < 0. 0001). The mean wait for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was 22. 73 days if the referral office was allowed to find a surgeon or interventional cardiologist and 35. 31 days if one was requested (p = 0. 002 after adjustment for urgency scores). CONCLUSIONS: Death of a patient on the waiting list is uncommon in an organized referral system. Patients with left main-stem disease are at higher risk of death than those in other anatomic categories. There were significant correlations between referring physicians' ratings of urgency, multifactorial urgency scores and actual waiting times. Expansion of capacity for CABG led to shorter waiting times, but patients with unstable symptoms continued to wait longer than recommended.

40|$|Driver braking {{behavior}} was analyzed using time-series recordings from naturalistic rear-end conflicts (116 crashes and 241 near-crashes), including events {{with and without}} visual distraction among drivers of cars, heavy trucks, and buses. A simple piecewise linear model could be successfully fitted, per event, to the observed driver decelerations, allowing a detailed elucidation of when drivers initiated braking and how they controlled it. Most notably, it was found that, across vehicle types, driver braking {{behavior was}} strongly dependent on {{the urgency of the}} given rear-end scenario’s kinematics, quantified in terms of visual looming of the lead vehicle on the driver’s retina. In contrast with previous suggestions of brake reaction times (BRTs) of 1. 5 s or more after onset of an unexpected hazard (e. g., brake light onset), it was found here that braking could be described as typically starting less than a second after the kinematic urgency reached certain threshold levels, with even faster reactions at higher <b>urgencies.</b> The <b>rate</b> at which drivers then increased their deceleration (towards a maximum) was also highly dependent on urgency. Probability distributions are provided that quantitatively capture these various patterns of kinematics-dependent behavioral response. Possible underlying mechanisms are suggested, including looming response thresholds and neural evidence accumulation. These accounts argue that a naturalistic braking response should not {{be thought of as a}} slow reaction to some single, researcher-defined “hazard onset”, but instead as a relatively fast response to the visual looming cues that build up later on in the evolving traffic scenario...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the incidence of neurologic manifestations and risk factors associated with these outcomes. Methods. The incidence of HAM/TSP and new signs and neurologic symptoms were computed in a group of patients enrolled in a cohort study. Results. Of 414 subjects, 76 had definite HAM/TSP, 87 had possible or probable HAM/TSP, and 251 subjects had no neurologic manifestation and were selected for analysis. Definite HAM/TSP developed in 5 (1. 47 %) patients. Follow-up of at least 3 years was achieved in 51 % of patients.

40|$|Drive-thru Internet {{has emerged}} as a {{fundamental}} approach for information/content distribution to vehicles on the go. In the drive-thru Internet, one vehicle may connect to multiple roadside units (RSUs) along its trip, and in the meantime, multiple vehicles may compete one RSU at the same time for transmissions. Therefore, both vehicles and RSUs need to optimize their connections to achieve their best utilities. In the perspective of RSUs, it is important to select optimal vehicles to transmit so as to maximize the global RSU system's utilization. For individual vehicles, it needs to wisely select RSUs along its trip to connect so as to minimize its download cost, e. g., energy consumption and bandwidth cost. This paper targets to address the two design goals in one framework using a game theoretic model. Specifically, we model the two-dimensional drive-thru Internet as a second-price sealed-bid auction. In each RSU cell, an adaptive reserve price scheme is designed such that the RSU is allowed to selectively provide connections to vehicles based on the network size, vehicle's transmission <b>rate,</b> <b>urgency</b> of download, and content popularityMergeCell the RSU finally obtains the optimal utility on a Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the auction. For individual vehicles, a finite-horizon Markov decision process has been developed to guide vehicles to optimally select RSUs to connect along their road trips. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve the highest utility for the RSUs compared with existing proposals. It can also help vehicles keep a higher utility and transmission ratio when going through a single RSU or multiple RSUs than the conventional schemes.

40|$|Abstract Background Patients {{admitted}} to a secure forensic hospital {{are at risk of}} a long hospital stay. Forensic hospital beds are a scarce and expensive resource and ability to identify the factors predicting length of stay at time of admission would be beneficial. The DUNDRUM- 1 triage security scale and DUNDRUM- 2 triage urgency scale are designed to assess need for therapeutic security and urgency of that need while the HCR- 20 predicts risk of violence. We hypothesized that items on the DUNDRUM- 1 and DUNDRUM- 2 scales, rated at the time of pre-admission assessment, would predict length of stay in a medium secure forensic hospital setting. Methods This is a prospective study. All admissions to a medium secure forensic hospital setting were collated over a 54  month period (n[*]=[*] 279) and followed up for a total of 66  months. Each patient was rated using the DUNDRUM- 1 triage security scale and DUNDRUM- 2 triage urgency scale as part of a pre-admission assessment (n[*]=[*] 279) and HCR- 20 within 2 weeks of admission (n[*]=[*] 187). Episodes of harm to self, harm to others and episodes of seclusion whilst an in-patient were collated. Date of discharge was noted for each individual. Results Diagnosis at the time of pre-admission assessment (adjustment disorder v other diagnosis), predicted legal status (sentenced v mental health order) and items on the DUNDRUM- 1 triage security scale and the DUNDRUM- 2 triage <b>urgency</b> scale, also <b>rated</b> at the time of pre-admission assessment, predicted length of stay in the forensic hospital setting. Need for seclusion following admission also predicted length of stay.

40|$|Background: Medication {{safety is}} of {{increasing}} importance {{and understanding the}} nature and frequency of medication errors in the Emergency Department (ED) will assist in tailoring interventions which will make patient care safer. The challenge with the literature to date is the wide variability {{in the frequency of}} errors reported and the reliance on incident reporting practices of busy ED staff. Methods: A prospective, exploratory descriptive design using point prevalence surveys was used to establish the frequency of observed medication errors in the ED. In addition, data related to contextual factors such as ED patients, staffing and workload were also collected during the point prevalence surveys to enable the analysis of relationships between the frequency and nature of specific error types and patient and ED characteristics at the time of data collection. Results: A total of 172 patients were included in the study: 125 of whom patients had a medication chart. The prevalence of medication errors in the ED studied was 41. 2 % for failure to apply patient ID bands, 12. 2 % for failure to document allergy status and 38. 4 % for errors of omission. The proportion of older patients in the ED did not affect the frequency of medication errors. There was a relationship between high numbers of ATS 1, 2 and 3 patients (indicating high levels of clinical <b>urgency)</b> and increased <b>rates</b> of failure to document allergy status. Medication errors were affected by ED occupancy, when cubicles in the ED were over 50 % occupied, medication errors occurred more frequently. ED staffing affects the frequency of medication errors, there was an increase in failure to apply ID bands and errors of omission when there were unfilled nursing deficits and lower levels of senior medical staff were associated with increased errors of omission. Conclusions: Medication errors related to patient identification, allergy status and medication omissions occur more frequently in the ED when the ED is busy, has sicker patients and when the staffing is not at the minimum required staffing levels...|$|R

Episodes of harm to self, harm to others and episodes of seclusion whilst an in-patient were collated. Date of discharge was noted for each individual. RESULTS: Diagnosis at the time of pre-admission assessment (adjustment disorder v other diagnosis), predicted legal status (sentenced v mental health order) and items on the DUNDRUM- 1 triage security scale and the DUNDRUM- 2 triage <b>urgency</b> scale, also <b>rated</b> at the time of pre-admission assessment, predicted length of stay in the forensic hospital setting. Need for seclusion following admission also predicted length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may form the basis for a structured professional judgment instrument, rated prior to or at time of admission, to assist in estimating length of stay for forensic patients. Such a tool would be useful to clinicians, service planners and commissioners given the high cost of secure psychiatric care...|$|R
40|$|Background & AimsFew {{treatments}} {{have demonstrated}} efficacy and safety for diarrhea-predominant {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS-D). A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeat treatment with the nonsystemic antibiotic rifaximin. MethodsThe trial included adults with IBS-D, mean abdominal pain and bloating scores of 3 or more, and loose stool, located at 270 centers in the United States and Europe from February 2012 through June 2014. Those responding to a 2 -week course of open-label rifaximin 550 mg 3 times daily, who then relapsed during an observation phase (up to 18 weeks), {{were randomly assigned to}} groups given repeat treatments of rifaximin 550 mg or placebo 3 times daily for 2 weeks. The primary end point was percentage of responders after first repeat treatment, defined as a decrease in abdominal pain of ≥ 30 % from baseline and a decrease in frequency of loose stools of ≥ 50 % from baseline, for 2 or more weeks during a 4 -week post-treatment period. ResultsOf 1074 patients (44. 1 %) who responded to open-label rifaximin, 382 (35. 6 %) did not relapse and 692 (64. 4 %) did; of these, 636 were randomly assigned to receive repeat treatment with rifaximin (n = 328) or placebo (n = 308). The percentage of responders was significantly greater with rifaximin than placebo (38. 1 % vs 31. 5 %; P =. 03). The percentage of responders for abdominal pain (50. 6 % vs 42. 2 %; P =. 018) was significantly greater with rifaximin than placebo, but not stool consistency (51. 8 % vs 50. 0 %; P =. 42). Significant improvements were also noted for prevention of recurrence, durable response, and bowel movement <b>urgency.</b> Adverse event <b>rates</b> were low and similar between groups. ConclusionsIn a phase 3 study of patients with relapsing symptoms of IBS-D, repeat rifaximin treatment was efficacious and well tolerated. ClinicalTrials. gov ID: NCT 01543178...|$|R
