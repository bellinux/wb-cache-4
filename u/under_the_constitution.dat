5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends.

This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E

The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President. This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, {{as they had been}} thought disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned to deal with this by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's salary as governor, {{which was}} the highest for an elected {{official}} in the state, was $1,000. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution,</b> the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in a nine-year period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited powers as governor.|$|E

5|$|The {{two main}} issues {{considered}} by the High Court were whether the Migration Act 1958 (the legislation governing immigration to Australia) permitted a person in Al-Kateb's situation to be detained indefinitely, and if so, whether this was permissible <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of Australia.
