To investigate the correspondence between this standard unit and the actual amount contained in the ‘usual’ drink poured by {{a sample of the}} Scottish public, participants (n= 251) were recruited from three employers in a major city—a manufacturer, an academic and a financial institution.

40|$|Introducing {{a minimum}} price for alcohol in Northern Ireland is an {{important}} step in the prevention of suicide and self-harm, as well as addressing wider health and social issues, the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Northern Ireland has said. Dr Philip McGarry, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Northern Ireland, welcomed the consultation into alcohol pricing launched today by Social Development Minister Alex Attwood and Health Minister Michael McGimpsey - but said the floor price must be set high enough to have a genuine impact on problem drinking. Speaking at the launch, Dr McGarry said there are strong correlations between alcohol and mental health problems. "Psychiatrists see the effect of alcohol abuse on patients every day, and it’s clear this is exacerbated by irresponsible promotions that encourage people to drink more than they otherwise would," he said. Dr McGarry said it is important the Northern Ireland Executive takes a tougher stance than England, where the Government plans to set a minimum price by imposing a ban on selling alcohol for less than the combined tax and duty paid for it, resulting in a minimum price of 31 pence per unit of beer and 28 pence per <b>unit</b> of cheap <b>spirits.</b> Medical professionals have said these price measures will do little to tackle the health problems caused by alcohol. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has called for a minimum price of 45 pence a unit, to put a floor under discount wars. This would have very little impact for moderate drinkers - increasing the average spend by about £ 10 a year - but would be a deterrent for young binge drinkers and people dependent on alcohol...|$|R

However, the benefits of an additional computed tomography (aCT) performed over the next days after iv-thrombolysis have not been determined. Methods: We retrospectively screened 287 Caucasian patients with ischemic stroke who were consecutively treated with iv-thrombolysis from 2008 to 2012. The results of computed tomography performed on the second (control computed tomography) and seventh (aCT) day after iv-thrombolysis were compared in 274 patients (95. 5 %); 13 subjects (4. 5 %), who died before the seventh day from admission were excluded from the analysis. Results: aCTs revealed a higher incidence of HT than control computed tomographies (14. 2 % vs 6. 6 %; P= 0. 003). Patients with HT in aCT showed higher median of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission than those without HT (13. 0 vs 10. 0; P= 0. 01) and higher presence of ischemic changes > 1 / 3 middle cerebral artery territory (66. 7 % vs 35. 2 %; P 1 / 3 middle cerebral artery (phi= 0. 03) existed, and the presence of HT in aCT was associated with 3 -month mortality (phi= 0. 03). Conclusion: aCT after iv-thrombolysis enables higher detection of HT, which is related to higher 3 -month mortality. Thus, patients with severe middle cerebral artery infarction may benefit from aCT in the decision-making process on the secondary prophylaxis.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the nature of contemporary kinship relationships among the Cham Muslim community of migrants from Cambodia, now settled in Malaysia. The study was conducted in 2006 in Pulau Keladi Village, a Cham settlement on the East Coast of peninsula Malaysia, and employed an ethnographic research approach combining traditional participant observation with simple survey techniques. The study is primarily concerned with how modernization has affected kinship relations among the Cham. Modernization is used here to designate the processes of involvement in the commercial relations of a market-based society. In the case of the Cham, the transition to such relations was intertwined with the process of movement from their country of origin, i. e. Cambodia, to another country. With the process of movement and resettlement, this community confronted real challenges and had to develop new ways of life in a new milieu. From traditional forms of farming and fishing, which had been their main sources of economic support in Cambodia, these people utilized a similar physical environment to develop commercially-oriented economic activities in their new settlement. The degree of cooperation in the village helps producers to produce and market larger quantities than if everyone operated as an isolated <b>unit.</b> The <b>spirit</b> of mutual help which pervades this community, and which is interrelated with kinship, is an important aspect of this study. Through {{the way in which they}} responded to their new milieu and the cultural challenges which it provided, the Cham managed to re-establish strong kinship networks and to assemble a large group of kin in a single place. Through examining the kinship structure and ideology of the Cham, their marriage patterns, relations between parents, adult children and adult siblings, the role of kinship in life course transitions and ceremonies, the utilisation of kinship in economic activities and the interplay of migration, ethnic identity and kinship, the study identifies the significance of kinship to Cham social organisation and explores the elements of continuity and change. Over the last three decades, these people have undergone significant transformation due to the modernization process and resettlement. The data of this study suggests that changes have taken place in some aspects of their lives. However, compared to western communities, the resilience of kinship ties is clearly transparent. While there are more elements of freedom for the younger generation in many areas of life, they still accept considerable guidance from older family members, and the range of kin who are recognised and who meet regularly to celebrate family events, the preference for working with kin, the patterns of financial and emotional assistance, the relatively high levels of arranged marriages and of cousin marriage, the exceptionally low rates of divorce and remarriage, and the close relations between parents and adult children and between adult siblings, all illustrate the importance that the Cham attach to the bonds of kinship and their efforts to protect kinship from the eroding influence of modernisation. Finally, the study suggests that important contributing factors to the continuing strength of kinship are the historical and contemporary efforts of a minority group to maintain their identity, persecution under the Khmer Rouge and the subsequent migration and resettlement, which have all both accentuated the importance of kinship as protection and resource, and deepened the attachment of the Chain to a collective identity - now in the form of Orang Kemboja - which kinship plays an important role in maintaining.
