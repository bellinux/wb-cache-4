Currently, the United States and European Union represent two distinct approaches {{to the right of}} individuals to permanently remove personal content from social media. U.

The European Union’s approach social media privacy gives users more rights to remove themselves entirely from social media permanently (General Data Protection Regulation, Article 17, 2012).

40|$|Nowadays, {{information}} {{technology is a}} key driver in our world. Big cloud federations are aiming to increase their computing power and achieve better results while being scalable. This huge IT systems are managed by multiple users having different roles {{and at the same}} time, new services deployment automation is needed to be able to cope with the rising need of resources. This flexibility in deployment has created concerns on the security and the main- tainability of these extensive systems. These requisites have led to start CYCLONE platform, a project focused to provide authentication and authorization services towards services running under control of federated <b>unions</b> of <b>users.</b> CYCLONE, at the moment working as a proof of concept, now allows to authenticate and authorize access to users using one-click-deployment applications against their federation’s credentials. However, actual SSO systems require registration of the services against their Identity Providers in order to provide user validation. In this master thesis, we present two the components of CYCLONE. The first one is a service registration for clients of the OpenID Connect Single Sign-On protocol that allows newly deployed services to be registered automatically against CYCLONE’s SSO component, using RedHat’s Keycloak authentication solution. Based on the real world scenarios that defined the CYCLONE platform, we have designed and implemented a solution alternative to the ones provided by Keycloak, and to evaluate it we have compared it to Keycloak’s alternatives. As a result we have created a simple API implementation from where it’s possible to track who is executing this registrations of new clients, in comparison to the anonymous ones provided by other solutions. The second one is a module that allows easy SSH authorization through the use of CYCLONE’s SSO backend as identity provider and that has been evaluated and tested by one of CYCLONE’s use cases...|$|R

Method: Three patients with experience of involuntary discharge from medication-assisted treatment have been interviewed. All were heroin abusing men living in Stockholm. The interviewees were recruited through the Swedish Drug <b>Users</b> <b>Union</b> and through a shelter for homeless people with drug problems. Results: All the discharged patients experienced a hard time after the discharge. One went back to abuse heroin and the other two began to buy methadone or burprenorphine on the black market. All of them also experienced it difficult to cope with the stigma and considered that there were many obstacles in their life caused by the treatment rules.

40|$|The TUC (Trades Union Congress) {{proposed}} that union learning representatives {{could play a}} role in developing a new culture of lifelong learning at the workplace as the health and safety representative movement has had a major impact on making work environments safer. This is the most extensive piece of research that has been done on union learning representative activity in the North-West region of England. Analysis of data, collected on behalf of unionlearn with the North-West TUC, identified that there were principal stakeholders that had an interest in the success of the union learning representative initiative; the Government and its agencies, TUC/ unionlearn, affiliate unions, employers and, as service <b>users,</b> <b>union</b> members. This thesis investigates to what extent union learning representative activity meets the expectations of those principal stakeholders. The investigation is underpinned by literature that explains the conceptual framework for workplace learning, stakeholder theory and unions and learning. The missing link appears to be the failure of the sponsors of the initiative (Government, TUC and CBI) to acknowledge the possible resistance of some employers to facilitate union learning representative activity in their workplaces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} many of these {{conflicts}} are the result of a failure to create a set of rules of interactions between the key stakeholders [...] government, regulators, <b>users,</b> <b>unions</b> and the media. Most concession contracts proved to be incomplete in terms of the information requirements needed to anticipate pricing and investment related problems. Moreover, the necessary autonomous but accountable regulatory capacity has never been fully developed for this sector in Arge ntina. In particular, as the level of private participation increases in the sector, Argentina's problem was every regulator's problem: how to regulate monopolies when the actual cost and production information is directly controlled by these monopolies. To be effective, any regulatory agencies has to be granted access to a minimum level of consistent information. It must also be given instructions on the mechanisms it needs to follow to use this information and how to tailor them to the regulatory commitments. It must also be given the necessary enforcement power when any of the players fails to comply. The big questions are: how and to what extent? Argentina's transport sector has not yet been able to answer these questions and many of the tense situations observed over the last 2 to 3 years are the product of this incomplete regulatory capacit...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} present the results of research carried out regarding the needs, demand and consumption of European <b>Union</b> information by <b>users</b> in European Documentation Centres (EDC). A quantitative methodology was chosen based on a questionnaire with 24 items. This questionnaire was distributed within the EDC of Salamanca, Spain, and the EDC of Porto, Portugal, during specific time intervals between 2010 and 2011. We examined the level of EU information that EDC users possess, and identified the factors that facilitate or hinder access to EU information, the topics most demanded, and the types of documents consulted. Analysis was made of the use that the consumer of European information makes of databases and their behaviour during the consultation. Although the sample used was not very significant owing to its small size, it is a faithful reflection of the scarce visits made to EDCs. This study can be of use to managers of EDCs, providing them with better knowledge of the information needs and demands of their users. Ultimately this should lead to improvements in the services offered. The study lies within a frame of research scarcely addressed in specialized scholarly literature: European Union information...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{a decade}} after Argentina began privatizing its railways, {{resolution}} of conflicts between regulators, users, and operators continues to take longer, and to be more difficult, than expected. The authors contend {{that many of these}} conflicts arose because there are no rules for interactions between the key stakeholders: government, regulators, <b>users,</b> <b>unions,</b> and the media. One result of inexperience in setting up concession agreement has been that the agreements did not clearly define the information needed for oversight and regulation. Argentine rail concession contracts were supposed to be specific about the way tariffs, quality, investment, exclusivity, and so on, would change over time. And the newly created regulatory bodies were given some discretion about adjusting the contracts in the face of unforeseen developments. However, initial privatization were carried out {{in such a way that}} there was no time to refine terms, so many loopholes remained. Those unforeseen events have happened, and the regulatory agency, the National Commission for Transport Regulation (CNRT), has had to adapt its procedures and decisions to available information. In some cases, alleged modifications of the operating environment have led to renegotiations. Changes have been introduced in the approach to furnishing information to the government for oversight and regulatory accounting. The changes center on clearer definitions in connection with four major issues: a) The measurement of efficiency; b) access prices; and c) the financial model. Circumstances in the Argentine rail industry early in 2001 did not favor dramatic changes, but current renegotiations could be used to adjust information requirements to reflect what has been learned through six yearsof experience.

40|$|A global {{archive of}} {{high-resolution}} (3 -hourly, 0. 58 latitude–longitude grid) window (11 – 12 mm) brightness temperature (Tb) data from multiple satellites {{is being developed}} by the European <b>Union</b> Cloud Archive <b>User</b> Service (CLAUS) project. It {{has been used to}} construct a climatology of the diurnal cycle in convection, cloudiness, and surface temperature for all regions of the Tropics. An example of the application of the climatology to the evaluation of the climate version of the U. K. Met. Office Unified Model (UM), version HadAM 3, is presented. The characteristics of the diurnal cycle described by the CLAUS data agree with previous observational studies, demonstrating the universality of the characteristics of the diurnal cycle for land versus ocean, clear sky versus convective regimes. It is shown that oceanic deep convection tends to reach its maximum in the early morning. Continental convection generally peaks in the evening, although there are interesting regional variations, indicative of the effects of complex land–sea and mountain–valley breezes, as well as the life cycle of mesoscale convective systems. A striking result from the analysis of the CLAUS data has been {{the extent to which the}} strong diurnal signal over land is spread out over the adjacent oceans, probably through gravity waves of varying depths. These coherent signals can be seen for several hundred kilometers and in some instances, such as over the Bay of Bengal, can lead to substantial diurnal variations in convection and precipitation. The example of the use of the CLAUS data in the evaluation of the Met. Office UM has demonstrated that the model has considerable difficulty in capturing the observed phase of the diurnal cycle in convection, which suggests some fundamental difficulties in the model’s physical parameterizations. Analysis of the diurnal cycle represents a powerful tool for identifying and correcting model deficiencies...|$|R
