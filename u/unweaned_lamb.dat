5000|$|Milk-fed lamb — {{meat from}} an <b>unweaned</b> <b>lamb,</b> {{typically}} 4-6 weeks old and weighing 5.5 to 8 kg; {{this is almost}} unavailable {{in countries such as}} the United States and the United Kingdom, while it is popular in Iran and Persian Gulf countries.The flavour and texture of milk-fed lamb when grilled (such as the tiny lamb chops known as chuletillas in Spain) or roasted (lechazo asado or cordero lechal asado) is generally thought to be finer than that of older lamb, and fetches higher prices. [...] The areas in northern Spain where this can be found include Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, and La Rioja. Milk-fed lambs are especially prized for Easter in Greece, when they are roasted on a spit.|$|E
40|$|The modern {{consumer}} of sheep meat requires uninterrupted market supply with qualitatively standardized meat, without excess fat and with high tenderness, which has encouraged producers to slaughter young sheep. A lamb’s diet during the pre-weaning phase was {{discussed in this}} review because it is of great importance for achieving success in a meat production system, given the high speed of lambs’ growth during their first weeks of life. Supplying palatable concentrate in creep-feeders from {{the first days of}} life promotes pre-stomach development and adapts the animal to a solid diet consumption; important processes for enhancing animal performance, since nutritional requirements, especially for energy, are high during this period and can only be met by milk for a short time. An early weaning technique can be adopted from 35 days old, when adequate nutritional support is provided. <b>Unweaned</b> <b>lamb</b> slaughtering combined with creep feeding and controlled feeding have superior effects to early abrupt weaning, probably by avoiding the adverse effects generated by post-weaning stress. The use of a milk replacer is seldom reported due to the difficulty in finding specific products for sheep and its high cost. Controlled suckling does not affect the performance of lambs. Further studies investigating lamb feeding strategies need to be developed during the pre-weaning period...|$|E
40|$|Causes of pre-weaning lamb losses under farm {{conditions}} were investigated among the Shugor and Dubasi ecotypes of the Sudan Desert sheep. On average, these losses accounted for 40. 5 % of the lamb crop, {{but for the}} separate ecotypes these figures were 44. 3 and 36. 7 %, respectively, for the Shugor and Dubasi. Adult sheep mortality rate amounted to 25. 4 %, on average, {{during the period of}} January 1976 to August 1978. Causes of losses were associated mainly with respiratory involvement (30. 8 % for adult ewes and 35. 9 % for <b>unweaned</b> <b>lambs).</b> Type of birth had significantly (...|$|R
5000|$|Lechazo is a Spanish dish {{made from}} [...] "cordero lechal". The meat used is from <b>unweaned</b> <b>lambs,</b> and {{is similar to}} veal, or the meat of [...] "cochinillo", Spanish {{suckling}} pigs.

40|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) is a transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (TSE) (or prion disease) that is readily transmissible to sheep by experimental infection and has the shortest incubation period in animals with the ARQ/ARQ PRNP genotype (at codons 136, 154, and 171). Because {{it is possible that}} sheep in the United Kingdom could have been infected with BSE by being fed contaminated meat and bone meal supplements {{at the same time as}} cattle, there is considerable interest in the responses of sheep to BSE inoculation. Epidemiological evidence suggests that very young individuals are more susceptible to TSE infection; however, this has never been properly tested in sheep. In the present study, low doses of BSE were fed to lambs of a range of ages (∼ 24 h, 2 to 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months) and adult sheep. The incidence of clinical BSE disease after inoculation was high in <b>unweaned</b> <b>lambs</b> (∼ 24 h and 2 to 3 weeks old) but much lower in older weaned animals The incubation period was also found to be influenced by the genotype at codon 141 of the PRNP gene, as lambs that were LF heterozygotes had a longer mean incubation period than those that were homozygotes of either type. The results suggest that sheep in the United Kingdom would have been at high risk of BSE infection only if neonatal animals had inadvertently ingested contaminated supplementary foodstuffs...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the high}} value of land in Brazil, it is {{necessary}} to conduct studies about the economic feasibility of the choice of production strategy. The soil expectation value determines the maximum purchase price of the bare land, considering the horizon of infinite time. Therefore, this methodology was used to assess the financial-economic feasibility of sheep production systems in pasture with either creep feeding or creep grazing termination of <b>unweaned</b> <b>lambs.</b> Six scenarios were proposed to evaluate the economic feasibility, according to the finishing strategy, the dry matter (DM) offer per kg of body weight (BW) per day (12 % or 8 %) and the corresponding percentage of white clover supplementary pasture area (30 % to 50 % - relative to the main pasture area). The soil expectation value was positive in all of the evaluated systems Creep grazing finishing system with 8 % DM offer per kg BW and with 30 % of reduction on the white glover area resulted in the largest financial return (R$ 289, 043. 71) and the highest internal return rate (1. 74 %). The most economically attractive scenario, however, was the creep feeding finishing system with 8 % DM offer per kg of BW, which allowed expenses with the land as high as R$ 22, 950. 68 per hectare. Adjustments in the main pasture offer, which do not compromise animal performance, can enable economic improvement on the feasibility of grazing sheep production systems. The soil expectation value can be used as an economic indicator in the choice of location or expansion of grazing sheep farms...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between sensory traits (tenderness, juiciness, flavour and overall liking) and objective measures, such as shear force, intramuscular fat, cooking loss, pH and animal age, were derived for M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LL) from 471 lamb and sheep carcasses. Tenderness could be predicted {{with the most}} accuracy (R 2 = 0. 24) and flavour with the highest precision (r. s. d. = 7. 5 units) when using the objective measures, which may be {{in part due to}} the small variation in the range of shear force values of the samples (all carcasses electrically stimulated and meat aged for 5 days) and the use of consumer panels for the assessment of sensory traits. The ultimate pH of the LL, the rate of decline in pH in the LL or the predicted temperature at pH 6. 0 were not significant predictors of the sensory traits when tested on a subsample of the carcasses. The model coefficients indicated that all sensory traits (tenderness, flavour, juiciness and overall liking) declined as shear force and age increased, and as intramuscular fat percentage decreased. This translated into a decline of 16 points on average for tenderness and 13 points for overall liking when LL samples from 68. 5 -month-old sheep were compared with those from <b>unweaned</b> <b>lambs,</b> when adjusted to the same level of intramuscular fat and shear force. Predictions of the sensory traits at varying levels of shear force were made and show that at 49 Newtons (N), the overall liking score would be 51 and the tenderness score 48. Derived {{relationships between}} objective meat quality measures and sensory traits suggest that to achieve a failure rate of no more than 10 % for loin meat when eaten, it must have a shear force of about 27 N or less...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bacterial avian pathogens and a common inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract of animals. Most pathogenic E. coli can not be differentiated biochemically or by classic microbiologic methods. Molecular typing methods, particularly PCR, facilitated epidemiological and ecological studies of bacteria. Here we describe the application of a random amplified polymorphic DNA- polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) for molecular genetic differentiation of E. coli isolates in Iran. In this study 58 E. coli isolates including 4 standard strains, 3 food originated isolates, 33 avian isolates, 8 isolates form diarrheic calves and 10 isolates from <b>unweaned</b> diarrheic <b>lambs</b> were analyzed by RAPD-PCR using primer 1247 (5 /-AAG AGC CCG T- 3 /). The RAPD analysis showed that these isolates could be grouped into 33 RAPD types and avian isolates were discriminated into 29 genotypes. It was shown that the primer could not differentiate E. coli isolated from lambs. Discriminatory index for entire isolates was 0. 912 and for avian isolates was 0. 990. We concluded that RAPD-PCR can be used as a method for molecular differentiation of E. coli isolates...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} type of lambs and hoggets on eating quality was {{evaluated}} using the M. longissimus lumborum (LL) and the M. biceps femoris (BF) from 210 animals. The animals comprised 7 types as follows: Poll Dorset or White Suffolk x (Border Leicester x Merino) (second cross <b>unweaned</b> <b>lambs,</b> mixed sex, 3 - 5 months of age); Poll Dorset x (Border Leicester x Merino) (second cross weaned lambs, mixed sex, 9 - 12 months of age); Border Leicester x Merino (BLM; first cross weaned lambs, mixed sex, 9 months of age); Poll Dorset or White Suffolk x Merino (PDM; first cross weaned lambs, wethers, 12 months of age); Merino x Merino (weaned wether lambs, 9 - 12 months of age); Border Leicester x Merino (BLM; first cross hoggets, mixed sex, 20 months of age); and Poll Dorset or White Suffolk x Merino (PDM; first cross hoggets, wethers, 16 months of age). The animals were sourced {{from a number}} of different properties in New South Wales (NSW) (n = 120) and Victoria (n = 90). Each carcass was subjected to high voltage stimulation (700 V) within 1 h of slaughter. All meat was aged for 5 days before freezing and was subsequently tested by consumers on a 0 - 100 scale for a number of attributes after cooking using a grilling procedure. The LL from sucker lambs had the lightest colour (highest L* values) with the hoggets having the darkest colour in the NSW group with differences less apparent in the Victorian group. Muscle from first cross and Merino weaned lambs had consistently higher pH levels across the 3 muscles tested (LL; M. semimembranosus; M. semitendinosus) for the NSW group with no differences detected in the Victorian group. LL meat from second cross sucker and first cross (BLM and PDM) weaned lambs had the highest overall liking score, with that from second cross weaned lambs, BLM hoggets and Merino lambs scored as intermediate, while meat from the PDM hogget group had the lowest overall liking score. A similar outcome was found for the other sensory attributes with differences between types being lower for juiciness compared with overall liking scores but they were of a similar ranking. For the BF there was some re-ranking of the overall liking scores compared with the LL, with meat from suckers and first cross PDM lambs and hoggets being intermediate in score while second cross weaned lambs and first cross BLM lambs had the highest scores. The BF from hoggets (BLM) and Merino lambs were given the lowest scores. The lower juiciness score for sucker BF contributed to this change in ranking compared with the LL...|$|R
