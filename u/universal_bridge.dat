We use industrial strength design drivers such as an MP 3 decoder to test our automatically generated bridges {{for a variety of}} platforms and compare them to manually designed bridges on different quality metrics.

40|$|Abstract- The paper {{presents}} the modeling, simulation {{and analysis of}} an AC-DC converter based PWM rectifier. It provides a suitable control algorithm for a pulse width modulation rectifier which reduces ripple from the DC output side as well as shapes the input current properly. The basic objective of a PWM rectifier is to regulate the DC output voltage and also ensure a sinusoidal input current and unity power factor operation. This is implemented by high speed IGBT switches connected in anti parallel mode across the rectifier diodes. The output voltage is controlled by switching these IGBTS and higher order ripples at the output can be easily eliminated {{with the help of}} passive filters. Lower order harmonics are eliminated using PWM technique. The control subsystem generates gating pulse to the <b>universal</b> <b>bridge</b> by passing the output voltage through a network consisting of comparator, discrete PI controller and discrete PWM generator. The output of this generator are the gating pulses to be applied to the <b>universal</b> <b>bridge.</b> By this control method, we have tried to reduce the input current harmonic distortion and bring the input current and voltage in same phase as well as make it sinusoidal. The control of modulation index(m) and phi has been shown in the closed loop system. This paper {{presents the}} state of the art in the field of regenerative rectifiers with reduced input harmonics and improved power factor.

The orientation of RRF {{is consistent with the}} position determined on a 70 S-RRF complex by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM).

At 3. 3 Å resolution, RRF is seen to interact exclusively with ribosomal elements associated with tRNA binding and/or translocation. Furthermore, these results now provide a high-resolution structural description of the conformational changes that were suspected to occur on the 70 S-RRF complex, which has implications for the synergistic action of RRF with elongation factor G (EF-G).

Appropriate electrical properties of barium titanate-based materials, such as magnitude of relative dielectric permittivity and the Curie temperature, {{can be achieved}} by varying sintering conditions (which influenced ceramics’ microstructure) and/or by doping with various cations. In this study, we investigated the influence of sintering atmosphere (air and argon) on the crystal structure, microstructure, dielectric and optical properties of barium titanate-stannate (BTS; BaTi 1 -xSnxO 3) ceramics. The BTS powders (with x = 0, 0. 05 and 0. 1; denoted BT, BTS 5 and BTS 10, respectively) were synthesized by the solid-state reaction technique. The powders were subsequently uniaxially pressed (P = 240 MPa) into cylindrical compacts (ø 6 mm and h ≈ 2 mm) and sintered in SETSYS TMA (Setaram Instrumentation, Caluire, France). Sintering experiments were performed at a heating rate of 10 °/min up 1420 °C and with a dwell time of 2 hours; to determine the influence of sintering atmosphere, two sets of experiments were performed: (1) in air, and (2) in Ar. During sintering, the shrinkage was recorded in the axial (h) direction. The crystal structure of the BTS ceramics was studied at room temperature by X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy.
