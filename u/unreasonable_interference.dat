500|$|Nuisance in English law {{is an area}} of {{tort law}} broadly divided into two torts; private nuisance, where the actions of the {{defendant}} are [...] "causing a substantial and <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with a 's land or his/her use or enjoyment of that land", and public nuisance, where the defendant's actions [...] "materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects"; public nuisance is also a crime. Both torts have been present from the time of Henry III, being affected by a variety of philosophical shifts through the years which saw them become first looser and then far more stringent and less protecting of an individual's rights. Each tort requires the claimant to prove that the defendant's actions caused interference, which was unreasonable, and in some situations the intention of the defendant may also be taken into account. A significant difference is that private nuisance does not allow a claimant to claim for any personal injury suffered, while public nuisance does.|$|E
500|$|Private {{nuisance}} {{was defined}} in Bamford v Turnley, where George Wilshere, 1st Baron Bramwell defined it as [...] "any continuous activity or {{state of affairs}} causing a substantial and <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with a [...] land or his use or enjoyment of that land". Private nuisance, unlike public nuisance, is only a tort, and damages for personal injuries are not recoverable. Only {{those who have a}} legal interest in the affected land can sue; an exception was made in Khorasandjian v Bush, where the Court of Appeal held that a woman living in her mother's house was entitled to an injunction to prevent telephone harassment despite having no legal interest in the property. In Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, however, the House of Lords rejected this development, arguing that to remove the need for an interest in the affected property would transform the tort of nuisance from a tort to land into a tort to the person. The liable party under private nuisance is the creator, even if he is no longer in occupation of the land or created a nuisance on somebody else's land. In Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan, it was held that the defendant was liable for a nuisance (a set of water pipes) even though he had not created it, because he had used the pipes and thereby [...] "adopted" [...] the nuisance.|$|E

50|$|For a {{nuisance}} {{that the law}} will provide a remedy, there must he a substantial and <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with the property interest being asserted. The interference can be negligent or intentional. For instance in the duties of farm operations, an action constituting {{a nuisance}} will be deemed intentional {{even if it is}} unintended if it is an easily likely consequence of the farmer's otherwise protected farming activities. The drifting of sprayed farm pesticides onto a neighbor's land is considered an intentional nuisance even though this particular result is unintended.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interference}} must {{be substantial}} and unreasonable {{in order to}} establish public nuisance. In modern world, daily inconveniences and annoyances are part of <b>unreasonable</b> and substantial <b>interference.</b> However, there are some examples that shows even if it could cause interference to the public, there is no public nuisance. For example, in case Maitland v Raisbeck, [...] "it would seem that every driver of a vehicle on the road would be turned into an insurer in respect of latent defects in this machines", even if a danger was created because of moral use of vehicle. In the case Silservice Pty Ltd v Supreme Bready Pty Ltd (1950) 50 SR NSW 127, it appears that in cases of this kind if the defendant has available to him reasonable means of removing or avoiding the obstruction, he is responsible for the nuisance if he does not, adopt those means. The test is not whether an obstruction has been caused, but whether the obstruction could reasonably have been avoided: 63 L.Q.R. 147, and cf. Fabbri v. Marris.(5) I think, however, {{that this is not the}} sole test of whether a person is responsible for the nuisance caused by the assembly of a crowd of people, and that a more absolute liability rests upon the person whose business involves the gathering together of a crowd, or who, apart from any consideration of the bona fide conduct of his business, deliberately continues to gather the crowd.|$|R

Critics claim that much of the poverty caused in British Columbia is a result of regressive land use policies. Many ALR property owners, especially those closer to urban areas where commercial real estate prices are high, maintain vacant lots in anticipation of zoning changes, as the ALR does not stipulate that the land must produce, agriculturally speaking. However, media reports still indicate that the ALR has widespread popularity among British Columbia voters.|$|E

50|$|Nuisances {{are part}} of tort law. Torts are civil wrongs whether {{intentional}} or accidental from which injury occurs to another. Nuisances can be public or private. A public nuisance is an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with a right common {{to the general public}} while a private nuisance is an interference with a person's enjoyment and use of his land. Black's Law Dictionary defines a nuisance as... that which annoys and disturbs one in possession of his property, rendering its ordinary use and occupation physically uncomfortable to him. It defines a private nuisance as:..anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another. As distinguished from public nuisance, it includes any wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the property of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with their lawful use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which unlawfully hinders them in the enjoyment of a common or public right and causes them a special injury different from that sustained by the general public. The word nuisance is connected closely with the word disturbance which is used extensively in many noise ordinances. A definition below further restricts the meaning to noise disturbance. Nuisance law applies to both community noise regulation as well as private suits brought to court to reduce noise impact.|$|E

40|$|<b>Unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> of {{business}} activities, {{a type of}} unfair trade practices prohibited under Article 23 of the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act has a unique nature {{in that it is}} very hard to distinguish illegal <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> from legal aggressive pro-competitive business practices which the Act should encourage. In particular, when interference with the competitor’s business is performed by means of rendering beneficial treatments to dealers for promoting one’s own business, the distinction between illegal and legal one is blurred.

40|$|This article {{critically}} considers {{calls for}} the pre-cautionary principle to inform judicial decision mak-ing in a private law context {{in light of the}} Hoffman litigation, where it is alleged that the potential for genetic contamination from genetically modified (GM) crops causes an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with the rights of organic farmers to use and enjoy their lands, giving rise to an actionable nuisance.

40|$|Generally, {{the fact}} that a {{plaintiff}} comes to a nuisance is not a per se defense to a nuisance action. This defense is viewed in many jurisdictions as but a factor in determining whether a defendant’s conduct is an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with use and enjoyment of a neighbor’s property. In principle, two other affirmative defenses are — although not often allowed in practice by the courts — found in contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. This Article seeks to develop a theory of economic captivity which embraces the notion that a plaintiff may be constrained, socio-economically, in making choices which restrict options for living accommodations. Because of these constraints, low-income individuals and families may be forced to live in surroundings which may well challenge contemporary standards of habitability or in an environment which interferes unreasonably with the use and enjoyment of their real property. Put directly, an individual’s socio-economic status should not preclude his access, through the law of nuisance, for redress of actions which compromise the enjoyment of his property rights. The theory of economic captivity allows a plaintiff to, essentially, blunt efforts by a defendant — through use of an affirmative defense — to assert that a plaintiff came to the nuisance and is therefore responsible for this acquiescence or condonation of the very condition for which he is complaining. The defense of economic captivity would serve to fortify the rights of an injured plaintiff and thereby not subject him to assertions that he knowingly came to and accepted the unreasonable living condition of which he now asserts is an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with the use and enjoyment of his property. The efficacy of various federal programs (e. g., Federal Uniform Relocation Act), together with state and local government initiatives (e. g., managed growth), will be analyzed. These government efforts seek to either move low-income economic captives into more desirable locations, or — alternatively — subsidize these marginal households to remain in their present location. Ideally, programs of this nature should serve as catalysts for incentivizing an ethic of good property use and maintenance both from present and from future property owners. At the same time, the federal programs, in particular, acknowledge the ideal that every citizen — regardless of economic status — should enjoy minimum levels of habitability which are not compromised by conditions which have the effect of restricting, unreasonably, use and enjoyment of their property...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> of {{concurrent}} threads {{makes the}} testing activity for concurrent systems a difficult task. Test case explosion {{is the major}} problem in concurrency testing and make an interruption in systematic testing of concurrent systems. In this paper we propose an approach of generating test cases from combinational UML models. In our approach Activity Diagram (AD) and Sequence Diagram (SD) are used to model a system. The AD has converted into a graph called Activity Graph (AG) and SD into a graph called Sequence Graph (SG). Finally AG and SG are combined to form a graph called Activity Sequence Graph (ASG). The ASG is traversed using a traversing algorithm to generate the test cases. After comparing the test cases generated from ASG with the test cases generated from AG and SG, {{it is found that}} the test cases generated from ASG gives a better coverage when compared with the test cases from single modelling graph. The test cases are generated by controlling the test case explosion and are useful for controlling synchronization fault, loop fault, as well as scenario faults and interaction faults...|$|E
40|$|A {{nuisance}} is an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with an owner’s {{right to}} use and enjoy her land. The tort of nuisance must be understood {{if we are to}} understand the nature, scope, and justification of private property rights. As the latter task is among the most important ones facing legal and political philosophers in a democratic society, such as ours, the former is crucial. Yet, we lack anything like a viable theory of nuisance law. The two most prominent—the economic view and the physical-invasion view—both fail, doc-trinally and normatively. Things are so bad for nuisance that it has been called a ‘legal garbage can. ’ We can do better, and we need to do better. Nuisance law protects owners by protecting their normative control, their capacity to determine what will happen on their land, and protects the core of their rights as owners of real property. Moreover, the scope of nuisance law helps fix the scope of this normative control; in other words, nui-sance is partially determinative of the normative boundaries of ownership. Looking at nuisance helps reveal a distinctive understanding of private ownership and thus, reveal property rights’ place as partially constitutive of a just society. Looking at nuisance this way also helps us see why its core doctrines are what they are: the reasonability standard at the heart of nuisance, along with its core doctrines relating to locations, time, and the objectivity of nuisance all bring out a normatively attractive vision of nuisance law and, therefore, of private property rights...|$|E
40|$|Nearly {{a decade}} ago, the Supreme Court in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council {{held that a}} {{regulation}} that denies to a landowner all economically beneficial use of the regulated land is a per se taking that requires the payment of just compensation under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. The Court added, however, that the regulator can avoid takings liability if the use interests proscribed by the regulation {{were not part of}} the title to begin with because they were reflected in 2 ̆ 2 background principles 2 ̆ 2 of the state 2 ̆ 7 s law of property and nuisance. This article addresses whether those background principles must inhere in the common law or may have statutory or regulatory derivation.

40|$|Individuals enjoy {{privacy in}} their person, in their {{personal}} spaces, and also in their biographical core of personal information. A successful claim for the exclusion of evidence {{on the basis of}} an infringement of section 8 of the Charter requires that three questions be answered in the affirmative: (1) is there a reasonable expectation of privacy? (2) has there been an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with that expectation? and (3) does the infringement warrant exclusion of the evidence? Turning to the first question, the determination of the issue ultimately rests on whether our societal values are such that we are prepared to acknowledge that the accused had a valid and enforceable expectation of privacy. Early on in the jurisprudence, the Supreme Court of Canada answered this question by resorting to a very general and normative form of analysis, largely disconnected from the actual facts of the case, leading to results that were unlikely to conform with societal expectations of what is just. Subsequently, the Court moved towards an approach that remained normative, but firmly rooted in the unique circumstances of the particular case. In deciding whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in information, the enquiry should be guided by {{the extent to which the}} information in question promotes the values protected by section 8, the dignity and autonomy of the individual. Not all information warrants protection, particularly that which actually undermines the values promoted by section 8. Turning to the second question, the Supreme Court has recently introduced confusion into the law concerning searches in the regulatory context. Searches in the regulatory context were typically not required to comply with the requirement of prior judicial authorization, if they were necessary to ensure compliance with the regulatory framework. However, in the recent decision of R. v. Jarvis, a tax prosecution case, the Court has indicated that investigators must abandon the use of their audit and inspection powers, once their purpose shifts to the determination of penal, as opposed to tax, liability. Jarvis raises many questions and investigators will need to be very careful before relying on a warrantless power of inspection to build a case for prosecution purposes. The decision whether to exclude evidence rests on a balancing of the state’s interest in law enforcement against the privacy rights of the accused. Privacy rights are often subordinated to the state interest in law enforcement, as the Charter is not the only means by which society seeks to promote the dignity, integrity and autonomy of the individual. Conduct is often criminalized in order to protect individuals from having their rights, including privacy rights, invaded by wrongdoers. The individual who has committed an offence should not evade criminal liability for his acts by being permitted to shield himself behind rights he has himself invaded. The state interest in law enforcement should ordinarily prevail in the face of a claim of privacy infringement, unless the state’s conduct is both egregious and deliberate...|$|E
40|$|In Kroeger v. Department of Environmental Protection, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, {{held that}} the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) had {{appropriately}} denied a private landowner a permit to build a dock. Out of nine permitting criteria enforced by the DEP, the court {{held that the}} structure would violate one criterion: the <b>unreasonable</b> <b>interference</b> with the scenic uses of Somes Sound. The majority cited the enjoyment of the Sound by boaters and recreationalists, as well as the nearby tourist attraction of Acadia National Park as factors supporting the area’s scenic use. The majority found that the DEP had not arbitrarily denied the permit and that the plaintiff had practicable alternatives to building the proposed dock, including utilizing a local marina and making boat launches from the shore. The dissenting opinion, however, argued the plaintiff’s application satisfied the DEP’s wetland permitting criteria and that no perceptible visual impairment would occur by constructing the plaintiff’s proposed dock. The dissent maintained that the plaintiff had no practicable alternatives by which to reasonably access and utilize the waterfront. In addition, the dissent criticized the majority for overlooking the plaintiff’s property rights as a landowner and instead deferring too readily to the DEP’s decision regarding scenic uses. The Kroeger decision highlights the ongoing debate over the use of aesthetics as a legitimate basis for regulations protecting visual resources. The subject of aesthetics is by its nature controversial: at its heart are questions and subjective assessments pertaining to beauty - its value, importance, and whether it should or should not be afforded protection in particular situations. Nonetheless, aesthetic regulations have existed throughout this country’s history, gaining traction in the early 20 th century. The United States Supreme Court has addressed the issue of aesthetic regulations, first via zoning cases, and then by way of dicta forceful enough to inspire the growth of aesthetic regulations by state governments. Aesthetic regulations have been and continue to be utilized in Maine, as demonstrated by Kroeger. Indeed, much of the case law surrounding aesthetics in Maine involves the DEP’s scenic uses provision, and often focuses on coastal locales. However, Kroeger offers a new dimension because it involves the issue of tourism along Maine’s coast. The question now arises: given the important role tourism plays in this state’s economy, how should the Law Court weigh the competing interests of preserving both aesthetic value and land owners’ rights when the protected area is near a coastal tourist destination? This Note considers where Maine generally stands in the national debate regarding aesthetic regulation after Kroeger, and where it may be headed in terms of coastal aesthetic regulation. First, this Note chronicles how aesthetic regulations slowly developed from the general laws of nuisance into the legitimate exercise of the police powers. It then describes the two different approaches taken by various jurisdictions in this country for validating aesthetic regulations. The first approach is premised on the belief that aesthetic regulations on their face fit securely within the general welfare prong of the police powers. The other approach relegates aesthetics to a secondary role, not allowing them to stand alone, but rather to play an ancillary role in the government interests of health, safety, moral, or general welfare. This Note then chronicles how Maine specifically has interpreted aesthetic regulations, analyzing the approaches in Kroeger that the Law Court’s majority and dissent utilized, and criticizing both sides for not more fully explaining their rationales. In conclusion, this Note contends that in its next relevant case the Law Court should more fully detail the preferred basis for aesthetic regulations in Maine, potentially creating a litmus test for cases involving popular coastal scenic areas. In addition, this Note suggests that the Maine Legislature could include the promotion of the economy, which would encompass tourism, as a legitimate category within the state’s police powers. Such a specific governmental directive would decidedly aid the Law Court in future coastal aesthetic regulations cases...|$|E
