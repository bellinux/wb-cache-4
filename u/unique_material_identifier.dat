Finally, the article looks at some implications of the electronic revolution. While digitization can provide worldwide access to <b>unique</b> <b>materials,</b> it also leads to increased demands {{for access to the}} originals. The article concludes with this paradox, setting a context for dilemmas that will increasingly face spe-cial collections librarians...|$|R
