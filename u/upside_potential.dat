40|$|Abstract: It is {{negative}} risk {{if there is}} a good chance of coming out better than our reference level. This paper proposes a general risk measure: bilateral partial moment, where downside risk is supplemented with the “upside potential”. Variance, mean absolute deviation, semi-variance and other downside risk definition are all incorporated in this framework. The portfolio selection problems in this general class of risk model are discussed. The portfolio optimization provides the flexibility for the selection of an appropriate target return and the weight of <b>upside</b> <b>potentials...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{rationale}} of {{a product}} family architecture (PFA) has been well recognized as an effective means to achieve mass customization. Investing into a PFA creates flexibility {{for the company to}} accommodate future customization requirements while taking a risk by increasing complexity in design and production. Thus an important issue of PFA is the economic justification of flexibility. This paper applies the real option theory to the valuation of PFA flexibility. A real option model is proposed, in which product family design within a PFA is referred to as an investment strategy being crafted by a series of options that are continuously exercised to achieve expected returns on investment. The real option approach surmounts traditional discounted cash flow analysis based valuation methods that tend to ignore the <b>upside</b> <b>potentials</b> to an investment from management flexibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{rationale}} {{of product}} family design {{has been well}} recognized by both academia and industries alike. It is important to justify the economic latitude of product families. The traditional valuation approaches based on discounted-cash-flow analysis tend to ignore the <b>upside</b> <b>potentials</b> from managerial flexibility inherent in the product family design process. This paper adopts a real option approach to model product family design as an investment strategy being crafted {{by a series of}} options that are continuously exercised to achieve expected returns on investment. The focus is on the identification of real options associated with product family design. In accordance with the real options identified, a valuation framework is developed. To demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the real option framework, a case study of mobile phone vibration motor family design is reported...|$|R

50|$|Hence high VIX {{readings}} mean investors see {{significant risk}} that the market will move sharply, whether downward or upward.

40|$|The report finds clear {{evidence}} of the potential of frontier technologies to contribute to social, economic and political development gains {{in a number of}} ways, by: • Driving innovations in business models, products and processes that provide new goods and services to ‘bottom of the pyramid’ consumers; • Providing the means by which to make better use of existing underutilised household and productive assets; • Catalysing increases in demand, nationally and internationally, which create new industries and markets, leading to macro- and microeconomic growth; and • Changing demand for labour and capital, leading to direct job creation and transformation of the workforce. For all of the <b>potential</b> <b>upsides,</b> <b>potential</b> downsides must also be considered. While it will largely be the private sector that will drive deployment of these technologies, the public sector through national regulation, as well as development financing, will have a major role in mediating the pace and direction of technological change, both to achieve development objectives, and to protect potential losers. As new technologies and digital business models reshape economies and disrupt incumbencies, interest has surged in the potential of novel frontier technologies to also contribute to positive changes in international development and humanitarian contexts. Widespread adoption of new technologies is acknowledged as centrally important to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. But while frontier technologies can rapidly address large-scale economic, social or political challenges, they can also involve the displacement of existing technologies and carry considerable uncertainty and risk. Although there have been significant wins bringing the benefits of new technologies to poor consumers through examples such as mobile money or off-grid solar energy, there are many other areas where the applications may not yet have been developed into viable market solutions, or where opportunities have not yet been taken up in development practice...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of default risk and growth options in {{explaining}} {{the market value of}} equity, besides that of earnings and book value of equity. Default risk is measured by the option-based probability of default at debt’s maturity, while the growth options measure capturing the firm’s <b>upside</b> growth <b>potential</b> is estimated from a regression model of option-based variables. Our main sample consists of 965 U. S. firms that filed for bankruptcy during 1992 - 2002. We also use three additional sub-samples of “healthy ” firms as controls, with varying degrees of financial distress and growth prospects, to examine the conditionality of the impact of these factors. Our results confirm that growth options dominate {{the role of}} book equity (and net income) in proxying for unrecognized net assets. The default risk seems to have a mixed effect: a traditional distress risk penalty with a negative impact on equity value for distressed firms or value firms on main exchanges; and a (equityholders’) default option, reflected positively in current equity market values in the case of more volatile firms traded on Nasdaq. Our results confirm that use of earnings and book equity indeed proxy for (omitted) distress and growth option effects...|$|R
