5|$|Highway32 {{was assumed}} on July 24, 1929, {{following}} the <b>unimproved</b> road between Gananoque and Highway15.|$|E
5|$|It was {{surveyed}} in 1854 by Ontario's deputy surveyor, Charles Rankin, {{to provide a}} short route between the undeveloped Sydenham (now Owen Sound) and Hepworth townsites. This route passed through a large swamp {{and as a result}} remained an <b>unimproved</b> one lane trail up until the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The 79th Rescue Squadron {{operates}} the HC-130J Combat King II and provides combat rescue forces to theater commanders worldwide. It conducts helicopter air refueling, airdrop, and landing of pararescue personnel on <b>unimproved</b> runways, {{and equipment to}} recover combat personnel. Its crews fly low-level operations and perform these missions day or night.|$|E
5|$|Walton and Ivythorn Hills {{are covered}} {{by a variety of}} {{semi-natural}} habitats. These include <b>unimproved</b> calcareous grassland, scrubland and coppiced woodland including field maple and Ash. The range of habitats are home to many species of invertebrate. Butterflies, Leafhoppers, Spiders and Soldier Flies are particularly well represented. There is also a population of Great Green Bush Cricket (Tettigonia viridissima).|$|E
5|$|By 1926, the Kingsland–St. Marys highway was a sand or dirt road. When the Folkston–Kingsland {{stretch of}} SR40 reappeared on maps in February 1932, the highway was {{recorded}} as an <b>unimproved</b> but maintained road. SR40 was under construction along its present alignment from US17 in Kingsland {{to the south}} end of Osborne Street in St. Marys by October 1934; the highway was completed as a paved road by January 1936. The highway from Folkston to the Charlton–Camden county line was under construction by October 1936. The construction was extended east from the county line to the highway's original SR110 junction in July 1937. When construction concluded in October 1937, there was a paved highway from Folkston to the county line and a graded but otherwise <b>unimproved</b> highway from there to SR110. SR40 between Colerain and the western edge of Kingsland was under construction by July 1939 and paving was completed in January 1941. The gap in Kingsland was placed under construction by April 1941 but was not completed until the beginning of 1943.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans <b>unimproved,</b> sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to {{the west}} between the two rivers into {{the foothills of the}} Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and {{south-east}} {{on the south side of}} the Kennet as far as Whitley Wood, Lower Earley and Woodley; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely <b>unimproved</b> floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet floodplain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area, which is a cause of road congestion there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Menage {{had begun to}} {{purchase}} land near Puget Sound in Washington, accumulating several thousand acres which he planned to develop into an iron mine, smelter and steel mill, along with housing for the workers. To finance the development he sold an early form of mortgage-backed security to investors in New England and Europe. When the Panic of 1893 occurred, investors found that Menage's properties were fraudulent. Many of the deeds were held by random names taken from the Minneapolis and Saint Paul telephone books, the properties themselves were <b>unimproved,</b> and the payments to investors were being made out of the bank's funds.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway 44, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 44, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The -long route began at Highway15 in the town of Almonte and travelled eastward through Lanark County towards Ottawa, ending at Highway17. Highway44 was assumed by the province in 1938 along existing <b>unimproved</b> roadway. A significant portion of the highway was incorporated into a new routing of Highway17 in 1966. The highway alignment remained generally unchanged for the next three decades until it was decommissioned in 1997 and transferred to Lanark County and what is now the City of Ottawa. The road has since been redesignated as Lanark County Road49 and Ottawa Road49.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{original}} routing {{of what is now}} I-84 existed as early as 1923; however the portion of now I-84 into Idaho was not yet constructed. In 1926, much of the route was signed as US-30S, from the now eastern terminus at I-80 (US-530 then), northwest into Ogden. Between Ogden and Brigham City, the highway was to be concurrent with US-91, then US-30S split off northwest to the Idaho border. The entire western branch of US-30S was an <b>unimproved</b> road, however the concurrency into Ogden was paved. The remainder of the route to its now terminus was mostly graded with a few improved sections, and by 1937, the entire route was paved.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form {{available}} in commercial nurseries is <b>unimproved</b> Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. It prefers a sunny aspect without exposure to frosts, and tolerates fairly heavy pruning. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 5 to 6 weeks to germinate. Flowering begins at around four to six years from seed. The other subspecies are less well known in cultivation, but are obtainable. Cultivation is presumably similar to B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, except that B.integrifolia subsp. monticola may be assumed frost-tolerant. Dwarf forms of B.integrifolia are sometimes sold, and a registered prostrate cultivar, Banksia 'Roller Coaster', is available. The latter is a vigorous ground-hugging plant that can spread to 4 or 5 metres across yet remains only 50 centimetres high.|$|E
5|$|The plutons in {{the park}} are Jurassic and Cretaceous aged and are located toward the park's western margin {{where they can be}} seen from <b>unimproved</b> roads. One of these {{relatively}} small granitic plutons was emplaced 6787 Ma and spawned one of the more profitable precious metal deposits in the Death Valley area, giving rise to the town and mines of Skidoo. In the Death Valley area these solidified blobs of magma are located under much of the Owlshead Mountains and are found in the western end of the Panamint Mountains. Thrusted areas can be seen at Schwaub Peak {{in the southern part of}} the Funeral Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The road {{has evolved}} from {{historical}} routes, {{some of which are}} thousands of years old including the Harrow Way and the Fosse Way. The modern route was first laid out in the early 19th century as the New Direct Road, a faster coaching route from London to Exeter. It was initially in demand but fell into disuse as railways became popular from the 1840s onwards. It was not thought of as a significant through route when roads were initially numbered, but was revived as a major road in 1933, eventually becoming a trunk road in 1958. Since then, the A303 has gradually been upgraded to modern standards, though there are still several <b>unimproved</b> parts.|$|E
5|$|The trail, {{like the}} Wallkill Valley Rail Trail to the north, {{is part of}} the former Wallkill Valley Railroad's rail corridor. The land was {{purchased}} by the towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk in 1985 and converted to a public trail. The portion of the trail in Shawangunk was formally opened in 1993 and named after former town supervisor Jesse McHugh. Plans to pave the trail between Walden and Wallkill were discussed since 2001, and the route was finally paved between 2008 and 2009. The trail includes an unofficial, <b>unimproved</b> section to the north of Wallkill, and is bounded by NY 52 and NY 208.|$|E
5|$|Waldron's {{squadron}} sighted {{the enemy}} carriers and began attacking at 09:20, followed by Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6, from Enterprise) whose Wildcat fighter escorts also ran low on fuel {{and had to}} turn back at 09:40. Without fighter escort, all 15 TBD Devastators of VT-8 were shot down {{without being able to}} inflict any damage. Ensign George H. Gay, Jr. was the only survivor of the 30 aircrew of VT-8. VT-6 lost 10 of its 14 Devastators, and 10 of Yorktowns VT-3's 12 Devastators were shot down with no hits to show for their effort, {{thanks in part to the}} abysmal performance of their <b>unimproved</b> Mark 13 torpedoes. Midway was the last time the TBD Devastator was used in combat.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the main}} road {{southeast}} from Klamath Falls, still <b>unimproved</b> in California, headed southeast to State Highway Route 28 (now SR 299) at Canby rather than south to Bieber. There travelers could head east on Route 28 to Alturas and south on the present US 395 (not a state highway north of Susanville until 1933) towards Reno. The California state legislature passed a law in 1939, providing for state takeover of the Canby-Oregon road if the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Public Roads were to construct and pave it. The road was in fact mostly paved by mid-1939, and under construction or completed by mid-1940, when Oregon Route 58 opened, continuing the corridor northwest from Klamath Falls. In 1943 the legislature gave it the Route 210 designation; Oregon had added the short connecting Hatfield Highway to its state highway system in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, <b>unimproved</b> neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} low tail dock and {{generally}} <b>unimproved</b> anatomy, Jacob ewes are widely {{reputed to be}} easy-lambing. Jacobs are seasonal breeders, with ewes generally cycling in the cooler months of the autumn. They will begin to cycle during the first autumn following their birth and most often the ewe's first lamb is a single. Subsequent gestations will typically bear one or two lambs in the spring, and triplets are not unusual. The lambs will exhibit their spotting and horn characteristics at birth, with the horn buds more readily apparent on ram lambs. Lambs may be weaned at two months of age, but many shepherds do not separate lambs and allow the ewe to wean the lamb at about 4months of age. Jacob ewes are instinctively attentive mothers and are protective of their lambs. They are included in commercial flocks in England because of their ease of lambing and strong mothering instincts.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and <b>unimproved</b> by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions {{as to whether he}} had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|State Route 237 was {{assigned}} in 1928, during the mass numbering of state highways within Pennsylvania. The termini {{at the time}} were with State Route 37 and State Route 137, the former of which was the parent route. At the time, the entire highway was an <b>unimproved</b> gravel road. This lasted for four years, until 1932, when the Pennsylvania Department of Highways paved the highway. The highway remained relatively unchanged until 1946, when the highway was decommissioned in a mass deletion of state highways within the commonwealth. The current alignment of former State Route 237 is now Pike County Quadrant Route 1012 from PA 590 to the Shohola Township border. The rest is locally maintained, with a piece at PA 434 designated Shohola Township Roads 413 and 454. The two state routes at the termini, State Routes 37 and 137, are now State Routes 434 and 590.|$|E
5|$|The gap in Utah {{was soon}} {{bypassed}} by taking US 50 to the north, crossing the Great Salt Lake Desert with U.S. Route 40 to Salt Lake City, and using long portions of U.S. Route 93 in Nevada and U.S. Route 89 in Utah. U.S. Route 6 was marked along the direct, but still partially <b>unimproved,</b> route in 1937; {{it was finally}} paved in 1952, and US 50 was moved to it within a few years. Another straightening was made in 1976, when US 50 in central Utah was moved south onto the new extension of Interstate 70 {{at the request of}} the National Highway 50 Federation, a group dedicated to promoting US 50. Among other things, the group has unsuccessfully pushed for an extension of Interstate 70 west along US 50 to California.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} K-383 {{southwest}} of Almena {{was part of}} the Rock Island Highway, an auto trail that paralleled the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad northeast from Colby to Norton and then east along the northern tier of the state to St. Joseph, Missouri. When the U.S. Highway System was laid out in 1926, the Rock Island Highway, which had become integrated into the Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway, was designated US-36. The portion of K-383 north of the US-36 split was K-22. By 1927, all of the highway along the K-383 corridor followed section lines, with a great number of right-angle turns, except for a small section south of Almena. US-36 and K-22 were graded throughout Norton County but were <b>unimproved</b> dirt roads in Decatur, Phillips, and Sheridan counties.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{the first}} {{prolonged}} conflict in Britain to involve the use of artillery and gunpowder. Sieges became a prominent {{part of the war}} with over 300 occurring during the period. Worcester was once again a strategically important region in the war, and walled towns and cities like Worcester that could be defended against passing armies were particularly significant from a military perspective. By the 1640s the design of military fortifications had progressed significantly on the continent, owing largely to the Thirty Years War; while older medieval stone walls still had military utility, they typically needed reinforcement with more modern earthworks to be truly effective. These new ideas were applied to city defences in England. In some cases a circuit of forts was built around a city; in other cases, an entirely new city wall comprising modern bastions would be built. At Worcester, the <b>unimproved</b> walls were considered to be indefensible {{at the start of the}} war in 1642, and the chosen solution was to directly reinforce the existing medieval wall with new earthworks.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route 147 was an <b>unimproved</b> {{road back}} in 1927. When the 500-series county routes were {{established}} in the 1950s, this road {{became a part of}} County Route 585, a route that ran from Route 109 (then a part of U.S. Route 9) in Lower Township north to U.S. Route 30 and Route 157 in Absecon. The route was also designated as part of County Route 18, which continued west past U.S. Route 9 to Route 47. In 1971, Route 147 was designated to replace the portion of County Route 18/County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 in Burleigh and the North Wildwood border. As a result of a bridge replacement over the Grassy Sound, Route 147 was realigned off its former drawbridge, and the former alignment became Cape May County Route 665. The southern terminus of County Route 585 was eventually truncated its current location at Route 52 in Somers Point. By the 1990s, Route 147 was extended to its current terminus at New York Avenue in North Wildwood.|$|E
5|$|As part of Oregon's {{initial state}} highway system, {{the road from}} Grants Pass {{southwest}} to Wilderville and then along the Crescent City Plank Road to the state line was named the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway No. 25 in November 1917. At the time, the Grants Pass-Crescent City route, via the Gasquet Toll Road, was a narrow, winding unpaved mountain road with long grades and some remaining plank road in California. California added its portion to the state highway system in 1919, for the state's third highway bond issue, {{as an extension of}} Legislative Route 1. By 1924, the road was part of the Redwood Highway, which continued south to Sausalito, but was still completely <b>unimproved</b> between Crescent City and Waldo, Oregon. (Oregon changed the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway name to Redwood Highway in May 1924.) A new highway between Gasquet and Kerby was completed by the two states in September 1926, and in June 1929 the new Hiouchi Bridge over the Smith River was dedicated, bypassing the remainder of the old road over Howland Hill. In 1948, US 199 became part of the Winnemucca to the Sea Highway, organized to promote the route that has largely become Nevada State Route 140 and Oregon Route 140 from I-80 at Winnemucca, Nevada to Crescent City. One major improvement to the highway's alignment was made after 1929: the Collier Tunnel replaced the winding route over Hazel View Summit in California on July 20, 1963.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} {{originally}} become DE 404 was an <b>unimproved</b> county road, with the section east of Bridgeville under contract {{as a state}} highway. The entire route of what would become DE 404 was completed as a state highway to a point northwest of Bridgeville by 1924. By 1931, the road was built as a state highway northwest to the Maryland border. DE 404 was designated to run from the Maryland border, where it connected to MD 404, southeast to DE 18 southeast of Bridgeville by 1936. The route followed its current alignment to Bridgeville, where it passed through the town on Market Street and South Main Street before picking up its current alignment east of US 13. At this time, what is now DE 404 past its then-eastern terminus was designated as part of DE 18. By 1987, DE 404 was extended east to DE 1 in Five Points, following DE 18 to Georgetown and US 9 (which had replaced a portion of DE 18) from Georgetown to Five Points. DE 404 Alt. was created to bypass Bridgeville {{to the north and}} east by 1990, following Newton Road and US 13. The alternate route became a part of mainline DE 404 by 1999, with the former DE 404 through Bridgeville becoming DE 404 Bus.|$|E
5|$|The current {{alignments}} of MS 198 existed by 1928 as unnumbered roads. The {{sections in}} Tylertown, Columbia, Hattiesburg, and Beaumont were gravel roads and the sections in McLain and Lucedale were <b>unimproved</b> roads. By 1932, {{what is now}} MS 198 in Tylertown, Columbia, Hattiesburg, Beaumont, and McLain {{became a part of}} MS 24, which ran east-west across {{the southern part of the}} state. The section of road in McLain became a gravel road by 1933. In 1935, the road west of Tylertown became paved. MS 15 was designated onto MS 24 east of Beaumont and in McLain and what is now the Lucedale portion of MS 198 in 1936. A year later, the portion of road east of Lucedale was paved. In 1938, the portion of current MS 198 southwest of Columbia was paved. The road east of Tylertown was paved by 1939. In 1940, a new alignment of MS 24 between McComb and Tylertown was under construction, which included what is now MS 198 northwest of Tylertown. Also by this time, the road between Columbia and MS 44 was paved. In 1941, the portions of road in Hattiesburg, east of Beaumont, in McLain, and northwest of Lucedale were paved. The road west of Beaumont was paved in 1943. The portion of MS 24 between McComb and Tylertown was completed as a paved road in 1944. In 1955, US 98 was extended into Mississippi, replacing the MS 24 and MS 15 designations on what is now MS 198.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where <b>unimproved</b> they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E
25|$|For {{monitoring}} purposes, {{two categories}} were created: 1) improved sanitation and (2) <b>unimproved</b> sanitation. Open defecation {{falls into the}} category of <b>unimproved</b> sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation {{do not have access to}} improved sanitation.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{this species}} also occurs on <b>unimproved</b> hay meadows and pastures.|$|E
25|$|With a gravelkit {{modification}} the 737-200 can use <b>unimproved</b> or unpaved landing strips, such as gravel runways, {{that other}} similarly-sized jet aircraft cannot. Gravel-kitted 737-200 Combis are currently used by Canadian North, First Air, Air Inuit, Nolinor and Air North in northern Canada. For many years, Alaska Airlines {{made use of}} gravel-kitted 737-200s to serve Alaska's many <b>unimproved</b> runways across the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{association}} of waxcaps with <b>unimproved</b> (nutrient-poor) grasslands was first noted in 1949 in the Netherlands, but current interest was stimulated {{by a series}} of papers published by Dutch mycologist Eef Arnolds in the 1980s. Arnolds not only confirmed the {{association of}} waxcaps with <b>unimproved</b> grasslands, but also noted the rapid decline in such habitats in the Netherlands. Similar studies were subsequently undertaken elsewhere in Europe, initially in Denmark and the United Kingdom.|$|E
