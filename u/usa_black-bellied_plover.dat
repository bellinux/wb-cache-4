30|$|Although {{individual}} species varied {{considerably from}} year to year, {{there were only a}} few differences from 2007 to 2010 in our broader categories of birds. Specifically, the year 2007 had a lower than average richness for other waterbirds (Table 9) and in 2009, there was a higher than average abundance and richness of landbirds (Table 13, Table 11). Our data for the six focal shorebird species monitored by McCrary and Pierson (2000) showed some decadal changes (1994 - 1997 vs. 2007 - 2011). Site by decade interactions were common, indicating that some sites saw increases in abundance across decades but others saw decreases. Of the individual species, willet (P = 0.0035) and <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover</b> (P = 0.0001) decreased in abundance, but godwit (P = 0.01), whimbrel (P = 0.0005), and snowy plover (0.0008) increased in abundance. Sanderling did not change significantly between decades. Overall, for the total abundance of the six focal species of shorebirds, there was no effect of decade on total abundance. However, there was a significant trend toward slightly lower shorebird richness in the latter decade (2.9 vs. 2.5 out of 6 species, on average, P = 0.0002). In contrast, the more regular surveys of the Christmas Bird Count data for Ventura County showed an increase in all six shorebird species between December 1997 and December 2009 (average slope of birds per unit effort vs. year = + 0.07, SD = 0.05 (National Audubon Society 2011). Our analysis of the longer term CBC counts from adjacent Santa Barbara County, California, showed slight long-term positive trends for all species but <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover</b> (for 1990 - 2009, average slope of birds per unit effort vs. year = 0.02, SD = 0.03). However, this time series showed a steep drop in the counts of all six species coincident with the 1997 - 1998 ENSO event (for 1997 - 1998, average slope of birds per unit effort vs. year = - 0.32, SD = 0.19. Since then, all species but <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plovers</b> have recovered to pre-ENSO levels (for 1998 - 2009, average slope of birds per unit effort vs. year = 0.04, SD = 0.06 (National Audubon Society 2011). In sum, these results suggest that there has not been a long-term decline in birds, except for a lingering effect of the 1997 - 1998 ENSO on <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plovers.</b>|$|R

30|$|Methylmercury is a toxic form {{of mercury}} which {{persists}} in food webs {{for long periods}} of time and biomagnifies up successive trophic levels. Shorebirds breeding in the Arctic are exposed to methylmercury, derived from both natural and anthropogenic sources, when they ingest their invertebrate prey. Populations of many shorebird species are believed to be declining and one hypothesis for these declines is that they are due to detrimental effects of contaminants, including methylmercury. To test this hypothesis, we assessed mercury contamination in eggs of four Canadian Arctic-breeding shorebird species: <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover</b> (Pluvialis squatarola), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) and white-rumped sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis). <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>plovers</b> and ruddy turnstones are declining in the western hemisphere, whereas white-rumped sandpipers and semipalmated plovers have stable or slightly increasing populations. We found no relationship between egg mercury concentration and population trend for these four shorebird species. Intraspecific variation in mercury concentration was high. Notably, the mercury concentrations were much higher than levels found in a previous study of eggs of the same shorebird species from this same site, suggesting that mercury contamination may be subject to substantial inter-annual variation in the Canadian Arctic food web.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Conservation {{of habitat}} for {{flagship}} species, such as birds, {{aids in the}} protection of biodiversity in critical ecosystems. Extensive mats of macroalgae stimulated by nu-trient input to estuaries threaten critical successes in conser-vation made by legislation that reduces habitat destruction. Macroalgae can cover intertidal mudflats that are key foraging grounds for obligate visual foragers such as <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plovers</b> (Pluvialis squatarola), as well as foragers that rou-tinely switch from visual to tactile foraging such as least sandpipers (Calidris minutilla), western sandpipers (Calidris mauri), and willets (Tringa semipalmata), and predominately tactile foragers such as marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa). We hypothesized that macroalgae would affect shorebirds directly by altering foraging behavior and indirectly by reducing prey availability. Mats reduced visual foraging (pecking) for sand-pipers and marbled godwits and caused them to probe more often. Willets spent overall less time foraging than sandpipers and marbled godwits and did not alter their foraging strategy due to macroalgae. While foraging, <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plovers,</b> marbled godwits, and willets avoided macroalgae while sand-pipers did not select between habitat types. This suggests macroalgae may have negative effects on plovers, marbled godwits, and willets by reducing foraging area but that sand-pipers may utilize both macroalgae and bare sediments. Macroalgal mats indirectly influenced shorebirds by enhanc-ing variability in prey availability across the mudflat land-scape. By quantifying avoidance of or preference for mats, foraging behavior, and variation in prey availability, we showed that macroalgae have differential effects across shore-bird foraging guilds...|$|R

50|$|Southern coastal Maine is a {{migration}} and staging area {{for much of}} the North American shorebird population. Thousands of shorebirds feed along coastal beaches and mudflats as they migrate through the state. Biddeford Pool serves {{as one of the top}} shorebird staging areas in southern Maine. The most common species observed in the autumn include semipalmated <b>plover</b> (Charadrius semipalmatus), <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover</b> (Pluvialis squatarola), least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), and semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla). These species and others typically feed in the mudflats at low tide. Most shorebirds feed in salt pannes and roost in pannes and adjacent upland areas during high tides.|$|R
30|$|Weather {{and ocean}} {{conditions}} vary {{from year to}} year and this could have explained why some of our results showed annual differences. Still, most patterns were consistent {{from year to year}}. Decadal differences between our data and the data of McCrary and Pierson (2002) were mixed for their six focal shorebird species. In contrast, Ventura Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs) show consistent increases in counts for the period after McCrary and Piersonâs (2002) study through the last year of our surveys, indicating that declines in willet and <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover</b> have not been gradual over this time. One possible explanation is the strong ENSO in the winter of 1997 - 1998 led to a decline and eventual recovery of shorebirds. This hypothesis cannot be evaluated in Ventura county because the Ventura CBC data started after the ENSO and the data of McCrary and Pierson (2002) predate the ENSO. However, in neighboring Santa Barbara County, the CBC extends farther back in time and indicates that the ENSO was associated with sharp drops in the six focal shorebird species. Trends in these shorebirds over time have been positive since the 1997 - 1998 El Nino in both the Santa Barbara and Ventura CBCs. So, although snowy plover, marbled godwit, and whimbrel eventually exceeded the immediate pre-El Nino period sampled by McCrary and Pierson (2002), willet and <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover</b> have been slower to recover. Although an ENSO effect seems plausible, we cannot, from the available data, determine if there have been any additional human-induced changes in shorebirds over the last decade in Ventura County.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{studies have}} {{surveyed}} bird populations at this site. The International Shorebird Survey in 1988 counted 155,000 shorebirds at Big Quill Lake. Surveys between 1989 and 1992 at Middle and Little Quill Lakes found one-day peaks of 101,900 birds. The most comprehensive study conducted, involving all three lakes, {{resulted in a}} count of 197,155 birds. The site is an important staging and breeding area for the endangered piping plover. Other species identified throughout the complex include [...] "85,000 geese, 100,000 ducks, and 12,000 cranes", as well as <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover,</b> sanderlings, Hudsonian godwits, red knots, stilt sandpipers, white-rumped sandpipers, semipalmated sandpipers, long-billed dowitchers, red-necked phalaropes, and lesser yellowlegs. Additionally, in the mid-1990s several whooping cranes were observed using the area for staging during fall migration.|$|R
30|$|As indicated, we did {{not find}} any {{significant}} differences among species in egg mercury concentration, and therefore no relationship between mercury concentration and population status for these four species of shorebirds. We predicted that mercury concentrations in the eggs of species with declining population trends (i.e., <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plovers</b> and ruddy turnstones) would be higher than those species with stable or increasing population trends (i.e., semipalmated plovers and white-rumped sandpipers). Interestingly, the white-rumped sandpiper (having a stable population trend) had the highest individual egg mercury concentrations of all samples (FigureÂ  2). These findings provide no evidence for mercury contamination of eggs as an obvious explanation for declining populations of shorebirds; however, our samples are small and drawn from a single site, and inter- and intra-specific differences need to be considered when conducting a study of contaminants.|$|R
30|$|Our study {{provides}} basic {{information on the}} community of birds that uses beach habitat in Ventura County California. The richness, density, and seasonality of the bird community found along Ventura County beaches was similar to a comparable year-round study in neighboring Santa Barbara County conducted in 1999 (Lafferty 2001). A key difference was that, in Santa Barbara, winter bird abundances were as high as fall bird abundances (whereas winter counts were half of fall abundances in Ventura). Not surprisingly, there were {{differences between the two}} studies in the relative abundance of some of the bird species. For instance, among the common birds, American crow, semipalmated <b>plover,</b> western sandpiper, <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover,</b> and western snowy plover were more abundant in Santa Barbara whereas brown pelican was more abundant in Ventura.|$|R
30|$|The four shorebird {{species in}} this study appear to have {{elevated}} egg mercury levels when compared to an earlier study (i.e., Hargreaves et al. 2010, 2011). The eggs used by Hargreaves et al. (2010, 2011) were collected in 2008 from the same four species at the same study site (East Bay). Mean total egg mercury concentrations for each species {{in this study}} were at least three times greater than the results from Hargreaves et al. (2011), and the ranges of egg mercury levels found in each study did not overlap. A similar pattern of contamination was observed in Hargreaves et al. (2011) where <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plovers</b> and ruddy turnstones had the lowest egg mercury concentrations. However, in contrast to our study, they observed the highest egg mercury concentrations among the semipalmated plovers, rather than the white-rumped sandpipers (Hargreaves et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|<b>Black-bellied</b> <b>plovers</b> (Pluvialis squatarola) have short {{bills and}} {{primarily}} peck while foraging whereas Willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus) have long bills and primarily probe with bills open in sediments. Intestinal digesta {{were collected from}} these species at sympatric overwintering sites in southern California near San Diego to relate sediment ingestion to bill length and feeding behavior. Plover digesta contained an estimated 29 % sediment, and Willet digesta an estimated 3 % sediment. Techniques based on acid insoluble ash and on the elemental markers of Al, Fe, and Ti in digesta provided similar results. High Ca concentrations in Willet digesta along with our observations suggested that the Willets in our sample fed primarily on molluscs and crustaceans. Sediment ingestion may be species-specific, not necessarily linked to bill length or probing behaviors, and may greatly affect a birdâs exposure to environmental contaminants in sediment...|$|R

50|$|Like most gulls, Bonaparte's gull has {{a varied}} diet, with prey items {{changing}} {{over the course}} of the year, and from year to year. During the breeding season, it is largely insectivorous. It is known to quickly congregate in large numbers to take advantage of termite dispersal flights, circling over the emerging swarm and hovering briefly to take the insects in flight. It also gathers in large numbers to feed on the eggs of spawning salmon, alighting on the water and, if necessary, diving to take drifting eggs. During migration and into the winter, insects are first supplemented, then replaced by other food items, including fish, small crustaceans, mollusks, euphausiids, marine worms, and other invertebrates. At least one immature bird has been recorded as having fed on walnut meat. Bonaparte's gulls are known to engage in kleptoparasitism, and have been observed stealing earthworms from foraging dunlins and <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plovers.</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{found no}} {{differences}} in egg mercury concentrations between the species with declining numbers (<b>black-bellied</b> <b>plovers,</b> ruddy turnstones) and the species with stable or increasing numbers (white-rumped sandpipers, semipalmated plovers). These results do not support mercury contamination as a primary contributor to shorebird declines in North America, but ours is not a definitive test. Our sample is small and drawn from a single site, and studies of contaminants in the wild are extremely complex undertakings, with many variables to consider. It is possible that detrimental population-level effects of mercury are not showing up in the shorebird embryonic stage; mercury contamination may be affecting shorebirds at some other stage in their life history, such as at overwintering sites or feeding during migration stopovers. In nature, organisms can be exposed to a toxic âcocktailâ consisting of multiple contaminants, possibly acting antagonistically or synergistically with one another depending on life history stage, as mercury and selenium sometimes do (as in mallard ducks; Heinz and Hoffman 1998).|$|R

Shorebirds and wading birds were observed November 1997 to April 1998 and September 1998 to April 1999 to compare functional values of natural and created marshes on the Texas coast. Study locations included Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Nueces Delta Mitigation Project, and Mustang Island, Texas. Analysis focused on <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover</b> (Pluvialis squatarola), long-billed curlew (Numenitus americanus, peeps (Calidris sandpipers), willet (Cataptrophorus semipalmatus), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), and great egret (Ardea alba). Invertebrate benthos were sampled to determine prey availability. Few significant differences existed in invertebrate density or biomass between sites. No significant differences existed for any variable at Aransas NWR (p> 0. 05). At Nueces Delta, total biomass (p= 0. 031) and polychaete biomass (p= 0. 029) were significantly lower in October 1998 than in February 1998 or 1999, or April 1998 or 1999. Total density (p= 0. 042) and crustacean density (p= 0. 049) were significantly higher at the Mustang Island natural site than at the created site. Insect density (p= 0. 002) and insect biomass (p= 0. 001) increased significantly from November 1998 to April 1999 on Mustang Island. Cluster analysis showed no overall pattern among avian species' activities by site, location, year, or type of site (natural or created). Mustang Island sites were most similar for <b>black-bellied</b> <b>plover,</b> long- billed curlew, peeps, and willet. Peeps fed in > 78 % of observations at all sites except Nueces Island 1997 - 98 (61. 3 %). Great blue heron and great egret were rarely recorded feeding (< 20 %) at any site. Patterns of utilization among sites appear species specific, related more to habitat than type of site. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling using the 11 most abundant species separated Mustang Island sites from Nueces Delta sites. Dunlin, peeps, sanderling, willet, snowy egret, and great egret were much more abundant on Mustang Island than Nueces Delta.
