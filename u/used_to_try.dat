5|$|Treatment of {{advanced}} forms of MS {{is more difficult}} than relapsing-remitting MS. A wide range of medications have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E

5|$|In the Diet, {{the group}} of middle-sized states, known as Mittelstaaten (Bavaria, Württemberg, the grand duchies of Baden and Hesse, and the duchies of Saxony–Weimar, Saxony–Meiningen, Saxony–Coburg, and Nassau), {{supported}} complete demobilization within the Confederation. These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises and subtle (or outright) threats Bismarck <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to gain their support against the Habsburgs. The Prussian war cabinet understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout: the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They also understood that Prussia's only ally abroad was Italy.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability {{to move a}} limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Research, in 2008, by {{scientists}} from Pennsylvania State University found {{high levels of}} the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has been {{thought to be a}} cause of CCD. Researchers from Washington State University, under entomology professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.|$|E

5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex {{to show how the}} molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E

25|$|The {{three types}} of venomous snakes that cause the {{majority}} of major clinical problems are vipers, kraits, and cobras.

25|$|This {{result is}} often {{encountered}} in social-science and medical-science statistics and is particularly problematic when frequency data is unduly given causal interpretations.

25|$|In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the US Supreme Court {{ruled that}} Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions {{applied to all}} detainees in the War on Terror.

25|$|In many {{countries}} around the world, waterways prone to floods are often carefully managed. Defenses such as detention basins, levees, bunds, reservoirs, and weirs are used to prevent waterways from overflowing their banks. When these defenses fail, emergency measures such as sandbags or portable inflatable tubes are often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to stem flooding. Coastal flooding has been addressed in portions of Europe and the Americas with coastal defenses, such as sea walls, beach nourishment, and barrier islands.|$|E
