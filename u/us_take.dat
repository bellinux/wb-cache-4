25|$|At {{the behest}} of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make {{preparations}} for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let <b>us</b> <b>take</b> this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E

25|$|There {{remained}} marked inequalities however. Most of Cuba's {{doctors were}} {{based in the}} relatively prosperous cities and regional towns, and conditions in rural areas, notably Oriente, were significantly worse. In 1992 the US embargo was made more stringent {{with the passage of}} the Cuban Democracy Act resulting in all U.S. subsidiary trade, including trade in food and medicines , being prohibited. The legislation did not state that Cuba cannot purchase medicines from U.S. companies or their foreign subsidiaries; however, such license requests have been routinely denied. In 1995 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States informed the U.S. Government that such activities violate international law and has requested that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>take</b> immediate steps to exempt medicine from the embargo. The Lancet and the British Medical Journal also condemned the embargo in the 90s.|$|E
25|$|Jackson's {{attempt to}} {{purchase}} Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed. The chargé d'affaires in Mexico, Colonel Anthony Butler, {{suggested that the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>take</b> Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was later replaced {{toward the end of}} Jackson's presidency. In 1835, the Texas Revolution began when pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government for Texan independence. By May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military, establishing an independent Republic of Texas. The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States. However, Jackson was hesitant recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election. The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, and Van Buren was elected President. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating a chargé d'affaires on the last full day of his Presidency, March 3, 1837.|$|E
25|$|It is true {{there are}} cases in which, if we confine {{ourselves}} {{to the effects of}} the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let <b>us</b> <b>take,</b> for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? … It is not on account of the evil of the first order {{that it is necessary to}} erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.|$|E

500|$|General William Westmoreland, {{who was the}} U.S. Army {{commander}} in South Vietnam, Taylor, and other senior U.S. officers in Saigon and Washington, D.C. urged President Lyndon B. Johnson to authorize reprisal bombings against North Vietnam. Taylor messaged Washington on Christmas Day, saying, [...] "Hanoi will get the word that, despite our present tribulations, there is still bite in the tiger they call paper, and the U.S. stock {{in this part of}} the world will take sharp rise. Some of our local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate."

[...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it let <b>us</b> <b>take</b> control of what we needed to do.

500|$|Broadcast {{rights to}} the 2012 Summer Paralympics were sold to local {{broadcasters}} by LOCOG, with production of the world feeds sub-contracted to Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS). The Games saw a significant growth in media coverage for the Paralympics; LOCOG reached deals with over 36 broadcasters to televise the Games in over 100 countries. LOCOG chief Sebastian Coe stated that [...] "beyond how the commercial value of this package has raised the bar financially for the Paralympic movement, the fantastic broadcast coverage we have agreed will help <b>us</b> <b>take</b> advantage of this opportunity to inspire disabled {{people of all ages}} to take up sport and be a catalyst for continued change in public attitudes towards disability." [...] LOCOG reached deals with broadcasters such as China Central Television, the Korean Broadcasting System, NHK, Rede Globo and SporTV in Brazil, the TV Pool (a consortium of free-to-air broadcasters in Thailand consisting of Channel 3, Channel 5, BBTV Channel 7, and Modernine TV), and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to air coverage. The games were to be broadcast on television in the United Kingdom by Channel 4, replacing long-time Paralympic broadcaster BBC in a £9 million deal; the BBC still held radio rights, with coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra. The IPC webcast approximately 780 hours of its coverage through its YouTube channel, with four streams of coverage in English and one in Spanish.|$|E
