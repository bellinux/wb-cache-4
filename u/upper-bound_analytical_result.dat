40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe current results from an on-going study of the mechanisms that led to the failure of the TIBB. Experimental and <b>analytical</b> <b>results</b> are presented. Experimental results include load, strain, and deflection data for the TIBB (Technology Integration Box Beam). An analytical investigation was conducted to compliment the experimental investigation and to gain additional insight into the TIBB structural response. <b>Analytical</b> <b>results</b> include strain and deflection results from a global analysis of the TIBB. A local analysis of the failure region is being completed. These <b>analytical</b> <b>results</b> are validated through comparisons with the experimental results from the TIBB tests. The experimental and <b>analytical</b> <b>results</b> from the TIBB tests are used to determine a sequence of events that may have resulted in failure of the TIBB. A potential cause of failure is high stresses in a stiffener runout region. Typical <b>analytical</b> <b>results</b> are presented for a stiffener runout specimen that is being defined to simulate the TIBB failure mechanisms. The results of this study are anticipated to provide better understanding of potential failure mechanisms in composite aircraft structures, to lead to future design improvements, and to identify needed analytical tools for design and analysis...|$|R
