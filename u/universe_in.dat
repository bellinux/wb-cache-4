5|$|Bhikshatana is {{considered}} a gentler form of Shiva's fierce aspect Bhairava and a gentle phase between Bhairava's two gruesome forms, one of which decapitates the god Brahma and the other of which murders the god Vishnu's gatekeeper. Bhikshatana is the form of Bhairava that Shiva assumes to atone for his sin of severing Brahma's fifth head. He wanders the <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of a}} naked Kapali mendicant, begging for alms with Brahma's kapala (skullcap) as his begging bowl, until his sin is expiated upon reaching the holy city of Varanasi.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was set in}} a {{contemporary}} world, albeit a world of magic and supernatural conflict behind the scenes. The series is largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the DC <b>Universe,</b> <b>in</b> which the supernatural or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most ordinary people, and in Earth-threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at, suggesting that superheroes no longer existed there. However, some DC Comics characters—most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, The Phantom Stranger, Shade, The Changing Man, Dream of the Endless, and Swamp Thing made appearances.|$|E

Though mostly set in the mainstream Marvel universe, or Earth-616 {{as it is known}} in dialogue, the story depicts major changes to the space-time continuum {{as a result of the}} time travel on the part of characters, resulting in Miles witnessing the coming of the mainstream Marvel Galactus, an entity that consumes planets, to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Large {{particle}} accelerators can replicate {{the conditions that}} prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement {{of the details of}} the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into high energy regimes. Consequently, the state of the <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.|$|E
5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding <b>universe.</b> <b>In</b> 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnetic}} monopole objection {{was raised in}} the late 1970s. Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as {{magnetic monopole}}s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable <b>universe,</b> <b>in</b> the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.|$|E

5|$|With {{advent of}} {{automated}} telescopes {{and improvements in}} spectroscopes, a number of collaborations {{have been made to}} map the <b>Universe</b> <b>in</b> redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the Universe. The Great Wall, a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.|$|E
5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as {{the cracks in the}} universe close. The Doctor has to stay outside this new <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> order for that to happen. After a final goodbye to Amelia on the night they met, he enters the cracks and disappears.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon.

Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
