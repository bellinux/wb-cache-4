50|$|Electrostatic {{deflection}} is {{very useful}} for small deflection angles but {{is well known}} to be inferior to magnetic deflection for deflecting a charged particle beam into large angles - say over 10 degrees. The reason is that deflection aberrations become large as the deflection angle increases. This reduces the ability to finely focus the beam. Also in electrostatic deflection {{it has long been}} the practice to inject the beam midway between the charged deflection plates so as to avoid the fringe fields as much as possible. However it was found by computation methods that deflection aberrations would be significantly reduced if the beam were injected offset toward the attracting plate. That way the beam tends to follow equipotentials and the deflection force is normal to the beam direction. Thus offset, all the electrons in the beam are deflected into the same angle. There is an induced astigmatism that is correctable. This deflection idea has been tested and verified. Deflection angles of 50 degrees are reportedly possible without measurable deflection aberration. Optimal injection offset is approximately 1/3 of the plate gap toward the deflecting plate. The <b>useful</b> <b>beam</b> diameter is also approximately 1/3 of the gap. See M. Retsky and R. Stein. Testing an electron beam deflection innovation: Initial results. Jour.

The performance of thin-walled beams can also be greatly modified by relatively minor variations in geometry such as flanges and stiffeners.|$|R

40|$|The beam {{deflection}} magnet and energy control {{system of the}} Utrecht cascade generator are described. The uniform-field magnet has entrance and exit slits located outside the magnetic held. Since the cascade generator produces a vertical beam, the most convenient choice for the angle of deflection was 90 degrees. The radius of curvature of the beam {{in the region of}} the uniform-field is 20 cm, which makes it possible to deflect a one MeV beam of He+ or DeT ions with a field of 14. 5 kilograms. The value assembly of the magnet and slits can be repeated about the incoming beam in order to direct the beam to different experimental arrangements. Energy control is achieved in two steps: first the exciting current of the magnet is stabilized, the magnetic field being measured with a proton magnetic resonance fluxmeter, and second the high tension is controlled so as to maintain the deflected beam centered on the exit slit of the magnet.

From the static analysis, an hyperstatic supporting system is proposed in order to minimise the systematic deflections and the effects due to changing temperature conditions in the tunnel.

40|$|Millimeter-wave MIMO {{systems have}} gained {{increasing}} traction towards {{the goal of}} meeting the high data-rate requirements in next-generation wireless systems. The focus of this work is on low-complexity beamforming approaches for initial UE discovery in such systems. Towards this goal, we first note {{the structure of the}} optimal beamformer with per-antenna gain and phase control and the structure of good beamformers with per-antenna phase-only control. Learning these beamforming structures in mmW systems is fraught with considerable complexities such as the need for a non-broadcast system design, the sensitivity of the beamformer approximants to small path length changes, etc. To overcome these issues, we establish a physical interpretation between these beamformer structures and the angles of departure/arrival of the dominant path(s). This physical interpretation provides a theoretical underpinning to the emerging interest on directional beamforming approaches that are less sensitive to small path length changes. While classical approaches for direction learning such as MUSIC have been well-understood, they suffer from many practical difficulties in a mmW context such as a non-broadcast system design and high computational complexity. A simpler broadcast solution for mmW systems is the adaptation of directional codebooks for beamforming at the two ends. We establish fundamental limits for the best beam broadening codebooks and propose a construction motivated by a virtual subarray architecture that is within a couple of dB of the best tradeoff curve at all <b>useful</b> <b>beam</b> broadening factors.

In clinical practice, {{in order to avoid}} errors that may affect the treatment outcome, there are two issues that need to be carefully addressed.

In this work, we describe the development and use of a new acrylic templates named Template La Fe-ITIC. They have been designed specifically to help the clinical user in the selection of the correct applicator, and to assist the medical staff in reproducing the positioning of the applicator. These templates are freely available upon request. Material and methods: Templates that were developed by University and Polytechnic Hospital La Fe (La Fe) and Hospital Clínica Benidorm (ITIC) in cooperation with Elekta, consist of a thin sheet made of transparent acrylic. For each applicator, a crosshair and two different circles are drawn on these templates: the inner one corresponds to the <b>useful</b> <b>beam,</b> while the outer one represents the external perimeter of the applicator.

40|$|The use of Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs) as {{sensitive}} {{tools for}} various beam diagnostic applications {{will be discussed}} {{as well as their}} tasks in machine protection and loss location detection. Examples will illustrate that an appropriate design of a BLM-system and a proper understanding of loss events can improve machine performance. 1 INTROCUCTION You do not need a BLM-System {{as long as you have}} a perfect machine without any problems. However, you probably do not have such a nice machine, therefore you better install one. Beam loss monitor systems are designed for measuring beam losses around an accelerator or storage ring. A detailed understanding of the loss mechanism, together with an appropriate design of the BLM-System and an appropriate location of the monitors enable a wide field of very <b>useful</b> <b>beam</b> diagnostics and machine protection possibilities. Beam losses can be divided into two different classes: 1) Irregular losses, sometimes called fast or uncontrolled losses: These losses may be distributed around the accelerator and not obviously on a collimation system. They are very often a result of a misaligned beam or a fault condition, e. g. operation failure, trip of the HF-system or of a magnet power supply. Losses should be avoided and should be kept to low levels • to keep activation low enough for hands-on maintenance, personal safety and environmental protection, • to protect machine parts from beam related (radiation) damage. This includes quench protection of superconducting magnets and acceleration structures and protection of detector components, • to achieve long beam lifetimes or an efficient beam transport to get high integrated luminosity for the related experiments. Sometimes such losses have to be tolerated even at a high level at low repetition rates during machine studies. However, a beam loss monitor system should define the allowed level of those losses. The better protection there is against these losses, the less likely is down time due to damage of components. A post mortem event analysis is most helpful to understand and analyse the faulty condition. Some examples of such a functionality of beam loss monitor systems will be given in this paper. 2) Regular losses, sometimes called slow o...|$|E

The calorimetry was compared to measurements using a free-air chamber (FAC), a PTW 31014 Pinpoint ionization chamber, and a PTW 34001 Roos ionization chamber. The IMBL beam height is limited to approximately 2 mm. To produce clinically <b>useful</b> <b>beams</b> of a few centimetres the beam must be scanned in the vertical direction. In practice it is the patient/detector that is scanned and the scanning velocity defines the dose that is delivered. The calorimeter, FAC, and Roos chamber measure the dose area product which is then converted to central axis dose with the scanned beam area derived from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and film measurements. The Pinpoint chamber measures the central axis dose directly and does not require beam area measurements. The calorimeter and FAC measure dose from first principles. The calorimetry requires conversion of the measured absorbed dose to graphite to absorbed dose to water using MC calculations with the EGSnrc code. Air kerma measurements from the free air chamber were converted to absorbed dose to water using the AAPM TG- 61 protocol. The two ionization chambers are secondary standards requiring calibration with kilovoltage x-ray tubes. The Roos and Pinpoint chambers were calibrated against the Australian primary standard for air kerma at the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA).
