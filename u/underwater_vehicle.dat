40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been {{intensive}} efforts toward the development of <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The model of <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicles</b> strongly affects the dynamic performance as well as accurate control, navigation and guidance of <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The coefficients of <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicles</b> model are generally obtained experimentally such as through the planar-motion-mechanism (PMM) tests; however, the tests are generally lengthy, complex and expensive.

5|$|The search {{team and}} {{equipment}} {{had to be}} organised within four months, {{to take advantage of}} a narrow window of calm conditions in the North Atlantic.

5|$|The Michigan Sea Grant Program {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming remotely operated <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle</b> (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E

25|$|The MVFugroSupporter and MVHavila Harmony were {{equipped}} with a Kongsberg HUGIN4500 autonomous <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle</b> (AUV), which carried the same instruments as the towfish deployed by the other vessels. Unlike the towfish, the AUVs were self-propelled and could manoeuvre themselves to maintain a constant altitude above the seafloor. When launched, the torpedo-shaped AUV dived to the proper altitude, then followed a pre-programmed search pattern for up to 24 hours, collecting sonar data for up to 24hours; when the mission was complete, the AUV surfaced and was recovered by the vessel, where the data was downloaded and the batteries were swapped for the next mission. The AUVs were used to scan areas {{which could not be}} effectively searched by the towfish on the other three vessels. Because of the difficultly in operating the AUV during the austral winter months due to sea conditions, the AUV operations were suspended during the austral winter months.|$|E

25|$|An {{underwater}} glider—an autonomous <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle</b> (AUV), {{designed by}} the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, was named after Slocum's ship Spray. It became the first AUV to cross the Gulf Stream, while operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Another AUV has been named after Slocum himself: the Slocum Electric Glider, designed by Douglas Webb of Webb Research (since 2008, Teledyne Webb Research). In 2009, a Slocum glider, modified by Rutgers University, crossed the Atlantic in 221 days. The RU27 traveled from Tuckerton, New Jersey, to Baiona, Spain — the port where Christopher Columbus landed on his return from his first voyage to the New World. Like Slocum himself, the Slocum glider is capable of traveling over thousands of kilometers. These gliders continue {{to be used by}} various research institutions, including Texas A University's Department of Oceanography and Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG), to explore the Gulf of Mexico and other bodies of water.|$|E
