25|$|Although {{the birth}} {{and growth of}} the {{cassette}} began in the 1960s, its cultural moment {{took place during the}} 1970s and 1980s. The cassette's popularity grew during these years as a result of being a more effective, convenient and portable way of listening to music. Stereo tape decks and boom boxes became some of the most highly sought-after consumer products of both decades. Portable pocket recorders and high-fidelity ("hi-fi") players, such as Sony's Walkman (1979), also enabled users to take their music with them anywhere with ease. The increasing <b>user-friendliness</b> of the cassette led to its popularity around the globe. The body of the Walkman was not much larger than the cassette tape itself, with mechanical keys on one side, or electronic buttons or a display on the face. Sony's WM-10 was even smaller than the cassette itself, and expanded to hold and play a cassette.|$|E

He called the character designs [...] "excellent" [...] and distinct from those in previous games in the series; he found it interesting that the character designs in previous games, which took place in [...] "watery" [...] settings, had brighter and less earthy colors, while Remember 11, which takes place in the mountains, makes more use of earthy colors.|$|E

[...] The One praised the game's controls, saying that [...] "the game's impressive <b>user-friendliness</b> is undoubtably one of its strong points," [...] adding that [...] "Lure of the Temptress is every bit as professional and polished as anything the Americans and French have been able to offer us recently" [...] but [...] "Lure is, if anything, a little too serious and sombre" [...] and that [...] "LucasFilm's games boast the more interesting characters and interaction sequences." [...] Amiga Power praised its graphics, saying they are [...] "very pretty drawn, with the dark, moody look you'd expect from a town being oppressed by an evil Temptress," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best graphic adventures ever" [...] that's [...] "up there with Monkey Island 1 and Beneath a Steel Sky," [...] and adding that the [...] "only drawback is that it's shorter than your average adventure." [...] Mega Zone praised the game, stating that it is a [...] "Sierra/Lucasfilmish with really, really good playability. We're talking 32 colours graphics which look really nice, with playability which is really smooth, and simply pure gaming enjoyment here," [...] adding that [...] "the manual is very well written, the sound the graphics are all there, disc access is very good, and looking at the way the whole game is put together right down to the intro it's one of the most amazing Amiga Adventures every written! An Adventure Zone classic!" [...] Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power opined that Core Design's rival 1992 fantasy adeventure game Curse of Enchantia (also published by Virgin) was [...] "a funny version of Lure of the Temptress with a different plot." ...|$|E

[...] To address these, researchers from Utrecht University developed an advanced interpreter called Helium, which improved the <b>user-friendliness</b> of error messages by limiting the generality of some Haskell features, and in particular removing support for type classes.|$|E

2500|$|Sandra Vogel of The Scotsman {{noted that}} while {{part of the}} game's success was due to its {{association}} with George Lucas, it had a [...] "pedigree all its own", involving a series of gaming awards. Multimedia Schools praised its <b>user-friendliness,</b> tutorials, replayability, and ease of installation, offering a rating of 5 stars. Computer Shopper noted that while the game was an exploitation of the Star Wars brand, it used the association to ensure the [...] "productive" [...] game received an audience. Similarly, Daily Record wrote that the title was [...] "yet another spin off from the incredible marketing hype" [...] of , but praised the game for its imagination, magic, and 3D environments. The Washington Times thought the game would appeal to all fans of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Daily Herald said the game had a broader appeal than computer programming video game The Robot Club. Knight Ridder said the game offered an opportunity for parents and children {{to work together to}} build robots and solve missions in a similar way to the tradition of building Soap Box Derby racers, and praised its slick graphics. The Washington Post thought the game was a worthy piece of kidware. Birmingham Evening Mail praised the game's blend of fun and education. The Boston Globe thought it was a standout educational title. Rocky [...] Mountain complimented the game's ease of use, sense of humour, and surreptitious educational content.|$|E
2500|$|Shigenori Soejima, who {{had worked}} on the last two main-series Persona titles, {{returned}} as character designer. The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier titles included the user interface (UI) displays. The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for {{by the rest of}} the team. According to Soejima, he was working on designs for the then-prospective Persona 5 while the previous game was still in development: his designs evolved as the story for Persona 5 came together. Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where Persona 4 left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development. The thematic color of the game is red, as that of Persona 3 and 4 was blue and yellow respectively. The red color was meant to convey a harsh feeling. Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against the color. There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world. Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as the protagonist's Persona Arsène were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style. The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism with NPC movements, elements within Tokyo's districts such as street trash and graffiti. When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so [...] "aggressively animated" [...] that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between <b>user-friendliness</b> and style.|$|E
