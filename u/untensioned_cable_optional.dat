5000|$|Transmission: S1/J1/YS1 (4.4 final drive, <b>cable</b> clutch, <b>optional</b> LSD for YS1), Y1 (4.266 final drive, <b>cable</b> clutch, <b>optional</b> LSD) ...|$|R
5000|$|Clutch: {{conventional}} friction clutch, <b>cable</b> operated. <b>Optional</b> in some markets: {{magnetic clutch}} filled with iron [...] "filings".|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{behavior}} of fully grouted, <b>untensioned</b> <b>cable</b> bolts and their application to the stabilization of underground openings are investigated. The study program undertaken involves field, laboratory and numerical studies which aim to improve {{understanding of the role}} of passive cable bolting in rock mass support. The higher residual load carrying capacity of the cable and the grout-aggregate mix is compared with that of the conventional grout (cement + water). Based on the variational approach, an analytical model has been developed to calculate the distribution of shear bond stress along the embedded length of a cable bolt. A parametric study is then undertaken to illustrate the support behavior of cable bolts with different grout compositions. A special finite element for the cable bolt was formulated and integrated into existing finite element code called MSAP 2 D, in order to allow the simulation of cable bolts in underground excavations. A practical example is presented to demonstrate the effect of cable bolts on the stability of the opening. The simulation is carried out using the newly developed numerical model with cable bolt simulation capability...|$|R
50|$|The FT-1000MP series radios can be {{controlled}} by Yaesu's Computer Aided Transceiver system, through an <b>optional</b> <b>cable,</b> connected between the radio and a computer.|$|R
50|$|The {{shutter release}} {{is in the}} center of the shutter-speed dial and is {{threaded}} for a <b>cable</b> release. The <b>optional</b> Motor-Drive gives additional front and vertical-grip releases.|$|R
50|$|When {{using the}} multilane DIN 1.0/2.3 <b>cabling</b> {{solution}} an <b>optional</b> high speed uplink {{can also be}} used, allowing 6.25 Gbit/s uplink communication to the camera. This {{can be used for}} very accurate triggering.|$|R
50|$|RDI, the French {{equivalent}} of CBC Newsworld, also has cross-Canada cable carriage rights, as does TV5 Qu√©bec Canada. Most other French-language networks are {{available only in}} Quebec, although some have <b>optional</b> <b>cable</b> carriage status {{in the rest of}} Canada. V, for instance, is carried on cable in New Brunswick and parts of Ontario and is available nationally by satellite.|$|R
50|$|The {{scope of}} this project is to specify {{additions}} to and appropriate modifications of IEEE Std 802.3 to add 100 Gb/s 4-lane Physical Layer (PHY) specifications and management parameters for operation on backplanes and twinaxial copper <b>cables,</b> and specify <b>optional</b> Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) for 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s operation over backplanes and copper cables.|$|R
50|$|The O-lock also {{conveniently}} secures {{the rear}} wheel: only locking {{the frame is}} needed, to secure both the frame and the rear wheel. Used {{in addition to a}} U-lock it can be a convenient second lock. Some models have an <b>optional</b> <b>cable</b> or chain that plugs into the body of the lock to enable the bicycle to be secured as well.|$|R
50|$|The missile {{system could}} be {{deployed}} {{in a number of}} configurations. The man-portable configuration consists of a launcher which doubles up as a transport container, a combined sight and controller, a battery and a 63 meter long <b>cable.</b> An <b>optional</b> Missile Selector Box allowed up to 6 missiles to be controlled by, and widely separated from, a single sight controller. The launcher box is placed on the ground facing the direction of expected targets, and then connected by the cable to the sight controller, which can be deployed some distance away. The sight controller is a pistol grip design, with two grips. The front grip has the launch trigger, and the rear grip has a thumb joystick for steering the missile. A low-magnification (3.2x) monocular forms the sight itself. Engraved stadia lines allow simple ranging, based on a typical tank target bridging the lines once in range.|$|R
5000|$|The {{light grey}} program-by-program {{summaries}} for individual channels, red and light blue channel highlighting, and graphical [...] "Prevue Weather" [...] forecasts {{that were previously}} available to <b>cable</b> systems as <b>optional</b> grid features and inserts remained available in the same manners as before. Closed captioning, MPAA movie rating and VCR Plus+ logos were additionally introduced by {{this version of the}} software, and unlike in prior versions, large graphical Prevue Guide logos appeared within its grid, between listings cycles. The old, synthesized interstitial music that had been used since 1988 was also replaced with a more modern piece called [...] "Opening Act," [...] from the defunct James & Aster music library.|$|R
5000|$|The OnLive Game System {{consisted}} of an OnLive Wireless Controller and a console, called the [...] "MicroConsole TV Adapter", {{that could be}} connected to a television and directly to the OnLive service, so {{it was possible to}} use the service without a computer. It came with the accessories needed to connect the equipment, and composite video users could purchase an additional <b>optional</b> <b>cable.</b> [...] The MicroConsole supported up to four wireless controllers and multiple Bluetooth headsets. It also had two USB ports for game controllers, keyboards, mice, and USB hubs. For video and audio output it provided component, HDMI, TOSLINK ports, and an analog stereo minijack. An ethernet port was used for network access, which was required to access the OnLive service. Pre-orders for the OnLive Game System began to be taken on November 17, 2010.|$|R
25|$|Al Jazeera: Was {{approved}} by the CRTC in 2004 as an <b>optional</b> <b>cable</b> and satellite offering, but {{on the condition that}} any carrier distributing it must edit out any instances of illegal hate speech. Cable companies declared that these restrictions would make it too expensive to carry Al Jazeera. Although no cable company released data as to what such a monitoring service would cost, the end-result was that no cable company elected to carry the station, either, leaving many Arabic-speaking Canadians using free-to-air satellite dishes to watch the station. The Canadian Jewish Congress has expressed its opinion over possible anti-Semitic incitement on this station and that the restrictions on Al Jazeera are appropriate, while the Canadian B'nai Brith is opposed to any approval of Al Jazeera in Canada. The CRTC ruling applied to Al Jazeera and not to its English-speaking sister network Al Jazeera English, which was launched two years after the ruling.|$|R
