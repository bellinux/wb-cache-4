40|$|Part 6 : Models and MethodsInternational audienceThe {{field of}} Software Engineering {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of developing sophisticated process models and methods and tools for its support. At the same time in the field of Human-Computer Interaction process models, methods, and tools have been developed and standardised internationally. Approaches from both fields have a lot to offer. However, despite great approaches for joining strengths and advantages of both fields, synergies are not yet fully used. In this paper I present the UCProMo User-Centred Process Model that provides an integrated approach by leveraging on existing process models, methods, and tools from both fields. UCProMo capitalises on clear phases, iteration, and strong involvement and participation of users throughout the whole process, which leads to integrated results and models of technology (esp. software) and ultimately to smooth <b>user</b> <b>journeys</b> through the whole system...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of complex {{problems in a}} world of increasing indeterminacy, not least within developing contexts, places new demands on stakeholders, educators, students, practitioners and theorists. A user, or customer, journey is a schematic representation of the path a user will take through lifecycle stages, touchpoints, channels, interaction modes, emotional states, content and functionality. User journeys have become a frequently applied tool for research and design in the practical fields of Design Thinking, Service Design, User Experience Design and Information Architecture Design. In our paper we position <b>User</b> <b>Journey</b> Design as both a tool and a rigorous selfreflective, data-driven process through information gathering, synthesis and into design, which assists the student designer in navigating the complexities of indeterminate problems. Initially the paper present a history and review of the literature, application and limitations of <b>User</b> <b>Journey</b> Design in practice today which explores related literature from Design Thinking and the nature of indeterminacy in design (Buchanan, 1992, Brown 2008, Cross 2006,) to set the context for an approach that broadens the relevance and application of <b>User</b> <b>Journey</b> Design. This paper then present two examples of student design work that demonstrate the application of <b>user</b> <b>journey</b> design in the resolution of complex problems. User Journeys provide a structured approach to synthesizing large amounts of data in self-reflective, humanistic ways, where the path through complexity can be traced back from artifact to the original problem-formation. It is in this respect that <b>User</b> <b>Journey</b> Design not only provides an approach to solving problems that emerge through complexity, but also narrows the gap between practice, research and teaching...|$|E

This article describes an alternative, potentially more general and expressive approach to interactive narrative {{that focuses on the}} procedural representation of story construction between an AI agent and a human interactor. This notion of procedural interaction relies on shared background knowledge between all actors involved; therefore, we have developed a body of background knowledge for improvising Western-style stories that includes the authoring of scripts (i. e. prototypical joint activities in Westerns). This article describes our methodology for the design and development of these scripts, the formal representation used for encoding them in our interactive narrative technology, and the lessons learned from this experience in regards to building a story corpus for interactive narrative research...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design of a fare engine which {{operates}} within the constraints of using contactless bankcards as a fare instrument, while satisfying the complex current and future fare requirements of Transport for London (TfL). A fare engine is a system which transforms user transactions at fare gates and validators into chargeable fares. Contactless bankcard fare payment differs from current fare smartcard systems by requiring a centralized fare engine. The proposed fare engine utilizes a data structure which maintains each <b>user's</b> <b>journey</b> history in three successive tiers of linked objects. This structure enables transactions to be correctly sequenced without a guarantee of in-order arrival of gate and validator transactions. A cleanup routine prevents the data structure from growing without bound as journey history accumulates. A dynamic journey linking mechanism allows the effect of inserted transactions to be propagated throughout the data structure and reflected in the affected journeys with near-constant time complexity. This ensures scalability while providing real-time feedback for customer service and payment authorization needs...|$|R

By combining these attributes we are able to represent a social <b>user</b> <b>journey</b> for each user of the system which we seek to exploit for identifying potential trigger conditions.

40|$|Often, when {{designing}} new and novel technologies with users, {{the initial}} envisioning and concept generation stage {{is carried out}} exclusively by the research team. Within this paper three barriers are identified which make it challenging to include users within this early design activity: knowledge gap, <b>user</b> <b>journey,</b> and complex requirements. These three barriers are often exacerbated when working with young people (children and teenagers). This paper explores a design technique (Primed Design Activities) which is intended to help lower these barriers and enable young people to be more effectively involved in early envisioning and concept generation stages. The technique bases the designs around a scenario of use and collects context appropriate screen designs.

40|$|The Journey Map tool {{provides}} a graphic and structured visualization {{about all the}} factors that can influence the User Experience, directly constructed from the user's perspective. Basically it is a schematization of the user path, crossing different service touchpoints 1, as the user starts to use a service until some goals are achieved. Into the <b>user</b> <b>journey</b> also the emotional aspects that {{affect the quality of}} the user experience and its level of satisfaction are considered. Graphically the Journey Map is a matrix composed by columns and rows. The columns, from left to right, show all the steps that form the <b>user</b> <b>journey,</b> a timeline that {{provides a}} sequential and chronological disposition of each stage for further details. In horizontal are displayed several rows, representing the research areas of interests (eg. Where the action takes place, the touchpoints involved in the context considered, the unexpressed needs of the user, his/her level of confidence to technology, etc…). All these elements together usually have different impacts along the journey steps; in this way the Journey Map can better track them and represent and identify these changes that interact with the user experience. In this specific occasion, the Journey Map will be used with the purpose to extrapolate qualitative and quantitative data about the User Experience of children with T 1 DM aged 8 - 10 in using the first prototype of the MyPAL app, as a graphical facilitator for an interactive discussion. In order to obtain reliable proofs of children’s experience, the Journey Map activity will be exploited with a co-creation methodological approach, where interactivity is essential and represents a great tool to collect insights in a playful and stimulating environment. In fact, this activity will involve directly our users (children) by mapping his/her experience and telling indirectly to us his/her feedbacks and expectations. This tool allows both individual and choral sessions and participatory techniques between deductive and analytical thinking. In this context, the Journey Map will be used as an individual explorative tool of investigation (one child per time) ...|$|E

40|$|There {{is general}} {{acceptance}} by Facilities Management practitioners that failure to obtain feed {{back on the}} building performance can expose the facilities to serious consequences. Evaluating building performance is becoming a necessity in effectively observing the overall perspectives of facilities. However, not every FM organisation performs this exercise on a regular basis. There are many obstacles that prevent the evaluation being conducted effectively such as lack of funds, lack of expertise and awareness {{of the importance of}} building maintenance. The implementation of various performance levels in planned maintenance requires not only the standardisation of the condition assessment method, but also the related planning methodology. There are different facilities performance evaluation approaches in practice such as post-occupancy evaluation, usability, <b>users</b> <b>journey,</b> post-occupancy review of building engineering (PROBE) and building performance evaluation to mention but a few. These have their strengths and weaknesses. Through a critical review of extant literature, the paper examines these, and how they all contribute towards keeping the performance of facilities to an acceptable standard.

40|$|Today’s {{societal}} {{development is}} not sustainable. The transportation sector {{has the potential}} role to be a tremendous lever for sustainability due to its central position in the societal structure {{as well as for}} the current unsustainable trends that occur in this system. Recommendations to public transportation providers were made by highlighting the main existing gaps between the current transportation system and an envisioned future transportation system that could exist in a sustainable society. To highlight these gaps, multiple perspectives were considered. These perspectives were enabled by e. g. <b>User</b> <b>Journey</b> Maps at the individual level and a holistic perspective over the broader urban transport system. The premise is that in order to increase use rates of public transportation, there is a need to better assess and address urban travellers' needs when commuting. For providers to have a strategic, stepwise approach and to be able to bring the public transportation system towards sustainability, the authors recommended that public transportation providers prioritize and implement future actions aligned with the three prioritization questions presented at the strategic level of the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development and by defining a criterion that would emphasize that the users’ needs of importance highlighted in the study are fulfilled...|$|E

Mode choice studies often lack proper consideration of travel time variability and uncertainty in such situations, neither do they fully account for some options considered by users, such as waiting, taking a shuttle bus, or cancelling the trip. This study aims to investigate transit user mode choice in response to peak hour rapid transit service disruption in the City of Toronto, incorporating such factors as the type of disruption, stage of the passenger’s trip (pre-trip or en-route), weather conditions, and uncertainty of delay duration. A joint Revealed Preference (RP) and Stated Preference (SP) survey is designed where the RP part gathers information on the respondent’s actual response {{to the most recent}} service disruption while the SP part solicits the respondent’s responses under a set of hypothetical service disruption scenarios. A transit trip planner tool is developed to generate alternative transit mode and path options to avoid the disrupted segment. The survey methodology is discussed including the scope, experimental design, survey sample design, survey instrument design, and survey implementation. The data collected would be used to develop econometric models to understand the potential effects of different factors on the choice making behaviour of transit users under conditions of service interruption...|$|R
