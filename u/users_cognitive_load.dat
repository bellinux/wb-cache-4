In assistive {{technology}} design, it is indispensible {{to consider the}} sensory, physical and cognitive level of target <b>users.</b> <b>Cognitive</b> <b>load</b> is an important indicator of cognitive feedback during interaction and became the critical research issue in designing assistive user interfaces, incorporated with smartphone based {{assistive technology}} like in the android platform. In this paper, we proposed a cognitive load based user interface integrated with reconfigured mobile android phone (R-MAP) based on user‟s cognitive load level. We performed some cognitive tasks within {{a small group of}} sighted but blindfolded people and blind people or visually impaired using R-MAP. Based on task performance and cognitive load levels we manually annotated some data of 24 participants and finally applied some machine learning algorithms to automate the mobile interface. Based on our novel design and experimental finding, we recommended that “cognitive load enabled feedbacks based assistive user interface ” would be a useful assistive tool for the people who use mobile phone for their daily operations...|$|E
40|$|While {{the number}} of {{traditional}} laptops and computers sold has dipped slightly year over year, manufacturers have developed new hybrid laptops with touch screens {{to build on the}} tactile trend. This market is moving quickly to make touch the rule rather than the exception and the sales of these devices have tripled since the launch of Windows 8 in 2012, to reach more than sixty million units sold in 2015. Unlike tablets, that benefit from easy-to-use applications specially designed for tactile interactions, hybrid laptops are intended to be used with regular user-interfaces. Hence, one could ask whether tactile interactions are suited for every task and activity performed with such interfaces. Since hybrid laptops are increasingly used in educational situations, this study focuses on information search tasks which are commonly performed for learning purposes. It is hypothesized that tasks that require complex and/or less common gestures will increase user's cognitive load and impair task performance in terms of efficacy and efficiency. A study was carried out in a usability laboratory with 30 participants for whom prior experience with tactile devices has been controlled. They were asked to perform information search tasks on an online encyclopaedia by using only the touch screen of and hybrid laptop. Tasks were selected with respect to their level of cognitive demand (amount of information that had to be maintained in working memory) and the complexity of gestures needed (left and/or right clicks, zoom, text selection and/or input.), and grouped into 4 sets accordingly. Task performance was measured by {{the number of}} tasks succeeded (efficacy) and time spent on each task (efficiency). Perceived cognitive load was assessed thanks to a questionnaire given after each set of tasks. An eye tracking device was used to monitor users' attention allocation and to provide objective cognitive load measures based on pupil dilation and the Index of Cognitive Activity. Each experimental run took approximately one hour. The results of this within-subjects design indicate that tasks involving complex gestures led to a lower efficacy, especially when the tasks were cognitively demanding. Regarding efficacy, there is no significant differences between sets of tasks excepted for tasks with low cognitive demand and complex gestures that required more time to be achieved. Surprisingly, users that declared the biggest experience with tactile devices spent more time than less frequent <b>users.</b> <b>Cognitive</b> <b>load</b> measures indicate that participants reported having devoted more mental effort in the interaction when they had to use complex gestures. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{complex and}} time-critical situations, users of an {{interactive}} system can experience {{high levels of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>load,</b> which can interfere with their optimum task performance. An intelligent adaptable system that is aware of a <b>user's</b> experienced <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> may help effectively improve their performance by deploying more appropriate output and support strategies dynamically. However, measuring a <b>user's</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> robustly and in real-time is not a trivial task. Many research studies have attempted to assess users' <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> using physiological, behavioural, performance, and subjective measures. Most of these measures can be intrusive and can disrupt the normal flow of the interaction. Though they may be useful approaches in research situations, they are often unsuitable for deployment in real-life applications due to their high intrusiveness. In this thesis, several novel speech and linguistic features are proposed as potential indices of <b>user's</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> that may be collected implicitly and non-intrusively allowing real-time and automatic assessment of <b>cognitive</b> <b>load.</b> Thirty different speech and linguistic features are proposed in four categories of speech pauses, linguistic categories, grammatical features, and language complexity measures. These were extracted from users' natural speech and analysed for significant changes in their behaviour under various tasks of different <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> levels. Results showed users' different speech and linguistic patterns under various task complexities and <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> levels. Specifically, under high load people used more and longer pauses, and longer response latencies. They also spoke more and used longer sentences; used more negative and less positive emotion words; showed more disagreement and less agreement with other team members. For high load collaborative tasks people worked together to share the load as reflected by their increased use of plural personal pronouns and decreased use of singular pronouns. The results also showed that under high load, users' language became more complex and difficult to comprehend. An abstract model to use such linguistic features for automatic, real-time, and non-intrusive assessment of <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> is also proposed. A linguistic approach to measure <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> for <b>user</b> interface evaluation and interaction design improvement is discussed, and directions for future research are suggested...|$|R

It is also helpful in examining how individual differences among searchers (e. g. cognitive abilities) affect the search process.

To correct this, {{a set of}} methods, called Dynamically-Defined Virtual Fixtures, was previously proposed to create a movable virtual fixture that stops the user {{at a safe distance}} outside the forbidden region. In this work, a new method, called the Force-Based Method, was added. A vision system was introduced for real-time tool tracking. Additionally, we implemented a closed-loop controller with the virtual fixtures that allows the user to reach, but not enter, the forbidden region. Two user experiments were conducted on a 1 -DOF testbed to evaluate the virtual fixture methods. The first experiment showed the effectiveness of the virtual fixtures in preventing the penetration. However, the absence of haptic feedback in the closed-loop implementation resulted in boundary penetration. In the second experiment, visual feedback was used to compensate for the lack of haptic feedback. <b>User</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> was added as an inhibiting factor in a human-machine cooperative setting.

In Coactive Learning the user provides feedback to the algorithm {{in the form of an}} improvement to a suggested configuration.

Research has also shown that users have difficulty remembering highly secure, randomly created, text-based passwords. Graphical-based passwords {{have been shown to be}} highly memorable for users when applied to system authentication. However, graphical-based authentication systems require additional <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> to recognize and enter a password compared to traditional text-based authentication that is more muscle-memory. This increase in <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> causes an increased security risk of shoulder-surfing created from the longer amount of time needed to input a password.

In order to mitigate these attacks, a number of solutions have been proposed, most of them being cognitive authentication schemes (challenge-response protocols that require users to perform some kind of cognitive operations). In this paper we show successful passive side-channel timing attacks on two cognitive authentication schemes, a well-known Hopper-Blum (HB) protocol and a US patent Mod 10 method, previously believed to be secure against observation attacks. As we show, the main security weakness of these methods comes from detectable variations in the <b>user’s</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> that results from cognitive operations during the authentication procedure. We carried out theoretical analysis of both Mod 10 and HB methods, as well as an experimental user study of Mod 10 method with 58 participants to validate the results of our timing attacks. We also propose security enhancements of these schemes aimed to mitigate the timing side-channel attacks. The proposed enhancements show the existence of a strong tradeoff between security and usability, indicating that the security of cognitive authentication schemes comes at a non-negligible usability cost (e. g., increased overall login time). For this reason, the designers of new cognitive authentication schemes should not ignore possible threats induced by side-channel timing attacks...|$|R

Moreover, intuitiveness of the automatically generated interface was studied by analyzing the results obtained through trained users on the same interface. Objective measurements (in terms of false positives, false negatives, task completion rate, and average number of attempts for activating functionalities) and subjective measurements (about system response accuracy, likeability, cognitive demand, annoyance, habitability, and speed) reveal that the results obtained by the first-time users and experienced users with the proposed framework's interface are very similar, and their performances are comparable with those of both the considered references...|$|R

In this study, we measure effects of interrupting a user at different moments within task execution in terms of task performance, emotional state, and social attribution. Task models were developed using event perception techniques, and the resulting models were used to identify interruption timings based on a <b>user’s</b> predicted <b>cognitive</b> <b>load.</b> Our results show that different interruption moments have different impacts on user emotional state and positive social attribution, and suggest that a system could enable a user to maintain {{a high level of}} awareness while mitigating the disruptive effects of interruption. We discuss implications of these results for the design of an attention manager...|$|R

This to-do list provides a unified environment for managing personal tasks, delegating tasks to the software personal assistant, and collaborating with other users. We use to-do list and instant messaging metaphors {{to enable the}} user to initiate, manage, and modify complex agent-executed tasks. Through simple operations on to-do items and direct-manipulation chat, we envision many seamless interactions between the user and various AI technologies that ultimately result in saving the <b>user</b> work, reducing <b>cognitive</b> <b>load,</b> and improving task performance...|$|R

Most of this information {{is in the form}} of documents in files organized in the hierarchical folder structures provided by the operating system. Operating system-provided access to these data is mainly through structure-guided navigation, and more recently through keyword search. This thesis describes the author's research into the accessibility and utilization of personal documents stored and organized using the hierarchical file system provided by common operating systems. An investigation was carried out on how users currently store and access their documents in these structures. Access and utility problems triggered a need to reconsider the navigation methods currently provided. Further investigation into navigation of personal document hierarchies using semantic metadata derived from the documents was carried out. A more intuitive exploratory interface that exposes the metadata for browsing-style navigation was implemented. The underlying organization is based on a model for navigation whereby documents are represented using index terms and associations between them exposed to create a linked, similarity-based navigation structure. Exposure of metadata-derived index terms in an interface was hypothesized to reduce the <b>user's</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> and enable efficient and effective retrieval while also providing cues for discovery and recognition of associations between documents. Evaluation results of the implementation supports this hypothesis for retrieval of deeply located documents, as well as better overall effectiveness in associating and discovery of documents. The importance of semantic document metadata is also highlighted in demonstrations involving transfer of documents from the desktop to other organized document stores such as a repository.

Most typical user controls relate to providing ratings, editing user data, and adjusting weights of the algirithm. The <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> of the <b>user</b> may increase when using more advanced user controls. We divided common user con- trols into three levels (high, middle, and low) and conducted a study (N= 90) to investigate how different levels of <b>user</b> control affect <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> and quality of recommendations. We de- signed a visualisation {{on top of a}} music recommender system that incorporates three levels of control. The study results show that high level control tends to produce the best recommen- dations, while requiring the highest <b>cognitive</b> <b>load.</b> However, only participants with rich experience in recommender sys- tems are more likely to tweak such high level control, while the majority of participants still prefers low and middle level control. We validated the robustness of our findings with three different algorithms. status: publishe...|$|R
