40|$|Overview: Green Lite Motors is a Portland-based company {{building}} a hybrid commuter vehicle targeted for {{urban and suburban}} areas. The vehicle is a front/back, two-seat configuration with three wheels (two front and one rear-drive wheel). The vehicle is classed as a motorcycle, giving it all the advantages of a smaller footprint in parking and highway travel; however, the advanced roll-cage design and fairing give the vehicle safety and comfort advantages of a standard passenger car. The unique combination of internal combustion engine and electric motor give the vehicle mileage possibilities greater than 100 mpg {{as well as the}} convenience and advantages of a plug-in hybrid. The current vehicle has been developed with a gas-electric hybrid drive system as result of a prior Oregon BEST Commercialization Grant. The coverage of the OTREC grant effort relates to the dynamometer and highway testing for verification of mechanical operation, computer hardware and software integration, and control algorithm operational efficiency as well as implementation of resulting modifications related to initial system issues. Mechanical System: The mechanical system involves the testing of the hybrid interface system proving seamless utilization and control of the internal combustion engine and electric motor. The configuration will be analyzed and tests will be designed for validation and verification of mechanical system integrity. Embedded Control System Objective: The embedded control system consists of a real-time computer system tasked with calculation and application throttle control to the internal combustion engine and electric motor. The control system acquires real-time data from the internal combustion engine propulsion system, the electric motor propulsion system, and the vehicle user. From this input, both propulsion systems will be digitally controlled with the goal of optimizing power plant operation to get the most efficient use of the provided energy stores for moving the vehicle at the users desired performance levels. This system must be exhaustively tested for fault conditions and commissioned for optimal operation. Integrated System: The vehicle will be dynamometer tested as a fully functional system. Different driving scenarios will be tested for vehicle performance, handling, and control system behavior. <b>Mileage</b> <b>factors</b> will be derived with a goal of 100 mpg under normal operation...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{vehicles}} in China has been increasing rapidly. We evaluate the impact of current and possible future vehicle emissions from China on Asian air quality. We modify the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS) for China's road transport sector in 2000 using updated Chinese data for the {{number of vehicles}}, annual <b>mileage,</b> and emission <b>factors.</b> We develop two scenarios for 2020 : a scenario where emission factors remain the same as they were in 2000 (No-Policy, NoPol), and a scenario where Euro 3 vehicle emission standards are applied to all vehicles (except motorcycles and rural vehicles). The Euro 3 scenario is an approximation of what may be the case in 2020 as, starting in 2008, all new vehicles in China (except motorcycles) were required to meet the Euro 3 emission standards. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem), we examine the regional air quality response to China's vehicle emissions in 2000 and in 2020 for the NoPol and Euro 3 scenarios. We evaluate the 2000 model results with observations in Japan, China, Korea, and Russia. Under NoPol in 2020, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) from China's vehicles more than double compared to the 2000 baseline. If all vehicles meet the Euro 3 regulations in 2020, however, these emissions are reduced by more than 50 % relative to NoPol. The implementation of stringent vehicle emission standards leads to a large, simultaneous reduction of the surface ozone (O 3 ) mixing ratios and particulate matter (PM 2. 5 ) concentrations. In the Euro 3 scenario, surface O 3 is reduced by more than 10 ppbv and surface PM 2. 5 is reduced by more than 10 μg m− 3 relative to NoPol in Northeast China in all seasons. In spring, surface O 3 mixing ratios and PM 2. 5 concentrations in neighboring countries are also reduced by more than 3 ppbv and 1 μg m− 3 , respectively.

40|$|Despite being a major {{emitting}} {{nation in}} the world, {{there is a huge}} lack of reliable, updated, and detailed information of road transport's emissions in India for both current and future levels. In this work, a detailed bottom up emission inventory for road transportation in India has been prepared for the year 2005, analyzing the available data and making plausible assumptions for vehicle stock on road, annual <b>mileages</b> and emission <b>factors.</b> This inventory brings the calculation of road transport’s exhaust emissions in India one step further to a sophisticated modeling that is standard for industrialized countries. Emissions for the future (years 2020 and 2030) are also estimated by developing three plausible scenarios (high growth, business as usual and sustainable) for developments in vehicle stock, activity <b>factors</b> (<b>mileages),</b> and emission rates. The bottom up scenario quantification is as detailed as the emission inventory. This is the first that detailed comprehensive bottom up study on the emissions from road transportation in India. This is also the first detailed study for the criteria pollutants - both for the current situation and the future developments. The IPCC SRES 2000 scenarios are interpreted and used first time for the road transportation sector in India to develop scenarios of traffic growth and evolution of emission rates in the future. Throughout the study, the vehicular emissions in the mega cities are quantified and analyzed separately, and compared {{with the rest of the}} nation. The inclusion of non-exhaust PM emissions as well as emissions from tractors on road is also a new but novel and important step for India. The uncertainties in the emission inventory are quantified, identifying the probable sources. Sensitivity analyses are also carried out to identify the most critical factors in the emission scenarios. It lends itself for further improvement and differentiation, but already provides novel quantitative details for the region with little information. The emission inventory prepared for the year 2005 shows that motorized two wheelers (M 2 W) and heavy duty trucks (HDT) are the most important vehicle categories in terms of emissions. Nationally, two wheelers are responsible for almost half of VKM, CO and HC emissions, and about 16 % of PM; with about only 8 % fuel use. HDTs are responsible for slightly more than half of CO 2, NOx and SO 2 emissions, and about 40 % of PM emissions. The emission scenario is dominated by the rest of the country (share: 85 %- 90 %). Certification, inspection, and maintenance contribute from two thirds to three quarters of uncertainties in criteria pollutant emissions for the year 2005. The range of total uncertainty is from 80 % in NOx to about 200 % in CO. The scenario results strongly depend on quantitative assumptions made with respect to the increase in traffic volume and improvements in the vehicle technologies. Energy demand and CO 2 emissions in the road transportation sector are expected to grow dramatically in the coming decades (between 3. 3 and 7. 4 times of the current level in 2030). Passenger vehicles will need less energy than freight vehicles, except for the sustainable scenario. Heavy duty trucks will be the largest consumer of energy (36 % to 48 % share in 2030), cars being a distant second (12 % to 24 % share in 2030) at the national level. However, a major share of energy demand (37 % to 62 % in 2030) will come from cars and light duty trucks (LDT) in the mega cities. The trend of high growth in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions will continue unless the economic growth slows down or major changes in surface transportation occur. The major changes required in urban road transportation are: controlled growth and use of passenger cars and LDTs and a higher use of buses as well as non motorized transportation. Extra urban transportation requires a modal shift towards railways for intercity freight transportation. Otherwise, increased bill of fuel import problems may seriously risk India’s future economic growth and the global competition for oil products will be also more intensified. Sensitivity analyses for the high growth scenario show that higher constraints for growth in number of ‘passenger cars and freight vehicles’ result in almost equal reduction in CO 2 emissions as by higher fuel efficiency of ‘all’ vehicle categories. The combined efforts to reduce number and mileage of these two vehicle types are very critical for reducing not only CO 2 emissions but also NOx, PM, SO 2 emissions. The potential of renewable energy sources in the transportation sector seems to be small until 2030 (4 %- 11 %). Decoupling of fuel demand and CO 2 emission from air pollutant emissions is evident from the scenario results in this work. However, criteria pollutants will grow until 2020. Exhaust PM and SO 2 will already decline by 2020 due to increased pressure to improve the air quality in the urban areas. Unless a significant delay or a complete failure of stricter emission regulations will occur, the continuous improvements in emission control technologies will result in very low levels of these emissions by 2030. The level of exhaust PM emissions in the future is very uncertain. The crucial actions in directing the problems of air pollution, energy security, and climate change simultaneously are: speedy introduction and a strict implementation of a series of stringent emission norms; controlling growth in traffic volumes of freight vehicles, motorized two wheelers and passenger cars; enhancing the growth of small vehicles; phasing out traditional two stroke technology in the fleet of motorized two wheelers; and vigorous market penetration of electrical and hybrid vehicles. PM 10 and PM 2. 5 emissions can not be reduced in the future without controlling emissions from non-exhaust sources as well as exhaust PM from tractors. Large uncertainty in non-exhaust PM emissions result from highly uncertain emission factors. In dieser Arbeit wird eine detaillierte bottom-up Emissionsinventar für den Straßenverkehr in Indien für das Jahr 2005 entwickelt. Dabei werden 15 Fahrzeugklassen, vier Altersgruppen und zwei regionale Klassifizierungen untersucht. Ebenfalls werden die Emissionen in den Jahren 2020 und 2030 abgeschätzt, wobei drei Szenarien für die Entwicklung von Fahrzeugbestand, Fahrleistung und Emissionsraten betrachtet werden. Diese Szenarien sind: ein Szenario mit starken Wachstum, ein Referenzszenario und ein nachhaltiges Szenario mit schwachen Wachstum. Das bottom-up Szenario ist vergleichbares detailliert wie die Emissionsbestandsaufnahme. Die vorliegende Arbeit ist die erste derart detaillierte bottom Up-Studie für den Straßenverkehr in Indien. Ebenso ist es die erste derart detaillierte Untersuchung von Luftverunreinigungen - sowohl für die heutige Situation als auch für zukünftige Entwicklungen. In der Arbeit werden die Megacities und der Rest des Landes getrennt untersucht und miteinander verglichen. Die Einbeziehung der Partikel Emissionen von Abrieb und Aufwirbelung wie auch die Berücksichtigung der Emissionen von Traktoren sind ein ebenso neuer wie wichtiger Schritt für Indien. Die Schwankungsbreiten der Emissionsschätzungen werden quantifiziert und ihre Ursachen identifiziert. Eine Sensitivitätsanalyse wird durchgeführt und die kritischsten Faktoren bestimmt. Das Emissionsinventar für 2005 zeigt, dass motorisierte Zweiräder (M 2 W) und schwere Lastwagen(HDT) die wichtigsten Fahrzeuggruppen hinsichtlich der Emissionen sind. Landesweit sind M 2 W für fast die Hälfte an VKM, CO und HC-Emissionen verantwortlich und etwa 16 % PM Emission beteiligt, dagegen nur für 8 % des Treibstoffverbrauches. HDT sind für etwas mehr als die Hälfte der CO 2, NOX und SO 2 Emissionen verantwortlich, daneben für etwa 40 % PM. Das Emissionsszenario wird vom Rest des Landes (außerhalb der Megacities) dominiert. Ungenügende Zertifizierung sowie mangelhafte Inspektion und Wartung tragen etwa 70 % der Unsicherheiten der Emissionsschätzung für das Jahr 2005 bei. Die Schwankungsbreite liegt von etwa 80 % für NOx bis etwa 200 % für CO. Die Ergebnisse der Szenarien hängen stark von quantitativen Annahmen bei Verkehrszuwachs und Verbesserungen in der Fahrzeugtechnik ab. Es kann erwartet werden, dass Energieverbrauch und CO 2 -Emissionen im Straßenverkehr in den nächsten Jahrzehnten dramatisch wachsen werden. (Bis 2030 zwischen dem 3, 3 und dem 7, 4 fachen des heutigen Niveaus). Jedoch wird ein hoher Anteil des Energieverbrauches (Anstieg von 37 % auf 62 % bis 2030) von Pkw und leichten Lastwagen (LDT) in den Megacities stattfinden. Der Trend zu einem hohen Wachstum im Treibstoffverbrauch und CO 2 -Emission wird anhalten, solange das ökonomische Wachstum anhält oder keine wichtigen Veränderungen im Verkehrsverhalten auftreten. Die notwendigsten Veränderungen im städtischen Verkehr, um die Emissionen zu begrenzen, sind ein kontrolliertes Wachstum der Fahrleistung von PKW und LDT und ein höherer Anteil von Bussen und nicht-motorisiertem Transport. Begrenzung des Emissionen zum Überlandverkehr erfordert eine Erhöhung des modal shifts zugunsten von Eisenbahnen für den Intercity-Güterverkehr. Werden Energieverbrauch und Emissionen nicht begrenzt, werden höhere Kosten für den Treibstoffimporte Indiens ökonomische Zukunft nachhaltig gefährden und der globale Wettbewerb auf dem Treibstoffmarkt verschärft. Die Empfindlichkeitsanalyse für das Szenario mit starkem Wachstum zeigen, dass sowohl ein kontrolliertes Wachstum der Anzahl der PKW und LKW als auch eine höhere Treibstoffeffizienz in allen Fahrzeugkategorien etwa die gleiche Wirkung auf die CO 2 -Reduktion haben. Eine reduzierte Anzahl und Fahrleistung von PKW und LKW ist aber nicht nur für die CO 2 -Reduktion entscheidend, sondern auch für NOx, PM und SO 2 -Emissionen. Das Potential von erneuerbaren Energien im Verkehrssektor scheint zumindest bis 2030 klein zu sein (nur 4 %- 11 %). Wie die Entkopplung der Treibstoffnachfrage und der CO 2 -Emissionen von den sonstigen Emissionen möglich ist, zeigt diese Arbeit auf, vor allem für das Szenario mit starkem Wachstum. Jedoch werden die Luftverunreinigungen bis 2020 stark wachsen. Partikel von Abgas und SO 2 -Emissionen werden bereits vor 2020 zurückgehen, da der Druck zur Verbesserung der Luftverhältnisse in den Städten wächst. Sofern nicht eine deutliche Verzögerung bei der Einführung strengerer Emissionsnormen eintritt, werden diese Emissionen bis 2030 auf ein sehr niedriges Niveau zurückgehen. Das Ausmaß der Partikelemissionen als Folge von Abrieb und Aufwirbelung ist in der Zukunft sehr ungewiß ebenso der künftige Einsatz von Partikelfiltern für Schwerlastfahrzeuge. Besteht die wichtigste Maßnahme darin, gleichzeitig die Probleme von Luftverschmutzung, Energieverbrauch und Klimawandel zu bewältigen, in einer schnelle Einführung und strenge Umsetzung einer Reihe von stringenten Emissionsnormen das Wachstum der Verkehrsleistung im Frachtverkehr, von Zweirädern und PkW zu steuern, in einer strikten Umsetzung von Inspektions- und Wartungsnormen, eine Erhöhung des Anteils kleinerer Fahrzeuge, die traditionelle Zweigangtechnik bei Zweirädern zu beenden und einer starken Marktdurchdringung von elektrischen und Hybridfahrzeugen. Feinstaubemissionen (PM 10 und PM 2, 5) können nicht ohne Regelung der Partikel von Abrieb und Aufwirbelung sowie der Emissionen von Traktoren reduziert werden. Die hohe Ungenauigkeit bei ihrer Schätzung resultiert vor allem (zu etwa 75 %) aus der Unbestimmtheit der Emissionsfaktoren...|$|R
