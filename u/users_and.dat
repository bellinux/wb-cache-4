40|$|The {{invention}} discloses a charging method, a {{charging system}} and a charging server for sensor network. The method comprises: recording charging information of a first user; recording charging information of a second user working in a first spectrum, the first spectrum being a licensed spectrum of the first user; calculating charges of the first user to be offset according to the charging information of the first user, the charging information of the second <b>user,</b> <b>and</b> an economic relationship between the second <b>user</b> <b>and</b> the first user; and calculating charges of the second user according to the charging information thereof. The charging system and server calculate charges of users in the sensor network through recording the charging information of the first <b>user</b> <b>and</b> the second <b>user</b> <b>and</b> considering the economic relationship between the second <b>user</b> <b>and</b> the first <b>user,</b> <b>and</b> the charging method, the charging system and the charging server are beneficial to development of the sensor network in the future. 本发明公开了一种感知网络计费方法、系统及服务器。所述方法包括：记录第一用户的计费信息；记录工作在第一频谱的第二用户的计费信息，所述第一频谱是所述第一用户的许可频谱；根据所述第一用户的计费信息、所述第二用户的计费信息以及第二用户与第一用户间的经济关系计算第一用户被抵消的费用；根据所述第二用户的计费信息计算第二用户的费用。本发明通过记录第一用户和第二用户的计费信息并考虑第二和第一用户间的经济关系，来计算感知网络中用户的费用，有利于未来感知网络的发展。Department of ComputingInventor name used in this publication: 冯伟Inventor name used in this publication: 曹建农Title in Traditional Chinese: 感知網絡計費方法、系統及服務器Chin...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents an}} effort towards finding a common understanding on how <b>user</b> <b>and</b> learner modeling systems, if seen as agents, {{can communicate with}} the applications. The fundamental characteristics of the communication between application agents (Apps) <b>and</b> <b>user</b> or learner modeling systems (ULMSs) are examined in order to draw some conclusions on what features should be considered within such a proposed communication consensus. Taking that into account I open to discussion {{a proposal for a}} framework concerning such a communication. This framework is based on a reinterpretation of the KQML within a <b>user</b> <b>and</b> learner modeling scenario and describes the types of performatives that were considered relevant from a <b>user</b> <b>and</b> learner modeling perspective. The analysis of these performatives is made using a scenario where both <b>user</b> <b>and</b> learner modeling systems and applications are seen as software agents. Finally, I will draw some implications on how some current general <b>user</b> <b>and</b> learner mo [...] ...|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 <b>users,</b> <b>and</b> is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.|$|E
5|$|Before {{completion}} of the tunnel, in 2009, nearly 16,000 vehicles travelled to and from PortMiami through downtown streets each weekday. Truck traffic made up 28% (or 4,480) of this number (Source: 2009 PB Americas Traffic Study). In 2010 {{it was estimated that}} around 19,000 vehicles traveled to the port daily but that only 16% were trucks. Existing truck and bus routes restricted the port's ability to grow, drive up costs for port <b>users</b> <b>and</b> presenting safety hazards. They were also thought to congest and limit redevelopment of the northern portion of Miami's Central Business District.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{the use of}} a <b>user</b> <b>and</b> task analysis in the development of an interactive nursing terminal (IVT). The IVT offers digital planning and patient information to the nurse on the road.
