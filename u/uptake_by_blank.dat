40|$|The {{effects of}} chemical, physical, and {{infectious}} cytotoxic agents on primary and cultured cells {{were evaluated by}} measurements of oxygen uptake for various time periods. A newly developed respirometer used a Clark oxygen electrode in a 1. 0 -ml chamber, with provisions for constant mixing and for temperature control of both the sample and electrode chambers. The device was unique because the electrode and instrumentation were provided by a clinical blood-gas analyzer. Oxygen <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> <b>blank</b> controls was negligible, whereas cells and tissue consumed oxygen at rates of approximately 1 to 5 mul/h in a dose- and temperature-dependent fashion. Cyanide, heat, and freeze-thaw lysis reduced the oxygen uptake to less than 0. 6 mul/mg per h. Infection of trachea organ cultures with Mycoplasma pneumoniae significantly reduced relative ciliary activity, tetrazolium reduction capacity, and oxygen consumption in a coordinated fashion...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} release-delaying coat for drug-layered fish pellets, in order to prevent a {{premature}} release of the drug in the tank water but allowing a rapid release after <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> the fish. <b>Blank</b> pellets were prepared in a rotary processor and drug layered in a Wurster coater with bovine serum albumin or riboflavin using hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) as a binder. On the drug-loaded pellets, different mixtures of ethyl cellulose (EC) and HPMC were applied as the release-delaying coat. The aim was to obtain less than 10 % drug release during the first 10 min followed by a fast release after the "lag" period, resulting in a sigmoidal release profile. In order to prevent coat bursts it was necessary {{to increase the amount of}} plasticizer from 20 to 40 % triethylcitrate. To have a complete coat around the pellets, the thickness of the coat (amount EC) was important up to a certain level. The EC/HPMC ratio had a decisive influence on optimizing the permeability of the coating and realizing a sigmoidal release profile. The release rate was studied as a function of several formulation variables and physicochemical parameters (salinity, pH, and temperature) of the dissolution medium as the coating system is intended for different fish species. Salinity of the water proved to be important as well as the temperature. The developed system seems to be promising for a lot of ichthyologic applications, although it has to be evaluated for each intended drug, keeping in mind the properties of the particles to be coated, the fish species, and the environment. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{dissolved}} organic matter binds metal ions and buffers them in natural waters. Although it is believed that a decrease in metal ion concentration should lead to a decrease in metal bioavailability, previous work has shown that Pb <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> Mytilus edulis gills is greatly enhanced in the presence of humic acids. In the present work, the effect of more soluble organic matter (fulvic acids and DOM extracted from river) on Pb <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> mussels and their gills is studied. Pb complexation by these organic substances was measured by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) and it is proven that Pb <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> mussel gills in the presence of fulvic acids can be successfully predicted according to ASV-labile Pb concentrations.

40|$|Water uptake {{kinetics}} of axes and cotyledons of Vigna radiata seeds {{has been}} studied during incubation at chilling temperature (4 °C) and under cycloheximide treatment. Germination rate of scarified seeds was faster than intact seeds, which can be correlated with their comparative water uptake kinetics. Chilling temperature during incubation significantly slowed down water <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> both intact and scarified seeds. Treatment with cycloheximide was also somewhat effective in retarding water uptake, but only in scarified seeds. Water <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> axes isolated from intact seeds (attached or detached from the cotyledons) was inhibited completely by chilling temperature {{as well as by}} cycloheximide treatment while these treatments were ineffective in preventing water <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> cotyledons.

40|$|Introduction Tumour hyperglycolysis {{is driven}} by {{activation}} of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) through tumour hypoxia. Accordingly, the degree of 2 -fluro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> tumours might indirectly reflect the level of hypoxia, obviating {{the need for more}} specific radiopharmaceuticals for hypoxia imaging. Discussion In this paper, available data on the relationship between hypoxia and FDG <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> tumour tissue in vitro and in vivo are reviewed. In pre-clinical in vitro studies, acute hypoxia was consistently shown to increase FDG <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> normal and tumour cells within a couple of hours after onset with mobilisation or modification of glucose transporters optimising glucose <b>uptake,</b> followed <b>by</b> a delayed response with increased rates of transcription of GLUT mRNA. In pre-clinical imaging studies on chronic hypoxia that compared FDG <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> tumours grown in rat or mice to <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> FMISO, the pattern of normoxic and hypoxic regions within the human tumour xenografts, as imaged by FMISO, largely correlated with glucose metabolism although minor locoregional differences could not be excluded. In the clinical setting, data are limited and discordant. Conclusion Further evaluation of FDG <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> various tumour types in relation to intrinsic and bioreductive markers of hypoxia and response to radiotherapy or hypoxia-dependent drugs is needed to fully assess its application as a marker of hypoxia in the clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{regulation}} of anionic amino acid transport, using radiolabelled D-aspartate as a tracer, by rat mammary tissue explants has been examined. Na+-dependent D-aspartate <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> mammary tissue increased between late pregnancy and early lactation {{and again at}} peak lactation but thereafter declined during late lactation. In contrast, the Na+-independent component of D-aspartate <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> mammary explants did not change significantly with the physiological state of the donor animals. Premature weaning of rats during peak lactation markedly decreased Na+-dependent D-aspartate <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> mammary tissue. In addition, premature weaning also reduced the effect of reversing the trans-membrane Na+-gradient on the fractional loss of D-aspartate from mammary tissue explants. Unilateral weaning of rats during peak lactation revealed that milk accumulation per se reduced the Na+-dependent moiety of D-aspartate <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> mammary tissue suggesting that the transport of anionic amino acids is regulated to match supply with demand. Treating lactating rats with bromocryptine reduced D-aspartate <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> mammary tissue explants suggesting that the transport of anionic amino acids by the rat mammary gland is regulated by prolactin...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{antidiabetic}} drug metformin (Nl, Nl-dimethylbiguanide) on glucose <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> isolated rat diaphragm muscle have been studied.

Diaphragm muscle from normal rats incubated in a medium containing sodium butyrate (0. 25 mg/ml) showed a reduction in glucose uptake similar to that seen in muscle from diabetic animals. Metformin (10 μg/ml) also increased glucose <b>uptake</b> <b>by</b> this preparation in the presence of insulin (P < 0. 01).
