25|$|While {{the unusual}} spectra of red giant stars {{had been known}} since the 19th century, it was George Gamow who, in the 1940s, first <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were stars of roughly solar mass that {{had run out of}} {{hydrogen}} in their cores and had resorted to burning the hydrogen in their outer shells. This allowed Martin Schwarzschild to draw the connection between red giants and the finite lifespans of stars. It is now understood that red giants are stars in the last stages of their life cycles.|$|E

Hayashida stated that these were intricate parts of the original and directly affect the difficulty {{and so they were}} not changed. Hayashida also spoke similarly about the controls; even if they were not considered ideal, he <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been conceived that way for a reason and so they were unaltered for NES Remix.|$|E

25|$|The {{harshness}} and {{unpredictability of}} life in the Arctic ensured that Inuit lived with concern for the uncontrollable, where a streak of bad luck could destroy an entire community. To offend a spirit was to risk its interference with an already marginal existence. The Inuit <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had to work in harmony with supernatural powers to provide the necessities of day-to-day life. Before the 1940s, Inuit had minimal contact with Europeans, who passed through on their way to hunt whales or trade furs but seldom had any interest in settling down on the frozen land of the Arctic. So the Inuit had the place to themselves. They moved between summer and winter camps to always be living where there were animals to hunt.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the {{underground}} facility began in late 1941, and was completed by late summer 1942. The chambers served as a dual observation post, with an observation slit overlooking the Bay of Gibraltar and a larger aperture over the Mediterranean Sea. Six men were selected for the operation, an executive officer as leader, two physicians, and three wireless operators. All six men had volunteered to be sealed inside the cave should Gibraltar fall to the Axis powers. The men <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would remain sealed within the facility for about a year, although it could be much longer. Provisions for a seven-year stay had been assembled in the complex. However, the plan was never activated. The Director of Naval Intelligence ordered that the provisions in the complex be distributed and the cave sealed. Rumours of a secret complex, eventually dubbed Stay Behind Cave, circulated for decades in Gibraltar, until discovery of the chambers in 1997 by the Gibraltar Caving Group. The authenticity of the site was confirmed {{by one of the}} builders in 1998, and a decade later by one of the physicians. That physician, the last surviving member of the Tracer team, died in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} bombing proponents {{within the}} USAAF, called the Bomber Mafia by their ideological opponents, had {{established in the}} early 1930s a policy against research to create long-range fighters, which they thought would not be practical; this kind of research was not to compete for bomber resources. Aircraft manufacturers <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not be rewarded if they installed subsystems on their fighters {{to enable them to}} carry drop tanks to provide more fuel for extended range. Lieutenant Kelsey, acting against this policy, risked his career in late 1941 when he convinced Lockheed to incorporate such subsystems in the P-38E model, without putting his request in writing. It is possible that Kelsey was responding to Colonel George William Goddard's observation that the US sorely needed a high-speed, long-range photo reconnaissance plane. Along with a change order specifying some P-38Es be produced without guns but with photo reconnaissance cameras, to be designated the F-4-1-LO, Lockheed began working out the problems of drop tank design and incorporation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, eventually about 100 P-38Es were sent to a modification center near Dallas, Texas, or to the new Lockheed assembly plant B-6 (today the Burbank Airport), to be fitted with four K-17 aerial photography cameras. All of these aircraft were also modified to be able to carry drop tanks. P-38Fs were modified as well. Every Lightning from the P-38G onward was drop tank-capable off the assembly line.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Evita (1976), a sung-through concept album by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber {{detailing}} the life of Eva PerÃ³n, director Alan Parker met with their manager David Land, asking if Rice and Lloyd Webber had thought of making a film version. He <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were more interested in}} creating a stage version with the album's original lyrics. The original West End theatre production of Evita opened at the Prince Edward Theatre on June 21, 1978, and closed on February 18, 1986. The subsequent Broadway production opened at the Broadway Theatre on September 25, 1979 and closed on June 26, 1983 after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. Robert Stigwood, producer of the West End production, wanted Parker to direct Evita as a film but, after completing work on the musical Fame (1980), Parker turned down the opportunity to helm Evita, telling Stigwood that he [...] "didn't want to do back-to-back musicals".|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of transuranium elements was suggested by Enrico Fermi {{based on his}} experiments in 1934. However, even though four actinides were known by that time, {{it was not yet}} <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> formed a family similar to lanthanides. The prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the 7th period, with thorium, protactinium and uranium corresponding to 6th-period hafnium, tantalum and tungsten, respectively. Synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view. By 1944 an observation that curium failed to exhibit oxidation states above 4 (whereas its supposed 6th period homolog, platinum, can reach oxidation state of 6) prompted Glenn Seaborg to formulate a so-called [...] "actinide hypothesis". Studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic elements provided more data in support of this point of view, but the phrase [...] "actinide hypothesis" [...] (the implication being that a [...] "hypothesis" [...] is something that has not been decisively proven) remained in active use by scientists through the late 1950s.|$|E

[...] Ray cited eight separate conversations between the First Lady and senior staff and concluded: [...] "Mrs. Clintonâ€™s input into the process was significant, if not the significant factor influencing the pace of events in the Travel Office firings and the ultimate decision to fire the employees." [...] Moreover, Ray determined Hillary Clinton had given [...] "factually false" [...] testimony when questioned by the GAO, the Independent Counsel, and Congress about the travel office firings, but reiterated that [...] "the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt" [...] that she knew her statements were false or <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may have prompted the firings.|$|E
500|$|Tomoko Sasaki reprised {{her role}} of lead {{composer}} {{from the original}} Nights into Dreams, and was rejoined by Sonic Team veterans Naofumi Hataya and Fumie Kumatani. Additionally, series newcomers Tomoya Ohtani, Teruhiko Nakagawa, and Tatsuyuki Maeda each contributed a few musical pieces. The game's sound effects were created primarily by Jun Senoue, better known for his musical compositions in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. According to [...] Iizuka, the team <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not compose the same style of music featured in the original game, owing to the technical revamp of Journey of Dreams. Sasaki elaborated that the original Saturn version used the console's internal music sequencer, which allowed them more control over changing the game's music as the player progressed through the game, whereas the Wii version only played the recorded music directly. Despite the limitations, both Sasaki and Hataya were able to produce a better quality soundtrack by using {{a wider range of}} instruments than what was used in the previous game. In addition, Sasaki asked an employee from Delfi Sound Inc. to record an orchestral piece for the game. Since the team were aware that the game's characters would have more dialogue than the original game, they requested that the orchestra perform a dramatic arrangement in order to put more emphasis on the game's storyline.|$|E
