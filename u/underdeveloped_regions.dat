Many of the dwellings now remain shut, while abandonment of the traditional rural economy has affected the cultural landscape.

Tourism constitutes the principal source of revenue for the local economy, although it has a highly seasonal character. Intense development in terms of accommodation and tourism infrastructure occurred in the 1980s, mainly through state initiatives.|$|E

25|$|In {{analyzing}} nationalist {{successes in}} early 20th century Romania (Cultural Politics in Greater Romania), Irina Livezeanu {{builds on the}} theories of American social anthropologist Ernest Gellner, specifically on his definition of nationalism {{as a product of}} industrial society and the emphasis he places on academics having promoted and imposed nationalist theses. She applied Gellner's ideas and concepts to a particular case, that of the predominantly rural Romanian society, and, in this context, linked them to the conclusions of Liah Greenfeld. According to Greenfeld and Livezeanu, although nationalism was generated by economic and social development in England, it grew independently from that point on, and was equally able to impose itself in less <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1985 {{there were}} more than 1,000 teacher {{training}} schools - an indispensable tool in the effort to solve the acute shortage of qualified teachers. These schools, however, were unable to supply the number of teachers needed to attain modernization goals through 1990. Although a considerable number of students graduated as qualified teachers from institutions of Higher Learning, the relatively low social status and salary levels of teachers hampered recruitment, and not all of the graduates of teachers' colleges became teachers. To attract more teachers, China tried to make teaching a more desirable and respected profession. To this end, the government designated September 10 as Teachers' Day, granted teachers pay raises, and made teachers' colleges tuition free. To further arrest the teacher shortage, in 1986 the central government sent teachers to <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>regions</b> to train local schoolteachers.|$|E

25|$|An {{estimate}} of the mortality rate for the modern bubonic plague, following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, {{although it may be}} higher in <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>regions.</b> Symptoms of the disease include fever of , headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 per cent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 per cent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time {{for the development of the}} enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.|$|E
25|$|In economics, {{since the}} late 1970s a {{widening}} gap of economic resources between the developed and <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>regions</b> of Yugoslavia severely deteriorated the federation's unity. The most developed republics, Croatia and Slovenia, rejected attempts to limit their autonomy as provided in the 1974 Constitution. Public opinion in Slovenia in 1987 saw better economic opportunity in independence from Yugoslavia than within it. There were also places that saw no economic benefit from being in Yugoslavia; for example, the autonomous province of Kosovo was poorly developed, and per capita GDP fell from 47 percent of the Yugoslav average in the immediate post-war period to 27 percent by the 1980s. However economic issues have not been demonstrated to be the sole determining factor in the break up of Yugoslavia, as Yugoslavia in this period was the most prosperous Communist state in Eastern Europe at this time period and the country in fact disintegrated {{during a period of}} economic recovery after the implementation of the economic reforms of Ante Marković's government. Furthermore, during the break up of Yugoslavia, the leaders of Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, all declined an unofficial offer by the European Community to provide substantial economic support to them in exchange for a political compromise. However the issue of economic inequality between the republics, autonomous provinces, and nations of Yugoslavia resulted in tensions with claims of disadvantage and accusations of privileges against others by these groups.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{development}} {{is directly related}} to human development of any region or country. A proper understanding of this relationship may help to improve quality of life in general, and reduce poverty in particular for <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>region.</b> The present paper is an effort to study the agrarian economy of north-east India, which is an <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>region</b> in the country. A comparative state-wise analysis of some economic parameters and population pressure on the agricultural sector along with district-wise agricultural productivity in the region has been carried out. The spatial distribution of land productivity as well as labour productivity has been mapped across the districts of the region using a GIS tool. The study reveals a general trend of the region, but there exist significant variations among sates and districts. Although these analyses are based on the secondary data of some macro-economic indicators and population/agriculture census, yet it makes an attempt to map the extent of disparity, especially on the agro-economic front...|$|R

2500|$|The {{revival of}} {{prostitution}} was initially associated with China's eastern, coastal cities, {{but since the}} early 1990s at least, local media have reported on prostitution scandals in the economic hinterlands, incorporating such remote and <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>regions</b> as Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet. [...] In the 1980s, the typical seller of sex was a poorly educated, young female rural migrant from populous, relatively remote provinces such as Sichuan and Hunan. Over the past decade, {{there has been a}} recognition that the majority of women who enter prostitution do so of their own accord. The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options. The state-controlled media have focused attention on urban residents engaging in prostitution, especially university-educated women. There also seems to be a growing acceptance of prostitution. In a 1997 study, 46.8% of undergraduates in Beijing admitted to having considered receiving prostitution services. On the demand side, prostitution has been associated with the gender imbalances brought about by the one-child policy.|$|E
