5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption,</b> believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
25|$|At {{least nine}} districts in West Bengal and 42 districts in Bangladesh have arsenic levels in {{groundwater}} above the World Health Organization maximum permissible limit of 50µg/L or 50 {{parts per billion}} and the untreated water is <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E

50|$|Insect pests pose a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} shelf-life of stored grain. Species like Bruchidius atrolineatus and Callosobruchus maculatus, (commonly known as cowpea weevils, or bruchids) carry out their life cycle within grain, and their presence makes the crop <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> or animal <b>consumption.</b> These insects reproduce rapidly, thus {{only a few of}} the insects within a collection of cowpeas can cause significant damage within a month.|$|R
25|$|The {{contamination}} of both groundwater and nearby streams {{may be for}} long periods of time. Deterioration of stream quality results from acid mine drainage, toxic trace elements, high content of dissolved solids in mine drainage water, and increased sediment loads discharged to streams. When coal surfaces are exposed, pyrite comes in contact with water and air and forms sulfuric acid. As water drains from the mine, the acid moves into the waterways; as long as rain falls on the mine tailings the sulfuric-acid production continues, whether the mine is still operating or not. Also waste piles and coal storage piles can yield sediment to streams. Surface waters may be rendered <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> agriculture, <b>human</b> <b>consumption,</b> bathing, or other household uses.|$|R
25|$|Brookvale Park Lake and {{surrounding}} land is a park that was formally a {{drinking water reservoir}} until the steadily encroaching city made the water <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> It was briefly converted into an outdoor pool until that was also abandoned after health and safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew of the}} Japanese tuna-fishing boat Lucky Dragon 5, who {{had been}} fishing just outside the {{exclusion}} zone, returned to port suffering from radiation sickness and skin burns; one crew member was terminally ill. Efforts were made to recover the cargo of contaminated fish but at least two large tuna were probably sold and eaten. A further 75 tons of tuna caught between March and December {{were found to be}} <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> When the crew member died and the full results of the contamination were made public by the U.S., Japanese concerns were reignited about the hazards of radiation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that each year about 17,000 children die from diarrhea. One reason is that drinking water quality is often below standards. Some water treatment plants are not maintained properly and are thus inefficient in removing parasites, viruses and other parasitic microorganisms. In 2009, {{a study by the}} Ministry of Health showed that drinking water for half a million people in Asiut was <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> As of June 2011, nothing had been done to address the problem. Chlorination systems of wells, which had been installed years ago because high levels of bacteria had been detected in the groundwater, failed for lack of maintenance and have been shut down so that untreated water is provided to the residents.|$|E
40|$|Food {{operators}} require {{products to}} be free and safe from microbial contamination. The characteristics and activities of microbial communities in food material, {{at the time of}} processing, influences shelf life, quality, and spoilage rate. Present processing and storage conditions enable growth of bacterial species adapted to survive extreme conditions, making them a concern in the food industry as they result in food <b>unfit</b> or hazardous <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> In this thesis, 16 S rRNA gene amplicon data was used to investigate the microbial community structure and composition sampled from a Finnish sausage processing factory. To roughly analyze the distribution of dominating bacterial species in each processing stage, the 16 S rRNA gene count data was filtered to retain OTUs having a non-zero, to greater than 50, read counts in more than 50 % of the samples, where differences in composition were tested for significance. A more thorough analysis included agglomerative hierarchical clustering using Ward’s minimum variance method, to explore OTU grouping based on their read count composition, across various food processing environments and within factory locations. Both approaches identified spoilage bacteria of the genus Leuconostocs, Pseudomonas, Brochothrix, Yersinia, Carnobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Clostridium dominating samples. Lactic acid bacteria such as Leuconostocs were found abundant in packaged product and emulsion samples whereas Brochothrix, Pseudomonas and Carnobacterium were abundant in nutrient rich mediums such as meat. The results of the analysis coincide with findings in literature. Factory equipment surfaces were abundant in spoilage species such as Brochothrix, Clostridium, and Yersinia, which are reported in literature to grow on meat and skin. Metal equipment surfaces had a higher incidence of spoilage bacteria compared to plastic surfaces. The current analysis also showed that the effect of extensive and daily cleaning leads to the higher growth of certain spoilage bacteria, instead of reducing their number. The presence of spoilage bacteria on factory surfaces suggests the formation of biofilms that are difficult to remove...|$|R

I am a backward being, alas, in these days when so much is forward; our public anxieties somehow strike {{for me at the}} roots of letter-writing, and I remain too often dumb, not because I am not thinking and feeling a thousand things, but exactly because I am doing so to such intensity. You wrote me weeks ago that you had finished your new novel--which information took my breath away (I mean by its windlike rush)--and now has come thus much of the remainder of the adventure for which that so grandly liberated you and which I follow with the liveliest participation in all your splendid sense of it and profit of it. I confess I take an enormous pleasure in the fact of the exposure of the sensitive plate of your imagination, your tremendous attention, to all these wonderful and terrible things. What impressions you are getting, verily--and what a breach must it all not make with the course of history you are practising up to the very eve. I rejoice that you finished and snipped off, or tucked in and wound up, something self-contained there--for how could you ever go back to it if you hadn't?--under that violence of rupture with the past which makes me ask myself what will have become of all that material we were taking for granted, and which now lies there behind us like some vast damaged cargo dumped upon a dock and <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> purchase or <b>consumption.</b> I seem to fear that I shall find myself seeing your recently concluded novel as through a glass darkly--which, however, will not prevent my immediately falling upon it when it appears; as I assume, however, that it is not now likely to do before the summer's end--by which time God knows what other monstrous chapters of history won't have been perpetrated! What I most want to say to you, I think, is that I rejoice for you with all my heart in that assurance of health which has enabled you so to gird yourself and go forth. If the torrid south has always been good for you there must be no amount of it that you are now not getting--though I am naturally reduced, you see, to quite abjectly helpless and incompetent supposition. I hang about you at any rate with all sorts of vows and benedictions. I feel that I mustn't make remarks about the colossal undertaking you are engaged in beyond saying that I believe with all my heart in the final power of your push. As for our news here the gist of that is that we are living with our eyes on you and more and more materially backing you.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} with microelement loads {{was set up}} on loamy-textured, calcareous chernozem soil formed on loess. The ploughed layer contained about 5 % CaCO 3 and 3 % humus. The soil was well supplied with Ca, Mg, Mn and Cu, moderately supplied with N and K, and weakly supplied with P and Zn. The water table is at the depth of 15 m, the water-balance of the area is negative, and the site is drought-sensitive. Salts of the 13 examined microelements were applied at 4 levels {{in the spring of}} 1991. Treatments were arranged in split-plot design, in a total of 104 plots with two replications. Loading rates were 0, 90, 270 and 810 kg/ha per elements in the form of AlCl 3, NaAsO 2, BaCl 2, CdSO 4, K 2 CrO 4, CuSO 4, HgCl 2, (NH 4) 6 Mo 7 O 24, NiSO 4, Pb(NO 3) 2, Na 2 SeO 3, SrSO 4, and ZnSO 4. Soil profiles of the control and the 810 kg/ha treatment were sampled in the 3 rd, 6 th and 10 th year of the trial. The mixed samples, consisting of 5 cores/plot, were taken every 30 cm to the depth of 60 (1993), 90 (1996) and 290 (2000) cm. NH 4 -acetate + EDTA-soluble element content was determined. The scheme for vertical movement of soluble elements in soil profile as a function of time is shown in Fig. 1. The main conclusions of the study can be drawn as follows: 1. On contaminated soil with 810 kg/ha loading rates, As, Hg, Ni, Cu, Pb, Ba and Sr displayed no significant vertical movement. The movement of these elements is blocked in the soil-plant system: their accumulation in the above-ground plant parts usually remains below 5 – 10 mg/kg D. M., with the exception of Ba and Sr which showed a somewhat higher accumulation. On this soil the above elements {{do not seem to be}} dangerous contaminants either to soil, groundwater or plants. Extreme As and Hg loads, however, resulted in phytotoxicity in some plants. 2. Moderate extent of leaching occurs in the case of Zn and Cd, when they are enriched significantly. Their accumulation was moderate in the above-ground plant parts. Zn is not a dangerous pollutant either for soil, plants or groundwater at this site. Cd, however, is a very dangerous element from the human toxicological point of view and more extreme Cd loads also proved to be toxic for soil life, crops yield and quality. 3. Cr, Se, and Mo (in the form of chromate, selenate and molybdenate anions) exhibited great mobility in the soil and partly in the soil-plant system. Cr was hardly detectable in the above-ground floral parts. Its rapid leaching, however, can jeopardize groundwater quality. Se showed hyperaccumulation in all plant organs with high toxicity for all kind of crops. Mo also showed two or three orders of magnitude greater accumulation in plant parts, resulting in products <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> animal or <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> Under our experimental conditions Cr(VI), Se, Mo can be classified as dangerous contaminants, since the anion forms remained stabile for a long time in this well-aerated calcareous environment...|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{as to the}} origin of this custom. Two popular {{explanations}} for the South’s association with peas and good luck dates back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman’s march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates' food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> Southerners considered themselves lucky to be left with some supplies to help them survive the winter, and black-eyed peas evolved into a representation of good luck. In another Southern tradition, black-eyed peas was a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Years Day. Other Southern American traditions point to Jews of Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry in Southern cities and plantations.|$|E
500|$|Notorious {{for taking}} bait from fish hooks, the smooth toadfish is an {{unwanted}} catch for anglers as its flesh is highly poisonous and <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> Its lack of spines {{makes it easier}} to handle than other toadfish when it inflates itself after being caught. Its toxicity had been reported by local aborigines in Sydney to William Dawes in the late 18th century.

One man found not guilty at trial in 1669 was not released because he owed prison fees from his pre-trial confinement, a position supported by the judge, Matthew Hale. Jailers sold food or let out space for others to open shops; the Marshalsea contained several shops and small restaurants. Prisoners with no money or external support faced starvation. If the prison did supply food to its non-paying inmates, it was purchased with charitable donations—donations sometimes siphoned off by the jailers—usually bread and water {{with a small amount}} of meat, or something confiscated as <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> Jailers would load prisoners with fetters and other iron, then charge for their removal, known as [...] "easement of irons" [...] (or [...] "choice of irons"); this became known as the [...] "trade of chains".|$|E
