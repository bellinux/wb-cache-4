5|$|Nephrotic syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by blood levels of albumin below 25g/l) and if the syndrome {{is caused by the}} condition membranous nephropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease (<b>ulcerative</b> colitis and Crohn's disease) predispose to thrombosis, particularly when the disease is active. Various mechanisms have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Pet rats {{can also}} develop {{pituitary}} tumors {{if they are}} given high-calorie diets, and ringtail if they are placed in areas with low humidity or high temperatures. Staphylococcus spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly reside {{on the top of}} the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause <b>ulcerative</b> dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with <b>ulcerative</b> colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand whiting was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number of problems with diseases such as <b>ulcerative</b> dermatitis and the failure of the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these fingerlings are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory bowel {{disease is}} an {{inflammatory}} condition affecting the bowel walls, and includes the subtypes Crohn's disease and <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. While Crohn's {{can affect the}} entire gastrointestinal tract, <b>ulcerative</b> colitis {{is limited to the}} large intestine. Crohn's disease is widely regarded as an autoimmune disease. Although <b>ulcerative</b> colitis is often treated as though it were an autoimmune disease, there is no consensus that it actually is such.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ulcerative</b> colitis has a {{significant}} association with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a progressive inflammatory disorder of small and large bile ducts. As many as 5% of patients with <b>ulcerative</b> colitis may progress to develop primary sclerosing cholangitis.|$|E

25|$|Curcumin (turmeric) therapy, in {{conjunction}} with taking the medications mesalamine or sulfasalazine, may be effective and safe for maintaining remission in people with quiescent <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. The effect of curcumin therapy alone on quiescent <b>ulcerative</b> colitis is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Aggregation of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis in families.|$|E
25|$|Management of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis {{involves}} first {{treating the}} acute {{symptoms of the}} disease, then maintaining remission. <b>Ulcerative</b> colitis {{is a form of}} colitis, a disease of the intestine, specifically the large intestine or colon, that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores, in the colon. The main symptom of active disease is usually diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset which often leads to anaemia. <b>Ulcerative</b> colitis is, however, a systemic disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestine.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{megacolon}} {{is mainly}} seen in <b>ulcerative</b> colitis and pseudomembranous colitis, two chronic inflammations {{of the colon}} (and occasionally, in the other type of inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease). Its mechanism is incompletely understood. It is probably due to an excessive production of nitric oxide, at least in <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. The prevalence {{is about the same}} for both sexes.|$|E
25|$|Diet: as {{the colon}} {{is exposed to}} many dietary {{substances}} which may encourage inflammation, dietary factors have been hypothesized {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of both <b>ulcerative</b> colitis and Crohn's disease. Few studies have investigated such an association; one study showed no association of refined sugar on the prevalence of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. High intake of unsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. Other identified dietary factors that may influence the development and/or relapse of the disease include meat protein and alcoholic beverages. Specifically, sulfur has been investigated as being involved in the etiology of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis, but this is controversial. Sulfur restricted diets have been investigated in patients with UC and animal models of the disease. The theory of sulfur as an etiological factor is related to the gut microbiota and mucosal sulfide detoxification in addition to the diet.|$|E
25|$|Slow release {{phosphatidylcholine}} {{has some}} evidence of benefit in <b>ulcerative</b> colitis.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Crohn's disease, <b>ulcerative</b> colitis has {{a lesser}} {{prevalence}} in smokers than non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|One {{study of}} {{isotretinoin}} {{found a small}} increase {{in the rate of}} <b>ulcerative</b> colitis.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be used to prevent flares in those with <b>ulcerative</b> colitis.|$|E
25|$|Herbal {{medications}} {{are used}} by patients with <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. Compounds that contain sulfhydryl may have an effect in <b>ulcerative</b> colitis (under a similar hypothesis that the sulfa moiety of sulfasalazine may have activity {{in addition to the}} active 5-ASA component). One randomized control trial evaluated the over-the-counter medication S-methylmethionine and found a significant decreased rate of relapse when the medication was used in conjunction with oral sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ulcerative</b> colitis {{is marked}} by chronic bloody {{diarrhea}} and inflammation mostly affects the distal colon near the rectum.|$|E

25|$|Gram {{positive}} bacteria {{present in}} the lumen could be associated with extending the time of relapse for <b>ulcerative</b> colitis.|$|E
25|$|No direct {{causes for}} <b>ulcerative</b> colitis are known, but many {{possible}} {{factors such as}} genetics and stress play a role.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>ulcerative</b> colitis is {{a disease}} of unknown causation, inquiry should be made as to unusual factors {{believed}} to trigger the disease.|$|E
25|$|Low {{levels of}} vitamin D are {{associated}} with Crohn's disease and <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. Further studies are required to determine its significance.|$|E
25|$|Recently, use of {{methotrexate}} {{in combination}} with anti-TNF agents {{has been shown to}} be effective for the treatment of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in Nature in 2001 found high levels of anti-transglutaminase antibodies in inflammatory bowel disease - specifically in Crohn's disease and <b>ulcerative</b> colitis.|$|E
25|$|Helminthic therapy {{using the}} whipworm Trichuris suis {{has been shown}} in a {{randomized}} control trial from Iowa to show benefit in patients with <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. The therapy tests the hygiene hypothesis which argues that the absence of helminths in the colons of patients in the developed world may lead to inflammation. Both helminthic therapy and fecal bacteriotherapy induce a characteristic Th2 white cell response in the diseased areas, which was unexpected given that <b>ulcerative</b> colitis was thought to involve Th2 overproduction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ulcerative</b> colitis affects {{many parts}} of the body outside the {{intestinal}} tract. In rare cases, the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon.|$|E
25|$|Alicaforsen {{is a first}} {{generation}} antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM-1 messenger RNA through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-1. ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes (white blood cells) into inflamed tissue. Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis sufferers, where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity. This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target {{in the treatment of}} <b>ulcerative</b> colitis.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of {{the colon}} is a {{characteristic}} symptom of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis, and {{a new series of}} drugs in development looks to disrupt the inflammation process by selectively targeting an ion channel. A crucial step involved in the inflammation signaling cascade involves an intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel (IK channel) known as KCa3.1; a protein coded for in the human gene KCNN4. Ongoing research seeks to prevent T-cell activation and inflammation by inhibiting the KCa3.1 channel, selectively. Since there is an upregulation of IK channel activity during T cell activation, inhibition of the KCa3.1 is able to disrupt the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and TNF-∝. Production of these cytokines decreases because inhibition of KCa3.1 reduces the efflux of K+, which in turn diminishes the influx of Ca2+. By lowering elevated intracellular Ca2+ in patients with <b>ulcerative</b> colitis, these novel drug candidates can inhibit the signaling cascade involved in the inflammation process and help relieve many of the symptoms associated with <b>ulcerative</b> colitis.|$|E

25|$|Changes {{that can}} be seen in chronic <b>ulcerative</b> colitis include granularity, loss of the {{vascular}} pattern of the mucosa, loss of haustra, effacement of the ileocecal valve, mucosal bridging, strictures and pseudopolyps.|$|E
25|$|Another bismuth compound, {{bismuth subnitrate}} was also shown to bind with H2S. Another {{study showed that}} bismuth acted synergistically with various {{antibiotics}} to inhibit sulfate-reducing gut bacteria and sulfide production. Some authors proposed a theory that H2S {{was involved in the}} development of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis and that bismuth might be helpful in the management of this condition. However, bismuth administration in rats did not prevent them from developing <b>ulcerative</b> colitis despite reduced H2S production. Also, new evidence suggests that colonic H2S is largely present in bound forms, probably sulfides of iron and other metals. Rarely, serious bismuth toxicity may occur with higher doses.|$|E
25|$|Helminthic {{therapy is}} the use of {{intestinal}} parasitic nematodes to treat <b>ulcerative</b> colitis, and is based on the premises of the hygiene hypothesis. Studies have shown that helminths ameliorate and are more effective than daily corticosteroids at blocking chemically induced colitis in mice, and a trial of intentional helminth infection of rhesus monkeys with idiopathic chronic diarrhea (a condition similar to <b>ulcerative</b> colitis in humans) resulted in remission of symptoms in 4 out of 5 of the animals treated. A randomised controlled trial of Trichuris suis ova in humans found the therapy to be safe and effective, and further human trials are ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal causes: {{the distal}} tractus digestivus secretes {{high levels of}} magnesium. Therefore, {{secretory}} diarrhea can cause hypomagnesemia. Thus, Crohn's disease, <b>ulcerative</b> colitis, Whipple's disease and celiac sprue can all cause hypomagnesemia.|$|E
