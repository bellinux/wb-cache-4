5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Kyser's band {{continued}} to record hit records, including two featuring Jane Russell as vocalist. It's All <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> features vocals by Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore, although Kyser's {{participation in this}} recording is disputed, record label showing Axel Stordahl as conductor. Kyser had intended to retire {{following the end of}} the war, but performance and recording contracts kept him in show business for another half decade. During this time, Kyser made a cameo appearance in a Batman comic book. Kyser was first to introduce the new sonic audio process called the 'sonovox', a singing electronic voice triggered by music. The Sonovox would be used by Jingle Companies such as PAMS and JAM Creative Productions, and said jingles would be used in heavy rotation by rock radio stations such as WABC, WMEX, WXYZ, KONO, WKDA, and WHTZ.|$|E

500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected.

[...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E

500|$|The tank {{scene was}} created {{completely}} using CGI. The only actual footage {{from the scene}} was the background. A computer-generated tank, along with women, were designed on a computer. Then, special effects shots of smoke and explosions were layered {{on top of the}} vehicle to give it a more life-like appearance. Bruce Harwood, who portrayed Byers, noted that the action sequences in the episode were a challenge. He explained, [...] "It's pretty difficult on a set when the stuntmen come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and go, 'Don't worry, you'll be safe, Nothing to worry about. Okay.

500|$|Other Formula One drivers {{believed}} that Hamilton had gained an advantage. Sébastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso said that [...] "the penalty is really rough {{but in the}} end it's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to give the position back or not. Pretty straightforward". The view was reiterated by his fellow drivers Nico Rosberg and Jarno Trulli. Trulli {{believed that}} [...] "Hamilton got an advantage by cutting the chicane", saying, [...] "Had he stayed on the road, he wouldn't have had the speed to overtake the Ferrari. In the same way at Monza someone could cut the first chicane, catch a rival's draft, and overtake him under braking at Roggia".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Montana {{entering}} Lilly Truscott's, portrayed by Emily Osment, Sweet sixteen at the Santa Monica Pier.

[...] Then Truscott (Osment) says, [...] "You will never make this up to me." [...] Montana is being overwhelmed by fans, which proceed to lift her to a stage and perform the song. Throughout most of the video Cyrus' character performs the song with background dancers, a band, and Steve Rushton on the electric guitar. In the conclusion, Rico Suave, portrayed by Moises Arias, emerges from a massive birthday cake that explodes on the crowd.|$|E

In 1987, the follow-up Barmy was published, featuring sketches entirely collated from As Seen On TV. Barmy features a Margery and Joan sketch specially written as {{an introduction to the}} book, where they review forthcoming novels. Also exclusive to this book are two sketches cut from the original broadcast, 'Lady Police Serial', a parody of the long-running Juliet Bravo, where Wood as Juliet chats to her Desk Sergeant Wilberforce. Also, 'Craft Shop', where the owner (Rosalind March) tries to tempt her customer (Celia Imrie) with the likes of [...] "Ukrainian Prayer Shawls, woven by the mothers of Russian dissidents whilst in a state of euphoria, which doesn't happen very often which is why we've only got three." ...|$|E

Nelson went on stating that [...] "it's tracks like the aforementioned 'Wash All Over Me' [...] that showcase the megastar's vulnerable, relatable side". Brad Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, commented that [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] was [...] "very Confessions-esque", further calling it [...] "a truly curious concoction of sound". In response to a fan of the singer, Stern agreed that it was [...] "fabulous and very emotional", and opined that [...] "the lyrics are much more intriguing than, say, taking shots of Tanqueray like a girl gone wild." [...] Nouses Jack Elliott applauded [...] "Wash All Over Me", describing it as [...] "a lyrically powerful, yet vulnerable ending to the album that could be interpreted as a track celebrating triumph or defeat. It is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to interpret it as you wish." ...|$|E

[...] Vitti has said Meyer's [...] "fingerprints are on nearly every script" [...] and he [...] "exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without {{being one of the}} creators," [...] while recounting how [...] "a show that you have the writer's credit for will run, and the next day people will come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and tell you how great it was.

[...] Bill Oakley noted Meyer has [...] "he's been there since the beginning adding thousands of jokes and plot twists, etc., that everyone considers classic and brilliant.|$|E

500|$|In the chorus, Knowles gives {{listeners}} {{a flashback}} to her friskier days and {{admits that she}} is certified neither as a teacher, a preacher nor a doctor, but is willing to perform their various duties regardless. She also sings, [...] "I'm great at writing physical love letters", and [...] "I'm a freak, all day all night". After asking, [...] "Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?", Knowles echoes, [...] "Oh oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh".

500|$|Howe favoured {{as quick}} a {{transition}} to a peacetime economy as possible. Most industries in which there were not shortages were released from government controls in late 1945. Labour leaders, fearing unemployment, wanted to keep wartime government plants in production; Howe opposed such proposals. When union members who were laid off from the Research Enterprises Limited (R.E.L.) confronted Howe on a golf course, the minister stated, [...] "R.E.L. was a war-time plant. The war is through, the plant is through, and your union... what happens to your union is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Get the hell off of the course." [...] In disposing of redundant government property, Howe found that saddles and harnesses had been stored {{since the end of}} the Boer War and men had been employed to safeguard and polish them for over 40 years. He strove to eliminate such anachronisms. [...] However, Howe was slower to release economic controls. According to Roberts, [...] "although he worked to return the country's economic power to private hands, he often seemed as loath to surrender his own dictatorial powers over it as he was to submit to Parliament". [...] In November 1945, Howe's wartime portfolio was merged into his new responsibility to form the Department of Reconstruction and Supply.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{became known}} for his [...] "frightening" [...] {{tendency}} to not [...] "mince words". The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene {{in order to get}} the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something [...] "boring" [...] if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled the director would [...] "always come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and say something unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to [...] "look so old." [...] She also commented, however, that [...] "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail." [...] Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice t'ai chi to [...] "help her relax [...] make her do things simpler." [...] Other actors soon joined them in meditating – according to Doran, it [...] "was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [...] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of." [...] He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him in order to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.|$|E

500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Reed of Paste Magazine {{called it}} [...] "a driving pop anthem that moves from a punchy, 'Roxanne'-esque new-wave groove to a soulful, synth-driven chorus." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters further {{explained}} the track, writing, [...] "It starts out like an early Police single, with some straight-up Reggatta de Blanc syncopation and a shockingly good Sting vocal impression. But the chorus opens up {{to turn into}} something less Police-y and more, dare I say it, Bruno Mars-y." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that the song [...] "channels the Police, but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson. It's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels." [...] Jason Lipshut of Billboard gave a very positive review, stating that [...] "'Locked out of Heaven' is Mars' best solo single to date, with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act. Sometimes, the perfect lead single is hard to find; other times, it walks right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and delivers a big, cozy hug." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix praised [...] "Mars' singing and the catchy little background vocals," [...] which according to her, [...] "keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace." [...] She also noted that [...] "Even clumsy lyrics like 'your sex takes me to paradise' can’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring." ...|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
