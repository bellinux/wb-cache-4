Biological sabotage—in the form of anthrax and glanders—was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Imperial German government during World War I, with indifferent results.

The Turkish, Mongolian, and Korean bows were standardized when archery lost its military function and became a popular sport. Recent Turkish bows are optimized for flight shooting.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} thick outer peridium, Mycenastrum corium puffballs can {{withstand}} hard blows without breaking, and children have <b>used</b> <b>them</b> as replacements for balls. The puffballs {{have also been}} used medicinally in Mexico as a hemostatic, as a throat and lung tonic, and for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E

5|$|Queen conch shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E

50|$|Today, 3D {{models are}} used {{in a wide variety}} of fields.

The movie industry <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> as characters and objects for animated and real-life motion pictures. The video game industry <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> as assets for computer and video games. The science sector <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> as highly detailed models of chemical compounds. The architecture industry <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> to demonstrate proposed buildings and landscapes in lieu of traditional, physical architectural models. The engineering community <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> as designs of new devices, vehicles and structures as well as a host of other uses. In recent decades the earth science community has started to construct 3D geological models as a standard practice. 3D models can also be the basis for physical devices that are built with 3D printers or CNC machines.|$|R

5|$|The station had a news cinema (later {{a cartoon}} cinema) {{that showed a}} {{continuous}} programme.

5|$|They soon {{reverted to}} state ownership. The Colorado Highway Commission <b>used</b> <b>them</b> to realize plans {{it had made}} a decade earlier, when it first {{designated}} the future Highway 82 through the Roaring Fork Valley.

5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have <b>used</b> <b>them</b> to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|A fire {{destroyed}} part of {{the monastery}} during the War of the Spanish Succession. During the Peninsular War, French troops looted the buildings and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> as barracks. The monks were forced to leave in 1820 because of confiscations by a new liberal government, but they returned in 1823 after King Ferdinand VII restored conservative institutions. However, the nearby villagers denied support to the monastery despite its protection by the king. The monastery ceased to operate in 1835: the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal enforced a law declaring that minor religious holdings housing fewer than 12 residents were to be forfeit to the state; the monastery had only four monks and one lay brother, who were cast out.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{continued}} to freelance, submitting humor columns {{to a variety}} of publications, including Life (where fellow humorist James Thurber stated that Benchley's columns were the only reason the magazine was read). He continued meeting with his friends at the Algonquin, and the group became popularly known as the Algonquin Round Table. In April 1920, Benchley landed a position with Life writing theatre reviews, which he would continue doing regularly through 1929, eventually taking complete control of the drama section. His reviews were known for their flair, and he often <b>used</b> <b>them</b> as a soapbox for issues of concern to him, whether petty (people who cough during plays) or more important (such as racial intolerance).|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives. In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents <b>used</b> <b>them</b> to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.|$|E
5|$|Dubnium {{does not}} occur {{naturally}} on Earth and is produced artificially.

The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, resulting in credit for discovery being officially shared between both teams.
