40|$|Three {{profiles}} of 226 Ra in the meromictic Dead Sea measured during 1963 - 1978 {{indicate that the}} radium activities in the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> were {{higher than in the}} lower water mass. All three profiles indicate a similar radium inventory. The Jordan inflow is not the primary source of radium to the Dead Sea. Mineral springs and submerged seepages are probably more important contrib-utors. The age of the meromictic structure is estimated by a model which requires that the radium inventory of the lake be at a steady state, that sometime in the past the radium profile of the lake had been uniform (when either the lake was monomictic or an overturn had ended an earlier meromictic phase) and that the contemporaneous {{profiles of}} radium have been built up by inflows of radium solely into the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>mass,</b> while the monimolimnion is relict, isolated, and loses radium only by radioactive decay. Supporting evidence is presented suggesting that the above conditions may be fulfilled. Thus, it is possible to estimate that the Dead Sea was meromictic for about 300 years before the turnover in 1979. From tentative balances of the Dead Sea dissolved salts it is shown that a previous overtur...|$|E

40|$|The {{abundance}} of salmon lice in the Hardangerfjord is potentially {{large enough to}} be a threat to the wild fish stocks of the fjord. The salmon louse spends a period of 2 – 4 weeks in its planktonic stages drifting in the current of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> of the fjord looking for suitable hosts on which to settle. It is important to assess the abundance and distribution of the lice in their planktonic phases in order to evaluate the infection pressure they represent to the wild fish. The current system of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> in the Hardangerfjord is highly variable and consists of a multitude of components. This implicates a similar variability of the salmon lice dispersion. We find the most efficient transport mechanism for planktonic salmon lice to be from internal pressure due to lateral variations of the <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> density. From current observations we find large water exchanges of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> in the fjord lasting for several days, approximately monthly. Numerical model results indicate that these exchange episodes extend for the whole length of the fjord. Hence, the salmon lice will be regularly transported several tens of kilometres. We find the influence area of salmon lice from a source to be potentially large as a small number of lice can cover large areas. However, the majority of the lice will stay relatively close to the source but not necessarily with the highest abundance in the source area. We also find aggregations of lice in certain areas, typically close to land and in bays...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{reorganization}} of the ocean circulation in the Atlantic Ocean {{has been linked to}} widespread varations in climate on both millennial and glacial-interglacial timescales. The response of the tropical Atlantic upper ocean to such circulation changes, has been investigated in both proxy studies and modelling experiments. It is believed that reduction of the thermohaline overturning leads to decreased cross-equatorial northward transport of warm surface waters. Consequently, heat accumulates in the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column of the tropical Atlantic. In this thesis, temperature variability within the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> of the western tropical Atlantic is investigated in six timeslices associated with different modes of overturning circulation. The timeslices represent the Last Glacial Maximum, Heinrich event 1, Bølling-Allerød, the Younger Dryas and the early and late Holocene. Changes in the thermal stratification of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column are inferred from stable oxygen isotope- and Mg/Ca measurements on five species of planktonic foraminfera that live vertically dispersed in the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses.</b> The proxy measurements provide evidence that more heat was stored in western tropical Atlantic waters during the Last Glacial Maximum when the thermohaline overturning was reduced. Heat was released in the present interglacial, which is associated with vigorous overturning. Concomitant to reductions in the overturning circulation, centred on the deglaciation, possible evidence is given that heat accumulated in the <b>upper</b> tropical <b>water</b> <b>masses.</b> However, on this scale, the results are not conclusive, and further investigation is needed...|$|R

We therefore studied the vertical and horizontal distribution patterns of T. heimii in the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column (0 - 200 m) along three transects: an inshore-offshore gradient off Cape Blanc (CB), a south-north transect from CB to the Portuguese coast and a north-south transect off Tanzania. We compared concentrations of living cysts (cells with cell content) with chlorophyll-a, salinity and temperature measurements at the sampling depth. In order to explore the seasonal variability in cyst production, three transect off CB were sampled at three different times of the year. Living T. heimii cysts were found in the upper 160 m of the water column with highest concentrations in the photic zone indicating that the calcification of T. heimii occurs in {{the upper part of the}} water column. Maximal abundances of living cysts were found relatively often in or just above the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), the depth of which varies regionally from about 20 - 40 m off CB to about 80 m off Tanzania and along the transect from CB to the Portuguese Coast. However, there was no significant correlation at the 95 % confidence level between the cyst concentrations and temperature, salinity and chlorophyll-a concentrations at the sampling depths observed. In both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, the highest abundances of T. heimii were observed in regions where the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> contained relatively low nutrient concentrations that are influenced only sporadically, or not at all, by enhanced photic zone mixing related to the presence of upwelling cells or river outflow plumes at or close to the sampling sites.

These microorganisms are often adapted to specific chemo-physical milieus and can thus be excellently studied in the Black Sea with its oxic <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> being constantly separated from the anoxic methane-rich water body below. By using a highly sensitive LC-MS method we studied the distribution and relative concentration of bacteriohopanepolyols (BHP) in the suspended matter sampled at different water depths. In the photic zone we found high concentrations of a 2 -methyl BHP pointing to a cyanobacterial source (Summons et al., 1999). Below the light-penetrated zone, in the transition between oxic and anoxic waters (~ 120 m water depth), concentrations of BHPs specific for methanotrophic bacteria clearly increase (Blumenberg et al., 2007). These BHPs include mainly hopanoids with amino functionalities and a 3 -methyl BHP.

The data set consists of over 2100 data from recent sediment with thorough age control, that have been checked for internal consistency. We further examine how the oxygen isotopic composition of fossil foraminifera is related to hydrological conditions, based on published results on living foraminifera from plankton tows and cultures. Oxygen isotopic values (delta 18 O) of MARGO recent fossil foraminifera are 0. 2 - 0. 8 per mil {{higher than those of}} living foraminifera. Our results show that this discrepancy is related to the stratification of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> and generally increases at low latitudes. Therefore, as stratification of surface waters and seasonality depends on climatic conditions, the relationship between temperature and delta 18 O established on fossil foraminifera from recent sediment must be used with caution in paleoceanographic studies. Before models predicting seasonal flux, abundance and delta 18 O composition of a foraminiferal population in the sediment are available, we recommend studying relative changes in isotopic composition of fossil planktonic foraminifera. These changes primarily record variations in temperature and oxygen isotopic composition of sea water, although part of the changes might reflect modifications of planktonic foraminifera seasonality or depth habita...|$|E
40|$|Mg/Ca ratio {{measurements}} {{have been}} produced from IMAGES piston core MD 99 - 2251 using two species of planktonic foraminifera: the surface dwelling Globigerina bulloides and the thermocline dwelling Globorotalia inflata. Holocene Mg/Ca values for G. bulloides are higher and more variable (1. 8 – 3. 0 mmol/mol), with lower Mg/Ca ratios of 1. 1 – 1. 9 mmol/mol recorded for G. inflata. At no time do the thermocline Mg/Ca ratios exceed those of the surface. Comparison of the Mg/Ca records reveals a complex evolution of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> characteristics through the Holocene. The early Holocene exhibits far less distinction between surface and thermocline ratios and the Mg/Ca calibration derived temperatures in the upper water column, with the 0. 4 mmol/mol offset equivalent to a temperature difference of 1 – 2 °C. Mg/Ca ratios diverge from early to mid Holocene and despite the increase in G. inflata ratios from ~ 6. 5 ka onwards, the much more marked increase in G. bulloides after ~ 4 ka results in a clear separation of the surface and thermocline records {{for the remainder of}} the Holocene. Despite the long term increase in thermal contrast between surface and subsurface waters, there is a clear correlation between short-lived events evident in both of the Mg/Ca records, reflecting multi-decadal to centennial scale temperature fluctuations. Coolings at ~ 9 and 8. 2 ka are well represented in both records, as too are further warm–cold fluctuations at ~ 5. 5, 1. 5 and 0. 8 ka. This indicates that these rapid climate events had a common forcing that was recorded throughout the upper water column. Comparisons with the GISP 2 glacio-chemical indicators of atmospheric circulation suggest that the enhanced intensity of the atmospheric circulation during the early Holocene (11 – 10 ka) probably explain the reduced surface thermal stratification indicated by the Mg/Ca data...|$|E

Terrestrial climate conditions are reconstructed from pollen assemblages, whereas sea-surface temperature and salinity conditions are estimated from dinocyst assemblages and foraminiferal data (both assemblages and stable isotope composition of carbonate shells). LIO data from the eastern Canadian Arctic and northern Labrador Sea led to reconstruct much higher summer air temperature and seasurface temperature than at present by about 5 °C. Data from southeastern Canada and southern Labrador Sea also suggest more thermophilic vegetation and warmer conditions although the contrast between LIO and the Holocene is of lesser amplitude.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of enhanced oceanic heat transfer into the Arctic concomitant {{with the rapid}} sea-ice decrease temptingly suggest a direct relationship between both features. However, except for marginal areas of the Arctic Ocean where warm and saline Atlantic Water (AW) reaches the surface, the majority of AW heat is presently isolated from the sea-ice cover by a cold and fresh halocline layer. No evidence {{has been found to}} suggest a weakening of the halocline across the central Arctic basins that would enhance the AW heat transfer to the surface. A more direct link between sea-ice reduction and AW inflow is, however, seen in the inflowing Barents Sea branch in both historical and observational time series. In this presentation the AW advection into the Arctic Ocean and its influence on sea-ice variability will be reviewed from a geological point of view. Records from the geologic past are of great value as the time span of modern observations and historical data is often too short to comprehend long-term trends and causes of AW variability, changes in the marginal ice zone, and the vertical structure of the Arctic water column. Paleoceanographic studies from the recent interglacial indirectly suggest that the strength of AW advection and its propagation into the Arctic interior is effective in melting sea ice in combination with other factors such as insolation, sea level, freshwater input, and <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> stratification. However, to date, very little paleoceanographic work in the Arctic has focused on how the strength and position of the halocline has changed during previous interglacial periods.

40|$|The {{extent of}} the general warming related to {{increasing}} anthropogenic CO 2 emission andits implications for the global climate system are currently under heavy debate. In particular theextrapolation of long term climatic trends relies on complex climate models for the interactionbetween the atmosphere, the oceans and the land surface. In turn these models require validationbased on continuous time series of observational data. However, instrumental based data recordsonly extend {{as far back as}} approximately 150 years and thus make the validation of long-termmodelling experiments difficult. To obtain information on past climate beyond the instrumentalperiod, so-called paleoceanographic proxies are used. Two of the most targeted paleoceanographicparameters are the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity, which determine waterdensity. While past ocean temperatures can be reconstructed relatively accurately from variousindependent methods, the accurate reconstruction of past ocean salinity has proven to bemore difficult. A promising new method for the reconstruction of past ocean salinity has beensuggested to come from the hydrogen isotope composition of long chain alkenones (dDalkenone) derived from marine haptophyte algae. Culture studies have shown a strong correlation betweenhydrogen isotope fractionation and salinity, with decreasing fractionation with increasing salinity. In order to test the applicability of the dDalkenone as a salinity proxy, this thesis presents studies onsedimentary records obtained from various open ocean settings including the greater AgulhasSystem south of the African continent, the Eastern Tropical Atlantic and the Atlantic sector ofthe Southern Ocean, as well as coastal ocean margin settings in the Mozambique Channel andoffshore Southeast Australia. The dDalkenone from two sediment records located in the Agulhas Leakage area, covering thelast two glacial terminations, showed substantial hydrogen isotopic shifts from more D-enrichedalkenones during the glacial towards relatively more D-depleted alkenones during the interglacials. This pattern was in good agreement with planktonic foraminiferal based sea water oxygen isotope(d 18 Osw) records, suggesting a glacial-interglacial freshening in the Agulhas leakage area. Thistrend could be explained by the generally weaker Agulhas Leakage during glacial periods as aresponse to changing wind field stress, the expansion of sea ice and the northward displacementof the subtropical fronts. As a result, the transport of Indian Ocean water into the Atlantic waslikely less efficient and a potentially increased back transport of the Indian Ocean water occurredvia the Agulhas Return Current, possibly leading to more saline conditions during glacials andsubsequent freshening during the glacial terminations. Application of the dDalkenone salinity proxy in the upstream region of the Agulhas Currentprovided evidence that <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> salinities in the Agulhas leakage signal might have beencontrolled by upstream dynamics in the southern Agulhas Current without a significant change inthe actual Agulhas leakage into the South Atlantic. Instead, more saline southern Agulhas Currentwaters were potentially propagated to the Agulhas Leakage area during glacial termination periodsimplying that periods of higher salinity in the source region did not necessarily entail a greaterfraction of Indian Ocean water entering the South Atlantic Ocean, as initially inferred from thesalinity proxy records in the Agulhas Leakage area. Summary 128 A comparison of the hydrogen isotope fractionation factor aalkenone-sw with d 18 Oswreconstructions in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean showed similar patterns, suggesting bothproxy records reflected salinity. Differences were observed for the period between marine isotopestage (MIS) 5 - MIS 2 where d 18 Osw reconstructions showed only little variation, while aalkenone-swindicated more pronounced variability. This is potentially related to variability in growth rate of thealkenone producers. However, a comparison of the dDalkenone record with d 18 Osw reconstructionsfrom the western subtropical Atlantic showed a fairly good agreement during this time period,suggesting that changes in salinity occurred basin-wide in the tropical Atlantic. The relativelygood agreement of the dDalkenone with the carbon isotope record of benthic foraminifera suggest aconnection between AMOC strength variability and relative salinity shifts during MIS 5 and MIS 6 as well as during MIS 3 and MIS 4 at the core site. The dDalkenone was used to trace allochthonous input of alkenones in the Atlantic Sector of theSouthern Ocean. Here, SSTs reconstructed using the distribution of alkenones indicate a relativelywarm glacial, in contrast to distinctively cold glacial SST conditions indicated temperature recordsbased upon planktonic foraminiferal d 18 O values and distribution of Thaumarchaeotal lipids. Theobserved shift towards more negative values in dDalkenone during the glacial – interglacial transitionwas only slightly higher than expected based on global ice volume changes. This suggests thatindeed the alkenones might have been allochtonous and synthesized in warmer water masses withsimilar or slightly higher salinity during the glacial and transported to the core site. A 39 kyr record of dDalkenone values obtained from the Eastern African continental shelfin the Mozambique Channel showed, in contrast to open ocean records, no clear glacial –interglacial trend. In contrast to present day, the core site was in closer proximity to the continentduring glacial sea level low stand, resulting in a much larger effect of freshwater run off. Theseconditions probably led to relatively low salinity and therefore an increased isotopic fractionationof hydrogen during alkenone biosynthesis, resulting in the apparent lack of glacial-interglacialtrend in the dDalkenone record. On top of that a positive correlation between dDalkenone and valuesfor the branched isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index, a proxy for the input of soil organic matter, isobserved during the glacial period. This possibly indicated an increasing contribution to alkenoneproduction by coastal haptophyte species, which is supported by elevated ratios of C 37 /C 38 alkenones. In contrast, a coastal marine 135 kyr dDalkenone record off the continental shelf of SouthAustralia in front of the River Murray did show a strong glacial – interglacial pattern, in goodagreement with a planktonic foraminiferal d 18 O record. Despite increased terrestrial influence, asinferred from elevated BIT values, during sea level low stands via the Murray river, records ofalkenone accumulation rate and the alkenone C 37 /C 38 ratio suggested that species compositionor growth rate changes in the haptophyte producers did not substantially affect the dDalkenonevariability in this record. This suggests that dDalkenone record at this core site was influenced byfreshwater runoff to a lesser extent than that in the Mozambique Channel. In general, the glacialperiods (i. e. late MIS 6, MIS 4 and MIS 2) were marked by more D-enriched alkenones compared tointerglacial periods, indicating a freshening during glacial terminations. This input of low salinitywater is likely derived from the southwards flowing Leeuwin Current, which was elevated duringdeglaciations and interglacials. Summary 129 In summary, results described in this thesis have shown that the hydrogen isotope fractionationas reflected in long chain alkenones is a promising proxy for assessing changes in past ocean salinity. Multi-millennial sediment records of dDalkenone generally agreed well with planktonic foraminiferad 18 O records from open ocean and near coastal settings. Estimation of absolute salinity shifts,based on culture derived salinity aalkenone-sw relationships also corresponded reasonably well withestimations based on planktonic foraminifera d 18 Osw reconstructions. However, using aalkenone-swfor calculating absolute salinities requires an estimation of the hydrogen isotope composition ofthe past ocean, which results in larger uncertainties. This problem may be resolved in the futureby using multiple relationships of a for different compounds, e. g. sterols...|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays {{a central}} role in the northward {{distribution}} of heat. It is a key mechanism in the climatic system that needs to be further understood. Most studies focused on surface or deep water conditions. Relatively little is known about the role of subsurface, thermocline and intermediate waters, where heat uptake and/or transport occur. Our aim is to give a better representation of the hydrography during the past by reconstructing the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column from surface to intermediate waters. Understanding of how changes in the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> properties is crucial for determining the role of oceanic heat distribution involved in the AMOC and is the main objective of this PhD project. The Western Tropical Atlantic is a sensitive oceanic region connected with surface and intermediate waters that flow from the Southern Hemisphere into the North Atlantic and a deep <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> from the Northern Hemisphere. This region is unique in identifying the upper limb pathway of the AMOC and associated <b>water</b> <b>masses.</b> In this context, using sediment cores from depth transects is therefore crucial for estimating not only the magnitude of change but, particularly the orientation of <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> distribution change. Seven coring sites have been retrieved that fall along a depth transect extending from 600 to 1000 m water depth. Main strategy is to use different planktonic species having different depth habitat to reconstruct the upper surface to about 200 - 400 m water depth, and furthermore benthic species from depth of the coring sites to reconstruct <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> changes further below to 1000 m. The PhD project has two major objectives. The first is to calibrate and validate relationship between Mg/Ca ratio and temperature in benthic foraminiferal shells. Mg/Ca ratio in several benthic foraminifer species from core-tops were analysed to develop Mg/Ca calibrations over the 0 - 6 degrees Celsius temperature range in the Atlantic Ocean (Paper I). Apart from temperature, other factors may exert additional influences on foraminiferal Mg/Ca. For that purpose, the effect of the seawater carbonate chemistry on the magnesium incorporation into the foraminiferal calcite have been investigated for the benthic foraminifer species Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi (Paper II). In the second part of this project, we have applied the improved C. wuellerstorfi Mg/Ca-temperature calibration to examined surface, subsurface, thermocline and intermediate water conditions during the last deglaciation. Combining with water densities estimates and ventilation ages, we are trying to bring important insights on discerning sources of subsurface and intermediate waters (Paper III). This PhD work introduces a relatively new concept of investigating the hydrology along a core section in the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column. Looking to the future, we recommend a parallel strategy of applying proxies with refinements in methods and understanding of mechanisms that control the proxy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Past sea-surface {{conditions}} {{over the}} northern North Atlantic {{during the last}} glacial maximum were examined {{from the study of}} 61 deep-sea cores. The last glacial maximum time slice studied here corresponds to an interval between Heinrich layers H 2 and H 1, and spanning about 20 - 16 ka on a 14 C time scale. Transfer functions based on dinocyst assemblages were used to reconstruct sea-surface temperature, salinity, and sea-ice cover. The results illustrate extensive sea-ice cover along the eastern Canadian margins and sea-ice spreading, only during winter, over most of the northern North Atlantic. On the whole, much colder winter prevailed, despite relatively mild conditions in August (10 - 15 °C at most offshore sites), thus suggesting a larger seasonal contrast of temperatures than today. Lower salinity than at present is reconstructed, especially along the eastern Canadian and Scandinavian margins, likely because of meltwater supply from the surrounding ice sheets. These reconstructions contrast with those established by CLIMAP on the basis of planktonic foraminifera. These differences are discussed with reference to the stratigraphical frame of the last glacial maximum, which was not the coldest phase of the last glacial stage. The respective significance of dinocyst and foraminifer records is also examined in terms of the thermohaline characteristics of surface waters and the vertical structure of <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses,</b> which was apparently much more stratified than at present in the northern North Atlantic, thus preventing deep-water formation...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of stable isotope records and Mg/Ca temperature estimates of four different planktonic foraminiferal species from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1241 allows differentiation between temperature and salinity {{changes in the}} tropical east Pacific (TEP) <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column during the Pliocene (~ 5. 7 - 2. 1 Ma). The deviation of d 18 O records and Mg/Ca temperature estimates from thermocline-dwelling planktonic foraminifers suggests that local changes in salinity exerted a much stronger control on Pliocene TEP <b>upper</b> ocean <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> signatures than previously assumed. The most pronounced Pliocene change in TEP upper ocean stratification was the shoaling of the thermocline from ~ 4. 8 to 4. 0 Ma that was possibly triggered by changes in the configuration of low-latitude ocean gateways. During this time interval, mixed-layer temperatures and salinities remained relatively constant {{in contrast to a}} pronounced temperature (~ 6 °C) and salinity decrease {{at the bottom of the}} photic zone. This change led to a new state in the thermal structure of the TEP, as the thermocline remained relatively shallow until ~ 2. 1 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} of two species (or groups of species) of planktonic foraminifers: Globigerinoides ruber (or G. obliquus and G. obliquus extremus) and Globigerina bulloides (or G. falconensis and G. obesa) from ODP Hole 653 A and Site 654 in the Tyrrhenian basin, records the Pliocene-Pleistocene glacial {{history of the}} Northern Hemisphere. The overall increase in mean d 18 O values through the interval 4. 6 - 0. 08 Ma is 1. 7 per mil for G. bulloides and 1. 5 per mil for G. ruber. The time interval 3. 1 - 2. 5 Ma corresponds to an important phase of 18 O enrichment for planktonic foraminifers. In this interval, glacial d 18 O values of both species G. bulloides and G. ruber increase by about l per mil, this increase being more progressive for G. ruber than for G. bulloides. The increase of interglacial d 18 O values is higher for G. bulloides (1. 5 per mil) than for the Gruber group (1 per mil). These data suggest a more pronounced seasonal stratification of the <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> during interglacial phases. Large positive d 18 O fluctuations of increasing magnitude are also recorded at 2. 25 and 2. 15 Ma by G bulloides and appear to be diachronous with those of Site 606 in the Atlantic Ocean. Other events of increasing d 18 O values are recorded between 1. 55 and 1. 3 Ma, at 0. 9 Ma, 0. 8 Ma, and near 0. 34 Ma. In the early Pliocene the d 18 O variability recorded by the planktonic species G. bulloides was higher in the Mediterranean than in the Atlantic at the same latitude. This suggests that important cyclic variations in the water budget of the Mediterranean occurred since that time. Step increases in the d 18 O variability are synchronous {{with those of the}} open ocean at 0. 9 and 0. 34 Ma. The higher variability as well as the higher amplitude of the peaks of 18 O enrichment may be partly accounted for by increase of dryness over the Mediterranean area. In particular the high amplitude d 18 O fluctuations recorded between 3. 1 and 2. 1 Ma are correlated with the onset of a marked seasonal contrast and a summer dryness, revealed by pollen analyses. Strong fluctuations towards d 13 C values higher than modern ones are recorded by the G. ruber group species before 1. 7 Ma and suggest a high production of phytoplankton. When such episodes of high primary production are correlated with episodes of decreasing 13 C content of G. bulloides, they are interpreted as the consequence of a higher stratification of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> resulting itself from a marked seasonality. Such episodes occur between 4. 6 and 4. 05 Ma, 3. 9 and 3. 6 Ma, and 3. 25 and 2. 66 Ma. The interval 2. 66 - 1. 65 Ma corresponds to a weakening of the stratification of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> layers. This may be related to episodes of cooling and increasing dryness induced by the Northern Hemisphere Glaciations. The Pleistocene may have been a less productive period. The transition from highly productive to less productive surface waters also coincides with a new step increase in dryness and cooling, between 1. 5 and 1. 3 Ma. The comparison of the 13 C records of G ruber and G. bulloides in fact suggests that a high vertical convection became a dominant feature after 2. 6 Ma. Increases in the nutrient input and the stratification of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> may be suspected, however, during short episodes near 0. 86 Ma (isotopic stage 25), 0. 57 - 0. 59 Ma (isotopic stage 16), 0. 49 Ma (isotopic stage 13), 0. 4 - 0. 43 Ma (isotopic stage 11), and 0. 22 and 0. 26 Ma (part of isotopic stage 7 and transition 7 / 8).

40|$|Individual planktonic {{microfossil}} species, or assemblage {{groups of}} different species, {{are often used}} to, qualitatively and/or quantitatively, reconstruct past (sub) surface-water conditions of the world's oceans and seas. Until now, little information has been available on the surface sediment distribution patterns and paleoenvironmental reconstruction potential of coccolith, calcareous dinoflagellate cyst and organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst assemblages of the South and equatorial Atlantic, especially at the species level. This paper (i) summarizes the distributions of these three phytoplanktonic microfossil groups in numerous Atlantic surface sediments from 20 °N- 50 °S and 30 °E- 65 °W and determines {{their relationship with the}} physicochemical and trophic conditions of the overlying (sub) surface-waters, and (ii) determines the synecology of the three phytoplankton groups by carrying out statistical analyses (i. e. detrended and canonical correspondence analyses) on all groups simultaneously. Ecological relationships are additionally strengthened by statistically comparing the distribution patterns of the phytoplankton groups with those of planktonic foraminifera (Pflaumann et al. 1996; Niebler et al. 1998), as the ecological preferences of the latter are much better known. Many of the analyzed phytoplanktonic microfossil species or groups of species in the surface sediments do show restricted distributions which primarily reflect the environmental conditions of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> above them (e. g. sea-surface temperature, productivity, stratification). The acquired 'reference' data sets are large and diverse enough to allow future development of transfer functions for the reconstruction of past surface-water conditions, and show that there is still an enormous paleoenvironmental reconstruction potential concealed in many fossil coccolith and dinoflagellate cyst assemblages...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{samples from}} ODP Site 1085 were {{investigated}} {{in order to}} obtain more information on the initiation and development of the Benguela upwelling system during the middle and upper Miocene. In particular, our intent was to establish the causes of the upwelling as well as the response of the upwelling regime {{to the development of the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Based on changes in the calcareous dinoflagellate cyst association, we found an initial increase of the dinoflagellate cyst productivity, probably related to the initiation of upwelling about 11. 8 Ma ago. Two distinct increases in cyst productivity in conjunction with temperature decreases of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> reflect upwelling pulses off Namibia and occur at the end of the Miocene cooling events Mi 5 (about 11. 5 Ma) and Mi 6 (about 10. 5 Ma). Both cooling events are associated with an ice volume increase in Antarctica and are thought to have led to an increase in southeasterly winds, possibly causing these two upwelling pulses. We demonstrate a decrease in dinoflagellate cyst productivity and enhanced terrigenous input via the Orange River after the Mi 5 event. At about 11. 1 Ma, the dinoflagellate cyst productivity increases again. The polar cyst species Caracomia arctica occurs here for the first time. This implies an influence of subantarctic mode water and therefore a change in the quality of the upwelling water which allowed the Benguela upwelling to develop into modern conditions. From about 10. 4 Ma, C. arctica forms a permanent part of the association, pointing to an establishment of the upwelling regime...|$|R

In this paper, the distribution, migration, and spawning grounds of the adult Alaska pollack in the spawning season during August 1973 through July 1974 have been examined and is reported. The spawning season marked by the maturation stage of the gonad in the Alaska pollack lasted during January to March in 1974. The shoal migrated toward the shallow parts with the progress of maturation of their gonads; they stayed {{at the front of the}} cold <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> near the 100 meter depth. The cold <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> in the shallow parts was caused by the cooling in winter and by the <b>upper</b> layer <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> of the Oyashio current, 1974. The spawning grounds of the Alaska pollack varied with the intensity of cooling in winter and with the <b>upper</b> layer cold <b>water</b> <b>mass</b> of the Oyashio current. In 1954, the main spawning grounds were reported to be inside the Funka Bay, when the sea water temperature of the shallow parts in this region was high, but in 1974 when the sea water temperature of the shallow parts is low, its grounds were at the entrance of the Bay near the 100 - 120 meter depth. The sex ratio of the fish in the spawning season varied at each station. The male fish remained for a long time in the spawning grounds, but the female fish migrated to the deep sea areas once spawning was over. Because there were more male fish than female fish at the spawning grounds, the female fish predominated at the feeding groounds in the deep sea areas. 1. 1973 年 8 月から 1974 年 7 月に噴火湾周辺海域において底刺網による漁獲試験，魚探の利用，スケトウダラ卵の採集，海洋観測等を行い，産卵期を中心としたスケトウダラの分布回遊を明らかにした。 2. 生殖巣の成熟Stageからみた 1974 年の産卵期は 1 月から 3 月であつた。 3. 魚群は生殖巣の成熟に連れて，索餌期に棲息していた水深 300 m付近の餌生物が多い親潮系底層水域から浅海域に産卵のため回遊し，表層からの冬期冷却と寒冷な親潮系表層水の影響によつて 100 m付近に発生した冷水前線に停滞した。 4. 産卵場は冬期間の冷却と親潮系表層冷水塊の強さによって変化する。中心部は浅海域の水温が高かつた 1954 年には噴火湾の内部にみられたが，水温が低かつた 1974 年には湾ロ部の水深 100 ～ 120 m付近に形成された。 5. スケトウダラ卵の水平分布密度は魚探反応による魚群密度とほぼ一致している。しかし地球岬付近では噴火湾口部で産み出された卵が親潮系表層水によって噴火湾内に移送されており，卵の水平分布から産卵場を推定する場合には産卵群の分布や海流を考慮することが必要である。 6. 産卵期における性比は各地点によって変化している。雄は産卵場に長く留まるが，雌は産卵を終えると深海域に回避する。したがつて産卵場においては雄が雌より多く，深海域の索餌場では雌が卓越している...|$|R

The evolution of these two distinct hydrographic systems is compared for the last 160 kyr. Correspondence and cluster analyses are performed on combined radiolarian and planktonic foraminiferal quantitative data in order to study the changes of the planktonic assemblages through time and space. The Upwelling Radiolarian Index (URI) {{is used as a}} productivity proxy. The water temperature and hydrographic structure of the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> appear to be the major factors controlling the distribution patterns of the fauna. The relative abundances of three groups of foraminifera, cold water form (dextral N. pachyderma), mixed layer dwellers (G. trilobus, G. ruber, G. sacculifer, G. conglobatus, and G. glutinata), and thermocline dwellers (G. menardii, G. tumida, N. dutertrei, G. crassaformis, and P. obliquiloculata), follow distinct evolutionary patterns at the two sites during the last 160 kyr. At the equatorial site (core MD 85668), downcore fluctuations in the relative abundances of the three groups are closely related to the glacial/interglacial cyclicity and provide some insights into the interpretation of hydrographic changes. The dominance of the mixed layer foraminifera at the transition intervals between isotope stages 6 / 5 and 2 / 1, combined with weak URI values, is thought to reflect the reorganization of the oceanographic circulation. These short-term events (with a duration of < 5000 year) could be related to the rapid inflow of oxygen-depleted water through the Indonesian straits as a result of sea level rise during deglaciation. Underneath the 5 °N gyre (core MD 85674), the response to global climatic changes is overprinted by the regional effect of the Somalian upwelling, which has been persistent over the last 160 kyr...|$|R

Up to now, the southeastern S Pacific Ocean is insufficiently studied in this respect. We analysed piston core SO 213 - 08 - 2 located in the SE Pacific retrieved from ca. 2181 m water depth during RV SONNE cruise SO 213. According to the still preliminary stratigraphy based on benthic biodatums and the correlation of proxy data to the well-dated core SO 213 - 01 - 2 offshore Chile (Poggemann et al., pers. com.), the core covers the Plio/Pleistocene time period from ca. 3. 8 Ma to 0. 4 Ma, hence covering the time periods of the constriction of the Indonesian Gateway and the closure of the Panamanian Seaway being critical to the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation.

These changes, out-with calculated errors, {{can be explained}} by the varying influence of southern versus subpolar <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> in the basin as the Subpolar Gyre weakened and contracted. <b>Upper</b> <b>water</b> properties strongly correlate with a measure of the strength of the Subpolar Gyre (the first principal component of sea surface height over the Subpolar North Atlantic) prior to the mid- 2000 s. As the gyre weakens, the upper layers of the trough become warmer (r - 0. 85), more saline (r - 0. 86) and reduced in nitrate and phosphate (r + 0. 81 and r + 0. 87 respectively). Further the proportion of subpolar waters in the basin decreases from around 50 % to less than 20 % (r + 0. 88). Since the mid- 2000 s the Subpolar Gyre has been particularly weak. During this period temperatures decreased slightly (- 0. 21 1 C), salinities remained near constant (35. 410 +/- 0. 005) and phosphate levels low and stable (0. 68 +/- 0. 02 Micron). These relative lack of changes are thought to be related to the maximum proportion of southern <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> within the Rockall Trough having been reached. Thus the <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> properties are no longer controlled by changes in the relative importance of different <b>water</b> <b>masses</b> in the basin (as prior to the mid- 2000 s), but rather a different process.

The top 150 meters of the EGC is considered polar water and it is cold and low in salinity. The lowness in salinity {{has a lot to}} do with freshwater run off from sea ice melting, river runoff, and Pacific water flux and it is cold due to air-sea interactions while in the Arctic. Typical characteristics for the EGC Polar water are a temperature between 0°C and –1.7°C (e.g. freezing point of low-salinity sea water), and the salinity varies greatly from 30 psu (near the surface) to 34 psu at a 150-meter depth. The layer beneath the Polar Water is known as the Atlantic Water layer. It extends down to about 1000 m. This layer is defined as having relatively warm temperatures and saline waters. The temperatures are normally above 0°C and have a salinity of 34 psu at 150 meters and it increases to about 35 psu at 1000 meters. The Atlantic water that is seen in the EGC comes from two different sources. The first source of Atlantic Water originates from westward directed Atlantic water in the West Spitsbergen Current. This current sends Atlantic water (AW) into the Fram Strait, and because it is more dense then the surface Polar water it sinks to an intermediate depth. The second source of AW in the EGC originates from recirculated AW in the Arctic. This is AW that has entered the Arctic via the North Atlantic and has been circulating in the Arctic and is now being pushed out of the Arctic via the EGC. The layer beneath the Atlantic Water is simply referred to as the Deep Water where the salinity and temperatures are relatively constant. This level typically extends from 1000 meters to the bottom of the ocean. The temperatures in this bottom level are normally below 0°C and the salinity is around 34.9 psu.|$|R
