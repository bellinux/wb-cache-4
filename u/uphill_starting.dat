30|$|The total {{itinerary}} is 4.6  km {{long and}} well represents {{of an average}} urban trip, being constituted by a mix of main and minor roads with an alternation of slopes (downhill and <b>uphill)</b> <b>starting</b> and ending at the same geodetic altitude.|$|E
2500|$|GT Pack {{versions}} add {{heated and}} ventilated leather/suede seats, a premium BOSE sound system, cruise control, 19-inch forged alloy wheels, Synchro Rev Control technology on the manual version along with <b>Uphill</b> <b>Start</b> Support ...|$|R
50|$|On dry {{and stiff}} surface {{the vehicle is}} capable to climb 60% steep uphill and {{downhill}} forward and by reversing. <b>Uphill</b> <b>start</b> is possible on this gradient by help of interlocks. The nominal fording depth is 0.8 m, but 1.2-metre depth is achievable with preparation. The angles of approach and departure are 35°. Maximum side slope is 30% and vertical step about 0.6 metres. The terrain capability is further enhanced by a front-mounted hydraulic 150-kN self-recovery winch. The climatic operation range is from -55 °C to +50 °C.|$|R
50|$|With these locomotives, {{there was}} some concern about water supply. The {{capacity}} of the tender was limited at only 6200 imp gal and, with few watering points in service, the full capacity of the locomotive was not always used for fear of running short of this essential commodity in the semi-arid Spanish landscape. For example, for the 163 km stretch between Medina del Campo and Burgos that rises 131 m with an <b>uphill</b> <b>start,</b> three intermediate stops, one slack and some shunting movements to couple extra coaches to the train, {{the amount of water}} consumed was about 7300 imp gal.|$|R
50|$|Wyesham is {{effectively}} {{a suburb of}} Monmouth the county town. The Forest of Dean <b>starts</b> <b>uphill</b> from Wyesham and Offa's Dyke Path long distance footpath passes above the village and the Wye Valley Walk runs close by beside the river.|$|R
50|$|However, it was {{difficult}} for trains to <b>start</b> <b>uphill</b> and the siding was relocated to a more level site where it remains to this day. In 1887, it became a mail receiving station to complement Bellevue Station which was also a receiving station. A goods shed was built in 1891.|$|R
50|$|Second, {{traffic from}} Route 62 {{that are going}} toward the {{hospital}} or mall {{are in the process}} of preparing to exit onto the aforementioned ramp. Additionally, any vehicles from Berlin State Highway wanting to ultimately turn left towards the airport have, at most, 600 ft to cross the two through lanes, all while continuing <b>uphill</b> and usually <b>starting</b> from a full stop.|$|R
25|$|The dimer method {{can be used}} to find {{possible}} transition {{states without}} knowledge of the final structure or to refine a good guess of a transition structure. The “dimer” is formed by two images very close to each other on the PES. The method works by moving the dimer <b>uphill</b> from the <b>starting</b> position whilst rotating the dimer to find the direction of lowest curvature (ultimately negative).|$|R
5000|$|On the 10th April, Lermusiaux {{along with}} another 16 runners competed in the marathon, up to the 20km mark the Frenchman was leading the race, but with the poor roads, heat and <b>uphill</b> grade runners <b>started</b> to drop out, Lermusiaux {{staggered}} {{to a stop and}} received an alcohol rub by an attendant, when he tried to resume he knew he wouldn't finish so withdrew at the 32km mark.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{alternate}} return path that includes Class 2 bike lanes, a Class 1 {{path through the}} hills above Irvine, and a Class 1 path built {{as part of the}} planned subdivisions of older Irvine. Access is South on Old Laguna (Road?), which leads through quiet industrial park areas to a bridge over Interstate 405, and on to an area of newly developed town homes all on relatively safe Class 2 bike lanes (with the possible exception of a narrow bridge). Turning right at Quail Hill Road leads to a traffic circle; to the left at the circle, <b>uphill,</b> is the <b>start</b> of the new Class 1 path.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 2006-07 season, the Lions {{were picked}} {{by many to}} {{challenge}} for the WCC title, but their season was filled with near misses (losing to Long Beach State on a half court shot at the buzzer and three other WCC games on shots at the buzzer), critical injuries (Brandon Worthy out with ACL), <b>uphill</b> battles (<b>starting</b> 1-6 in the WCC) and bad luck (drawing host team in first round) that proved {{too much for the}} sixth-seeded Lions as they finish 13-18 on the year. Their season ended with a loss to the University of Portland at the Chiles Center {{in the first round of}} the West Coast Conference Championships. In his final game for LMU, Knight recorded 15 points and seven rebounds. He finished his career with 1,466 points and 743 rebounds, ranking 10th and sixth, respectively. He became the fifth player in LMU history to rank in the top-10 in career points and rebounds. Over 28 games as a senior in 2006-07, Knight averaged 16.5 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game. He subsequently earned first-team All-WCC honours for the second straight year.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A fully {{automated}} method {{is presented to}} classify 3 -D CT data into material fractions. An analytical scale-invariant description relating the data value to derivatives around Gaussian blurred step edges—arch model—is applied to uniquely combine robustness to noise, global signal fluctuations, anisotropic scale, noncubic voxels, {{and ease of use}} via a straightforward segmentation of 3 -D CT images through material fractions. Projection of noisy data value and derivatives onto the arch yields a robust alternative to the standard computed Gaussian derivatives. This results in a superior precision of the method.

40|$|In {{this present}} study the {{monitoring}} pattern of social interactions {{of one year}} old infants of more sensitive mothers and less sensitive mothers is investigated. The study is guided by the following main question: ‘Is maternal sensitivity related to the monitoring pattern of social interactions of one year old infants?’ The sample consisted of thirty-eight 12 -month-old infants and their mothers. An eye-tracking experiment {{was carried out in}} which we measured infants’ monitoring pattern of social interactions. The eye-tracking stimuli consisted of an animated movies in which a social interaction between two geometric figures, a small and a big oval shape, is showed. The animated movies consisted of four segments, which are <b>start,</b> <b>uphill,</b> separation and response. In half of the movies a crying sound can be heard, while in {{the other half of the}} movies a laughing sound can be heard. There are four different animated movies, the responsive crying movie, the responsive laughing movie, the unresponsive crying movie and the unresponsive laughing movie. Supported by the sensitivity theory of Ainsworth, which states that mothers’ responses to their infants’ signals influence children’s development and supported by Bowlby’s theory of internal working models, in which the relationship with a primary caregiver influence how we understand the social world around us, it is hypothesized that infants of more sensitive mothers may show differences in their monitoring pattern of social interactions, while infants of less sensitive mothers do not show similar differences. Thus, it is hypothesized that maternal sensitivity can influence infants processing of social interactions. Maternal sensitivity was measured based on three different episodes, using the Ainsworth Sensitivity Scale. Results suggested that, in the separation part of the observed movies, the overall attention of infants of less sensitive mothers declined across the repetition of the presentation during the unresponsive movies but not during the responsive movies. Furthermore, infants of less sensitive mothers looked longer at the first four movies than infants of more sensitive mothers, while in the second four movies there was no such difference. We also found in the response part of the observed movies, that the overall attention of infants of less sensitive mothers declined across the repetition of the presentation during the unresponsive crying and responsive crying movies, while infants of more sensitive mothers did not show this decline. Limitations, strong aspects and recommendation for further research are discussed...|$|R
