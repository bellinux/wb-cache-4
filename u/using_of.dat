5|$|Billie is the {{youngest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal and her powers were inherited from her maternal grandmother, making Helen a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. Billie has the basic abilities of a witch, including casting spells, performing rituals, brewing potions, scrying for lost people or objects <b>using</b> <b>of</b> a crystal pendant, and communicating with the dead. She also has the power of telekinesis and later develops the ability to warp reality using a power known as projection. She is shown mastering her original powers very easily and adapting them using unconventional methods, such as attaching a large quartz crystal to her computer's mouse to scry through a GPS system. Her telekinesis enables her to perform acrobatic moves, such as backflips. However, she experiences difficulty using her power of projection due to her fear of hurting others. Billie eventually masters this power, and by the series finale she can easily travel through time.|$|E

25|$|With {{the growth}} of {{multi-storey}} car parks {{since the middle of}} the twentieth century, many constructions of such structures have been using precast concrete to reduce the construction time. The design involves putting parking structure parts together. The parts of precast concrete include multi-storey structural wall panels, interior and exterior columns, structural floors, girders, wall panels, stairs and slabs. The precast concrete parts are transported using flatbed semi-trailers to the sites. The structural floor modules may need to be laid tilted during the transportation in order to cover as large floor area as possible while they can be easily transported on the roadways. The modules are lifted using precast concrete lifting anchor systems at the sites for assembly. Decorations may include <b>using</b> <b>of</b> covers to close the holes in the precast concrete that contains the lifting anchors, and installing facades to the exterior of the structures.|$|E

25|$|Some smaller estates failed, {{but others}} were saved from {{collapse}} by a scheme first adopted by one large owner, The British Central Africa Company Ltd. Instead <b>using</b> <b>of</b> direct labour, it issued seeds to tenants {{so they could}} grow cotton and tobacco under supervision, and sell their crops to the planters at low prices. This system was formalised in legislation, the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, which modified thangata by allowing rents to be paid in cash, in a fixed quantity of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The true value of the crop, usually tobacco, given in lieu of rent greatly exceeded the cash rent. Estate landlords also benefited from restrictions on smallholders growing tobacco. Although the estates now largely acted as brokers for their tenants‚Äô produce, and the name thangata, sometimes ‚Äútobacco thangata‚Äù after its commonest form was applied to rent in kind, the older form of labour thangata persisted on tea estates, and elsewhere if the owner wished to grow crops through direct labour.|$|E

500|$|In 1947 Michael Pertwee, a {{scriptwriter}} at Ealing Studios, {{suggested an}} adaptation of a 1907 Roy Horniman novel, Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal. The reviewer Simon Heffer observes that {{the plot of the}} source novel was dark in places‚Äîit includes the murder of a child‚Äîand differed in several respects from the resulting film. A major difference was that the main character was the half-Jewish (as opposed to half-Italian) Israel Rank, and Heffer writes that Mazzini's [...] "ruthless <b>using</b> <b>of</b> people (notably women) and his greedy pursuit of position all seem to conform to the stereotype that the anti-semite has of the Jew". The change from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini was brought about by the [...] "post-war sensitivity about anti-Semitism", and the moral stance of the films produced by Ealing. According to the British Film Institute (BFI), the novel is [...] "self-consciously in the tradition" [...] of Oscar Wilde, which is reflected in the snobbery and dandyism portrayed in the film.|$|E

500|$|Scribe B {{was a poor}} speller, and scribe A was {{not very}} much better; the best scribe was D. Metzger states: [...] "scribe A had made some unusually serious mistakes". Scribes A and B more often used nomina sacra in {{contracted}} forms (Œ†ŒùŒïŒ•ŒúŒë contracted in all occurrences, ŒöŒ•Œ°ŒôŒüŒ£ contracted except in 2 occurrences), scribe D more often used forms uncontracted. D distinguished between sacral and nonsacral <b>using</b> <b>of</b> ŒöŒ•Œ°ŒôŒüŒ£. His errors are the substitution of ŒïŒô for Œô, and Œô for ŒïŒô in medial positions, both equally common.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of Love and Rockets, the Hernandez {{brothers}} made increasing <b>using</b> <b>of</b> what Joseph Witek calls [...] "uncued closure": frequent use of abrupt ellipsis to pack large amounts of narrative into {{a small number of}} panels, relying on readers to fill in the gaps. [...] In Poison River the gaps between panels, which readers normally processed unconsciously, come to the forefront in a slow, staccato rhythm. [...] Panels are crowded with abundant dialogue, stretching out their perceived duration in time, while transitions from one panel to another are sudden‚Äîas are transitions from scene to scene, which can happen several times per page. [...] Hernandez limits the narrative only to important details, showing rapid growth in his characters and situations in limited space, rather than relating the story in a traditional step-by-step manner. [...] He compresses great a great deal of action into a minimum of panels, as in a two panel sequence which critic Jordan Raphael says [...] "delineates both the entirety (action and consequences) of a shootout between rival gangs even as [...] reveals each character's guiding motivation". [...] The narrative's chronology is fluid, with frequent jumps in time, such as an uncued 16-page flashback sequence. [...] Hernandez avoids using captions, leaving such jumps to the reader to sort out. [...] The copious, compact dialogue gives the reader an impression {{of what is going on}} at a given moment, but filtered through the speaker.|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} Ray Robinson {{wrote that}} [...] "of all Australian captains he came closest {{to being a}} disciplinarian". [...] Regardless, his team mates continued to select him as captain, trusting in his {{knowledge and understanding of}} the game. On a wet day during the 1899 tour, a delay in play saw some of the Australians accept an invitation to the Player's tobacco factory in Nottingham. While away, the weather cleared and play began with Darling leading a team of five Australians and five substitutes onto the field. Darling later called a team meeting that saw the culprits fined ‚Ç§5 for breaching team rules. His approach to the hard-drinking Ernie Jones was similarly tough. To ensure that the fast bowler would not drink to excess, he selected Jones as twelfth man in a match against an English county team. When Jones refused to play, a team meeting saw him facing expulsion from the team. Darling spoke to him privately and made it clear that without an apology to his team mates and a promise to curb his drinking, he would be on the next boat bound for Australia. The firm and prompt action had a lasting effect on team discipline during his time as Australian captain. Wisden noted that [...] "as a captain he inspired his men to reveal their best form." [...] As a captain he was a reformer, suggesting rule changes that included making six runs the reward for clearing the boundary rather than the entire ground, and <b>using</b> <b>of</b> sawdust to fill holes in bowler's run-ups.|$|E
