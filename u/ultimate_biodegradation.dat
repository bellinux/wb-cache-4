5000|$|A {{complete}} biodegradation under aerobic conditions {{consists of}} two steps, primary biodegradation and <b>ultimate</b> <b>biodegradation.</b> The first step begins from the terminal carbon in the alkyl chain as omega-oxidation, which can start from one or both ends, then is followed by beta-oxidation. After the first step the residual is sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates (SP(d)Cs), a large molecule which can {{be involved in the}} second step. The second step occurs only when the required bacteria exist. The ring cleavage of benzene and the further desulphonation of the mono- and dicarboxyilic sulphophenyl acids happen. After the two-step biodegradation, LAS is degraded into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic salts and residual biomass. During the biodegradation, several specific bacteria and oxygen are required in both omega-oxidation of the alkyl chain and the benzene ring cleaving process, so this biodegradation can only happen in aerobic conditions. [...] In anaerobic conditions in treatment process, LAS shows no change. Researchers also prove that biodegradation process is restricted in 20-40 mg/L and even inhibited at a higher concentration, which leads to the incomplete biodegradation of LAS in sewage treatment plants.|$|E

40|$|Conversion to CO 2 upon {{incubation}} in aerobic soil {{is one of}} {{the standard}} test procedures to assess biodegradability. It may be measured with unlabeled test compounds in biometer flasks. In this case, the background CO 2 evolution by unamended soil is subtracted from the CO 2 evolution by the amended soil and the resulting net CO 2 evolution becomes the measure of biodegradation. Alternately, 14 CO 2 release from radiocarbon substrates is measured to assess biodegradability. Both approaches measure <b>ultimate</b> (complete) <b>biodegradation</b> and bypass the theoretical and technical limitations of residue analysis. This report examines the underlying assumptions that, except for carbon content, conversion percentage to CO 2 is relatively independent of chemical composition, that CO 2 production is proportional to the amount of added test compound, and that the background CO 2 evolution of the soil is not influenced by the test substance. Work with unlabeled and radiolabeled substrates proved the first two assumptions to be essentially correct. However, more than half of net CO 2 production may represent the mineralization of biomass and soil organic matter, some of it unrelated to the test compound. The soil microbial community in its nongrowing steady state appears to convert a much lower percentage of a radiocarbon substrate to 14 CO 2 than a growing soil community that responds to a substantial substrate addition. These findings may help to improve test methods and may aid in the interpretation of test results...|$|R

The percentage decolorization for the treatment of wastewater containing structurally different dyes was found to be higher than 95 % in all trials. The stable bacterial count of the biofilm on stone media of the trickling filter during the treatment confirmed the presence, proliferation, dominance and involvement of the added microbial consortium in the treatment of textile wastewater. Results of physicochemical parameters revealed the reduction in chemical oxygen demand (58. 5 - 75. 1 %), sulphates (18. 9 - 36. 5 %), and phosphates (63. 6 - 73. 0 %).

40|$|Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs), {{which are}} widely used for {{industrial}} and domestic purposes, exert adverse effects on wildlife after being used and discharged into the environment. However, their <b>ultimate</b> biodegradability and <b>biodegradation</b> pathway remains unclear. In this study, the aerobic degradability of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) by the acclimated microorganisms in active sludge was examined using shaking-flask tests. The degradation of benzene rings in NPEOs was determined using UV spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that more than 80 % of benzene rings were removed after 8 - 10 days of degradation, {{and the majority of}} NPEOs were also removed after 9 days of degradation, indicating NPEOs and the benzene rings could be ultimately degraded by microorganisms in acclimated active sludge. Electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) analysis of biodegradation intermediates indicate that stepwise omega, beta-oxidation of EO chains or fission of EO chains, and further omega, beta-oxidation of alkyl-chain for short-EO-chain NPEOs constitute the main pathway in the early stage, and complete biodegradation occur when the benzene rings in these molecules are opened in the later stage...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} the fabrication of nanospheres {{from a range}} of novel polyhydroxyalkanoates supplied by Monsanto, St Louis, Missouri, USA for the delivery of selected actives of both pharmaceutical and agricultural interest. Initial evaluation of established microsphere and nanosphere fabrication techniques resulted in the adoption and optimisation of a double sonication solvent evaporation method involving the synperonic surfactant F 68. Nanospheres could be consistently generated with this method. Studies on the incorporation and release of the surrogate protein Bovine Serum Albumin V demonstrated that BSA could be loaded with between 10 - 40 % w/w BSA without nanosphere destabilisation. BSA release from nanospheres into Hanks Balanced Salts Solution, pH 7. 4, could be monitored for up to 28 days at 37 °C. The incorporation and release of the Monsanto actives - the insecticide Admire® ({ 1 -[(6 -chloro- 3 -pyridinyl) methyIJ-N-nitro- 2 -imidazolidinimine}) and the plant growth hormone potassium salt Gibberellic acid (GA 3 K) from physico-chemically characterised polymer nanospheres was monitored for up to 37 days and 28 days respectively, at both 4 °C and 23 °C. Release data was subsequently fitted to established kinetic models to elaborate the possible mechanisms of release of actives from the nanospheres. The exposure of unloaded nanospheres to a range of physiological media and rural rainwater has been used to investigate the role polymer biodegradation by enzymatic and chemical means might play in the in vivo release of actives and agricultural applications. The potential environmental biodegradation of Monsanto polymers has been investigated using a composting study (International Standard ISO/FDIS 14855) in which the <b>ultimate</b> aerobic <b>biodegradation</b> of the polymers has been monitored by the analysis of evolved carbon dioxide.

Six laboratories participated in this inter-laboratory exercise and tested four chemicals, according to methods published earlier by the RIVM (1987) and ECETOC (1988). The most satisfactory and simple procedure to evaluate the degree of anaerobic mineralization is to combine two parameters that can easily be measured, i. e. the net gas production and the increase of dissolved inorganic carbon. This approach is more succesful than monitoring the evolved methane. Both procedures to wash the anaerobic sludge are effective in reducing the blank gas production due to the sludge.

The study was carried out with microbiota isolated from different environmental niches: sediments from river channel, garden soil, drainage trench collecting agricultural runoff stream, agricultural soil and municipal waste repository. The obtained results revealed that resistance to toxicity and biodegradation efficiency of the micro-biota increased in the following order: microbiota from the waste repository[microbiota from agricultural soil & microbiota from an agricultural runoff stream[microbiota from garden soil[microbiota from the river sludge. It was observed that the toxicity of HILs increased with the hydrophobicity of the cation, however the influence of the anion was more notable. The highest toxicity was observed when MCPA was used as the anion (EC 50 values ranging from 60 to 190 mg L- 1). The results of <b>ultimate</b> <b>biodegradation</b> tests indicated that only HILs with 2, 4 -D as the anion were mineralized to some extent, with slightly higher values for HILs with the 4 -decyl- 4 -ethylmorpholinium cation (10 – 31 %) compared to HILs with the 4, 4 -didecylmorpholinium cation (9 – 20 %).

Acute toxicity of AES was studied to the microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana, Isochrysis galbana, Chaetoceros gracilis, Dunaliella salina and Tetraselmis chuii and the invertebrate Artemia franciscana, using culture growth inhibition and death, respectively, as effect criteria. During the degradative process two different stages were observed, which were better described with the first order and logistic kinetic models, respectively. Lag times were 3. 3 (stage A) and 26. 5 (stage B) days whereas half-lives were 18. 6 (stage A) and 49. 8 (stage B) days. AES inhibited the microalgae growth, with 96 -h EC 50 values ranging from 4. 68 g L− 1 for D. salina to 24. 02 mg L− 1 for I. galbana.

40|$|Most of the {{standardized}} biodegradation tests {{used to assess}} the <b>ultimate</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of environmentally degradable polymers are based solely on the determination of net evolved carbon dioxide. However, under aerobic conditions, it has to be considered that heterotrophic microbial consortia metabolize carbon substrates both to carbon dioxide and in the production of new cell biomass. It is generally accepted that in the relatively short term, 50 % of the carbon content of most organic substrates is converted to CO 2, with the remaining carbon being assimilated as biomass or incorporated into humus. The latter is particularly important when the metabolism of the organic matter occurs in a soil environment. A straightforward relationship between the free-energy content of a carbon substrate (expressed as the standard free-energy of combustion) and its propensity for conversion to new microbial biomass rather than mineralization to CO 2 has been established. This can potentially lead to underestimation of biodegradation levels of test compounds, especially when they consist of carbon in a fairly low formal oxidation state and relatively high free-energy content. In the present work, the metabolism of different kind of carbon substrates, especially in soil, is reviewed and compared with our own experimental results from respirometric tests. The results show that conversion of highly oxidized materials, such as the commonly used reference materials, cellulose or starch, to CO 2 may be significantly overestimated. The addition of glucosidic material to soil leads to greatly increased respiration and is accompanied by a very low conversion to biomass or humic substances. In contrast, relatively less oxidized substrates metabolize more slowly to give both CO 2 and biomass to an extent which may be significantly underestimated if glucosidic materials are used as the reference. The need for an overall carbon balance taking into account both the carbon immobilized as biomass and that volatized as CO 2 must be considered in standard respirometric procedures for assessing the biodegradability of slowly degrading macromolecules...|$|E
30|$|Taking {{into account}} that {{anaerobic}} biodegradation has or may become included as a pass/fail criterium in surfactant-specific regulations (e.g. EU Detergent Regulation, EU Ecolabel) {{there is a need}} for a test which reliably determines the anaerobic biodegradation of surfactants under relevant (use-related) conditions. Various methods for determining the anaerobic degradability of organic substances have been developed based on the ultimate aerobic biodegradation screening tests which are summarized in the Fraunhofer Report on the “Anaerobic Degradation of Detergent Surfactants” to the EU Commission (2002) [1]. The methods can be divided in two groups, the composting test running at 52 °C (which are not relevant for waste water effluents), and the tests in aqueous media running at 35 °C (e.g. ISO 11734 and OECD 311). These test methods use sludge from the digestion tower of municipal sewage plants as the inoculum. A comparison of the prevailing biodegradation conditions in these tests (e.g. OECD 311) with those encountered in practice, i.e. the conditions that are found in the digestion tower of a municipal sewage plant, shows that sewage plants work with considerably higher mass concentrations both of sludge and of organic pollutants. The above-mentioned tests for determining the <b>ultimate</b> <b>biodegradation</b> under anaerobic conditions are therefore only suitable to a limited extent for making practice-related statements about the anaerobic biodegradation of substances. Much more practice-related mass concentrations are used in simulation tests, like OECD 314 [6] or in the test according to DIN 38414, part 8 [7]. When we started the project, we had also another aspect in mind, namely cost and time efficiency of the test system, so that ideally the test could be used for serial screening of research substances. Based on these considerations, we have chosen the method DIN 38414, part 8 as the starting point for the development of a new method for determining the ultimate anaerobic biodegradation of organic substances under sewage plant simulation conditions. The main difference between this test and that of the method given in DIN 38414, part 8 is that an accurately known amount of the test substance is added to the sludge inoculum. By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced in the sludge inoculum plus test substance and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this test ultimately allows the quantification of the anaerobic biodegradability of the test substance. This anaerobic biodegradation under sewage digester conditions test (AnBUSDiC test) is particularly suitable for testing chemicals used in consumer products which, if used in accordance with the relevant instructions, are found practically quantitatively in the wastewater and therefore also in the anaerobic treatment stage of municipal sewage plants. In order to be able to assess the potential risks involved in applying clarified sludge to the soil the ultimate anaerobic biodegradability under the conditions of a sewage plant simulation test is the method of choice. This test is carried out in order to investigate the degradation behavior of the test substance under conditions such as prevail in the anaerobic sludge treatment in municipal sewage plants. The result may also be used to demonstrate that the substance complies with the criteria for good anaerobic biodegradability demanded by surfactant-relevant environmental labels (particularly the EU Marguerite and the Nordic Swan).|$|E
40|$|Background Sustainable water {{pollution}} control calls for effective enforcement of regulations and adoption of cleaner production technology {{as well as}} effective end-of-pipe treatment of effluents. The final effluent quality of many municipalities and industries in Kenya seldom comply with government-prescribed effluent discharge guidelines. There is, therefore, {{a need for a}} sustainable technology that can reliably achieve acceptable effluent quality for discharge into the environment at minimal cost. Natural and artificial wetland systems have been used as a cost-effective alternative to conventional wastewater treatment methods for improving final effluent quality. Data and information on pulp and paper mill wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands are few while performance data that can guide design and operation under tropical environment conditions are lacking. This study was undertaken to explore the potential of a constructed wetland {{to improve the quality of}} the final effluent from Pan African paper mills (E. A.) Limited (PANPAPER) in western Kenya in order: 1) to be in compliance with national discharge regulations, and 2) to protect the receiving aquatic environment, the River Nzoia, and downstream riparian users. In this thesis the problematic wastewater components were characterised (Chapter 2). The data were used to evaluate the performance of the PANPAPER Mills wastewater treatment ponds and the wetland system with respect to removal of nutrients, organic matter (BOD, COD), suspended solids (TSS), and phenols (Chapters 4 - 6) under various operational conditions. A pilot-scale constructed wetland covering a total area of 48. 5 m 2 was located in the tree nursery just below the final stabilization pond of PANPAPER Mills. It consisted of eight subsurface flow (SSF) cells each of dimensions 3. 2 m (length) x 1. 2 m (width) x 0. 8 m (depth) cells and two cells of dimensions 6. 2 m (length) x 1. 5 m (width) x 0. 8 m (depth). The latter were initially operated as free water surface flow and later as subsurface flow systems. The subsurface flow cells were planted in pairs with Cyperus immensus, Typha domingensis, Phragmites mauritianus and Cyperus papyrus. The Cyperus immensus did not establish well due to frequent attacks by vermin monkeys and were therefore removed after eight months and the cells left implanted. The larger cells were planted with Typha domingensis. All cells were filled with gravel to a depth of 30 cm. The experimental systems operation was dynamic and ran for a total period of 3 years from 2002 to 2005. It involved different operation modes, hydraulic loading rates and retentions in order to optimise pollutant removal while maintaining good plant vitality. Initially the wetland was operated on a batch load-drain mode starting with 5 -day retention time (batch phase 1). It was assumed that this format would enhance organic matter degradation. Plant vitality was relatively poor and was partly attributed to low nitrogen loading at a long retention time. A shorter retention time of 3 days (batch phase 2) was subsequently used. Although plant vitality increased, there was a reduction in treatment efficiency with respect to TSS. It was therefore decided to use a continuous flow operation mode. The results of batch phase 2 had shown better wetland performance at 3 days than at 5 days. A third phase of batch operation was undertaken as a repeat of the first phase when the wetland was considered to be mature. In all there were three phases of batch operation and two of continuous flow. In the first phase of continuous flow plant growth was at steady stage while in the second phase the plants were at an exponential growth stage. A tracer study using lithium chloride was conducted in the first phase. Wetland performance The study revealed that the PANPAPER Mills pond system was actually performing well as per its type and design. However, the concentration of pollutants in the final effluent (average 45 ± 3, 394 ± 340, 52 ± 6, and 0. 64 ± 0. 09 for BOD, COD, TSS and phenols, respectively) discharged into the Nzoia River does not comply with the national discharge limits. Mean total nitrogen and phosphorus were about 3 mg/ 1 and 0. 7 mg/ 1, respectively giving a low N:P ratio. Evapotranspiration (8 - 16 mm/day) was found to be an important component of outputs in the water budget of the wetland system making up to 15 - 32 %, depending on the system type. ET rates were different for the aquatic plant species studied. It was not possible to deduce the actual retention time and other hydraulic parameters (efficiency and number of "tanks in series") under continuous flow, as there was no discernable tracer concentration curve for all wetland cells. For this wastewater, which has high organic matter content, the study should be conducted with a different tracer. Alternatively, lithium chloride may still be used but with continuous feed instead of pulse feed, as was the case in this study. Plant tissue nutrient concentrations were lower than in healthy natural wetland plants. Nitrogen concentrations based on dry weights in Phragmites, Typha and papyrus were 9. 2 ± 0. 7, 7. 4 ± 0. 5, and 6. 1 ± 0. 2 mg/g, respectively while phosphorus concentrations were 1. 7 ± 0. 12, 1. 9 ± 0. 11, 1. 6 ± 0. 14 mg/g, respectively. Despite this, Typha and Phragmites had satisfactory aboveground biomass production (10896 g/m and 3015 g/m 2 dry weight, respectively) when compared to natural wetlands. The growth of papyrus was sub-optimal with an aerial biomass of 3075 g/m 2. In general, plant vitality and growth was lower during batch mode wetland operation. Below ground root and rhizome growth was variable. Typha roots penetrated the entire bed depth (approx. 30 cm) while Phragmites and papyrus rooting depths were in the top 20 cm and 10 cm, respectively. Plant uptake of nutrients exceeded inputs by influent in the exponential growth stage. Nutrient mass flows indicated that in this low loaded system mineralisation and cycling of nutrients in accumulated sediments and/or in senescing/decaying plant organs are important for sustaining plant growth. Mean removal efficiency for total nitrogen was in the range of 49 - 75 % for planted cells and 42 - 49 % for unplanted ones in continuous flow. For phosphorus removal efficiencies were 30 - 60 % in planted cells and (minus) 4 - 38 % in unplanted ones. Removal efficiency of up to 25 % may be attributed to uptake into plant shoots. Harvesting of plant shoots should be appropriately timed to avoid depletion of the nutrient pool. The removal efficiencies were lower during batch operation modes. The constructed wetland effectively removed BOD (up to 90 %) and TSS (up to 81 %) from the wastewater to concentrations below that prescribed by the regulating authority in Kenya. However, COD removal was low (up to 52 %). The non-zero background concentration for BOD varied between 4. 3 and 7. 4 mg/ 1 for the different cells while areal BOD reaction rate constants varied from 0. 055 - 0. 114 m/day (20 - 42 m/yr). The reaction rates are reported for pulp and paper mill wastewater for the first time. Typha cells had consistently higher TSS removal efficiency than Phragmites and papyrus in continuous flow. Besides TSS removal in the wetland bed with developed plant roots, the presence of macrophytes does not seem to enhance BOD and COD removal when compared to unplanted cells. However, the presence of plants is essential for nutrients and phenol removal. Mean phenol removal efficiencies based on mass flows ranged from 73 % to 96 %. Good buffering was achieved even during the highest inflow phenol concentration of 1. 3 mg/ 1 and the highest hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 9. 8 cm/day in the wetland. For batch operation, optimal removal was achieved at 5 -day hydraulic retention time with a mean outflow concentration of 0. 053 ± 0. 004 mg/ 1. The major processes of phenol removal are microbial breakdown (60 %) followed by sedimentation/adsorption (up to 30 %). However, <b>ultimate</b> <b>biodégradation</b> in a mature wetland may be higher as some of the sedimented and/or adsorbed phenols may be re-cycled and microbially degraded. The removal was enhanced by wetland age and presence of aquatic macrophytes especially when they were at an exponential growth stage. During this stage plant uptake rates were 5. 4 - 12. 7 mg phenol/day accounting for 10 - 23 % of phenol removed in SSF cells. The study reports, for the first time, phenol reduction rates (k values) in a constructed wetland. Average k, for SSF cells was 27 m/yr and 44 m/yr respectively at hydraulic loading rates of 4. 1 - 4. 9 cm/day and 9. 8 cm/day, respectively. The reduction rate was 38 m/yr for the free water surface flow cells at a HLR of 9. 3 cm/day. Mean volumetric removal rate for batch operation was 0. 57 d' for Phragmites and papyrus cells. Water quality of Nzoia River PANPAPER Mills's effluent discharge in a "business-as usual" scenario causes an increase in the concentration of pollutants downstream (3 km) compared to an upstream location (500 m). The increase is highest during low flow in the River, usually in the dry season (January to March). This was reflected in an increase in the concentration of various pollutants by between 20 % and 120 % at the downstream sampling point during the month of March. From the findings of this study I predict that the quality of water in River Nzoia downstream of the discharge point would improve significantly if a full-scale constructed wetland with similar performance as that in the pilot study were to be integrated with the existing treatment ponds as a tertiary stage. Such an intervention would decrease pollution by more than 90 % for phenols. TSS, COD and BOD would be reduced by 44 %, 30 % and 63 %, respectively. Nitrogen concentration downstream of discharge would remain the same as that in the upstream location (100 % pollution reduction) while phosphorus concentrations would reduce by 50 % of the current level. An appraisal of these findings is given in Chapter 7, which also includes recommendations for design, set-up and maintenance of a full-scale wetland...|$|E
