5000|$|A {{number of}} {{manufacturers}} have embraced oil tankers {{with a double}} hull because it strengthens the hull of ships, reducing the likelihood of oil disasters in low-impact collisions and groundings over single-hull ships. They {{reduce the likelihood of}} leaks occurring at low speed impacts in port areas when the ship is <b>under</b> <b>pilotage.</b> Research of impact damage of ships has revealed that double-hulled tankers are unlikely to perforate both hulls in a collision, preventing oil from seeping out. However, for smaller tankers, U shaped tanks might be susceptible to [...] "free flooding" [...] across the double bottom and up to the outside water level each side of the cargo tank. Salvors prefer to salvage doubled-hulled tankers because they permit the use of air pressure to vacuum out the flood water. In the 1960s, collision proof double hulls for nuclear ships were extensively investigated, due to escalating concerns over nuclear accidents.|$|E

In order to address this, a simulation experiment was conducted to compare homogeneous teams and heterogeneous teams. The main task of the bridge team was to safely navigate the vessel. In addition, a proposed safety assessment framework based on safety performance indicators was formulated as a tool for the assessment. The result showed that heterogeneous teams performed better than homogeneous teams. Nevertheless, this did not necessarily indicate that heterogeneous teams performed the task in a safer manner than homogeneous teams.

Qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to determine whether a valid description of bridge crew behavior could be developed and utilized in safety audit processes. Five expert sea pilots participated in a Hierarchical Task Analysis procedure that identified that tasks of safe navigation through pilotage waters and associated crew behaviours. Another five experienced seafarers participated in the recording of a simulation exercise that demonstrated varying levels of crew performance. A total of 10 experts then rated the behavioural makers. Inter-rater agreement was analysed and the overall mean rWG values increased from. 92 to. 98 following a Delphi procedure. These findings suggest that the identified behavioural markers constitute highly reliable descriptions of safe crew performance.

The hopes and fears of those on board of the ship were in tumultuous agitation, as the boat drew nigh that was to let them know the fortunes of the enterprise, and the fate of their predecessors. The captain, who was haunted with the idea of possible treachery, did not suffer his curiosity to get the better of his caution, but ordered a party of his men under arms, to receive the visitors. The canoe came first alongside, in which were Comcomly and six Indians; in the barge were M'Dougal, M'Lellan, and eight Canadians.

And when they moved on, it was very slowly, just keeping sight of the others across the lumbered dimness of Covent Garden, where tarpaulin-covered carts and barrows seemed to slumber under the blink of lamps and watchmen's lanterns. Across Long Acre they came into a street where there was not a soul save the two others, a long way ahead. Walking with his arm tightly laced with hers, touching her all down one side, Derek felt that it would be glorious to be attacked by night-birds in this dark, lonely street, to have a splendid fight and drive them off, showing himself to Nedda for a man, and her protector. But nothing save one black cat came near, and that ran for its life. He bent round and looked under the blue veil-thing that wrapped Nedda's head. Her face seemed mysteriously lovely, and her eyes, lifted so quickly, mysteriously true. She said: ...|$|R
40|$|Does the {{creation}} of a deemed servant-master relationship, between pilot and ship-owner or master through section 76 (2) of the National Ports Act (hereafter the NPA); accurately reflect the de facto relationship in which the parties stand? Can the provision's importation of the doctrine of vicarious liability and consequent foisting of liability on the ship-owner be defined as logical, just and practical? It will be argued after having had recourse to the manner in which these roles have come to be defined and understood in South African labour jurisprudence, the governing law, respective positions occupied by ship-owner and port authority, broad-based considerations of policy, and key tenets of the rationale underpinning the concept of vicarious liability; that the answer to the above-raised questions is are sounding no. In addition, the writer will submit that the privatisation of pilotage services presents a solution, alternate to the irrational imposition of the doctrine of vicarious liability, which is palatable to government, ship-owning interests and pilot. a) Introduction Typically, claims arising from consequences of pilot error satisfy the definition of a 'maritime claim' contained in s 1 (1) (e) and s 1 (1) (l) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Regulation Act. As a result thereof; a South African court sitting in admiralty has jurisdiction to hear such claims. As to the identification of the appropriate law; s 6 (2) dictates that South African statute, if relevant, trumps pre-existing English admiralty law and is the law to be applied. The NPA, chiefly through sections 75 and 76, regulates the extent of the pilot's liability for his/her acts or omissions whilst a vessel is <b>under</b> compulsory <b>pilotage.</b> Thus, the Act is applicable to disputes arising from pilot error, before a South African court sitting in admiralty...|$|R
6000|$|I was {{disturbed}} in my meditations by {{the noise of}} a troop of idle urchins, who came gambolling about the place where I had so often gambolled. They were checked, as I and my playmates had often been, by {{the voice of the}} sexton, a man staid in years and demeanor. I looked wistfully in his face; had I met him any where else, I should probably have passed him by without remark; but here I was alive to the traces of former times, and detected in the demure features of this guardian of the sanctuary the lurking lineaments of one of the very playmates I have alluded to. We renewed our acquaintance. He sat down beside me, on one of the tomb-stones over which we had leaped in our juvenile sports, and we talked together about our boyish days, and held edifying discourse on the instability of all sublunary things, as instanced in the scene around us. He was rich in historic lore, as to {{the events of the last}} thirty years and the circumference of thirty miles, and from him I learned the appalling revolution that was taking place throughout the neighborhood. All this I clearly perceived he attributed to the boasted march of intellect, or rather to the all-pervading influence of steam. He bewailed the times when the only communication with town was by the weekly market-boat, the [...] "Farmers' Daughter," [...] which, <b>under</b> the <b>pilotage</b> of the worthy Gabriel Requa, braved the perils of the Tappan Sea. Alas! Gabriel and the [...] "Farmer's Daughter" [...] slept in peace. Two steamboats now splashed and paddled up daily to the little rural port of Tarrytown. The spirit of speculation and improvement had seized even upon that once quiet and unambitious little dorp. The whole neighborhood was laid out into town lots. Instead of the little tavern below the hill, where the farmers used to loiter on market days and indulge in cider and gingerbread, an ambitious hotel, with cupola and verandas, now crested the summit, among churches built in the Grecian and Gothic styles, showing the great increase of piety and polite taste in the neighborhood. As to Dutch dresses and sun-bonnets, they were no longer tolerated, or even thought of; not a farmer's daughter but now went to town for the fashions; nay, a city milliner had recently set up in the village, who threatened to reform the heads of the whole neighborhood.|$|R

6000|$|I had an opportunity, {{while in}} London, however, of ascertaining {{that the land}} of our fathers, which by the way has archbishops, {{contains}} something besides an unalloyed virtue in its bosom. At Gravesend we took on board two customhouse officers, (they always set a rogue to watch a rogue, in the English revenue system,) and they remained in the brig until she was discharged. One of these men had been a gentleman's servant, and he owed his place to his former master's interest. He was a miracle of custom-house integrity and disinterestedness, as I discovered in the first hour of our intercourse. Perceiving a lad of eighteen {{in charge of the}} prize, and ignorant that this lad had read a good deal of Latin and Greek under excellent Mr. Hardinge, besides being the heir of Clawbonny, I suppose he fancied he would have an easy time with him. This man's name was Sweeney. Perceiving in me an eager desire to see everything, the brig was no sooner at her moorings, than he proposed a cruise ashore. It was Sweeney who showed me the way to the consignee's, and, that business accomplished, he proposed that we should proceed on {{and take a look at}} St. Paul's, the Monument, and, as he gradually found my tastes more intellectual than he had at first supposed, the wonders of the West End. I was nearly a week <b>under</b> the <b>pilotage</b> of the [...] "Admirable Sweeney." [...] After showing me the exteriors of all the things of mark about the town, and the interiors of a few that I was disposed to pay for, he descended in his tastes, and carried me through Wapping, its purlieus and its scenes of atrocities. I have always thought Sweeney was sounding me, and hoping to ascertain my true character, by the course he took; and that he betrayed his motives in a proposition which he finally made, and which brought our intimacy to a sudden close. The result, however, was to let me into secrets I should probably have never learned in any other manner. Still, I had read and heard too much to be easily duped; and I kept myself not only out of the power of my tempter, but out of the power of all that could injure me, remaining simply a curious observer of what was placed before my eyes. Good Mr. Hardinge's lessons were not wholly forgotten; I could run away from him, much easier than from his precepts.|$|R
