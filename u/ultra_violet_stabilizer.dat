40|$|This paper {{mainly focused}} on the {{synthesis}} of zinc oxide nanostructures, their characterization and their <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> light sensing response at room temperature. Nanowires, nanobelts and nanosheets were synthesized by varying doping material copper by using vapor transport technique governed by the vapor-liquid-solid or vapor-solid mechanisms. The structural, morphological and optical characterization was carried out using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray and <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> visible spectroscopy techniques. Finally the <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> light sensing response of these nanostructures was observed by using Keithley meter. The high <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> photosensitivity and fast response time justifies the effective utilization of these ZnO nanostructures as <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> sensors in different areas...|$|R

40|$|The active {{ingredient}} of ten brands of Metronidazole tablets were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography and <b>Ultra</b> <b>Violet</b> Spectrophotometry {{to determine which}} of the assay methods is better and if the drug is of the required standards. For the <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> spectrophotometry samples A,B,C,G and I have the required amount specified while sample D,E,F,H and J failed the required specifications. The High Performance Liquid Chromatography assay showed that samples A,B,C F,G and H are of the required specifications while D,E,I and J failed the required specifications. Samples A,B,C and D. passed the specifications in both assay methods while F and H passed only High performance liquid chromatography and I passed only <b>Ultra</b> <b>Violet</b> Spectophotometry. However samples E. D and J failed both assay methods. Also from the percentage relative derivation and percentage coefficient of variation of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (0. 0012) and <b>Ultra</b> <b>Violet</b> Spectophotometry (1. 9960) it can then be concluded that High Performance Liquid Chromatography has a lesser percentage and hence a more precise and efficient method than the <b>ultra</b> <b>violet...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{interesting}} {{fact that}} <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> rays {{have the power}} of de-stroying bacteria has beenknown {{for some time and}} has received extensive application in a variety of ways. These rays, which are emitted by nearly every source of light to some extent, and by electric discharges between electrodes of easily volatilizable metals in particular, are of wave lengths shorter than those per-ceptible tothe eye. Ultraviolet radiations are very active chemi-cally, among their noticeable chemical reactions being the forma-tion of nitrous acid and of ozone, the decomposition of silver and mercury salts and the decomposition of certain organic com-pounds. Some organic substances tend to become polymerized when exposed to the action of <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> rays. Thus, Pribram and Franke found that recently distilled formaldehyde after being exposed to <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> rays for some time contained a substance which was identified as glycolyl aldehyde. Similarly, Ostromisslenski (1912) showed that vinyl bromide is polymerized in a few hours to cauprene bromide. Numerous other investi-gators, Kailau, Thiele, lesure, Berthelot and Gaudechon, have demonstrated the effect of these rays in causing polymerization or decomposition. <b>Ultra</b> <b>violet</b> rays have been employed chiefly as a bactericidal agent and {{the reason for this is}} not far to seek. Sterilization by light affords a very convenient mode of application and does not introduce any objectionable substance into the material acted upon.
