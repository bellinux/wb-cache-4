40|$|Wettable {{nonwoven}} topsheets {{are traditionally}} spunbond polypropylene nonwoven fabrics. The fluid handling performance of hydroentangled greige cotton nonwovens was studied {{to determine their}} suitability for topsheet applications based upon analysis of fluid rewet, strikethrough, and acquisition properties; and the relative contributions of nonwoven cotton’s cellulosic and wax components to hydrophobic and hydrophilic fluid transport properties are addressed. It was observed that mechanically cleaned greige cotton nonwovens exhibit certain fluid handling properties {{that are similar to}} polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets, {{partly as a result of}} the residual wax content. Subsequently, the surface polarity, swelling, and moisture uptake of 100 % greige cotton and 50 : 50 blends of greige cotton and polypropylene hydroentangled nonwovens were studied in comparison with the performance of a commercially available 100 % polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets. The surface polarity, swelling, and wettability values obtained from electrokinetic and water contact angle analysis were found to be in agreement with the hydrophobic polypropylene topsheets. Additionally, comfort assessment was undertaken based upon fabric handle profiles using the Leeds <b>University</b> <b>Fabric</b> Handle Evaluation System, which is an objective evaluation based on the quantification of fabric buckling deformations. Of the fabrics studied in this work, 50 : 50 greige cotton/polypropylene hydroentangled fabrics were the softest as determined by the Leeds <b>University</b> <b>Fabric</b> Handle Evaluation System and exhibited fluid handling properties consistent with the requirements of commercial topsheets...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is to study the characteristics of fabric properties measured in an innovative fabric test system, Leeds <b>University</b> <b>Fabric</b> Handle Evaluation System (LUFHES); it is designed for objectively evaluating fabric handle in a simpler, relatively low cost and automatic method. The quantification of fabric handle in the LUFHES {{is based on the}} energy consumption of fabric shells during their cyclic shear twisting and cyclic axial compression buckling deformations, as well as the fabric surface properties evaluated from fabric-fabric self-friction process. In this study, low stress fabric mechanical properties measured in the cyclic axial compression buckling, shear twisting and fabric-fabric friction of fabric shells in LUFHES were analysed to establish the new technological approach in relation to fabric handle analysis. In addition, the fabric properties measured in the LUFHES were compared with the fabric properties measured in fabric unidirectional deformation processes such as the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric (KES-F) and the Fabric Assurance by Simple Testing (FAST) to disclose the differences of these three fabric measurement systems. Properties of 29 fabrics including 12 woven fabrics, 7 knitted fabrics and 10 nonwoven fabrics were studied in this project {{in order to understand the}} mechanical properties of fabrics which are made from different fibres, having different fabric structures, fabric weight and thickness measured by using the LUFHES system. The suitable pre-tension for the LUFHES tests was determined by analysing the effect of pre-tensions on the energy consumption of various fabric deformations in cyclic fabric shell compression buckling-recovery processes, and suitable pre-tension force for fabric measurements in the LUFHES was identified in the range of 1. 2 N/m and 2 N/m. Fabric shear and buckling properties measured in the LUFHES were compared with shear and bending properties obtained in both the KES-F and FAST systems to investigate the differences between these three systems in discriminating fabrics. It was found that fabric shear properties obtained in the FAST were different from those obtained in the LUFHES shear tests for woven fabrics due to insufficient shear deformations in woven fabrics in FAST test. It was also found that shear properties obtained in the KES-F shear tests were not in agreement with those obtained in the LUFHES tests due to greater extension forces applied on fabrics leading to greater fabric elongation before its shear test in the KES-F system for some fabrics such as knitted and nonwoven fabrics. Thus, fabric discriminations in terms of fabric shear properties obtained in these three testing systems will be different. The correlation between critical buckling force and bending properties was found to depend on the fabric types and measurement methods. Critical buckling forces of woven and nonwoven fabrics obtained in the LUFHES were found to correlate well with bending rigidity obtained in the KES-F system, while critical buckling forces of knitted fabrics correlated well with the bending rigidity obtained in the FAST system. It was found that there are several unique advantages using the fabric-fabric self- friction method in objective measurement of fabric handle over other methods such as fabric-metal and fabric-artificial finger frictions. The characteristics of fabric-fabric self-friction in the LUFHES friction test were analysed theoretically and experimentally, as well as compared with that of the KES-F fabric-sensor friction/roughness test. It was found that fabric-fabric friction coefficients obtained in LUFHES were greater and in a wider range than those obtained in the KES-F fabric-sensor friction test, and the spectrum of LUFHES fabric-fabric friction profile has advantages in differentiating the main fabric characteristic structures. In summary, the unique low-stress mechanical properties (shear and buckling) obtained in the LUFHES tests reveal insightful information of mechanical properties of fabric shell during biaxial deformations. The fabric-fabric friction was found to have advantages in discriminating fabric friction coefficient and fabric surface structures. Thus, the LUFHES has the potential to be used to sensitively evaluate fabric handle. ...|$|E

30|$|According to Adanur (2001), the open-end is {{a process}} notably {{employed}} to produce denim yarn. The open-end yarns are cheap and rustic for not passing through machines that add a sophisticated finishing, such as textile laminating and combing machines, differing, for example, from the ring spinning process where a set of parallelized fibers is well twisted so there is high cohesion and strength. Additionally, in open-end spinning, the individual fibers are not uniformly arranged in the produced yarn as in the spinning ring produced yarn. In an open-end spinning yarn most of the fibers are parallel, but with some intersections and some irregular fibers surrounding the main cable (Fabriclink – <b>Fabric</b> <b>University</b> 2012).|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} development of Nuevomexicano/a student identity at New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU) during three periods: (1) New Mexico's Territorial period and early statehood, (2) the 1940 s, and (3) the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. Nuevomexicano/a student identity was shaped {{through a process of}} accommodating to and resisting institutional powers. Since 1898, Nuevomexicano/a students have been active members of the university community, despite periods when they constituted {{a small portion of the}} student body and the institution's frequent disregard for Nuevomexicano/a culture and language. As they participated in campus activities, Nuevomexicano/as reconstructed their individual and collective identities, appropriating terms such as Spanish or Chicano/a, as a rhetorical strategy to revise their relationships with the university. Extralocal institutions, including government institutions, national protest movements, and international organizations shaped public conversations about cultural identity. During the first two periods, students employed subtle strategies of resistance that included presenting speeches and reorganizing student government. Often labeled as accommodationist, these strategies represent viable rhetorical strategies that provided students access to dominant literacies, which were used to promote social change. In the 1970 s, Chicano/a students utilized more aggressive practices, such as a weeklong sit-in, to radically alter the institutional culture at NMHU. In the forty years since the sit-in, NMHU has developed into a university that supports its Nuevomexicano/a students and incorporates elements of their culture into the <b>university's</b> social <b>fabric...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{total of}} 28 foam/fabric {{upholstery}} mock-up combinations (7 foams and 4 fabrics) {{were tested in}} a {{rate of heat release}} calorimeter (the cone calorimeter) at incident fluxes of 17. 5 and 25 kW/m 2. The results were analysed with three objectives: (a) understanding the relative contributions of fabric and foam; (b) comparing the relevance of the incident flux used to fire hazard; and (c) comparing the results with those of a round robin carried out on another rate of heat release calorimeter: Ohio State <b>University</b> instrument. The <b>fabrics</b> used represented the commercial range, but had no particular ad-ditional degree of flame retardance added: a cotton, a nylon, a polyester and a wool-nylon fabric The foams used were all flexible polyurethane foams, but had very different densities and levels and types of additives. All foams contained at least some flame retardant additives. The results suggest conclusions, at least for the systems tested: 1. The fabric plays a much greater role than the foam in determining the fire performance of the system...|$|R
