40|$|Do <b>upper</b> <b>houses</b> {{matter for}} cabinet formation? If so, {{does it make}} a {{difference}} how powerful they are? The most sophisticated study to give clear answers to these questions is still that of Druckman, Martin and Thies (2005), which argues that <b>upper</b> <b>houses</b> influence cabinet formation, regardless of their formal powers. We dispute these answers theoretically and empirically. Since adjusting cabinet formation to second chamber composition is not necessary and can be costly, we should expect that if <b>upper</b> <b>houses</b> matter at all, their formal powers should matter too. Replication shows that the empirical results are driven exclusively by two countries with weak <b>upper</b> <b>houses,</b> one of which (Ireland) is miscoded. If this case is recoded there is no statistically or substantially significant effect of <b>upper</b> <b>houses,</b> regardless of their power. We conclude that the two questions cannot yet be answered: we need more research based on broader samples in order to assess whether <b>upper</b> <b>houses</b> matter for cabinet formation and whether their formal powers make a difference...|$|R

The 1844 constitution also lengthened the governor's term to three years, set to start on the third Tuesday in January following an election, and barred governors from succeeding themselves.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Maryland Senate lie in the {{creation}} of an assembly during {{the early days of the}} Maryland colony. This assembly first met in 1637, making it the longest continuously operating legislative body in the United States. Originally, the assembly was unicameral, but in 1650, the Governor and his appointed council began serving as the <b>upper</b> <b>house</b> of a now bicameral legislature. These appointees had close political and economic ties to the proprietors of the Maryland colony, Cecilius Calvert and his descendants. Thus, the <b>upper</b> <b>house</b> in colonial times often disagreed with the lower house, which was elected, tended to be more populist, and pushed for greater legislative power in the colony.|$|E
