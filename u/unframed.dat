The legs of the central figure are surrounded by small magenta horseshoe shapes, which infrared shows to have been first drafted as flowers. The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is <b>unframed,</b> a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{was not a}} {{religious}} man; he viewed the papacy {{as a means to}} consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished <b>unframed</b> in a Farnese cellar.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and <b>unframed</b> to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E

500|$|There is no {{consensus}} among scholars regarding the origin of sod construction on the Plains. [...] Some maintain that the inspiration came from the earth lodges of the local native peoples, including the Omahas and the Pawnees. [...] However, these earth lodges were circular in cross-section, and built upon heavy timber frameworks. [...] It has also been suggested {{that the idea of}} building with sod came from European immigrants, either Russian-Germans, who are known to have built rammed earth dwellings in the Plains, or immigrants from the British Isles, particularly from Ireland, where turf houses were built with stone foundations and frames to support the turf.

Alessandro's large collection of art and antiques, which included the Titian portraits commissioned by Paul, was eventually inherited by Elisabetta Farnese (1692–1766). Elisabetta, who married [...] Philip V of Spain in 1714, passed on the collection to her son Carlos, who became Duke of Parma and later King of Spain. In 1734, he conquered the kingdoms of Sicily and Naples, and the collection was transferred to Naples. In 1738 Carlos built the Palace of Capodimonte, which includes the Museo di Capodimonte, in part to house the Farnese art collection. The painting remains there today, hanging in the Farnese Gallery section. The Museo di Capodimonte was designated a national museum in 1950.|$|E

500|$|Three {{distinct}} construction phases {{are evident}} {{on the exterior}} of this pyramid. The first version of this pyramid {{was built in the}} latter half of the 3rd century AD; it was built in a forerunner of the talud-tablero style and had three levels. It stood [...] tall with sides that measured [...] at the base. It featured vertical <b>unframed</b> tableros that were painted black and a stairway flanked by balustrades. The stairway rose at an angle of 49° and projected [...] from the pyramid base. Three more construction phases took place in the Early Classic between AD 300 and 550; none of these three phases supported a masonry superstructure. Each of these phases was very similar, consisting mainly in an increase in the size of the building. Phase 2 had a basal surface area of the base of the third phase covered an area of , this increased to [...] in the fourth construction phase. The second phase of construction took place in the 4th century in a local variation of the talud-tablero style that only included framed tableros on the front of the pyramid, except for the upper level where the tableros extend around all four faces of the structure; it had four stepped levels. The third phase of construction maintained the previous versions talud-tablero variant and had five stepped levels. The fourth version of the pyramid once again had four stepped levels. The fifth phase of construction of this building took place between AD 550 and 700 and involved the construction of a new stairway on top of the previous version, although the older four-level stepped pyramid with talud-tablero sides was retained. The pyramid base now measured [...] on each side. The stairway was widened by covering the balustrades and the pyramid was heightened by [...] by the addition of two more talud-tablero-style levels. This resulted in a base height of a new summit shrine was built upon this, possessing three vaulted rooms and an elaborate roof comb. This construction phase took place around the same time that Temple V was built, the first of the major temples of Tikal, or slightly earlier. The shrine, in its final version, had three access doorways to the first chamber, which was [...] wide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} miniatures appeared <b>unframed</b> horizontally {{across the}} page {{in the middle of}} text, following Byzantine and Arabic precedents, but in the 14th century the vertical format was introduced, perhaps influenced by Chinese scroll-paintings. [...] This is used in all the luxury manuscripts for the court that constitute the most famous Persian manuscripts, and the vertical format dictates many characteristics of the style.|$|E
2500|$|In some of Paris' manuscripts, {{a framed}} {{miniature}} occupies {{the upper half}} of the page, and in others they are [...] "marginal" [...] – <b>unframed</b> and occupying the bottom quarter (approximately) of the page. Tinted drawings were an established style well before Paris, and became especially popular {{in the first half of}} the 13th century. [...] They were certainly much cheaper and quicker than fully painted illuminations. [...] The tradition of tinted drawings or outline drawings with ink supplemented by coloured wash was distinctively English, dating back to the Anglo-Saxon art of the mid-10th century, and connected with the English Benedictine Reform of the period. A strong influence on one branch of the style was the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter, which was at Canterbury from about 1000 to 1640. [...] This was copied in the 1020s in the Harley Psalter, and in the Eadwine Psalter of the mid-12th century.|$|E
40|$|Organizational life {{is replete}} with claims for emancipation. Existing {{approaches}} understand these claims either through theories of macro-emancipation (which focus on larger social structural challenges) or micro-emancipation (which focus on everyday challenges). However, these theories fundamentally misrecognize many emancipatory challenges in organizations. Drawing {{on the work of}} Jacques Rancière, we argue that this philosophy is fertile for shifting or <b>unframing</b> traditional approaches of emancipation in organization studies. Emancipation is triggered by the assertion of equality in the face of institutionalized patterns of inequality, it works through a process of articulating dissensus, and it creates a redistribution of what is considered to be sensible. By focusing on these three aspects, we argue that a whole range of emancipatory struggles which had previously been disregarded by studies of macro-emancipation and micro-emancipation come back into view. This significantly extends how we conceptualize emancipation in organizations and allows us to address some of the shortcomings of existing theories...|$|R
40|$|Immersion and Immersionskunst (immersive art or art of immersion) are {{relatively}} new terms. They originate from the discourses of contemporary computer art, where immersion into synthetic perceptual worlds {{has been a}} lively topic since the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. We are dealing, therefore, with an arts practice {{that has come to}} be called immersion. Immersion, in this context, means to engage with one’s immersion in artificial environments, assisted by technical equipment, for instance a virtual reality helmet or an electronic visor. Through these technologies, humans are finally taken seriously as beings for whom it is natural to immerse themselves – and not only in water, the ‘wet element’, but in elements and environments generally. The method has been common for some time, for instance in the context of pilots’ training in flight simulators; however, the modern problem of hallucination management and immersive change was already anticipated in nineteenth century panoramas. A core aspect of artificial immersion, as a phenomenon, is the potential replacement of whole environments – not only of the images, usually framed, one looks at in galleries. Immersion as a method <b>unframes</b> images and vistas, dissolving the boundaries with their environment...|$|R
40|$|Controlling the Imagination is an {{exploration}} of the tensions embedded in the notion of quality when it is used in relation to the teaching and managing of Adult Language, Literacy and Numeracy, with specific relation to 'Skills for Life' — New Labour's policy attempt, instigated in 1999, to improve the basic skills of adults living in England. The thesis offers an analysis that charts the development of discourses around quality from the vague and attractive transcendental quality of the 18 th C artisan to its object like textualisation in the Common Inspection Framework. Through critical discourse analysis and interview data with teachers and managers in further and adult education colleges graded as good or outstanding in their most recent ALI / OfSTED inspection, the text traces the contours along which practitioners experience the tension between quality-as-professional-aspiration in contrast to quality-as-demanded by policy. This axis, wrenched apart in several directions, is further complicated by the tension between quality-as-abstract and quality as embodied in day-to-day experience. I argue that practitioners talk about quality in ways that journey through these competing and contrasting meanings. In considering the implications of these ideas about quality, the thesis explores the research, policy and practice nexus. Research can inform policy and practice, but it can also lead to uncomfortable and unsettling conclusions that to some extent also <b>unframe</b> professional practice. Key concepts: quality, adult literacy, professionalism, policy, Skills for Life, basic skills, research and practice, further education,...|$|R

[...] Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been looted by the Nazis during the Second World War. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains Old Masters as well as Impressionist, Cubist, and Expressionist paintings by artists including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri Matisse, Franz Marc, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, and Max Liebermann, among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine Focus report the find. News of the discovery was reported worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, {{the head}} of the prosecutors' office in Augsburg, said that 121 framed and 1,258 <b>unframed</b> works had been seized from the {{apartment}} of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012, including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse. The art historian who first examined the collection, Meike Hoffmann, claimed in print in 2010 that [...] "not a single one" [...] of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. She stated to Focus that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich. At the time of the interview with Focus, she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives. Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.|$|E
2500|$|Mount Airy is {{composed}} of a massive two-story central block above a high basement, [...] long and [...] deep, two curving one-story passageways, and two -square two-story end dependencies set forward. [...] The five-part unit, [...] long, encloses three sides of a semi-circular forecourt. This court is raised by a low terrace above the entrance drive and is reached by cut and molded stone steps, flanked by elaborate carved stone vases on pedestals. Set on a ridge, the house commands a wide view of the Rappahannock River Valley. The [...] walls of the central unit are made of dark-brown sandstone, carefully hewn and laid in courses of random height, with architectural trim in light-colored limestone.

The north or entrance façade is approached from the forecourt by a flight of steps leading to a recessed loggia, whose square columns, faced with four Roman Doric pilasters, define three rectilinear openings. The projecting central pavilion is of rusticated limestone, with three windows in the second story and a crowning pediment. The south or garden facade is almost identical in composition except that the three entrances in the pavilion are spanned by round arches with heavily marked voussoirs and keystones, and the upper windows are <b>unframed.</b> The other windows are framed by stone architraves and sills, and the limestone belt course and rusticated angle quoins are very prominent.

40|$|Taking {{the wildly}} {{conflicting}} critical evaluations of Elizabeth Bowen 2 ̆ 7 s final novel, Eva Trout, or Changing Scenes (1969) as its starting-point, this essay argues against 2 ̆ 7 interpreting 2 ̆ 7 both {{the novel and}} its 2 ̆ 7 monstrous 2 ̆ 7 heroine in conventional representational terms, to argue, instead, for an appreciation, or experience, of both novel and protagonist as instantiations of a process of becoming along Deleuzian lines.
