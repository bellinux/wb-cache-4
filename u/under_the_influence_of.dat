5|$|In the 12th {{and early}} 13th centuries, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the Norman conquest, the herbals {{produced}} in Britain fell less <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> France and Germany and more that of Sicily and the Near East. This showed itself through the Byzantine-influenced Romanesque framed illustrations. Anglo-Saxon herbals {{in the vernacular}} were replaced by herbals in Latin including Macers Herbal, De Viribus Herbarum (largely derived from Pliny), with the English translation completed in about 1373.|$|E

5|$|After briefly {{moving over}} land, Keith turned north <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a {{trailing}} frontal trough. The storm became disorganized while recurving northeast {{because of increased}} vertical wind shear {{and the presence of}} cool dry air from its north. On November23, Keith made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, with winds of 65mph (100km/h), while most of its convection was well {{to the north of the}} center. Its landfall was the second latest on record for the Continental United States, only behind a hurricane in the 1925 season. The storm quickly weakened as it crossed Florida, and within hours the winds dropped to 40mph (65km/h). Reaching the Atlantic Ocean eight hours after moving ashore, Keith began to gradually re-intensify, and <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a very large upper-level low pressure area over Newfoundland, the storm accelerated northeast. On November24, the storm again reached its peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h), shortly before becoming an extratropical cyclone near Bermuda. Keith restrengthened and deepened into a powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining hurricane-force winds and a minimum pressure of 945mbar (27.92inHg). The extratropical storm turned westward and was last observed on November26 northeast of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> estrogen, the cervix undergoes {{a series of}} changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open {{in response to the}} higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
5|$|After the 1969 {{burglary}} {{of a house}} Hendrix was renting in Benedict Canyon, California, {{and while}} he was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> drugs and alcohol, he punched his friend Paul Caruso and accused him of the theft. He then chased Caruso away from the residence while throwing stones at him. A few days later, one of Hendrix's girlfriends, Carmen Borrero, required stitches after he hit her above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken, jealous rage.|$|E

WLG shows good potential for application in polymer flooding projects.|$|R

The individual may choke and asphyxiate or suffer an aspiration pneumonia.|$|R
5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} {{to accept his}} election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575km (355mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over {{the next few}} days the depression gradually developed and organised further, as it moved towards the west-southwest <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over {{the next few days}}, the system gradually intensified <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Prime Minister Menzies {{recommended}} that Playford be bestowed with {{a form of}} honours. Playford's wish was to be made a privy councillor, yet, while entirely possible, if granted {{it would lead to}} demands from other state Premiers. Playford's grandfather had declined a KCMG, and Playford himself did initially, but <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Menzies he eventually accepted the honour and was knighted in 1957, but this time a class above the KCMG; the GCMG.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current {{data suggest that the}} universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Further hazards {{exist in}} the form of snowpack on about half of the volcanoes; <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> {{pyroclastic}} flows, the snowpack can melt, generating dangerous lahars such as the one generated by the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia. This eruption claimed 23,000 fatalities, and lahars are a major cause of volcanic eruption associated fatalities.|$|E

The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E
