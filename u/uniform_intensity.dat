5000|$|Since {{the concept}} of a perfect point source object is so central to the idea of PSF, it's worth {{spending}} some time on that before proceeding further. First of all, {{there is no such thing}} in nature as a perfect mathematical point source radiator; the concept is completely non-physical and is nothing more than a mathematical construct used to model and understand optical imaging systems. The utility of the point source concept comes from the fact that a point source in the 2D object plane can only radiate a perfect uniform-amplitude, spherical wave — a wave having perfectly spherical, outward travelling phase fronts with <b>uniform</b> <b>intensity</b> everywhere on the spheres (see Huygens-Fresnel principle). Such a source of uniform spherical waves is shown in the figure below. We also note that a perfect point source radiator will not only radiate a uniform spectrum of propagating plane waves, but a uniform spectrum of exponentially decaying (evanescent) waves as well, and it is these which are responsible for resolution finer than one wavelength (see Fourier optics).

We define a new validity domain of the fronto-parallel assumption based on the local intensity variations in the 4 -neighborhood of the matching pixel. The preprocessing step smoothes low textured areas and sharpens texture edges, whereas the postprocessing step detects and recovers occluded and unreliable disparities. The algorithm achieves high stereo reconstruction quality in regions with <b>uniform</b> <b>intensities</b> {{as well as in}} textured regions.

The performance of our algorithm is evaluated on the Middlebury test bed stereo images.

These targets are to be irradiated with high-intensity proton beams. At present, plans are to use beam-expanded <b>uniform</b> <b>intensities</b> for the APT target, with possibly a small horizontal and vertical jitter superimposed.

Both beam optics designs are representative only, and independent of any other official designs that may exist within the design groups of the APT or NSNS project.
