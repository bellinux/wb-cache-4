5|$|May's {{squadron}} {{was attached}} as a direct-reporting unit {{to the newly}} promoted General Twiggs' 1st Texas Division, {{which was to be}} committed to the north side of Monterrey. On September 21, Taylor launched his attack on the city, but failed to synchronize his two forces. Poor Mexican leadership allowed the Americans to avert disaster, and after some intense <b>urban</b> <b>fighting,</b> General Ampudia offered Taylor an eight-week ceasefire that was highly favorable to the Mexicans. Taylor accepted, which caused President James K. Polk, furious at the agreement, to transfer most of his forces to Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Viet Cong {{began their}} third general {{offensive}} {{for the year}} on 17 August 1968, attacking dozens of towns and military installations throughout South Vietnam with rockets and mortars, including Saigon. As part of the allied response the Australians were deployed to defend Ba Ria, the provincial capital, while during 20–23 August, B and C Company, 1 RAR with a troop of Centurion tanks were involved in intense <b>urban</b> <b>fighting</b> while supporting South Vietnamese forces to clear a company-sized force from D445 VC Battalion occupying Long Dien. At least 17 Viet Cong were killed during the fighting, while Australian casualties included six wounded. During the next three weeks, all three Australian battalions were deployed on search-and-destroy operations, yet the Viet Cong successfully eluded them. Continuing until 30 September, the renewed offensive lacked {{the scale of the}} previous attacks and again resulted in heavy communist casualties, failing to produce lasting military gains and contributing to an overall decline in Viet Cong and North Vietnamese combat power in the south. Yet such failures were neither final nor decisive and Hanoi seemed to increasingly hold the upper hand. The war continued regardless, while allied military strategic objectives were increasingly coming into question. In late-1968 1 ATF was again deployed outside its base in Phouc Tuy, operating against suspected communist bases in the May Tao and Hat Dich areas as part of Operation Goodwood. The operation led to sustained fighting during a 78-day sweep between December 1968 and February 1969 and later became known as the Battle of Hat Dich.|$|E
25|$|Back at Phu Bai LtCol Cheatham was {{reviewing}} Marine <b>urban</b> <b>fighting</b> doctrine which recommended staying off {{the streets}} and moving forward by blasting through walls and buildings. He proceeded to gather the necessary equipment including M20 Bazookas, M40 106mm recoilless rifles mounted on M274 Mules, C-4 explosive, flamethrowers, tear gas and gas masks. This equipment was loaded onto a convoy which arrived at the MACV Compund at 1pm on 3 February, LtCol Cheatham then joined his Company commanders in Huế University and they proceeded to develop the tactics to be used in recapturing southern Huế.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fighting}} that continued {{the next day}} turned into urban warfare, where the police and army infantry had to fight for every house in the large villages of Vaksince and Lojane. The NLA resisted fiercely. A special police unit called the [...] "Tigers", who specialised in <b>urban</b> counter-guerrilla <b>fighting,</b> was also deployed.|$|R

25|$|The Israeli command sent {{in three}} thrusts {{consisting}} mainly of the reservist 5th Infantry Brigade {{from the town}} of Jenin to the north, as well as a company of the Nahal Brigade from the southeast and Battalion51 of the Golani Brigade from the southwest. The force of 1,000 troops also included Shayetet 13 and Duvdevan Unit special forces, the Armoured Corps, and Combat Engineers with armored bulldozer for neutralizing the roadside bombs that would line the alleys of the camp according to Military Intelligence. Anticipating the heaviest resistance in Nablus, IDF commanders sent two regular infantry brigades there, assuming they could take over the Jenin camp in 48–72 hours with just the one reservist brigade. The force's entry was delayed until April 2 due to rain. The 5th Infantry Brigade did not have any experience in close quarters combat and did not have a commander when Operation Defensive Shield started, since the last commander's service ended a few days earlier. His substitute was a reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel Yehuda Yedidia, who got his rank after the operation began. His soldiers were not trained for <b>urban</b> <b>fighting.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, {{a convoy}} from the 3rd Infantry Division, {{including}} the female American soldiers Jessica Lynch, Shoshana Johnson, and Lori Piestewa, was ambushed {{after taking a}} wrong turn into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Piestewa, were captured. Piestewa died of wounds shortly after capture, while the remaining five prisoners of war were later rescued. Piestewa, who was from Tuba City, Arizona, and an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe, was {{believed to have been}} the first Native American woman killed in combat in a foreign war. On the same day, U.S Marines from the Second Marine Division entered Nasiriyah in force, facing heavy resistance as they moved to secure two major bridges in the city. Several Marines were killed during a firefight with Fedayeen in the <b>urban</b> <b>fighting.</b> At the Saddam Canal, another 18 Marines were killed in heavy fighting with Iraqi soldiers. An Air Force A-10 was involved in a case of friendly fire that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle. Two other vehicles were destroyed when a barrage of RPG and small arms fire killed most of the Marines inside. A Marine from Marine Air Control Group 28 was killed by enemy fire, and two Marine engineers drowned in the Saddam Canal. The bridges were secured and the Second Marine division set up a perimeter around the city.|$|E
500|$|In February 1969, C Squadron was {{relieved}} by B Squadron. On 6–7 June, B Squadron {{was involved in}} a fierce action during the Battle of Binh Ba, a village [...] north of Nui Dat. The attack began on the morning of 6 June when Australian tanks and APCs advanced with infantry from D Company, 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5 RAR) towards the village which was being occupied by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese. As the battle continued, B Company, 5 RAR took up a blocking position to prevent them from escaping. During fierce <b>urban</b> <b>fighting</b> the infantry were forced to clear each house, while the Communist troops occupying the houses fired on them from the windows and doorways before retreating into tunnels as the Australians passed. Each time the infantry were fired on, the tanks would blast a hole in the wall of the building, through which small teams could then enter and clear the structure of any opposition. The fighting continued throughout the afternoon, and resumed the next day before the Australians successfully cleared the village, the bulk of which was destroyed. One Australian was killed and 10 wounded, while communist losses included at least 107 killed, six wounded and eight captured.|$|E

25|$|The Iraqi tank crews used old, cheap steel penetrators {{against the}} {{advanced}} Chobham Armour of these US and British tanks, with disastrous results. The Iraqi forces {{also failed to}} utilize the advantage that could be gained from using <b>urban</b> warfare— <b>fighting</b> within Kuwait City— which could have inflicted significant casualties on the attacking forces. Urban combat reduces the range at which fighting occurs and can negate some of the technological advantage that well equipped forces enjoy. Iraqis also tried to use Soviet military doctrine, but the implementation failed {{due to the lack}} of skill of their commanders and the preventive air strikes of the USAF and RAF on communication centers and bunkers.|$|R
5000|$|In Devil May Cry 2, {{the player}} guides either Dante or Lucia through an <b>urban</b> environment, <b>fighting</b> groups of monsters in fast-paced combat. The game {{consists}} of missions with specific {{goals in the}} play area of the game itself. The player's performance in each mission is ranked from D (poor/"Don't Worry") to S (excellent/"Showtime") based on the time taken to complete the mission, the amount of Red Orbs collected, the overall [...] "style" [...] displayed during fights, item usage, and damage taken. In contrast {{to the rest of}} the gameplay, the style judging system used in the game has been cited as being the harshest in terms of how it judges the player's performance.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the decades}} after World War II, machine pistols {{were used in}} close quarter combat where a rifle would be too unwieldy, such as in <b>urban</b> house-to-house <b>fighting</b> or in tunnels. In these contexts, machine pistols were viewed as [...] "room brooms", which could sweep a space with {{automatic}} fire. While training doctrines for machine pistols vary between armies, in general, soldiers are instructed to use the weapon for short bursts, rather than for an uninterrupted period of automatic fire, because the weapon easily gets {{out of control in}} sustained firing, which means that many of the rounds may be off target. As well, given the high rate of fire of machine pistols, sustained firing wastes ammunition and can easily deplete the magazine too quickly.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{the unit}} {{underwent}} a noticeable shift in training focus. New training {{was conducted in}} cordon and search operations, urban patrolling, and vehicle checkpoints. There has also been an increased emphasis on high intensity <b>urban</b> <b>fighting.</b>|$|E

This novel system, called the Battlefield Augmented Reality System (BARS), supports information presentation and entry for situation awareness in an <b>urban</b> war <b>fighting</b> setting. To our knowledge, {{this is the}} first time extensive use of usability engineering has been systematically applied to development of a real-world AR system. Our BARS team has applied a cost-effective progression of usability engineering activities from the very beginning of BARS development. We discuss how we first applied cycles of structured expert evaluations to BARS user interface development, employing user interface mockups representing occluded (non-visible) objects. Then we discuss how results of these evaluations informed our subsequent user-based statistical evaluations and formative evaluations, and present these evaluations and their outcomes. Finally, we discuss how and why this sequence of types of evaluation is cost-effective. 1...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) technology, a variety of embedded and mobile devices is integrated to interact via the platform of the Internet of Things, especially {{in the domain of}} smart cities. One of the primary challenges is that selecting the appropriate services or service combination for upper layer applications is hard, which is due to the absence of a unified semantical service description pattern, as well as the service selection mechanism. In this paper, we define a semantic service representation model from four key properties: Capability (C), Deployment (D), Resource (R) and IOData (IO). Based on this model, an agent-based middleware is built to support semantic service enablement. In this middleware, we present an efficient semantic service discovery and matching approach for a service combination process, which calculates the semantic similarity between services, and a heuristic algorithm to search the service candidates for a specific service request. Based on this design, we propose a simulation of virtual <b>urban</b> fire <b>fighting,</b> and the experimental results manifest the feasibility and efficiency of our design...|$|R
