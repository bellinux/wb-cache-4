25|$|To this end, the H {{class had}} a {{significantly}} different arrangement for its third cylinder. A German Henschel & Son conjugated valve gear mechanism, driven from the combination levers of the Walschaert valve gear for the <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders,</b> was utilised in favour of the Gresley mechanism. The inside cylinder was also positioned further forward of the <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders</b> and drove the leading coupled axle, with the <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders</b> driving the second coupled axle.|$|R
5000|$|The Gresley {{conjugated}} gear {{is effectively}} an adding machine, where {{the position of}} the valve for the inside cylinder is the sum of the positions of the two <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders,</b> but reversed in direction. It can also {{be thought of as a}} rocking lever between one <b>outside</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the inside cylinder, as is common on 4-cylinder steam locomotives, but with the pivot point being moved back and forth by a lever from the other <b>outside</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{enable a}} 3-cylinder or 4-cylinder {{locomotive}} {{to be built}} with only two sets of valve gear. The best known is Gresley conjugated valve gear, used on 3-cylinder locomotives. Walschaerts gear is usually used for the two <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Two levers connected to the <b>outside</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve rods drive the valve for the inside cylinder. Harold Holcroft devised a different method for conjugating valve gear by linking the middle cylinder to the combination lever assembly of an <b>outside</b> <b>cylinder,</b> creating the Holcroft valve gear derivative. On a 4-cylinder locomotive the arrangement is simpler. The valve gear may be inside or outside and only short rocking-shafts are needed to link the valves {{on the inside and}} <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, inside {{cylinders}} were {{widely used in}} the UK, but <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders</b> were more common in Continental Europe and the United States.

25|$|The {{earliest}} 0-6-0 locomotives had <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders,</b> {{as these}} were simpler {{to construct and}} maintain.

5000|$|The first {{locomotive}} of Class 9P {{to be built}} was costed at £5,871. The four cylinders had a bore of 16 in and {{a stroke}} of 26 in. They were set in line (like the LNWR Claughton Class), with the inside cylinders driving the front coupled axle, and the <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders</b> driving the middle coupled axle (like the GWR Star Class). The 8 in piston valves were actuated by two sets of Stephenson valve gear, mounted inside the frames and operating the valves of the <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders</b> through rocking shafts placed behind the cylinders. These rocking shafts caused the two valves on each side to move forwards and backwards together, and since the inside and <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders</b> on each side were out of phase by 180°, the valves of the <b>outside</b> <b>cylinders</b> were arranged for outside admission, instead of the normal inside admission layout. The boiler was the Gorton [...] "No. 7 Standard", which was already used on two other GCR 4-6-0 classes: Class 1 (LNER Class B2) and Class 1A (LNER Class B8); it would later be used on Class 9Q as well. In July 1928, this boiler was assigned to LNER Diagram 13.|$|R
