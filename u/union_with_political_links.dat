40|$|As prime {{minister}} and finance minister of Luxembourg over 30 years, Pierre Werner {{played a major role}} in the building of a united Europe. This Christian Democratic intellectual and committed federalist gained strong reputation as a consensus-builder between larger powers (Germany and France) and between diametrically opposed positions (‘economists’ and ‘monetarists’), as well as for his ideas on monetary integration. From early 1950 s, Werner advocates a European monetary system based on a currency unit and on a clearing house for central banks. In 1968 he delivered a clear roadmap to EMU founded on a symmetrical economic and monetary <b>union,</b> <b>with</b> <b>political</b> <b>union</b> as the ultimate goal. Werner’s vital input and the ‘effective parallelism’ principle he imagined, were evident in the Werner Report of 1970, which was offered as the blueprint for EMU in the EU.

In this article the authors describe the shortcomings of the sectoral social dia-logue in terms of inadequate national and European networks and the lack of binding force of its results. Social dialogue must aim to shape change and, by developing a stronger sectoral dimension, seek to take up more industrial policy topics with a view to reconciling competi-tiveness and social inclusion. An additional long-term orientation for the social dialogue, geared to triggering new developments by means of participation, can put in place the condi-tions for effective bargaining solutions.

3000|$|To {{analyze the}} {{representation}} of scientific uncertainty of nanotechnology {{in the media and}} to determine important topics and actors, a content analysis of science media coverage was conducted. As shown, the majority of content analysis includes only press coverage about nanotechnology. There is still a lack of investigations with respect to other media such as TV. These investigations are also important because in Europe, notably in Germany, TV is the most popular medium for science information[39]. Hence, in this study, we also analyze TV science magazines as well as newspapers and science journals. This enables us to examine a broader range of media coverage. Furthermore, it makes intermedial comparisons possible. This is interesting because journalistic aims can differ in different media: newspapers often cover current scientific topics <b>with</b> <b>political</b> <b>links</b> or scientific events such as prize giving on a daily basis, whereas TV science magazines and science journals often report background information and explanations about scientific topics. Therefore, the research questions for the media analysis are as follows: (4) How can the coverage patterns about scientific uncertainty and nanotechnology be characterized? (5) What role do environmental issues play in media coverage in particular? (6) Do the coverage patterns vary in different types of media? Finally, comparing the results of the media content analysis with the mentioned uncertainties in scientific literature, the following questions are addressed: (7) How can the discussion of scientific uncertainties be characterized? (8) Does media coverage represent any of the discussion on scientific uncertainty we identified in the scientific literature about the environmental fate of nanoparticles? [...]...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the determinants of the EMU sovereign spreads with emphasis on the effect of the global financial crisis of 2007 / 08. We are using econometric techniques that help us to distinguish short-term from the long-term effects of macro-fundamentals and international factors. The financial crisis has as consequence the rapid increase of spreads in some countries and as result it created Euro zone of two speeds. Our results suggest that spreads are determined significantly from both macroeconomic and international factors. Remarkable finding of our research is the outcome of our investigations for the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. Our results suggest that before the crisis financial markets occurred homogeneity in EMU spreads determinants. Although the increase of heterogeneity in our results showing that after the crisis investors started to reconsider the risk factors of each sovereign issuer. We form the assumption through our results that before the crisis EMU was consider as entity and the risks was equivalent among the members. From our research we can conclude that some sovereign issuers in the EMU were unreasonably priced with low spreads in the before-crisis period. The rapid grow of national debt was one of the consequences, which has as result the appearance of the possibility of economic collapse in some countries due the unsustainable amount of debt. It also raises questions about the viability of a monetary <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>political</b> sovereignty and not common fiscal policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{debate over}} labour market {{regulations}} in India is highly polarised. Advocates of labour market deregulation {{suggest that the}} labour law framework in the country confers disproportionate powers on workers and trade unions in the formal sector of the economy, resulting in industrial conflicts and poor productivity. Using workplace union survey data {{from the state of}} Maharashtra, this paper examines the veracity of these claims. Maharashtra is recognised as a state with a broadly pro-worker labour law framework. We find that even pro-worker labour laws at best offer only weak protection to workers and unions in the formal sector establishments. Unions find themselves increasingly vulnerable to employer hostility. We discuss these findings {{in the context of the}} role of state and judiciary in employment relations and of <b>union</b> <b>links</b> <b>with</b> <b>political</b> parties...|$|R

These matters are analysed through a database in Argentina where the governors historically have been powerful stakeholders; taken from non-edited autobiographic information for the period 1983 - 2014. Empiric evidence accounts for that provincial leaders possess certain social highlighted features: they are mostly middle aged men of urban middle class and developing traditional professions, most of them <b>with</b> <b>political</b> family <b>links.</b> On the other hand these governors, previous to the conquest of the governorship, depict three types of career modalities according to some data: focused in provincial bureaucracy, immerse in the national Congress and expanded from the municipal political level...|$|R

50|$|The tramways {{workers were}} {{initially}} seeking {{to end the}} new Condition of Services introduced by the Hong Kong Tramways. But the political elements eventually changed the focus to disputes between the management and <b>unions</b> <b>with</b> <b>political</b> background. In 1951, the Hong Kong government proposed {{that most of the}} workers' variable living allowance paid by their employers should be included as part of the basic wage. The Hong Kong Tramways then launched a new Condition of Services along with the new wage plan, stating that other than allowances, dismissal and retirement compensations would also be considered as part of the basic wage. Most of the workers were opposed to the new Condition of Services. The Hong Kong Tramway Workers' Union (HKTWU) even asked for mediation from the Labor Department with Hong Kong Tramways. The HKTWU, a member of the left-wing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions. After they announced their intention to mediate with Hong Kong Tramways through the Labour department, left-wing organisations and unions actively showed support to them. Considering the political background of HKTWU, the Hong Kong Tramways refused to attend mediation with HKTWU. Instead, they held a meeting with workers representatives, given that workers could not claim to be representatives of the HKTWU. These meetings went on for several months, and Hong Kong Tramways at last agreed to change mandatory participation in the new Condition of Services to voluntary-based participation. The Tramway workers gained success in the negotiation with Hong Kong Tramways, but HKTWU then requested recognition from Hong Kong Tramways, which turned the dispute into political means. The Hong Kong Tramways recognised another non-political Tramway workers' union, but refused to recognise the HKTWU, which led to discontents among HKTWU members and other left-wing organisations and unions. The conflict became more intense after three tramway workers were dismissed on 20 April 1952. The HKTWU met with Hong Kong Tramways, asking to restore the three workers' position. Lots of workers gathered outside the Russell Street tram depot, waiting for the result of the meeting. The meeting continued for two days. Two of the three workers were eventually reinstated.|$|R
