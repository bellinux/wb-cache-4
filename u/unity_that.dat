5|$|Meanwhile, {{efforts by}} Magnus to besiege Swedish-controlled Reval were faltering, {{with support from}} neither Ivan nor Magnus' brother, Frederick II of Denmark forthcoming. Ivan's {{attention}} was focused elsewhere, while Frederick's reluctance perhaps stemmed from a new spirit of Swedish–Danish <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> made him unwilling to invade Livonia on behalf of Magnus, whose state was a vassal of Russia. The siege was abandoned in March 1561, whereupon Swedish action in the Baltic escalated, with the passive backing of Sigismund, John's brother-in-law.|$|E
5|$|While militarily Habré {{was only}} partly {{successful}} {{in his attempt}} to evict the Libyans from the Tibesti (the Libyans would fully leave the region in March, when a series of defeats in the north-east had made the area untenable), the campaign was a great strategic breakthrough for the FANT, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> had never been seen before in Chad.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} the war {{delineated}} itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed {{the bulk of the}} scouting and fighting. This pattern was radically changed in 1986, {{towards the end of the}} war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> had never been seen before in Chad. This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Lafayette's tricolour cockade {{was adopted}} in July 1789, {{a moment of}} {{national}} <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> soon faded. Royalists began wearing white cockades and flying white flags, while the Jacobins, and later the Socialists, flew the red flag. The tricolour, which combines royalist white with republican red, {{came to be seen}} as a symbol of moderation and of a nationalism that transcended factionalism.|$|E

50|$|Concerning his {{harmonic}} language, Zampronha uses non-traditional but intelligible chords comprising many notes (from 6 to 18, or even more).

In this sense, the concept of dissonance is re-interpreted. Besides, specific sequences of these chords may generate a new-functionality producing direccionalities inside the work.|$|R

25|$|Despite their similarities, works {{produced}} by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was omnidirectional, growing {{like a tree}} with many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists would not necessarily fall under one another's influence. Despite a growing awareness, a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> would attain a maxima circa 1912, deep-seated differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers.|$|E

25|$|The entire {{capitalist}} system thus {{appears as a}} hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as {{the outcome of the}} uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, but it is an integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and it is precisely the <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> here determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and underdevelopment reciprocally determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.|$|E
25|$|Another {{extension}} {{was added}} {{on the west}} side into Foster Place, designed in 1787 by another architect, Robert Parke; while matching Gandon's portico, he tried a different and less successful solution, linking the other portico to the main Pearce one by a set of Ionic pillars. The result proved unattractive. When the Bank of Ireland took over the building, it created an architectural unity by replacing this set of Ionic columns by a curved wall similar to that built on the east side by Gandon. Ionic columns were then added to both curved walls, giving the extensions an architectural and visual <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> had been lacking and producing the building's exterior as it is today.|$|E

A series of six acts was passed by the Legislative Council, heavily restricting civil liberties. Added to the wartime emergency provisions, Wallace-Johnson could be arrested without justification. A trial was held without a jury (most of the jurors were WAYL supporters and probably would not vote for a conviction), and Wallace-Johnson was sentenced to 12 months in prison, eventually arriving at Sherbro Island. He was released in 1944. He returned to political activism, but found the WAYL in a state of disarray where tribal and regional issues, rather than the cause of <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> he championed, flourished. nevertheless he was the representative of the WAYL at the foundation of the Pan-African Federation, held in Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1944.|$|E

25|$|In Los Angeles, {{clothing}} {{is an important}} marker for Filipino street gangs and gang members. After 1965, Los Angeles {{became one of the}} largest cities of Filipino immigrants which saw a massive migration of Filipino youth. To combat Mexican gang members, Filipino gangs arose. The Satana gang fused styles of the Philippines with those of other fashions, particularly cholo fashion among the Latino neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Satana members used the cholo style of dress as inspiration, as well as the jefrox style popularized in Manila. The jefrox style was typically associated with counterculture elements such as long hair and Rock and roll music. The hybrid of both jefrox and cholo styles resulted in brushed hair, the use of nets and bandanas, open toed sandals, and loose fitting shirts. Some Satana members preferred wearing khakis with significant creases as an homage to the Manong generation of the 1920’s and 1930’s. These khakis were deliberately worn to showcase the <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> the younger generations had with the Filipino laborers of the 1930’s who originally came to California. By the eighties and nineties, Filipino gang members quickly adopted the cholo style of Latino youth. Satana gang members wore loose fitting, baggy pants that were fully black in conjunction with white t-shirts and pendletons. Styles of dress varied, however, even among gangs. The Satana homeboys of the mid-Wilshire and Temple areas of Los Angeles were Filipinos from all economic backgrounds, from lower class to upper class families. Members from a wealthier background were easily identifiable, as they wore luxury clothes reminiscent of the “Manong” generation. Overall, men and women sought to wear brand name clothing such as Tommy Hilfiger and Nautica, who had significant presence in the hip-hop fashion community in the nineties. Filipino men chose to wore ill-fitting clothes while Filipina women chose to wear more revealing clothing. Items such as clothing played a role in how Filipino youth identified themselves, especially in inner city areas.|$|E

500|$|When Monteverdi {{composed}} L'Orfeo he had {{a thorough}} grounding in theatrical music. He had been employed at the Gonzaga court for 16 years, {{much of it as}} a performer or arranger of stage music, and in 1604 he had written the ballo Gli amori di Diane ed Endimone for the 1604–05 Mantua Carnival. The elements from which Monteverdi constructed his first opera score—the aria, the strophic song, recitative, choruses, dances, dramatic musical interludes—were, as conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt has pointed out, not created by him, but [...] "he blended the entire stock of newest and older possibilities into a <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> was indeed new". Musicologist Robert Donington writes similarly: [...] " [...] contains no element which was not based on precedent, but it reaches complete maturity in that recently-developed form ... Here are words as directly expressed in music as [...] wanted them expressed; here is music expressing them ... with the full inspiration of genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Another Hemingway scholar, Jim Berloon, {{disagrees with}} Tetlow, writing that its only unity {{consists}} of similarities in tone and {{style and the}} recurrence of the Nick Adams character. Although the first vignettes share a common thread about the war, each is distinctly framed, weakening any structural <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> might have existed. He blames the war, {{saying that it was}} too hard for Hemingway to write about it cohesively, that it was [...] "too large, terrible, and mentally overwhelming to grasp in its entirety". Instead, he says, Hemingway wrote fragments, [...] "discrete glimpses into hell... like the wreckage of battle lit up from a shell burst at night." [...] The structure apparent in the 1924 collection of vignettes is lost in the later edition because the short stories seem to bear little if any relationship to the interchapters, shattering the carefully constructed order. The sense of discordance is intensified because the action is about unnamed men and soldiers, only referred to with pronouns, and unspecified woundings. The characters are transformed through circumstances and settings, where danger exists overtly, on the battlefield, or, in one case, by a chance sexual encounter in a Chicago taxi.|$|E
500|$|The {{ruins of}} the Bastille rapidly became iconic across France. Palloy had an altar {{set up on the}} site in February 1790, formed out of iron chains and {{restraints}} from the prison. Old bones, probably of 15th century soldiers, were discovered during the clearance work in April and, presented as the skeletons of former prisoners, were exhumed and ceremonially reburied in Saint-Paul's cemetery. In the summer, a huge ball was held by Palloy on the site for the National Guardsmen visiting Paris for the 14 July celebrations. A memorabilia industry surrounding the fall of the Bastille was already flourishing and as the work on the demolition project finally dried up, Palloy started producing and selling memorabilia of the Bastille. Palloy's products, which he called [...] "relics of freedom", celebrated the national <b>unity</b> <b>that</b> the events of July 1789 had generated across all classes of French citizenry, and included a very wide range of items. Palloy also sent models of the Bastille, carved from the fortress's stones, as gifts to the French provinces at his own expense to spread the revolutionary message. In 1793 a large [...] featuring a statue of Isis was built on the former site of the fortress, which became known as the Place de la Bastille.|$|E
