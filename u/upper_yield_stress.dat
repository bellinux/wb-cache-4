40|$|A {{survey is}} {{presented}} of earlier investigations concerning {{the effect of}} temperature on the static and dynamic strength properties of iron and steel. Results are given of static and dynamic tests performed on a medium-carbon steel at temperatures ranging from + 15 °C to - 183 °C. Also investigated {{is the effect of}} various amounts of permanent dynamic strain on the subsequent static and dynamic properties of the steel. A correlation {{of the results of the}} above tests with the various mechanisms of deformation is permitted by photomicrographic examination of the tested specimens. Finally the results of the dynamic tests are compared with a delay-time theory. In order to be able to measure the true specimen strains in the low temperature static tests, a low temperature strain gauge was developed. This gauge, which incorporates wire resistance strain gauges, was used to find static stress-strain curves at a number of temperatures. From the variation of static <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> with test temperature an estimate of σ 0, the yield stress at absolute zero, is obtained. This value of σ 0 is used in comparing the results of the dynamic tests with a delay-time theory. It is also shown that as the test temperature is lowered the slip by which the ferrite deforms in the static tests becomes finer. The dynamic apparatus employed in this investigation was such that eccentricity of loading was reduced to a minimum. A falling weight was used to apply compressive stress waves of the order of 10 5 lb. /in. 2 and duration 110 microseconds to the test specimens. Fire resistance strain gauges were used to obtain stress time records at points on a weighbar and on an anvil bar, just above and just below the specimen faces. From these records a method of wave analysis gives stress against time and particle velocity against time curves for both faces of the specimen. Using these derived curves dynamic stress-strain curves are found at various impact velocities and test temperatures. These stress-strain curves indicate the large increase in strength of the steel under such loading conditions – the dynamic stress-strain curves being from 100 to 200 higher than the room temperature static stress-strain curve. A further comparison of the above curves shows that for identical velocities of impact, as the test temperature is lowered the time to yield, and upper and lower yield stresses increase, whereas the permanent deformation, the ratio of dynamic <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> to static <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> at the same temperature, and the maximum and average strain rates all decrease. It is also found that in dynamic tests deformation occurs primarily by very fine slip. However, in some of the low temperature impacts twinning also occurs. Results indicate that the stress at which twins are initiated is approximately independent of temperature and strain rate. It is thought that for the medium carbon steel under test, this stress for twin formation is in the range 121, 000 lb. /in. 2 to 128, 000 lb. /in 2. The yield stress, delay-time results obtained in the dynamic tests are compared with Campbell's delay-time theory. This theory, which assumes that yield will occur when a critical number of source dislocations have been released from their atmospheres of carbon and nitrogen, is found to be in fair agreement with the experimental results. The greatest discrepancy between the theory and the results obtained occurs at the lower test temperatures. This is attributed mainly to twin formation. It is found that the effect of deforming the steel dynamically is to render it softer for subsequent static deformation of the same type. In particular the static <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is reduced to a minimum after about 1 permanent dynamic strain. Also it is found that the effect of 'pulsing' steel, i. e. subjecting it to a rapidly applied stress of insufficient magnitude and duration to cause yielding, is to reduce the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> obtained during static reloading. The effect of dynamic deformation at a low temperature on the subsequent static stress-strain curve is also considered. It is found that the static stress-strain curve obtained after an impact is little affected by lowering the test temperature, provided that the magnitude and duration of the impact stress are increased so as to obtain the same permanent strain. It is also shown that 'pulsing' the steel lowers the dynamic <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> obtained in a subsequent impact test. It is found that the effect of a given stress pulse is greater on the subsequent dynamic <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> than it is on the subsequent static <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> Also, whereas after a small amount of permanent dynamic strain an upper yield point is still evident in a static retest, in a dynamic retest the yield point has almost been eliminated. Finally, repeated impact tests appear to indicate that Campbell's criterion for yielding, i. e. that a critical number of dislocations must be released from their atmospheres, is approximately valid whether or not the dislocations are freed in one or several impacts, provided that no strain ageing occurs between tests. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} mechanisms {{controlling the}} pre-failure stress-strain behavior of frozen sands are investigated in triaxial compression. The pre-failure, or small strain behavior (Ea<l%), {{is represented by}} the initial stiffness (Young's modulus) and the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> a very distinctive yield point representing the onset of large unrecoverable plastic strains. An extensive experimental program was conducted on a number of ice-saturated particulate systems to investigate the dependency of these two parameters on volume fraction, stress level, strain rate, and temperature, as well as on particle size, stiffness, roughness, shape, and interfacial bond strength. Theories for composite material behavior are employed to analyze the observed stress-strain-time-temperature behavior. The stress-strain behavior has been measured in a high-pressure, low-temperature automated triaxial compression testing system. Strain was evaluated using a novel on-specimen measurement device capable of consistently resolving displacements of less than 0. 1 microns, corresponding to strains of less than 0. 0002 % for specimens measuring 3. 6 cm x 7. 6 cm. Very precise temperature and strain rate control systems contributed to the reliability of the small strain measurements at confining pressures up to 10 MPa. Experimental findings show that the Young's modulus of frozen soils varies significantly with particle modulus and increases slightly with particle volume fraction, but does not change with strain rate and temperature. The development of stiffness, however, relies heavily on the extent of coupling between phases for the effective transfer of shear stress. This coupling can take the form of an adhesional bond or a frictional bond. In natural sand systems, shear stress is transferred through surface roughness and particle angularity and consequently the presence of an adhesional bond is not important. However, adhesional bonding is much more important in systems composed of smooth spherical particles. Application of reinforcement theories for two-phase particulate composites has led to a new approach for predicting the Young's modulus of frozen sand. The <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> behavior is controlled primarily by strain rate, temperature, and particle grain size, and for fully-bonded materials, is essentially independent of particle volume fraction and stress level. In the absence of an adhesional bond, however, the degree of surface roughness and stress level affect the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the system, showing the importance of coupling in this region as well. The qualitative behavior of the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> relative to polycrystalline ice can be explained by examining the influence of ice-particle interaction on the nature of cracks propagating through the ice matrix. by Gregory Da Re.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the initiation of brittle fracture and the nature of discontinuous yielding in small plastic enclaves in an annealed mild steel. <b>Upper</b> and lower <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> data have been obtained from unnotched specimens and nominal fracture stress data have been obtained from specimens of two scale factors and two grain sizes over a range of nominal stress rates from 10 ^ 2 to 10 ^ 7 lb/in. ^ 2 sec at - 111 °F and - 200 °F. The size and shape of plastic enclaves near the notches were revealed by an etch technique. A stress analysis utilizing slip-line field theory in the plastic region has been developed for the notched specimen geometry employed in this investigation. The <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the material in the plastic enclaves near the notch root has been correlated with the lower <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measured on unnotched specimens through a consideration of the plastic boundary velocity under dynamic loading. A maximum tensile stress of about 122, 000 lb/in. ^ 2 at the instant of fracture initiation was calculated with the aid of the stress analysis for the large scale specimens of ASTM grain size 8 1 / 4. The plastic strain state adjacent to a plastic-elastic interface has been shown to cause the maximum shear stress to have a larger value on the elastic than the plastic side of the interface. This characteristic of dis continuous yielding is instrumental in causing the plastic boundaries to be nearly parallel to the slip-line field where the plastic strain is of the order of the Lüder's strain. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the simple}} plastic theory {{commonly}} used for mild steel {{it is assumed}} that after yielding has occurred in either tension or compression, straining can continue indefinitely at constant stress. Such au assumption has been found satisfactory for low carbon steels having a plastic range corresponding to eight to ten times the strain a t yield, but for steels of greater strength th is range is often considerably shorter, and it becomes necessary {{to take into account the}} strain-hardening range beyond. To obtain experimental data, four steels were selected, varying in carbon content from 0. 28 to 0. 89 per cent, and having widely different stress-strain relations. For each steel a number of simply supported beams of square section were subjected to a symmetrical two-point loading; tension specimens were prepared from the unyielded ends of these beams and tested in a spring-loaded autographic testing machine to determine upper and lower yield stresses. In addition, two tension specimens from each steel were tested in a lever type of machine, and the strt%ss-strain relations through the plastic range and the initial stages of the strain-hardening range were obtained with the aid of a “Gerard ” extensometer. This information gave good support to the theoretical work, whereby the behaviour of these steels in flexure can be correlated with the tensile properties.

First, an elaborated analytical solution to model equations is achieved, which describes the shape of peak at stress-strain curves. However, the Alexander-Haasen model of the dislocation multiplication, qualitatively good, does not describe some features of the phenomenon, for example, the great difference in values of upper yield stresses for Czochralski and for floating zone grown silicon crystals. Therefore, in second, the model is generalized {{taking into account the}} effect of the solute dragging.

The magnitude of the stresses in the short duration stress-pulses was greater than the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> The material was aged at various temperatures between stress-pulses, and the effect of the time of aging on the number of stress-pulses to induce yielding was determined. Plastic and anelastic microstrain of 4 x 10 [superscript - 6] in. /in. to 37 x 10 [superscript - 6] in. /in. is observed prior to the onset of yielding in rapidly applied constant stress tests and in repeated stress-pulse tests. The relation between equilibrium microstrain and stress is determined for stresses below the static <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> Aging of the specimens for a sufficient length of time at a given temperature between stress-pulses induces recovery in the material such that yielding does not occur in repeated stress-pulse and aging cycles. The activation energy of the recovery process corresponds, within the limits of the experimental accuracy, to the activation energies of carbon and nitrogen diffusion in the material. These effects are discussed in terms of the dislocation theory of yielding. The recovery process is attributed to the diffusion of carbon and nitrogen to dislocations which have been displaced, thus stabilizing the array of dislocations for the particular stress condition. Equilibrium microstrain produced by a particular configuration of dislocations is theoretically investigated. An electrostatic analogy of the dislocation model is used in estimating the microstrain. Comparison of the theory and the experimental data leads to the determination of a characteristic length of dislocation which agrees with previous concepts of a mosaic block structure.

40|$|Propagation of {{plane strain}} shear cracks is {{calculated}} numerically by using finite difference equations with second-order accuracy. The rupture model, in which stress drops gradually as slip increases, combines two different rupture criteria: (1) slip begins at a finite stress level; (2) finite energy is absorbed {{per unit area}} as the crack advances. Solutions for this model are nonsingular. In some cases {{there may be a}} transition from rupture velocity less than Rayleigh velocity to rupture velocity greater than shear wave velocity.

A solution for this model can be represented as a convolution of a singular solution having abrupt stress drop with a 'rupture distribution function.

If the solution for abrupt stress drop has an inverse square root singularity at the crack tip, as it does for sub-Rayleigh rupture velocity, then the rupture velocity of the convolved solution is independent of the rupture distribution function and depends only on the fracture energy and crack length. On the other hand, a crack with abrupt stress drop propagating faster than the shear wave velocity has a lower-order singularity.

For the former, adequate experimental protocols need to be employed that take into account the time evolution of these materials: ageing and shear rejuvenation. This solves the problem of experimental determination of the <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> Also, we show that true <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> materials indeed exist, and in addition, we account for shear banding that is generically observed in <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> fluids...|$|R

Therefore, {{it is desirable}} to investigate the different factors influencing compaction induced <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> {{and to develop a}} quick mechanism to predict the compaction induced <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> There are many factors which can affect the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> like unit weight, water content, Atterberg’s limits, and grain size. However, modest data is available on these influencing factors in the past literature. Prakash et al. [9] only discussed the effect of dry unit weight and water content on <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> Therefore, further investigation is required on the influencing factors of <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} rheological {{characterization of}} mine tailings and paste materials as saturated solid-liquid or homogenous mixtures. Thickened tailings and paste fill {{can be classified}} as viscoplastic or time-independent non-Newtonian fluid material. Viscoplastic fluids deform plastically when the applied shear stress {{is less than a}} critical stress, which is known as "yield stress". When the shear <b>stress</b> exceeds the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> this type of fluid flows like a viscous material with finite viscosity. In terms of pipeline design for transportation of mine tailings or paste material, {{one of the most important}} rheological parameters that must be measured would be <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> There are numerous techniques and equipment that can be used for rheological characterization and specifically for <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measurements. Literature review shows that the vane method is one of the best rheometery techniques for determining the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of homogeneous fluids directly. There is also a method for calculating the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> from slump height. Any geometry of slump moulds, cone or cylinder, with different dimensions can be applied in this method. The standard conical slump test is basically used for controlling the workability of fresh concrete. This method was then modified for <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and viscosity calculation of cemented mixtures. These slump tests can be categorized as in-situ methods of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measurements. Several rheometery and in-situ experiments were carried out to measure the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of two mine tailings samples in this study. A rheometer was used in controlled shear rate and controlled shear <b>stress</b> modes for <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measurements with the vane method. The results were satisfactory for cemented and non-cemented mixtures. The effect of mixing time on the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of material combined with cement was also assessed using the vane method. No significant difference emerged between increased <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the mixtures after 4 minutes and 12 minutes of mixing. The accuracy of calculated <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> values using in-situ methods was also determined by drawing comparisons between these series of data and actual <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> measured using a rheometer. Modified conical slump tests overestimated the values of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and did not obtain reliable data for viscosity calculation of the mixtures...|$|R

It was observed that <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> values increase {{by the addition}} of graphene, shear rate range and resting time, however, decreased with the addition of super-plasticizer. Generally, in concentric cylinders, Bingham model determined the highest <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> values and HB model determined the lowest values. However, for the parallel plates, Modified Bingham model determined the highest <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> values, followed by Bingham, HB and Casson model. It is important to mention here that; smooth parallel plates and concentric cylinders were used in this research study. Therefore, due to slippage effect and surface friction (Nehdi and Rahman 2004), low <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> values were found. Variation of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> with graphene content, mathematical models, resting time, superplasticizer content, shear rate cycle and test geometries is further discussed in following subsections.|$|R
40|$|The <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of many <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> fluids {{has turned}} out to be {{difficult}} to determine experimentally. This has led to various discussions in the literature about those experimental difficulties, and the usefulness and pertinence of the concept of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> fluids. We argue here that most of the difficulties disappear when taking the thixotropy of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> fluids into account, and will demonstrate an experimental protocol that allows reproducible data to be obtained for the critical stress necessary for flow of these fluids. As a bonus, we will show that the interplay of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and thixotropy allows one to account for the ubiquitous shear localization observed in these materials. However, due to the thixotropy the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is no longer a material property, since it depends on the (shear) history of the sample. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|The {{stability}} of petroleum coke water slurry (PCWS) {{is currently a}} hot topic. The inherent relationship between <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and {{stability of}} bubble-PCWS was studied through orthogonal experiments and range analysis in this work. The {{results showed that the}} stability of bubble-PCWS was positively related to the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and that the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> could be greatly impacted by the operation conditions during preparation of bubble-PCWS. The main factors affecting the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of bubble-PCWS were solid concentration, aeration time and dosage of frother. However, the effects of aperture size of air distribution plates and type of frother on the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> were slight within the experimental range. The optimal conditions for the greatest <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> were as follows: aeration time of 30  min, solid concentration of 65  wt%, frother dosage of 0.030  wt% of the air-dried pulverized petroleum coke, aperture size of air distribution plate of 2 – 5  μm and AOS frother. The <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and the pour rate of bubble-PCWS under this optimum operation condition could reach maxima of more than 0.4  Pa and 96 %, respectively.|$|R

Advocates of the true <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> picture have demonstrated that the effective viscosity increases very rapidly as the stress is decreased towards the <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> Opponents have shown that this viscosity increase levels off, and that the material behaves as a Newtonian fluid of very high viscosity below the <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally (on four different materials, using three different rheometers, five different geometries, and two different measurement methods) that the low-stress Newtonian viscosity is an artifact that arises in non steady state experiments. For measurements as long as 10, 000 seconds {{we find that the}} value of the 'Newtonian viscosity' increases indefinitely. This proves that the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> exists and marks a sharp transition between flowing states and states where the steady state viscosity is infinite -a solid!Comment: 5 pages including 4 figures.
