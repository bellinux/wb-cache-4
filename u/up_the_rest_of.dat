5|$|Descriptions {{from early}} explorers and {{settlers}} give {{some idea of}} what the Pine Creek Gorge was like before it was clearcut. The forest was up to 85percent hemlock and white pine; hardwoods made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the forest. The area was inhabited by a large number of animal species, many of which have vanished {{by the end of the}} 20th century. A herd of 12,000American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, bobcats and foxes; all are locally extinct except for the last three as of 2007. The area had herds of elk and deer, and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks that they had to sleep in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same.|$|E

He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain.

5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi turned right to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare for a late attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be investigated by the stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the field. Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to pass him. A glass bottle appeared {{on the outside of the}} track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow racing to continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 which meant he fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to concerts specifically {{devoted to the}} Final Fantasy series, music from the games has been performed at many other concerts and concert series. Music from the series was played {{in the first four}} concerts of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra's Orchestral Game Music Concerts series from 1991 to 1994, and each concert has been released on an album. Outside Japan, Final Fantasy music was played {{for the first time at}} the Symphonic Game Music Concert series, a series of annual German video game music concerts starting in August 2003. It has also been played live by the Australian Eminence Symphony Orchestra since October 2003, an independent symphony orchestra specializing in classical music from video games and in the Video Games Live concert tour from 2005 to date as well as the Play! A Video Game Symphony world tour from 2006 onwards, for which Nobuo Uematsu composed the opening fanfare that accompanies each performance. The music made up one fourth of the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in September 2009 and in 2012 which were produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series and conducted by Arnie Roth; music from the Chrono series, the Kingdom Hearts series, and the Mana series made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the concert.|$|E

5|$|Navigation {{through the}} rocks {{of the bay}} had been difficult, and {{as she entered the}} bay Amazones rudder had been torn away, {{rendering}} the ship unmanoeuverable. With Amazone trapped, Macnamara called <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Cherbourg squadron, the frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and the brig-sloops HMS Goshawk under Commander James Lilburn and HMS Hawk under Commander Henry Bourchier. This force was required to remain a substantial distance offshore as the rocky coastline posed a considerable danger to the British ships. Macnamara's plan was to wait for high tide and then bring the squadron closer inshore to bombard the French frigate into surrender. As they waited, the squadron was joined by Niobe from the Le Havre under Captain John Wentworth Loring. At 16:00 the tides were optimal for the attack and Niobe, Amelia and Berwick sailed into the bay. However, Rosseau had situated Amazone in a strong position, protected from close attack by rocks and shoals and in consequence the British ships could only fire as they wore around, resulting in scattered and inaccurate fire. As they advanced, the British ships came under fire from Amazone, which killed one sailor on Berwick and killed one and wounded another on Amelia, while the British fire had no effect on the French ship. At 18:00, Macnamara withdrew his ships from the bay, all three vessels having suffered considerable damage to their rigging and sails from Amazones shot.|$|E
5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{divides the}} waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three {{freshwater}} ecoregions, naming them Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making up {{about a third of the}} total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay rivers. The effects of glaciation include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above Shoshone Falls, which totally blocks fish migration. This region has 14species of fish, many of which are endemic. The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity. There are 35species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk endemism.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The track was dusty when the first practice sessions were held; grip was poor and some drivers were forced onto the run-off areas after they slid off the track. Hamilton set the pace in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 40.887 seconds; almost one-tenth of a second quicker than Kubica. Rosberg and Michael Schumacher set the third- and sixth-fastest times respectively for Mercedes; they were separated by Vettel and Button. Webber was seventh quickest, ahead of Nick Heidfeld. The two Williams drivers completed the top ten; Nico Hülkenberg was ahead of Rubens Barrichello. Hispania driver Bruno Senna spun at turn nine after his left rear suspension broke and stopped on the track without hitting the barriers. Grip was improved for the second practice session, in which Webber set a time of 1:37.942—the quickest of the day—despite spinning late in the session. Alonso was second-quickest and Hamilton was third. Kubica set the fourth-quickest time. Button, who was sidelined for most of the session with an overheated exhaust, was fifth. Massa, Vettel, Vitaly Petrov, Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the top ten. Sakon Yamamoto in the other Hispania car caused the session to be suspended after spinning and stopping his car at turn sixteen.|$|E

5|$|By Christmas Eve 1941, No.1 Squadron {{had five}} {{serviceable}} aircraft. Together with No.8 Squadron RAAF, also equipped with Hudsons, it was tasked with maritime patrols {{to the east}} of Singapore. On 26January 1942, two of the squadron's Hudsons spotted a Japanese convoy heading for Endau, on the east coast of Malaya. It was decided to attack the convoy with all possible strength, including four Hudsons from No.1 Squadron and five from No.8 Squadron, together with obsolete Vickers Vildebeest and Fairey Albacore biplanes of Nos.36 and 100 Squadrons RAF, and with what little fighter escort could be found. The convoy was strongly defended by Japanese fighters, and although all nine Hudsons returned to Singapore, several were badly shot <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the strike force did not fare as well; 11 Vildebeests, two Albacores, two Hudsons (of No.62 Squadron RAF) and three fighters were lost. By the end of the month, No.1 Squadron had withdrawn to airfield P.2 on Sumatra, along with several other Commonwealth units including No.8 Squadron. It continued to attack Japanese bases in Malaya and convoys in the Dutch East Indies, relocating to Semplak, Java, in mid-February. At Semplak it took over the Hudsons of No.8 Squadron and No.62 Squadron RAF, giving it a strength of 25 aircraft; at one stage it was to be renumbered as an RAF squadron, but this never occurred. Heavily outnumbered by Japanese air units, which raided Allied bases with impunity, No.1 Squadron suffered heavy losses and was ordered to withdraw its four remaining Hudsons to Australia on 2March 1942, disbanding soon after. Although 120 of the squadron's personnel were evacuated from Java, 160 men including the commanding officer, Wing Commander Davis, were unable to escape and were taken prisoner by the Japanese; less than half survived captivity.|$|E
