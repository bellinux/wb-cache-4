Fluorophosphates were observed by {sup 19 }F and {sup 31 }P NMR in the electrolyte obtained from a Gen 2 cell aged 72 weeks at 45 C and presenting 50 % power fade. These electrolyte decomposition products were also observed by {sup 31 }P solid-state NMR {{on the surface of}} the cathode of the same cell. Samples were cut from the aged cathode from the original cell, subjected to different treatments (<b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> in anhydrous DMC, pressing, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> and pressing), and subsequently reassembled into small lab cells for electrochemical characterization. These treatments recovered the capacity of the electrodes to within a few percent of the original value, with the most improvement being obtained with the washed and pressed cathode. The impedance of the cathodes was also lowered after the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> and pressing treatments. Electron microscopy revealed that the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> of the aged Gen 2 cathode material resulted in the removal of small particles covering the surface of the active cathode.

40|$|Process Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop an efficient washing system to remove cutting oil from machining part surface. The proposed washing system consists of two processes: the dipping process and the modified automatic <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> process. The automatic <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> process is redesigned and developed to reduce operating cost and increase productivity from the previously developed machine. For this proposed system, experiments have been performed to determine the washing conditions that yield satisfactory proportion of defectives due to oil contamination. Under the suggested operating conditions, the proportion of defectives due to oil contamination is reduced from 12. 8 % to 1. 78 %, which leads to $ 16, 800 defective cost reduction. The proposed washing system yields 42. 9 % increase in washing productivity. Furthermore, it as has more standard procedure than the current washing process...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{technology}} is a promising tool for washing oily sludge to recover oil. In this study, the influence of ultrasonic conditions on the removal of different oil components from oily sludge was investigated to optimize <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> technology. Among the three frequencies (25, 50 and 100 kHz) applied, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> at 25 kHz exhibited the best performance in terms of oil extraction rate and efficiency. An ultrasonic intensity of 0. 33 W/cm(2) was necessary to overcome the energy threshold for oil washing. Application of a standing wave or dual frequencies did not improve the oil removal performance perceptibly. The optimum conditions {{for the removal of}} oil from oily sludge were an ultrasonic frequency of 25 kHz, intensity of 0. 33 W/cm(2) and sludge/water ratio of 1 / 2 (in volume). Thin-layer chromatographic flame ionization detection showed that ultrasonication could overcome high energy thresholds, resulting in an increase in the removal of asphaltenes and resins, with the removal of asphaltenes particularly affected by frequency.

40|$|Purpose: The {{demand of}} natural and {{eco-friendly}} products have undergone tremendous growth after the awareness and realization of global ecological concerns. In this study {{we have used a}} novel product (organic cotton) and a novel system (ultrasonic), both having critical importance to environmental pollution. Cotton {{is one of the oldest}} and most abundant natural, biodegradable and renewable fibres. Although numerous synthetic fibres have been produced, cotton is still the most important fibre because of its unique physical properties like durability, strength and absorbency, furthermore, only 10 % of the raw weight is lost during processing. Organic farming does not have any negative impact due to its natural growing abilities, in which the seeds genetic are not modified and no chemicals such as disinfect or fertilizer are used. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> has many advantages such as the extra cleanliness of textile materials, reducing process time, energy and chemicals which are used in the washing process. In addition ultrasonic agitation brings less fibre migrations than conventional washing. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental section reports on the characterization of the organic and conventional cotton that were washed by using an ultrasonic process. Both of the cotton types that used in this study were Turkish cottons and manufactured by ring spinning system. The yarn samples were applied with two different washing temperatures (30 °C and 40 °C) and three different washing times (10, 20 and 30 minutes). The following stage of ultrasonic and conventional washing physical properties (yarn count, twist, tensile strength, elongation etc) was investigated and comparisons were made. Findings: The investigation presented in this study indicates benefits of employing <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> and organic cotton farming. Research limitations/implications: The properties of yarn washed with ultrasonic energy shows better properties than those of yarns washed with conventional washing technique. The results confirms that <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> has some advantages such as less processing time, less chemical and water consumptions compared to conventional washing methods.

40|$|Because of the {{depletion}} of the world’s petroleum reserves and the increasing environmental concerns, biodiesel, as a low-emission renewable fuel {{and one of the}} best substitutes for petro-diesel fuel, has attracted great public interest over the past decades. At present, camelina oil has been considered as a low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production because of its high oil content and environmental benefits. In the present study, the optimization of biodiesel production and purification from camelina oil is studied extensively in order to maximize the biodiesel yield. The orthogonal array design is used to optimize the biodiesel production and four relevant process conditions for affecting biodiesel yield are investigated: methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time and temperature. For the optimization study on biodiesel purification, five commonly used washing methods are also investigated: cold deionized water washing, hot deionized water washing, phosphoric acid <b>washing,</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> assisted <b>washing,</b> and magnesol washing. The optimization study, based on traditional mechanical stirring process, reveals that the decreasing ranking of significant factors for biodiesel production is catalyst concentration > reaction time > reaction temperature > methanol to oil ratio. The maximum biodiesel yield is found at a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 8 : 1, a reaction time of 70 min, a reaction temperature of 50 ℃, and a catalyst concentration of 1 wt. %. After testing the fuel properties of the final product, the optimized biodiesel meets the relevant requirements of the biodiesel standards and thus can be used as a qualified fuel for diesel engines. The optimization study, based on ultrasonic-assisted transesterification process, reveals that the maximal fatty acid methyl ester yield of the final biodiesel product is obtained under a methanol to oil molar ratio of 8 : 1, catalyst concentration of 1. 25 wt. %, reaction time of 50 min and reaction temperature of 55 ℃. Compared with traditional mechanical stirring production process, ultrasonic-assisted transesterification process improves the biodiesel production since it could reduce the production cost and save energy. For the optimization study on biodiesel purification, the fatty acid methyl ester yield of the final biodiesel product, energy consumption and economic costs of different washing methods are compared. The comparisons indicate that the <b>ultrasonic</b> assisted <b>washing</b> method is the best method for biodiesel purification, when energy consumption and operation costs are considered. A preliminary kinetics study of transesterification reaction of camelina oil is carried out. After discussing four cases for overall reaction, a third-order reaction mechanism was proposed to fit the experimental data better because of the highest coefficient of determination. Based on the best-fit plot, the rate constants and activation energy are also determined. To sum up, the present research focuses on the optimization of biodiesel production and purification from camelina oil, and provides insights into the optimal process conditions for maximizing the biodiesel yield.

Occlusion of patent dentinal tubules effectively reduces the state of dentine hypersensitivity. Strontium chloride (SrCl 2) has been well known {{as a component of}} desensitizing dentifrice. Recently, new dentifrice containing sodium metasilicate was on the market for desensitizing dentifrice. The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the occlusion effect of dentinal tubule between the sodium metasilicate and the existing desensitizing dentifrices. Sixty-four human dentine specimens were embedded into a Teflon mold and were grinded with the use of silicone carbide papers to expose the surface of dentin.

Unpolluted dredging sludge, 820 K calcinated dredging sludge, silica and alumina were characterized, polluted with a known concentration of mercury and treated both by acid washing and thermal desorption with and without low frequency ultrasound application. The acid washing was carried out by a 4 % HNO 3 acid solution and the thermal desorption was performed in a 370 - 620 K range. X-ray semi-quantitative analysis of dredging sludge before and after acid washing and granulometric curves of the matrices after the ultrasonic treatment were considered in order to evidence chemical or physical changes during these treatments. Total residual mercury measurements were carried out before and after sonication. Results showed not measurable acid washing extraction from polluted dredging sludge, a little (3 %) extraction from 820 K heat-treated sludge and a significant (10 - 20 %) extraction from alumina and silica within 120 min of treatment. The ultrasound application gave generally poor improvement of the mercury removal. On the contrary thermal desorption of mercury was somewhat effective for alumina, silica and heat-treated dredging sludge samples in which mercury removal was 30 - 40 % at 370 K and 90 - 99 % at 570 K. Likewise ultrasound application did not improve desorption. Instead, the thermal treatment of dredging sludge had a negligible amount of mercury desorption at 370 K but it reached 95 % at 570 K.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the ultrasonic pressure distribution in a sonoreactor and an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> tank by finite element method (FEM) by taking into account the coupling effect between the acoustic pressure in water and the mechanical vibration of the solid structure. To examine the ultrasound intensity distribution in a sonoreactor with a fixed volume of water, the ultrasonic pressure distribution at different L values, which was the distance between the tip of the ultrasound probe and the bottom of the reactor inner wall, was simulated. The ultrasound intensity distribution was then calculated based on the acoustic pressure distribution obtained from the FEM simulation. The validity of the computer simulation was evaluated by comparing the ultrasound intensity distributions in the sonoreactor at two different L values with the result of a microbial inactivation test conducted in the same sonoreactor for each L value when treated by mano-thermo-sonication in a batch operation. The acoustic pressure field between two transducer boxes in a custom-made ultrasound-assisted washing tank was simulated, which was then compared with the result of an erosion test with aluminum foils.

The as-formed PDA coating on a wood surface exhibited a hierarchical micro/nano roughness structure, and functioned as an “adhesive layer” between the substrate and a metallic film by the metal chelating ability of the catechol moieties on PDA, allowing {{for the formation of}} a well-developed micro/nanostructure hierarchical roughness. Additionally, the coating acted as a stable bridge between the substrate and hydrophobic groups. The morphology and chemical components of the prepared superhydrophobic wood surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The PDA and octadecylamine (OA) modified surface showed excellent superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle (CA) of about 153 ° and a rolling angle (RA) of about 9 °. The CA further increased to about 157 ° and RA reduced to about 5 ° with the Cu metallization.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the use}} of ultrasonic vibration as an aid to the dilute acid method of cleaning eggs. It is expected that ultrasonics could increase the efficiency of cleaning by reducing the length of time the eggs are exposed to the acid solution. To determine whether ultrasonics could be beneficial, penetration of the cleaning solution into the egg, shell thickness, shell cleanliness, interior quality, and microbial, organoleptic, and functional properties were measured. Shell penetration was less, as a result of ultrasonic vibration, when the egg and acetic acid solution were the same temperature (22 C) at time of washing than when the eggs were 22 C and the solution was either 12 or 32 C. When egg and cleaning solution were 22 C, no cleaning solution penetrated the shell after 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 sec of exposure but penetration increased after 160 and 320 sec of exposure. No differences (P>. 05) in shell thickness resulted from cleaning in 1, 2, or 3 % acetic acid with ultrasonic vibration for 30, 60, 120, and 240 sec, and the shell thickness of eggs so treated did not differ (P>. 05) from that of commercially washed eggs. All three solutions produced clean eggs at each exposure time, and their cleanliness was comparable to that of commercially washed eggs. No differences (P>. 05) in Haugh units were caused by length of exposure to the cleaning solution and by exposure to ultrasonics.

40|$|AbstractThe ITTF’s mentions, in June 2007, on the VOC-free glue using rules, {{have been}} refined, in 1 Jan. 2009, up to higher {{standards}} {{due to the}} human health protection. Because of these reasons, the latest research focuses the processing of the table tennis rackets by materials and technologies that reduce or totally eliminate the using of glues. The processing of a sandwich composite plate based on Al alloy foam and rubber coating processed by injection moulding on the metallic foam provide the possibility to attach it to the wooden support of the tennis table racket by a mechanical route through the dovetail system. Thus, glues using is eliminated. The powder metallurgy (PM) technology {{has been used in}} order to process Al-based foams from Al alloys powder particles and NaCl granules. Powder particles of aluminum alloy of 200  μm average size, at 40 % (wt.) content, are homogenized with NaCl granules for 3  mm and 4  mm, at 60 % (wt.) content, followed by cold compaction at 500  MPa, sintering in argon atmosphere and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing.</b> Thus, metallic foams are processed, having different properties depending on the NaCl granules sizes. For 3  mm NaCl granules, the metallic foams have the following characteristics: density (0. 2 … 0. 35)  g/cm 3, porosity (60 … 70) %, average diameter of the pores 2. 15  mm. For 4  mm NaCl granules, the metallic foams have the following characteristics: density (0. 15 … 0. 25)  g/cm 3, porosity (65 … 75) %, average diameter of the pores 2. 65  mm. The mixture of rubber and carbon black is deposited on the metallic foam surface by injection moulding process, developed at the injection pressure of 50 bar, temperature of (130 … 150) ∘C.

40|$|Although strict {{practices}} for controlling {{the safety of}} leafy green produce have been implemented in the produce industry, current commercial operations rely on a wash treatment with an antimicrobial agent as the only step for reducing microbial populations on fresh produce. However, washing with a sanitizer has been demonstrated to achieve no more than 1 - 2 log reduction in pathogen populations. In recent years, much research effort has been put into the development of multiple-hurdle techniques to enhance produce safety. Ultrasonic waves ranging from 20 to 100 kHz in frequency have been successfully used as a surface cleaning technique in the medical and precision processing industries {{for a number of}} years. The use of ultrasound in fresh produce sanitation as a hurdle technique is a relatively recent endeavor, however. The reported studies have been sporadic and inconsistent, and have only dealt with batch operations. There are few reports documenting the effects of ultrasound and washing tank operational parameters on the efficacy of combined treatments of ultrasound and sanitizer, or on the removal of bacteria from fresh or fresh-cut vegetable surfaces. In this study, a systematic approach, starting from understanding the interactions among acoustic energy, produce, sanitizers, and bacteria, as well as the distribution of the ultrasonic field in the treatment channel, was employed to find the answer to the important question: "Can an ultrasound-assisted treatment indeed enhance microbial reduction in a continuous-flow pilot-scale produce washing system?" The first question that has to be answered for any ultrasound-assisted produce wash is if ultrasound as a form of physical energy will cause produce quality degradation. To address this issue, a determination was made of the threshold of acoustic power density (APD) in an ultrasound treatment allowable without causing unacceptable produce damage immediately after sonication. All subsequent produce wash tests were performed with an APD below this threshold. Next, the effect of ultrasound on the reduction of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 inoculated on the surfaces of selected produce was measured. The interactions between ultrasound and sanitizers were examined by monitoring the concentration changes of the sanitizers in washing solutions used for fresh-cut lettuce washes. The effects of ultrasound parameters and operational conditions on the uniformity of the acoustic field in the ultrasonic channel, and on surface decontamination of leafy green produce, were also examined. A continuous-flow pilot scale <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>washing</b> system was designed, fabricated, and tested in this study. Further, produce surface characteristics and infiltration pathways were studied. Finally, the application of ultrasonication for surface decontamination of lettuce coring knives was also investigated. The overall quality scores of baby spinach, lollo rosso, loose leaf lettuce, iceberg lettuce, and romaine lettuce remained unchanged during a 2 -week storage period when sonicated at an APD of less than 100 W/L for less than 2 min., and were above the acceptable level as determined by a sensory panel. The electro-conductivity rate of all four of these salad leaves increased over the treatment time. The ultrasound treatment significantly enhanced the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 cells from the spinach surfaces in all of the sanitation treatments, and the enhancement of the ultrasound increased with the treatment time and APD. Ultrasonication accelerated the degradation of free chlorine and total chlorine during a 4 -min treatment, compared to a wash without ultrasound, while concentrations of acidified sodium chlorite and peroxyacetic acid remained unchanged. An ultrasound treatment at 75 kHz was significantly less effective in the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from spinach leaves than treatments at 25 and 40 kHz (p < 0. 05). The removal of microbes from baby spinach leaves by ultrasonication decreased when the ultrasonic channel width increased from 304. 8 to 609. 6 mm. The blockage of ultrasound due to the overlapping of spinach leaves dramatically decreased the decontamination efficacy, and hence care should be taken to avoid the overlapping of produce leaves. A 20 -min degassing prior to ultrasonication only resulted in a marginal increase (0. 16 log cycle) in the E. coli count reduction. In the tests with the pilot-scale ultrasonic produce washer, ultrasound in combination with chlorine enhanced the reduction of E. coli inoculated on spinach by a 0. 53 log cycle for batch-leaf washes. Additionally, batch-leaf washes with chlorinated water enhanced the reduction of aerobic plate count by a 0. 50 log cycle over a chlorine-only wash. No significant effect of ultrasound was observed for yeast and mold reduction. Ultrasonication enhanced the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from baby carrots by 1. 24 log cycles and 0. 65 log cycle when treated for 1 min and 3 min, respectively. A batch wash with ultrasound also significantly (p < 0. 05) increased the aerobic plate count reduction for roma tomato surfaces by a 0. 75 log cycle over a sanitizer-only wash, while there was only a marginal enhancement in yeast and mold reduction. A number of new techniques were developed or applied to elucidate the relationships between produce surface characteristics and microbial attachment and removal. In the inactivation tests, the underside of spinach leaves (rough side) was found to provide a better shelter for E. coli O 157 :H 7 than the upside. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical profiler mapping were used to provide some insight into this observation. The SEM images and surface profiles of a spinach leaf showed valleys, deeper in the underside than in the upside, harboring and even protecting the cells attached in them. In the effort to quantify the surface roughness of produce, a freeze-drying sample preparation method for confocal laser scanning microscopy was developed which worked well. There {{were no significant differences in}} surface roughness among selected vegetables. Moreover, the surface hydrophobicity of the inner surface of spinach leaves was not significantly different from that of the outer surface, and was not affected by ultrasonication. For the first time, the MicroXCT technique was employed in this study to examine the internal structure of a produce sample on the micrometer scale. The MicroXCT images provided a detailed view of the potential infiltration pathways inside a produce tissue that may be used by human pathogens to penetrate fresh and fresh-cut produce. In the test to examine the interactions of ultrasound with a hard metal surface, the ultrasound treatment reduced the E. coli O 157 :H 7 count to below the detection limit on coring knives on both the blade and welding joint when treated for 30 s in 1 mg/L chlorinated water. The two newly designed prototype knives harbored significantly fewer E. coli cells than the current commercially used ones, enabling high disinfection efficacy. In summary, prerequisites for the application of acoustic energy for produce surface decontamination are a good understanding of the underlying physics of acoustics, as well as of the interactions among ultrasound, sanitizers, produce, and bacteria. The operational parameters of both the ultrasound generator and produce washer are also critical in improving the washing efficacy. With a carefully designed ultrasound system and a uniform acoustic field distribution in the washer and on each side of a produce sample, a significantly enhanced reduction in microbial count over that of a sanitizer-only wash can be achieved...|$|E
