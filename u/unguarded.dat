5|$|On 15 Aug 1952 {{the area}} was {{declared}} a National Monument by the South West African administration. Despite its early recognition, the site was left <b>unguarded</b> until 1986 when the entire area was declared a nature reserve. As a result, many of the petroglyphs were damaged or removed. Additionally, visitors have left their own graffiti on the sandstone slabs.|$|E
5|$|At {{about six}} {{o'clock in the}} morning, some of the protesters {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was <b>unguarded.</b> Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading hallways {{and those in the}} compromised sector, the cour de marbre, fired their guns at the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd. Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left <b>unguarded,</b> fell to the Normans.|$|E
5|$|In 837, a Muslim army under Abd al-Salam ibn Abd al-Wahhab {{attacked}} Enna, but {{was defeated}} by the Byzantines, and Abd al-Salam himself was taken prisoner. The Muslims responded by reinforcing their position around Enna, which they placed under siege. During the following winter, one of the besiegers discovered an <b>unguarded</b> path leading to the town, allowing the Muslims to take the entire lower town. The Byzantines however managed to maintain control of the citadel, and after negotiations secured a Muslim withdrawal {{in exchange for a}} large ransom.|$|E
5|$|In {{her plan}} {{to kill her}} husband she found an ally in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and spatharius (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then {{recruited}} the king's cubicularius (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on June 28, care was taken to leave {{the door open and}} <b>unguarded.</b> Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during {{intermission}} {{to drink}} at the saloon next door. The now <b>unguarded</b> President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13pm, aimed {{at the back of}} Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, due to {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} situation and communications difficulties, a degree of confusion emerged on both sides. Out of contact with their corps headquarters, the 4th Krajina Division continued to retain two brigades along the Bihać-Petrovac road, {{despite the fact that}} the 92nd Motorised Regiment had already passed along this route and into their rear. The critically important Petrovac-Ključ road to the south was left <b>unguarded,</b> endangering Tito and Supreme Partisan Headquarters as they fled from Drvar.|$|E
5|$|With {{evidence}} strongly {{pointing to}} Desha as the murderer, General William Reed summoned Desha {{to his house}} on November 9 and ordered him to remain until an examining trial could be held. Desha complied, showed no emotion when viewing Baker's body, and {{did not attempt to}} flee although left <b>unguarded</b> in the house. The examining trial resulted in Desha's formal arrest, and he was imprisoned in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. Relief Party partisans said that Desha was innocent and his arrest was fabricated by the Anti-Relief Party to embarrass his father Governor Desha and weaken him politically.|$|E
5|$|Zatch {{leads the}} crew to a hidden cave in which the ancient weapons of the Patusani monarchy are preserved. Zatch arms Johnny and attacks him to prepare him for future challenges. Johnny is beaten repeatedly, but he is finally able to disarm Zatch. They rally the villagers and they travel to the coast {{opposite}} from an island that houses the royal city and Colonel Chi's dungeon. Unable to go by boat due to an impassable reef, Johnny and Adam tell the Patusanis to make surfboards. They then paddle to the <b>unguarded</b> side of the island.|$|E
5|$|About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously {{informed}} him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He {{did not wish to}} leave the Tsushima Strait <b>unguarded</b> and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. Iwate was the most seriously damaged Japanese ship and suffered a total of 40 killed and 37 wounded.|$|E

None of the Japanese ships were seriously damaged; despite Izumo receiving over 20 hits, she only suffered 3 men killed and 16 wounded during the battle. She began repairs at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in mid-September.|$|E
5|$|After being {{occupied}} with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas {{throughout the year}} 970, Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus', moving his troops from Asia to Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment. The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops to effect a landing in the enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left <b>unguarded,</b> either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E
5|$|Baliszewski and Tadeusz Kisielewski {{are among}} those who point out the {{opportunity}} the Soviets had at Gibraltar. At {{about the same time}} that Sikorski's plane was left <b>unguarded</b> at the Gibraltar airfield, a Soviet plane was parked nearby; it carried Soviet ambassador Ivan Maisky, giving the Soviets an officially confirmed presence {{at the site of the}} accident. The head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's counterintelligence for the Iberian Peninsula from 1941 to 1944 was Kim Philby, the Soviet double agent who would defect in 1963 and later claim to have been a double agent since the 1940s. Before 1941, Philby had served as an instructor with the Special Operations Executive, an organization specializing in sabotage and diversion behind enemy lines.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the <b>unguarded</b> Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able {{to attack the}} Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E
5|$|Many myths {{surrounding}} vampires originated {{during the}} medieval period. The 12th-century English historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants, though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant. The Old Norse draugr is another medieval {{example of an}} undead creature with similarities to vampires. Vampire-like beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was <b>unguarded</b> and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event {{to the lack of}} a shmirah (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in <b>unguarded</b> tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|Sardinia and Libya {{were already}} conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus cast anchor off the Promontorium Mercurii, now Cap Bon, {{opposite}} Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Geiseric requested Basiliscus {{to allow him}} five days to draw up the conditions of a peace. During the negotiations, Geiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with combustible materials. During the night, these fire ships were propelled against the <b>unguarded</b> and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels.|$|E
5|$|Somerset's quarter-final, against Lancashire, was {{scheduled}} for Tuesday 28 July 2009. Bad weather meant that no play was possible on either the Tuesday or Wednesday, {{as a result of}} which the teams requested special dispensation from the ECB for an additional reserve day on the Thursday, which was granted. The wet weather continued, forcing the teams to play a bowl-out. Each team had to select five bowlers, each of whom had two deliveries at a set of <b>unguarded</b> stumps. Somerset won the bowl-out 5–1, with Ben Phillips, Peter Trego and Willoughby each hitting the stumps once, and Thomas hitting them twice.|$|E
5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} preceding {{the development of}} Bertha produced rough surf and rip currents along the Florida coastline. In Perdido Key State Recreation Area, two children were swimming in an <b>unguarded</b> area when they swept away by the currents. Their grandfather attempted to rescue them, but drowned in the rough waters. Another family rescued the two children. The large circulation of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida, with Pensacola and Destin reporting 2.75inches. Extreme southern portions of Alabama received over 3inches (75mm) of rain from the storm, while western Dauphin Island reported over 5inches (125mm).|$|E
5|$|A centenary {{celebration of}} Brooke rule in Sarawak {{was held in}} 1941. During the celebration, a new {{constitution}} was introduced that would limit {{the power of the}} Rajah and granting the Sarawak people a greater role in the functioning of government. However, this constitution was never fully implemented due to the Japanese occupation. That same year saw the British withdrawing its air and marine forces defending Sarawak to Singapore. With Sarawak now <b>unguarded,</b> the Brooke regime adopted a scorched earth policy where oil installations in Miri were to be destroyed and the Kuching airfield held as long as possible before being destroyed. Nevertheless, a Japanese invasion force led by Kiyotake Kawaguchi landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 and conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941, with British ground forces retreating to Singkawang in neighbouring Dutch Borneo. After ten weeks of fighting there, the Allied forces surrendered on 1 April 1942. Charles Vyner Brooke, the last Rajah of Sarawak, had already left for Sydney, Australia; his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp.|$|E
5|$|A {{few seconds}} after Pajota {{and his men}} heard Murphy fire the first shot, they fired on the alerted Japanese {{contingent}} situated across the Cabu River. Pajota had earlier sent a demolitions expert to set charges on the <b>unguarded</b> bridge to go off at 19:45. The bomb detonated at the designated time, and although it did not destroy the bridge, it formed a large hole over which tanks and other vehicles could not pass. Waves of Japanese troops rushed the bridge, but the V-shaped choke point created by the Filipino guerrillas repulsed each attack. Oneguerrilla, who had been trained to use the bazooka {{only a few hours}} earlier by the Rangers, destroyed or disabled four tanks that were hiding behind a clump of trees. A group of Japanese soldiers made an effort to flank the ambush position by crossing the river away from the bridge, but the guerrillas spotted and eliminated them.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Claire and Tom Yates {{have fallen}} in love, which complicates both their lives. During an <b>unguarded</b> moment, Claire tells Yates that Frank murdered Zoe Barnes and Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). She {{immediately}} regrets it, and tells Yates that they can't see each other anymore. In response, Yates threatens to publish a book detailing the Underwoods' crimes. Claire invites him to Usher's home, and poisons him. He dies while having sex with Claire, and she has Usher {{get rid of the}} body. Around this time, Claire and Frank convince Doug to take the fall for Zoe Barnes' death. Frank also starts to become suspicious of Claire as she disappears {{for a period of time}} (she had started talking to Davis in a secret corridor) and starts to memorize her testimony defending herself but not Frank, in case she has to testify.|$|E
5|$|In the Montenotte Campaign, the French won {{victories}} at Montenotte, Millesimo and Dego between 11 and 15 April. In the Battle of Ceva Colli's Sardinians repelled Augereau's attack {{but they}} {{retreated to the}} west when Sérurier's division appeared. Colli detailed Jean-Gaspard Dichat de Toisinge with 8,000 Sardinians and 15 guns to defend San Michele Mondovi against a French attack. On 19 April, Sérurier formed his division into two 3,000-man brigades under Pascal Antoine Fiorella and Jean Joseph Guieu plus a reserve under his personal command. The Corsaglia River was unfordable due to the spring thaw and the French attack soon stalled. However, some of Guieu's skirmishers found an <b>unguarded</b> footbridge and made a lodgement on the west bank. The French captured San Michele but the unpaid, hungry soldiers went on a looting spree. Led by a company of Swiss troops, Colli organized a counterattack which drove Sérurier's division out of the town, though Guieu's brigade maintained its bridgehead. The repulse cost the French about 600 casualties while the Sardinians lost 300.|$|E
5|$|Powerful surf {{affected}} the northern coastlines {{of the islands}} in the Greater Antilles. Strong swells also lashed the Bahamas. During most hurricanes, {{the location of the}} Bahamas prevents powerful swells of Atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast Florida. However, the combination of the location, forward speed, and strength of Isabel produced strong swells through the Providence Channel onto a narrow 10mile (16km) stretch of the southeastern Florida coastline; wave heights peaked at 14feet (4.3m) at Delray Beach. The swells capsized a watercraft and injured its twopassengers at Boynton Beach, and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near Juno Beach. Minor beach erosion was reported in Palm Beach County. In the northern portion of the state, waves reached up to 15feet (4.5m) in height at Flagler Beach, causing the Flagler Beach Pier to be closed due to damaged boards from the waves. Rip currents from Isabel killed a surfer at an <b>unguarded</b> beach in Nassau County, with an additional six people requiring rescue from the currents. The beaches were later closed during the worst of the rough surf.|$|E
5|$|The Samanid emir, Isma'il ibn Ahmad, {{launched}} an expedition against the Oghuz Turks in 893, {{forcing them to}} invade the Pechenegs' lands between the Volga and Ural rivers. After being expelled from their homeland, the Pechenegs departed for the west in search of new pastures. The Magyars had in the meantime invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise. Simeon I of Bulgaria sent envoys to the Pechenegs and persuaded them to storm into Etelköz. The unexpected invasion destroyed the <b>unguarded</b> dwelling places of the Magyars, forcing them to leave the Pontic steppes and seek refuge over the Carpathian Mountains. The Magyars occupied their new homeland in several phases, initially settling the lands east of the Danube and only invading the March of Pannonia after Arnulf of East Francia died in 899. They destroyed Moravia before 906 and consolidated their control of the Carpathian Basin through their victory over a Bavarian army in the Battle of Brezalauspurc in 907.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{made the}} first move in the war, seizing the {{strategic}} Rochester Castle, owned by Langton but left almost <b>unguarded</b> by the archbishop. John was well prepared for a conflict. He had stockpiled {{money to pay for}} mercenaries and ensured the support of the powerful marcher lords with their own feudal forces, such as William Marshal and Ranulf of Chester. The rebels lacked the engineering expertise or heavy equipment necessary to assault the network of royal castles that cut off the northern rebel barons from those in the south. John's strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London, protect his own supply lines to his key source of mercenaries in Flanders, prevent the French from landing in the south-east, and then win the war through slow attrition. John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales, where Llywelyn the Great was leading a rebellion against the 1211 settlement.|$|E
5|$|This {{string of}} Muslim {{victories}} curtailed Persian efforts to recapture lower Mesopotamia {{and left the}} Persian capital Ctesiphon <b>unguarded</b> and vulnerable to Muslim attack. Before assaulting the Persian capital, Khalid decided to eliminate all Persian forces {{from the south and}} west, and thus marched against the border city of Firaz, where he defeated a combined force of Sassanid Persians, Byzantine Romans and Christian Arabs and captured the city's fortress during the Battle of Firaz in December 633. This was the last battle in his conquest of lower Mesopotamia. While Khalid {{was on his way to}} attack Qadissiyah, a key fort on the way to Ctesiphon, he received a letter from Abu Bakr and was sent to the Byzantine front in Syria to assume the command of Muslim armies with the intent of conquering Roman Syria.|$|E
5|$|After this truce, Grant's army {{began to}} fill the 12-mile ring around Vicksburg. In short time {{it became clear that}} even 50,000 Union {{soldiers}} {{would not be able to}} effect a complete encirclement of the Confederate defenses. Pemberton's outlook on escape was pessimistic, but there were still roads leading south out of Vicksburg <b>unguarded</b> by Federal troops. Grant found help from Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, the Union general-in-chief. Halleck quickly began to shift Union troops in the West to meet Grant's needs. The first of these reinforcements to arrive along the siege lines was a 5,000 man division from the Department of the Missouri under Maj. Gen. Francis J. Herron on June 11. Herron's troops, remnants of the Army of the Frontier, were attached to McPherson's corps and took up position on the far south. Next came a three division detachment from the XVI Corps led by Brig. Gen. Cadwallader C. Washburn on June 12, assembled from troops at nearby posts of Corinth, Memphis, and LaGrange. The final significant group of reinforcements to join was the 8,000 man strong IX Corps from the Department of the Ohio, led by Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, arriving on June 14. With the arrival of Parke, Grant had 77,000 men around Vicksburg.|$|E
5|$|Pohlmann struck {{camp and}} {{deployed}} his infantry battalions {{in a line}} facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position. Pohlmann's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford {{into the mouth of}} his cannon, and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two <b>unguarded</b> villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot. Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann's left flank.|$|E
5|$|The Tar Heels' {{began to}} strain Kansas' defense with several players making {{perimeter}} shots, and {{when combined with}} Kansas' inability to convert from the field, this allowed the Tar Heels to jump out to a 114 lead. This led to Harp changing Kansas' defensive formation to a 23 zone, with Chamberlain under the basket. Rosenbluth — who was now relatively <b>unguarded</b> when compared to Kansas' previous formation — made a contested seventeen foot jumper. Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was subsequently fouled as he went up for a shot. He went to the free throw line and made one of two. As Kansas went up the floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original boxandone. Carolina's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender, which brought the score to 157 in favor of Carolina. Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot, but Chamberlain grabbed the rebound and was then fouled in air. He went to the line for a one–and–one and missed the first shot, while Rosenbluth caught the rebound.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{ceremonial}} role, the Golden Gate {{was one of}} {{the stronger}} positions along the walls of the city, withstanding several attacks during the various sieges. With the addition of transverse walls on the peribolos between the inner and outer walls, it formed a virtually separate fortress. Its military value was recognized by John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354), who records that it was virtually impregnable, capable of holding provisions for three years and defying the whole city if need be. He repaired the marble towers and garrisoned the fort with loyal Catalan soldiers, but had to surrender it to John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1391) when he abdicated in 1354. John V undid Kantakouzenos' repairs and left it <b>unguarded,</b> but in 1389–90 he too rebuilt and expanded the fortress, erecting two towers behind the gate and extending a wall some 350 m to the sea walls, thus forming a separate fortified enceinte inside the city to serve as a final refuge. In the event, John V was soon after forced to flee there from a coup led by his grandson, John VII. The fort held out successfully in the subsequent siege that lasted several months, and in which cannons were possibly employed. In 1391 however, John V was compelled to raze the fort by Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1382–1402), who otherwise threatened to blind his son Manuel, whom he held captive. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425–1448) attempted to rebuild it in 1434, but was thwarted by Sultan Murad II.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} {{flank of the}} U.S. 24th Infantry Division, the British 29th Infantry Brigade of the US I Corps was {{involved}} in the hardest fighting of the entire battle. In the 29th Infantry Brigade's first action of the Korean War, the brigade was ordered to defend the areas east of Koyang on the Seoul Bridgehead line. The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles (1RUR) covered the brigade's left flank, while the 1st Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (1RNF) was stationed on the brigade's right flank. The 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 21st Royal Thai Regiment covered the brigade's rear with artillery support. At 04:00 on January 3, 1RUR first made contact with the 149th Division of the PVA 50th Corps. The Chinese surprised and overran the B and D company of 1RUR, but a counterattack by Major C. A. H. B. Blake of 1RUR restored the battalion's position by the morning. While 1RUR was under attack, the Chinese forces also infiltrated 1RNF's positions by exploiting the <b>unguarded</b> valleys between hilltops occupied by the British. The entire 1RNF soon came under sniper fire and the Chinese made repeated attempts to capture the Y Company of 1RNF. To restore 1RNF's position, Brigadier Thomas Brodie of the 29th Infantry Brigade sent the W Company of 1RNF with four Churchill tanks as reinforcement. The reinforcement was met with machine gun and mortar fire, but the Chinese resistance immediately crumbled under the Churchill tanks' devastating assaults. The surviving Chinese troops fled under the bombardment from 4.2 inch mortars and 25 pounder field guns. In the aftermath of fighting, the 29th Infantry Brigade suffered at least 16 dead, 45 wounded and 3 missing, while 200 Chinese dead were found within 1RNF's position.|$|E
