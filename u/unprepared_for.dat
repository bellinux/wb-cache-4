5|$|Across {{the eastern}} Caribbean, Hurricane Lenny damaged vital infrastructure, {{including}} roads and piers in the tourism-dependent islands. Most of the islands' tourism areas were on western-facing beaches, {{many of which}} were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the high waves and winds produced by Lenny.|$|E
5|$|Residents and {{tourists}} in southern Florida were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the unusual off-season storm. Winds {{of up to}} 65mph (105km/h) spread across the area, causing damage to windows and power lines. The storm dropped 2–4inches (50–100mm) of precipitation along its path; the combination of unseasonable rainfall and winds resulted in crop damage in Miami-Dade County.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} {{to accept his}} election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
50|$|OWLS is a {{mnemonic}} used {{by general}} aviation airplane pilots to assess an <b>unprepared</b> surface <b>for</b> a precautionary landing.|$|R

60|$|He {{had seen}} this lugubrious stone cage before. But {{the magic of}} his morning walk across the moor, {{the sight of the}} pagan tors, the songs of the last cuckoo, had <b>unprepared</b> him <b>for</b> that dreary building. He left the street, and, {{entering}} the fosse, began a circuit, scanning the walls with morbid fascination.|$|R
5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks were largely <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after forming, gale {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Netherlands Antilles of the Leeward Islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla. Klaus {{was the first}} tropical cyclone on record to hit the Leeward Islands from the west, {{and as a result}} many were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the strong winds and rough seas from the southwest.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took his}} place by her side, {{deliberately}} removed his muffler and unfastened his overcoat. It struck her, from the first moment she heard his voice, that his manner was somehow altered. She was altogether <b>unprepared,</b> however, <b>for</b> the almost stern directness of his first question. [...] "Miss Beverley," [...] he began, [...] "will you allow me to ask you how long you have known Mr. Jocelyn Thew?" ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{conscious}} that Maisie was catching her breath, but was as <b>unprepared</b> as herself <b>for</b> the torrent of emotion that followed. She had {{dropped into a}} chair and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands.|$|R
50|$|Freezing is {{also one}} of the most {{commonly}} used processes, both commercially and domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods, including prepared foods that would not have required freezing in their <b>unprepared</b> state. <b>For</b> example, potato waffles are stored in the freezer, but potatoes themselves require only a cool dark place to ensure many months' storage. Cold stores provide large-volume, long-term storage for strategic food stocks held in case of national emergency in many countries.|$|R
5|$|<b>Unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the Allied {{operation}} at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement. Mikawa, {{commander of the}} newly formed Japanese Eighth Fleet headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards Guadalcanal on August 7. However, when the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99typhoon bulletins, warning {{residents}} about Mireille. There were 236warnings {{related to}} storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents {{were aware of}} the approaching storm, about 70% of residents did not expect significant effects. In general, residents were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the storm, partly {{due to the lack of}} recent storms. Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000individuals, and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted. In Hokkaido, 207schools were closed due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
50|$|Split {{into two}} parts, Jeff and Hunter begin {{searching for a}} Broadway theatre and Jeff creates the TOSability Board. Susan checks in from her {{dressing}} room {{on the set of}} Law & Order, her first appearance on the show after performing an <b>unprepared</b> search <b>for</b> a theater on foot in Shubert Alley. Upon returning to the apartment, Heidi messages Hunter and Jeff on iChat and recommends that the group perform out of town before mounting a Broadway production.|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} vision-based Augmented Reality tracking systems, artificially-designed fiducials (or landmarks) {{have been}} used as camera tracking primitives. The 3 D positions of these fiducials should be pre-calibrated, which imposes limitations in ranges of tracking view. Fortunately, the advance of computer vision technologies combined with new point position estimation technology enable natural features to be detected, tracked, and calibrated to be used as camera tracking primitives. This paper describes how these technologies are used to track in an <b>unprepared</b> environment <b>for</b> Augmented Reality...|$|R
60|$|I {{would most}} {{explicitly}} state, the present publication is no party act, or an act originating in party feeling, for though I {{must take a}} heartfelt interest in the present proceedings in our Society, yet I deeply feel that, even if I see, or think I see, the Ark of the Covenant of our God unsteadily placed as upon a new cart, {{there is a danger}} of putting forth, like Uzza of old, uncalled and <b>unprepared</b> hands <b>for</b> its support.|$|R
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, in the 19th century, Kanaks were {{recruited}} or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E
5|$|In 1700 Sweden was {{attacked}} {{by a coalition of}} Saxony, Russia, and Denmark–Norway. Saxony, under Augustus II, invaded Swedish oversea dominions in Livonia and quickly attacked the city of Riga. Meanwhile, Frederick IV of Denmark attacked the Swedish allied duchies of Holstein and Gottorp in order to secure his rear, before commencing with the planned invasion of Scania, which had been previously annexed by Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. A short time later, Russia under Peter I swept into Swedish Ingria and besieged the strategic city of Narva. <b>Unprepared</b> <b>for</b> these developments, the Swedes were forced into a war on three fronts.|$|E
60|$|For {{how many}} hours she {{had been trying to}} picture this meeting in her mind, now imagining him tender and affectionate as she wished him to be, now cold or contemptuous or resentful; and in every case her heated brain had {{suggested}} the very words he would use to her; but for this careless tone, and the inexplicable look on his face, according so ill with his tone, she was quite <b>unprepared,</b> and <b>for</b> some time she could make no reply to his words.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Froze-to-Death" [...] is said {{to derive}} from the {{experiences}} of the local Crow tribe of Native Americans. The area can be deadly <b>for</b> <b>unprepared</b> visitors. Its rocky, broken terrain is difficult for travelers and snow is possible at any time of the year.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Flying Yankees" [...] of the 103rd Airlift Wing are {{the third}} oldest Air National Guard {{unit in the}} United States, {{including}} a squadron that has served over 90 years in military aviation. They currently fly the C-130H Hercules, a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft designed and built originally by Lockheed Aircraft, now Lockheed Martin. Capable of using <b>unprepared</b> runways <b>for</b> takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, medical evacuation, and cargo transport aircraft. Its mission is providing theater cargo and passenger airlift.|$|R
5|$|Kinkaid hoped {{his next}} {{assignment}} {{would be that}} of naval attaché to London, but that job went to Captain Alan G. Kirk. Kinkaid was offered and accepted the post in Rome instead. He took up his posting there in November 1938. In 1939, he was also accredited with the American embassy in Belgrade. Kinkaid reported that Italy was <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> war. Only in May 1940 did he warn that Italy was mobilizing. Soon after, he learned from Count Galeazzo Ciano that Italy would declare war on France and Britain between 10 and 15 June 1940. He provided accurate reports on the damage inflicted by the British in the Battle of Taranto. He returned to the U.S. in March 1941.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, Ismael {{produced}} {{waves of}} up to 30feet (9m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the hurricane, which was expected to move more slowly, {{and as a result}} 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26million in damage (1995USD, $ USD). The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000people homeless. Moisture from the storm extended into the United States, causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|On October2, the {{government}} of Belize {{declared a state of}} emergency and activated the entire Belize Defence Force due to the storm's threat. The airport in Belize City was closed during Keith's passage, limiting transportation from the country's mainland to its offshore islands. In Corozal, Belize, authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000people to numerous shelters in Orange Walk. Officials were also ordered evacuations for Belize City, setting up shelters in Belmopan. Overall, about 25,000people evacuate, or about 10% of Belize's population. Three hospitals were evacuated in the country. In a post-storm assessment, residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the storm and did not anticipate such intensity.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} wall is not {{a uniform}} surface, dissected by ledges, dihedrals, and ramps. The main access route to the summit leads {{through one of the}} ramps to the saddle between the main summit and its western trabant. The passage on the top cone is secured by ropes <b>for</b> <b>unprepared</b> tourists.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] he said, in <b>unprepared,</b> extemporized tones, <b>for</b> her {{unexpected}} presence {{caught him}} {{without the slightest}} plan of behavior in the conjuncture. His manner made her think {{that she had been}} too chiding in her speech; and a mild scarlet wave passed over her as she resolved to soften it.|$|R
500|$|For {{his eighth}} birthday, Stevens {{received}} a new basketball hoop. [...] "It’s {{so much fun}} to dream in your driveway," [...] he later remarked. [...] "That’s where my friends and I hung out. It {{was a lot of fun}} to grow up in that era." [...] When a friend, Brandon Monk, had a basketball court installed in his back yard, Stevens [...] "appeared instantaneously." [...] He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the <b>unprepared</b> ingredients <b>for</b> grilled cheese sandwiches over to Monk's house, so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 25, 1950, ten {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> war. The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.|$|E
5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} education improved as well, though the extreme growth in the new boomtowns initially caused severe strain on school systems <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> the rapid influx of students. Even as money was rapidly flowing in the communities, obtaining tax revenue efficiently where it was needed was often complex. Communities dealt with these problems by establishing independent school districts, education districts formed independently of city or county government with their own independent taxing authority. This type of school district is still the standard in Texas today.|$|E
5|$|The Axioms {{passengers}} {{have become}} obese and feeble due to microgravity and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship {{under the control}} of the robotic autopilot, AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. However, AUTO orders his robotic assistant GO-4 to steal the plant to prevent this from happening.|$|E
50|$|Seventy {{years after}} the events of Rendezvous with Rama, a second Raman vessel enters the Solar System. Its arrival is {{expected}} and an expedition is sent to unlock more of Rama's mysteries, but the crew are <b>unprepared</b> both <b>for</b> what they find and for the conflicts that arise between them. Rama II brings new characters into a new story and is mostly unrelated to the original; largely, it serves to set up its own sequels. The novel ends with three of the twelve astronauts stranded inside Rama as it travels out of the Solar System, Nicole des Jardins, Richard Wakefield and Michael O'Toole.|$|R
