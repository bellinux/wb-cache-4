The 3, 400 thousand data were downloaded from agricultural soil information system and analyzed to get averages of soil order, soil series, and textual family for the three different soil management practices in Korea. The SOC content was 13. 3 ± 5. 38 g kg- 1 in paddy field, 13. 7 ± 7. 19 g kg- 1 in <b>upland</b> <b>field,</b> and 15. 2 ± 8. 22 g kg- 1 in orchard soil, respectively. As SOC in orchard was 10 % greater than that in upland, orchard must be managed with applying compost.

30|$|As {{stated by}} eight managers, species {{selection}} for farmland boundary markers is likely primarily {{based on the}} ability of the plants to withstand periodic trimming to maintain them at a small size suitable for marking <b>upland</b> <b>field</b> boundaries. According to our interviews, one D. crenata individual was maintained for at least 66 [*]years and many other individuals of this species have survived for approximately half a century. Similarly, most individuals of the other species noted in our interviews were also maintained for approximately 50 [*]years. These findings suggest that individuals of the main marker species that we observed can commonly persist for decades under repetitive trimming on <b>upland</b> <b>field</b> boundaries. Such persistence would be an important characteristic in marker selection. Moreover, the degree of difficulty of propagation also would be important for species selection. If vegetative propagation is easy, neighboring markers can be the source of new markers. Although most managers did not introduce markers themselves, the two managers who did so restored their markers by division of D. crenata and by planting a cutting of E. japonicus. Euonymus japonicus is known to be easily propagated from cuttings (Uehara [1961 b]). Therefore, at least these two species would be suitable for vegetative propagation in an open <b>upland</b> <b>field</b> environment.|$|E
