Under the influence of an area of high pressure {{to the north and}} a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved in that direction <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> unidentifiable on October21.|$|E

The school's purpose was to teach students in farming, gardening, poultry-keeping, and other agriculture-related skills. The school moved to a farm near Poughkeepsie in 1903, and the school building was run as a hotel for two years <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> Miss Knox's School.

The dominion did not appear at the Games under a Rhodesian banner until 1960, when it sent a fourteen-athlete delegation as part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In Rome, two sailors, Alan David Butler and Christopher Bevan, finished fourth, which was Rhodesia's best result <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> Zimbabwe in 1980. Southern Rhodesia sent 29 competitors, including a field hockey team, to the 1964 Summer Games, which was its last Olympic appearance under the Rhodesian banner.|$|E
5|$|The Giant Schnauzer is {{a working}} breed of dog {{developed}} in the 17th century in Germany. It is {{the largest of the}} three breeds of Schnauzerthe other two breeds being the Standard Schnauzer and the Miniature Schnauzer. Numerous breeds were used in its development, including the black Great Dane, the Bouvier des Flandres, and the German Pinscher. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer's property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers' shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> popular as a military dog during World War I and World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{region was}} known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local {{inhabitants}} practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended {{up the sides of}} the Krems River <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein, primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{bears the}} name of Honourable William McMaster, a prominent Canadian Senator and banker who bequeathed C$900,000 to its founding. It was incorporated {{under the terms of}} an act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1887, merging the Toronto Baptist College with Woodstock College. It opened in Toronto in 1890. Inadequate facilities and the gift of land in Hamilton prompted its relocation in 1930. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec controlled the university <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a privately chartered, publicly funded non-denominational institution in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E
