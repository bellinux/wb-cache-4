5|$|The TuđmanĆosić {{agreement}} on the pullout of JNA troops from Konavle provoked an emotional response in Yugoslavia, where it was interpreted as a defeat and betrayal. Following the agreement, the Prevlaka Peninsula was demilitarized and placed under the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), established by the <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> Council Resolution 779 of 6 October 1992. The resolution placed the peninsula {{under the control of}} UNPROFOR. The <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> Council Resolution 981 transferred control to the newly established United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia on 31 March 1995, and then to UNMOP through the <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> Council Resolution 1038 of 15 January 1996.

That resolution determined that the conditions necessary to deploy the peacekeepers had not yet been met. Instead, the UN deployed 50 liaison officers to prepare the mission while fighting continued throughout 1991.

5|$|There {{were several}} more {{attempts}} to advocate the Z-4 Plan {{as the basis}} of a political settlement of the Croatian War of Independence. After Croatia captured western Slavonia from the RSK in Operation Flash in early May, Owen and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK officials to Geneva in an effort to revive the plan. The initiative was endorsed by the <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> Council and the G7, which was preparing its summit in Halifax at the time. The meeting was attended by Owen, Stoltenberg, Galbraith, Kerestedjiants, Eide and Ahrens as the international diplomats; the RSK was represented by Martić, Mikelić and Babić, and the Croatian delegation was led by Šarinić. Šarinić accepted the invitation, claiming that the venue was a Croatian concession because Croatian authorities considered the issue an internal matter which should normally be dealt with in Croatia. On the other hand, the RSK delegation insisted on Croatian withdrawal from the territory captured earlier that month before negotiations could proceed. Since no such withdrawal was requested by the <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> Council, Croatia rejected the demand and the initiative collapsed.|$|E
