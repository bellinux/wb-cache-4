50|$|Distortion {{is caused}} by <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> across a film's {{dimension}} and starts to warp or curl.

Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.|$|E
50|$|Generally, thinner {{walls are}} more {{feasible}} with small parts {{rather than with}} large ones. The limiting factor in wall thinness is the tendency for the plastic material in thin walls to cool and solidify before the mold is filled. The shorter the material flow, the thinner the wall can be. Walls also should be as uniform in thickness as possible to avoid warpage from <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> When changes in wall thickness are unavoidable, the transition should be gradual and not abrupt.|$|E
5000|$|Wood warping is a {{deviation}} from flatness in timber {{as a result}} of stresses and <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> Warping can also occur in wood considered [...] "dry" [...] (wood can take up and release moisture indefinitely), when it takes up moisture unevenly, or - especially - is allowed to return to its [...] "dry" [...] equilibrium state unevenly, too slowly, or too quickly. Many factors can contribute to wood warp; wood species, grain orientation, air flow, sunlight, uneven finishing, temperature - even cutting season and the moon's gravitational pull are taken into account in some traditions (e.g., violin making).|$|E
40|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} (SLS) is a rapid prototyping process, which operates {{by using a}} laser to locally heat an area within a layer of powder material, causing it to fuse together, creating a thin cross-section of solid material. 3 D shapes are built by repeatedly depositing a layer of fresh powder {{on top of the}} cross-section and then locally heating it, causing it to fuse together and to the layer beneath. However, during SLS processing, temperature differences that exist in different regions of the fabricated parts lead to <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkages.</b> The shrinkages cause surfaces in the part, which are intended to be flat, to exhibit a curved profile; a phenomenon termed curl. The development of curl is highly influenced by the SLS machine parameters selected in fabrication. The production of geometrically acceptable parts involves numerous fabrication trials before the optimum machine parameters can be found. The procedure can be time consuming and expensive. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to develop finite element models for the purpose of predicting curl in SLS fabricated polycarbonate parts. The ultimate goal was to use the models to estimate the optimum SLS machine parameters for the physical fabrication of geometrically acceptable parts, produced in any material, and therefore avoid the costly and time consuming process of using SLS machines for experimental purposes. The prediction of curl was made through heat transfer and stress finite element models that were both coupled using the sequentially coupled thermal-stress analysis technique. Experimental work was carried out to measure material properties used as input to the models and to validate results predicted. The sensitivity of curl predicted to assumptions considered in the heat and stress models was introduced, and the assumptions highly influencing the accuracy of curl predictions were identified. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of composite structures the alignment of the reinforcing fibers can be distorted into wavy patterns due to <b>uneven</b> curing and <b>shrinkage</b> of the resin. Such wavy distortions will reduce both the strength and the stiffness of the composite structure. Yet if the fibers are intentionally formed into wavy patterns in an elastomer matrix a composite material with a stiffness that responds to changing loads and strains is produced. Such materials {{can be applied to}} uses were great flexibility is required within a limited range but high stiffness is required outside the range. This is the requirement for athletic knee braces and aircraft arrestor nets to name only two applications. Wave propagation techniques can be used to study the effects of fiber waviness on the stiffnesses of composite materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The article {{deals with}} the basic {{technological}} aspects of injection moulding, pointing {{to the importance of}} correct product geometry design. Large differences in the wall thickness of the mould result in <b>uneven</b> cooling, material <b>shrinkage,</b> and the formation of internal stress. This ultimately may give rise to deformations, such as those in form sink marks, and may affect the required quality of the mould. The article describes the application of a specific example of one of the ways of correction of the mould wall thickness used in technological practice of the injection moulding technology. This is a case of employing the method of the so-called relief pins. After the introduction of the proposed modification of the form, the mould quality has improved, thereby increasing the production efficiency in the process of shape optimization of manufacturing the product called Installation Box Series S-BOX 106 made of polyamide PA 66. In addressing the issue, simulation of cooling plastic and injection pressure in Cadmold 3 D-f software was employed...|$|R
50|$|An {{adobe brick}} is a {{composite}} material made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung. The soil composition typically contains sand, silt and clay. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> rates through the brick. Dung offers the same advantage. The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15% clay, 10-30% silt and 55-75% fine sand. Another source quotes 15-25% clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles 2 to 10 in with no deleterious effect. Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland cement up to 10% by weight.|$|E
5000|$|The four-minute [...] "Amberol" [...] {{cylinder}} {{made its}} début in 1908. Amberols {{were made of}} a brittle, black wax-like compound which was harder than the original 1902 black wax. This Amberol wax was also used for 2-minute [...] "Standard" [...] records from 1908 until the Blue Amberol appeared in 1912. The introduction of the Amberol started a resurgence of interest in cylinder records, but problems soon became apparent. Amberols crack rather easily and could break during playback. Amberols often shattered when they broke, unlike some kinds of 2-minute wax cylinders that would simply crack into a few pieces. Another problem was that wax Amberols wore out too quickly. Some Amberols mistracked or played with a wavering pitch due to <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> during the manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} that a study {{requires}} the shoreline position from before aerial photographs, or if the location has poor photographic coverage, historical maps provide an alternative. Many errors are associated with early maps and charts. Such errors {{may be associated with}} scale, datum changes, distortions from <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> stretching, creases, tears and folds, different surveying standards, different publication standards and projection errors. The severity of these errors depends on the accuracy of the map and the physical changes that occurred after it was made. The oldest reliable source of shoreline data in the United States dates is the U.S Coast and Geodetic Survey/National Ocean Service T-sheets and dates to the early-to-mid-19th century. In the United Kingdom, many pre-1750 maps and charts were deemed to be inaccurate. The founding of the Ordnance Survey in 1791 improved mapping accuracy.|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{waviness}} in laminated {{composite material}} is introduced during manufacture because of <b>uneven</b> curing, resin <b>shrinkage,</b> or ply buckling caused by bending the composite lay-up into its final shape prior to curing. The resulting waviness has a detrimental effect on mechanical properties, therefore this condition {{is important to}} detect and characterize. Ultrasonic characterization methods are difficult to interpret because elastic wave propagation is highly dependent on ply orientation and material stresses. By comparison, the pulsed terahertz response of the composite is shown to provide clear indications of the fiber waviness. Pulsed Terahertz NDE is an electromagnetic inspection method that operates in the frequency range between 300 GHz and 3 THz. Its propagation is influenced by refractive index variations and interfaces. This work applies pulsed Terahertz NDE to the inspection of a thick composite beam with fiber waviness. The sample is a laminated glass composite material approximately 15 mm thick with a 90 -degree bend. Terahertz response from the planar section, away from the bend, is indicative of a homogeneous material with no major reflections from internal plies, while the multiple reflections at the bend area correspond to the fiber waviness. Results of these measurements are presented for the planar and bend areas...|$|R
40|$|Efter introduktionen av Eurokoderna har mängden minimiarmering i betongkonstruktioner ökat. Denna ökning beror på skillnader i metoderna som nu används för att beräkna mängden minimiarmering i olika typer av betongkonstruktioner och de som användes tidigare då BKR var den gällande normen. Minimiarmering används i betongkonstruktioner för att omfördela tvångsdeformationer. I detta arbete undersöks om mängden minimiarmering kan minskas utan att dess huvudsakliga funktion går förlorad. I arbetet har ett antal metoder för att beräkna minimiarmering jämförts för att se hur stora skillnaderna i armeringsmängd blir, varför dessa uppkommer och vilka för- och nackdelar som finns med metoderna. De undersökta metoderna inkluderar den som anges i Eurokod 2, förändringar som gjorts i den tyska nationella bilagan till Eurokod 2 och ett förslag till ändring som presenterats av Hallgren i ett preliminärt arbete.   Resultaten bygger på simuleringar utförda i FEM-programmet Atena där olika typfall undersökts. I typfallen har betongens hållfasthetsklass, tvärsnittsdimension, armeringsdimension, täckande betongskikt och vidhäftningsförutsättning varierats. Armeringsmängden varierades för att motsvara den mängd som krävs vid beräkning enligt de tidigare nämnda metoderna. I alla undersökta fall antas tvärsnittet vara utsatt för ren dragbelastning, vilket är fallet vid krympning. Resultaten från de numeriska simuleringarna visade att en större armeringsmängd ger minskade sprickbredder och ökade möjligheter att omfördela tvångsdeformationer till nya sprickor. Bildandet av nya sprickor sker också vid en mindre krympning. Skillnaderna jämfört med om en mindre armeringsmängd används blir dock i de flesta fall små och mängden armering kan reduceras utan att minimiarmeringens sprickfördelande funktion äventyras. Resultaten från de numeriska simuleringarna användes också för att ta fram ett alternativ som ger en mindre mängd minimiarmering utan att armeringens huvudsakliga funktion försvinner. I detta arbete föreslås en förändring rörande koefficienten k i Eurokod. Förändringen av värdet på koefficienten k gör att mängden erforderlig minimiarmering minskar betydligt vid beräkningar, speciellt för tvärsnitt med en större tvärsnittshöjd. Fler numeriska simuleringar utfördes och det kunde säkerställas att en armeringsmängd motsvarande den som ges med den föreslagna ändringen fungerar för alla undersökta typfall. Endast en liten ökning av sprickbredderna sker.   En undersökning av sprickproblematiken under betongens hållfasthetstillväxtfas har gjorts, och resultaten visar att problem med sprickbildning inte beror på den autogena krympningen eller på uttorkningskrympningen. Endast en liten andel av denna krympning hinner uppnås under de första veckorna, samtidigt som hållfasthetstillväxten sker relativt snabbt. Problem med sprickbildning under denna tidsperiod beror istället på andra faktorer såsom en stor värmeutveckling i betongen, en ojämn uttorkning eller en ojämn temperaturfördelning över tvärsnittet i kombination med tvång. Efter den värmeutveckling som skett i betongen under det första dygnet efter gjutning påbörjas en avsvalningsfas. Under denna kan sprickbildning uppstå i betongen, och denna sprickbildning finns kvar när uttorkningskrympningen senare fortskrider. En jämförelse har även gjorts mellan handberäkningar av karaktäristiska sprickbredder enligt Betongföreningens handbok till Eurokod 2 och sprickbredder utlästa ur resultaten från de numeriska simuleringarna. Resultaten visar att metoden överlag fungerar bra, men att vissa justeringar skulle kunna göras för att anpassa den till mindre värden på betongens krympning. After the {{introduction}} of the Eurocodes, the minimum amount of reinforcement for crack control in concrete structures has increased. This is due to differences in themethods for calculating the minimum amount of reinforcement used in the Eurocodes and in BKR, a standard which was used in Sweden before the Eurocodes. Minimum reinforcement for crack control is used in concrete structures to redistribute the tensile stresses caused by restraint during the shrinkage. This thesis examines if the amount of minimum reinforcement can be reduced without compromising the main functions of the reinforcement. In this thesis a number of methods for calculating the minimum reinforcement has been compared to see how large the differences in the amount of reinforcement are, why they occur and what are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different methods. The different methods revised in this thesis are the method in Eurocode 2, the changes made in the German National Annex to the Eurocode 2 method and a method proposed by Hallgren in a preliminary work.   The results are based on simulations performed in the FEM-application Atena where different scenarios were examined. In the investigated scenarios, the strength classes of the concrete, the cross-sectional dimensions, the size of the reinforcement bars, the size of the concrete cover and the bond strength has been varied. The amount of reinforcement in each case has been varied to correspond to the required minimum amount according to the different methods for calculating minimum reinforcement. In all investigated cases, the cross section is assumed to be exposed to pure tensile load, which is the case for shrinkage. The results of the simulations showed that a larger amount of reinforcement reduces the width of the cracks, that a larger amount of small cracks are formed, and that new cracks are formed earlier at a lower shrinkage value. The differences are however in most cases small compared to when a lower amount of reinforcement is used. In other words, a lower amount of reinforcement could be used without compromising the main functions of the minimum reinforcement. The results from the simulations have also been used to obtain an alternative method for calculating the minimum reinforcement that gives a lower amount of reinforcement without compromising the main functions. The proposed change in Eurocode is a modification in the value of the coefficient k. By changing the value of the coefficient k, the amount of required minimum reinforcement is decreased significantly, especially for large crosssection heights. More numerical simulations were performed to ensure that the reinforcement amount according to the proposed change works for all scenarios considered in this thesis. The results showed that the reinforcement were capable of redistributing the tensile stresses caused by restraint. Only a small increase in the crack widths could be observed.   An investigation was conducted to find an explanation to why cracks occur during the first weeks after casting of the concrete. The results show that the problem with cracks occurring during this period is neither due to the autogenous shrinkage nor the drying shrinkage. Only a small share of those types of shrinkage are achieved during the first weeks, and at the same time the concrete strength growth is relatively fast. Instead, the problems with cracks seem to be caused by other factors, such as a large heat development in the concrete during the first day, <b>uneven</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> or an <b>uneven</b> temperature distribution over the cross section in combination with restraint. Cracks can develop during the first days after casting of the concrete due to the shrinkage that occur when the concrete cools off after the large heat development the first day. These cracks remain when the drying shrinkage continues. A comparison was also made between hand calculations of the characteristic crack widths according to “Betongföreningens handbok till Eurokod 2 ” and the crack widths read out of the results from the numerical simulations. The results showed that the method generally works well, but some minor adjustments could be made to adapt the method to smaller values of concrete shrinkage...|$|R
50|$|Shrinkage is a {{characteristic}} of paper {{because of the nature}} of cellulose fibers. The cellulose fiber is hygroscopic and acts like a sponge when immersed in water. The fibers expand in their width and not in their length. With handmade paper, because there is no direction associated with the fibers, the paper expands and shrinks unevenly in both the length and width of the finished sheet. With machine-made paper, because there is a direction to the fibers, the paper shrinks unevenly, that is, less in its length (in the direction of the fibers) and more in its width (in the direction opposite of the fibers). This characteristic is important to the printer because certain printing techniques required the paper to be dampened prior to printing. As such, when the paper dried, the <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of machine-made paper would produce an image of different proportions than the die that created it. The differences in appearance between wet and dry printed stamps can sometimes be quite noticeable, with dry printed stamps generally having sharper images on stiffer and thicker paper.|$|E
50|$|In skydiving, Spectra {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} used for suspension lines, largely supplanting the earlier-used Dacron, being lighter and less bulky. Spectra has excellent strength and wear-resistance, but is not dimensionally stable (ie. shrinks) when exposed to heat, which leads to gradual and <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of different lines as they are subject to differing amounts of friction during canopy deployment, necessitating periodic line replacement. It is also almost completely inflexible, which can exacerbate the opening shock. For that reason, Dacron (PET) lines continue to be used in student and some tandem systems, where the added bulk is less of a concern than the potential for an injurious opening. In turn, in high performance parachutes used for swooping, Spectra is replaced with Vectran and HMA (high-modulus aramid), which are even thinner and dimensionally stable, but exhibit greater wear and require much more frequent maintenance to prevent catastrophic failure. Spectra / Dyneema are also used for reserve parachute closing loops when used with automatic activation devices, where their extremely low coefficient of friction is critical for proper operation in the event of cutter activation.|$|E
50|$|The unshrunk tubing is fitted on {{the wire}} before making the connection, then slid down to cover the joint after it is made. If the fit is tight, {{silicone}} lubricant can be applied without compromising the heat-shrink material. The tubing is then shrunk to wrap tightly around the joint by heating in an oven or with a hot air gun or other source of hot gas flow. Convenient but less consistent methods for shrinking the tube include a soldering iron held close to but not touching the tube, or the heat from a lighter. Uncontrolled heat can cause <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> physical damage and insulation failure, and these methods are not recommended by heatshrink suppliers. If overheated, heat-shrink tubing can melt, scorch or catch fire like any other plastic. Heating causes the tubing to contract to between half and one sixth of its original diameter, depending on the material used, providing a snug fit over irregularly shaped joints. There is also longitudinal shrinking, usually unwanted {{and to a lesser}} extent than narrowing, of typically around 6%. The tubing provides good electrical insulation, protection from dust, solvents and other foreign materials, and mechanical strain relief, and is mechanically held in place (unless incorrectly oversized or not properly shrunk) by its tight fit.|$|E
30|$|Timber {{structures}} {{are sensitive to}} the climate variations when exposed to outdoor environment, as wood is a hygroscopic material. With the change of humidity and temperature of the surrounding air, <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> or swelling deformation can be formed in the cross section of timber elements, and internal stresses will be further produced (Larsen and Ormarsson 2013). Due to low perpendicular-to-grain tensile strength of wood, longitudinal cracks are frequently observed in timber elements (Frühwald et al. 2007). It was also proved by a previous field experiment, which indicated that when glulam elements were exposed to external climate conditions, moisture-induced stresses would exceed the tensile strength of wood in the perpendicular-to-grain direction (Fragiacomo et al. 2011).|$|E

At the same time, the cooling time in the discontinuous zone was longer than the continuous zone because of less exposure in the cooling medium. Although a tensile force (FT) was generated by the <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> from adjacent continuous phase of the coatings under the quenching interference[35 – 37], FT was {{much smaller than the}} critical value (Fcr) for both Q 1 and Q 2 coating. Thus, the crystallization process of polymer chains was dominated by the crystallization driving force and crystallization time[32, 38]; therefore, nano-willow and nano-fiber segments were obtained in the discontinuous zone of Q 1 coating, while nano-spheres/papules coexisted with smaller nano-fiber segments in the discontinuous zone of Q 2 coating.|$|E

The fibers have a polystyrene core and testing done at room temperature showed that one fiber can support the isotherm with a factor of safety of 13. 2 before fracture will occur from a uniaxial load.

30|$|Through {{the past}} 5  years' research, it is firstly found that bionic {{self-cleaning}} surfaces with well-ordered polymer nano-wires/fibers can be fabricated by disturbing polymer crystallization during one-step coating-curing process. Both the external macroscopic force and internal microscopic force interferences on polymer aggregates can significantly affect the nucleation and crystal growth of polymer chains under various cooling conditions. Orderly polymer nano-fibers (5 to 10 μm in length/ 100 nm in width) {{with a certain}} direction are obtained due to an external macroscopic force ‘Fblow,’ {{which is on the}} same direction as the H 2 gas flow. This orderly MNBS structure results in the coating with superior superhydrophobicity (WCA of 170 ° and WSA 0 ° to 1 °), very similar with ‘lotus effect.’ More particularly, well-ordered nano-wires and nano-bridges (1 to 8 μm in length/ 10 to 80 nm in width) are generated at the non-continuous zone due to an internal microscopic tensile force (FT) by severe <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of adjacent continuous phases in the non-uniform medium (quenched in dry ice). The novel method for well-ordered polymer nano-fiber will provide a theoretical basis for other polymer self-cleaning surfaces with MNBS texture on various metal substrates and largely promote their practical application in many fields such as drag-reduction and anti-icing.|$|E
40|$|Injection molding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods of mass production. After injecting molten plastic into a mold, the heat must leave the plastic material, enter the mold steel, enter the coolant, and exit the mold. This heat flow is {{critical}} to producing high quality parts rapidly. As plastic cools, the plastic shrinks. Uneven cooling causes <b>uneven</b> <b>shrinkage</b> which can cause the part to warp from the resulting internal stresses or create sink marks on the part. Thus the effect of uneven cooling is lower part quality, both in appearance and in dimension. Standard or conventional cooling channels are straight-drilled holes arranged such that they intersect and connect to form a loop for coolant, typically water, to flow through. This allows the mold to act as a heat exchanger, transferring heat to the coolant and carrying heated coolant away from the mold. While standard cooling channels have been used widely in the injection molding industry for their manufacturability and proven results, other methods have been developed for creating molds with cooling channels of any desired path or shape. These channels, called conformal due to how they conform to the shape of the part, provide uniform cooling, eliminate or reduce the quality issues of warpage and shrinkage, and provide faster, more economical cycle times. Conformal cooling is cannot be produced only by subtractive manufacturing methods that remove material from raw stock but rather through additive or hybrid manufacturing techniques that add material in layers of powder, sections, or sheets. Bonded sheet layer mold inserts can be made of any size and are currently the only feasible way of making large, conformally-cooled molds. Presented is a Six Sigma approach for implementing conformal cooling in existing molds to achieve the benefits of higher part quality and fast cycle times. Feasibility considerations include existing mold features such as slides and ejectors, choice of channel diameter, and the cooling channel path. Cost justification considerations include assessing part quality cost impact through calculation of the costs of poor quality and assessing machine capacity as relates to cycle time. With the approach presented, an injection molding company should be able to assess feasibility and cost effectiveness of implementing conformal cooling on its molds...|$|E
