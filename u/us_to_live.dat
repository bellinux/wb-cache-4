25|$|During {{his time}} in England in the early 1920s, Hughes {{became part of the}} black {{expatriate}} community. In November 1924, he returned to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with his mother in Washington, D.C. After assorted odd jobs, he gained white-collar employment in 1925 as a personal assistant to the historian Carter G. Woodson at the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. As the work demands limited his time for writing, Hughes quit the position to work as a busboy at the Wardman Park Hotel. There he encountered the poet Vachel Lindsay, with whom he shared some poems. Impressed with the poems, Lindsay publicized his discovery of a new black poet. By this time, Hughes's earlier work had been published in magazines and was about to be collected into his first book of poetry.|$|E

500|$|Then-president George W. Bush, {{when asked}} whether he would watch the film, responded: [...] "Doubt it." [...] “New {{technologies}} will change how we live and how we drive our cars, which all will have the beneficial effect of improving the environment,” Bush said. “And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases {{have been caused by}} mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> better lives {{and at the same time}} protect the environment”. Gore responded that [...] "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [...] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true." [...] White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino stated that [...] "The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity".|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] on the {{blackboard}} as a punishment for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips <b>Us</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E
500|$|In England in {{the spring}} of 1846, she met Giuseppe Mazzini, who had been in exile there from Italy since 1837. Fuller also met the Italian revolutionary Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, a marquis who had been disinherited by his family because of his support for Mazzini. Fuller and Ossoli moved in {{together}} in Florence, Italy, likely before they were married, though whether they ever married is uncertain. Fuller was originally opposed to marrying him, {{in part because of the}} difference in their religions; she was Protestant and he was Roman Catholic. Emerson speculated that the couple was [...] "married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec" [...] of 1847, though he did not explain his reasoning. Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4, 1848, to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting but one biographer provided evidence they first met on April 1 during the ceremony called [...] "Lavanda degli Altari" [...] (Altars Lavage). By the time the couple moved to Florence, they were referred to as husband and wife, though it is unclear if any formal ceremony took place. It seems certain that at the time their child was born, they were not married. By New Year's Day 1848, she suspected that she was pregnant but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks. Their child, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli, was born in early September 1848 and nicknamed Angelino. The couple was very secretive about their relationship but, after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness, they became less so. Fuller informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849 in a letter that explained that she had kept silent so as not to upset her [...] "but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> publicly and permanently together." [...] Her mother's response makes it clear that she was aware that the couple was not legally married. Even so, she was happy for her daughter, writing: [...] "I send my first kiss with my fervent blessing to my grandson." ...|$|E

At the close of his four-day trial Te Whiti declared: [...] "It is not my wish that evil should come to the two races. My wish is for the whole of <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> peaceably and happy on the land." [...] The magistrate committed both men to jail in New Plymouth until further notice. Six months later they were moved to the South Island, where they were frequently taken from jail to be escorted around the factories, churches and public buildings.|$|E
