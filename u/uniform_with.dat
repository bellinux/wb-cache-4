5|$|Mess Dress Uniform– {{the dark}} blue United States Air Force mess dress <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> CAP-distinctive {{insignia}} and sleeve braid. This is worn by senior members only.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are classified}} mainly as baroclinic, because they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient known as frontal zones. They can become barotropic late {{in their life}} cycle, when the distribution of heat around the cyclone becomes fairly <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> its radius.|$|E
50|$|MP {{personnel}} typically wear either specific display dress <b>uniforms</b> <b>with</b> white MP shoulder markings or the branch-common daily {{battle dress}} <b>uniforms</b> <b>with</b> a red beret.|$|R

5000|$|According to the North China Herald, the Bodyguard wore blue <b>uniforms</b> <b>with</b> scarlet facings {{and green}} {{shoulder}} straps bearing unit identification in Chinese characters. Artillerymen wore light blue <b>uniforms</b> <b>with</b> red facings and trouser stripes. Infantry wore dark green in winter dress with red facings and shoulder straps in regimental colours. In summer all branches wore white <b>uniforms</b> <b>with</b> scarlet facings. All units wore green turbans.|$|R
5|$|Special {{police were}} {{visually}} distinguished by the gradual {{introduction of a}} green <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> a shoulder patch worn on the right sleeve. Officially referred to as Sword and Lightning,(Mač i munja) {{the design of the}} Croatian special police shoulder sleeve insignia was inspired by the US Army Special Forces insignia.|$|E
5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E
5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E

5|$|Ceolnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury {{throughout}} Æthelwulf's reign, also minted coins {{of his own}} at Canterbury: {{there were}} three different portrait designs, thought to be contemporary {{with each of the}} first three of Æthelwulf's Canterbury issues. These were followed by an inscribed cross design that was <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> Æthelwulf's final coinage. At Rochester, Bishop Beornmod produced only one issue, a cross-and-wedges design which was contemporary with Æthelwulf's Saxoniorum issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the rules of the}} International Olympic Committee, Germany does not wear its official <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> the logo of the German Football Association while competing at the Summer Olympics. Instead, the DFB badge is replaced by the coat of arms of Germany. Like all DFB squads, the women's national team is supplied by Adidas, which had provided a specifically designed female football jersey since 1999. The team's main sponsor is the German insurance company Allianz.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely <b>uniform,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of some minor deviations, {{by the time of}} the spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E

5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> gold-plated epaulettes, {{given to him by}} officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E
5|$|On the Iberian Peninsula, apothecaries' weights in the 19th {{century were}} {{relatively}} <b>uniform,</b> <b>with</b> 24grains per scruple (576grains per ounce), the standard in Romance countries. The weight of an apothecaries' pound was 345.1g in Spain and 344.2g in Portugal. As in Italy, {{some of the}} additional subdivisions of the Roman system, such as the obolo, were still in use there. It was standard to use the marco, defined as 8ounces, instead of the pound.|$|E
5|$|Some troops {{establish}} Venture patrols as {{an optional}} program for boys thirteen through seventeen years old. Venture patrols experience more autonomy from the troop than ordinary patrols, and provide older Scouts with expanded social contact and physical challenges. The Venture patrol {{is guided by}} the assistant Scoutmaster-Venture {{who is responsible for}} Venture patrol activities. Venture patrol members wear the standard Boy Scout <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> the Venture strip over the right pocket. Patrol members are Boy Scouts and should never be referred to as Venture Scouts.|$|E

50|$|Both teams sported throwback <b>uniforms,</b> <b>with</b> the Packers {{in yellow}} and brown and the Patriots wearing the white road version of their AFL-era <b>uniforms</b> <b>with</b> Pat Patriot logo. The Packers stormed to a 10-0 halftime lead but two Vincent Brisby {{touchdown}} catches and a last-minute Matt Bahr field goal rallied the Patriots to a 17-16 win.|$|R
5|$|The buttons worn on the Infantryman's {{clothing}} {{is not as}} minor a detail as it would sound. The average infantryman may have had his uniform made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In reflection to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned his <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> Georgia State buttons. This would indicate to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for {{both sides in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} most {{significant}} difference is in Napoleon, in his clothing, and in his general stature. David's version depicts Napoleon, dressed in an immaculate, multi-coloured <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> a billowing cape. Delaroche's version, however, sees Napoleon in a fairly ordinary, gray coat with {{the sole purpose of}} keeping the cold away, rather than showing him as the symbol he may have represented - that of a gallant and powerful war leader, which is the impression given in David's version.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting for}} Maria-sama ga Miteru is , a fictional Catholic school founded in 1901 in Musashino, Tokyo, Japan; {{the school is}} {{depicted}} as an elegant, clean, pure, and very prestigious institution. Among the facilities of Lillian, aside from the classrooms, there is a church, a greenhouse, a kendo dojo, an auditorium, a park, and the Rose Mansion, where the Yamayuri Council meet. The students are very respectable and in good standing. The uniform at the school is a long, black Japanese school <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> a white collar.|$|E

5|$|The work is unfinished; {{a number}} of details, most noticeably the pope's right hand, are missing. Other {{passages}} are bland and <b>uniform,</b> <b>with</b> some key areas still blocked by the underdrawing. Many of Titian's characteristic finishing touches are missing; Paul's fur-lined sleeves do not contain the polishing white strokes of the 1543 portrait, or his usual final overglaze or glossing.|$|E
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's <b>uniform,</b> <b>with</b> medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|A near-contemporary {{account of}} Æthelwig's life, or Vita, is {{included}} in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey. This was a 13th-century work by Thomas of Marlborough, which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In order to do this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on Æthelwig. However, because of Thomas' purpose in composing the Chronicon, he probably altered some of the texts he included, and it appears that the life of Æthelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that composit work was adapted by Thomas into his Chronicon. The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the Æthelwig material is stylistic <b>uniform</b> <b>with</b> other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.|$|E
