5|$|By 1887 {{the threat}} of {{extinction}} was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England. The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further {{the best interests of}} the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle. By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.|$|E

The destroyer {{would then be}} blown <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time the RAF would carry {{out a number of}} diversionary air raids in the area. Most of them failed because of heavy clouds and fog and very few bombers.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released monologue of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's recollection of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United States that he was not involved in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives. In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E

5|$|After a few warm up gigs {{towards the}} end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scotts, London on 1 May. Realising the opera's {{narrative}} was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played Tommy all the way through at full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the audience would all stand <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of Tommy had a significant positive response.|$|E

25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal.|$|E

The Mine Hill Township Council consists of five elected members, each chosen at-large by the voters of Mine Hill in partisan elections for a four-year term on a staggered basis {{as part of the}} November general election, with two or three seats coming up for election every other year, and the mayoral seat <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time that two council seats are up for vote. At the Council's organizational meeting each January, one member is elected to serve as Mayor for a twelve-month term and another is chosen to serve as Deputy Mayor.|$|E
25|$|Stimulus control {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} for patients who have conditioned themselves to associate the bed, or sleep in general, with a negative response. As stimulus control therapy involves taking steps to control the sleep environment, it is sometimes referred interchangeably {{with the concept of}} sleep hygiene. Examples of such environmental modifications include using the bed for sleep or sex only, not for activities such as reading or watching television; waking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time every morning, including on weekends; going to bed only when sleepy and when there is a high likelihood that sleep will occur; leaving the bed and beginning an activity in another location if sleep does not result in a reasonably brief period of time after getting into bed (commonly ~20 min); reducing the subjective effort and energy expended trying to fall asleep; avoiding exposure to bright light during nighttime hours, and eliminating daytime naps.|$|E

25|$|Gorbachev's Perestroika {{also had}} repercussions on the {{copyright}} law. From 1987 to 1990, {{a number of}} decrees modified the legislation on copyright and related areas. New remuneration rates that defined much higher royalties than the previous schedules were issued in 1987; the decreasing scales were given <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time: the royalties for all subsequent printings of a work were defined uniformly to amount to 70% of the rates for the first publication. Important changes occurred two years later, when the monopoly of the VAAP on foreign trade in copyrights was broken. Authors henceforth could negotiate directly with foreign publishers; and even the clause in the mandatory model contracts for publication that assigned this right from the author to his publisher was abolished. Likewise, Soviet publishers were free to negotiate with foreign authors or publishers licenses to publish foreign works in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The first {{conveying}} {{started in}} 1917, {{and the following}} January the city engineer started construction, but this soon terminated. At the same time Graakalbanen started preparing the first lots for sale, including installation of water, sewage and roads. In June 1919, the engineering company Grøndahl & Kjørholt took over the work, planning to be finished to Lian by 1921. However, by June 1920, the rising prices resulted in the money being used <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time {{it turned out that}} the rolling stock was too much more expensive than expected; ordering of rolling stock was therefore delayed. In 1921, no construction was done on the line. Not before Trondhjems og Stridens Sparebank issued a loan of NOK 1.6 million was it possible to continue construction. This was based on mortgaging all assets, as well as a NOK 500,000 guarantee from the city council. While work previously had been along the whole route, it was then only concentrated on the section Ila–Munkvoll, where the depot would be located.|$|E
25|$|While writing Busted's second album, A Present for Everyone, Fletcher {{was asked}} by the record label if he was {{available}} to film auditions for a new band, V. It was at this time that Danny Jones and Fletcher met for the first time; Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boyband, for which they were intended. Fletcher was impressed with Jones' unique style and so approached and invited him to write with himself and Bourne. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (yet unnamed) band and, eventually, moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London for two months, (while still receiving help from Bourne) to concentrate on writing together. Bassist Dougie Poynter and drummer Harry Judd were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement in the NME magazine. The pair, both Essex lads, coincidentally turned <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> audition and got to talking over their shared appreciation of the band The Starting Line, after Poynter noticed their name and logo was printed on Judd's T-shirt.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{lyrics are}} {{described}} as 'politically, socially and personally conscious', incorporating themes such as corporate greed, racism and {{growing up in a}} broken home. Butler says it is [...] "an ode to the disenfranchised and disaffected youth" [...] and about accepting that we will never be perfect. Some of the lyrics reflect on his early life where he had to raise his sister and grow <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. He added ambiguity to the lyrics to [...] "facilitate" [...] ideas for the listeners. Freeman said that the lyrics [...] "reveal just how self-aware he is, which is a good counterpoint to those who feel that his constant vocalizing equates to selfishness." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of Hutcherson's {{childhood}} {{was spent on}} film sets {{rather than in a}} classroom. He attended New Haven Elementary School in Union until he began his career at the age of nine, after which he began homeschooling, with his mother as his teacher. He later returned to Kentucky to attend Ryle High School for one semester. Hutcherson played on the high school's soccer team and has been a keen sports enthusiast since, also displaying a passion for football and tennis. At the age of 13, he participated in a triathlon. He later said of his schooling experiences, [...] "I know it's something kids have to deal with every single day but getting <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time every day and having to listen to teachers talk about things I could learn so much more easily on my own, I hated it." ...|$|E
500|$|Orme {{started his}} racing career in August 1891 at the Glorious Goodwood meeting at Goodwood Racecourse. He was ridden by George Barrett {{and started the}} 4/5 {{favourite}} in the Richmond Stakes. 20/1 outsider Ben Avon led the field of eight {{in the early stages}} of the race, with Orme in the middle of the pack. Orme took the lead with a quarter of a mile left to run, and despite showing his inexperience, he won easily by three quarters of a length from Flyaway (who was carrying more weight than Orme), the two then colliding as they pulled <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> meeting, two days later, Orme also started in the Prince of Wales' Stakes. He started as the 1/2 favourite and led the field from the start. Dunure made some progress from the back of the field into second place, but none of the runners could get to Orme, who won by one length. Dunure was second and Galeopsis was third, four lengths behind Dunure. After these two races, he was already as short as 5/1 for the 1892 Epsom Derby. After Goodwood the Duke of Westminster refused a big offer to purchase Orme.|$|E

500|$|The town's {{fields were}} {{enclosed}} in 1796 and {{a map of}} the village was drawn <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, showing the settlement along Town Road and Townside Road with Rector Field and Earl Field to the north and north-east respectively. At the time, more than 210 acres of land were allotted to the rectory by Lord Bristol in place of the tithes it had previously been entitled to. During the mid and late-19th century, the population of the old village of Quarrington declined (from 98 in 1851 to 72 in 1871). Aside from the rectory and church, the village included two large farms and a cluster of labourers cottages around Town Road. By 1872, the parish spanned 1,620 acres and the village contained 63 houses. The same year, Trollope wrote that [...] "the appearance of this small village, lying around its well cared for church, is very pleasing". As Sleaford expanded, houses were built along London and Station Roads, pushing the town inside the Quarrington parish boundaries in what became New Quarrington. Sanitation in the poorest parts of Sleaford worsened during the 19th century and a Local Board of Health was charged with improving living conditions. In 1879, Lord Bristol sold land on Quarrington Hill to the board, who built a pumping station to transport clean fenland water east into the town.|$|E
