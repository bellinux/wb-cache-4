5|$|Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest {{foreign policy}} concern dealt with China. In 1868, the Senate had {{ratified}} the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots {{broke out in}} San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed {{with an emphasis on}} stopping Chinese immigration. In response, Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> abrogate treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration, and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, after Hayes left office.|$|E

25|$|Grant {{used the}} theory as {{justification}} for immigration {{policies of the}} 1920s, arguing that the immigrants from certain areas of Europe, such as Italians and other Southern Europeans and Eastern Europeans, represented a lesser type of European and their numbers in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be increased. Grant and others urged this {{as well as the}} complete restriction of non-Europeans, such as the Chinese and Japanese.|$|E

500|$|As the Cold War set in, enthusiasm in the United States for an {{alliance}} with Britain cooled as well. A September 1949 poll found that 72 per cent of Americans agreed that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> [...] "share our atomic energy secrets with England". The reputation of the British Mission to Los Alamos was tarnished by the 1950 revelation that Fuchs was a Soviet atomic spy.

500|$|Davis' {{term in the}} Senate was unexceptional, {{except for}} the notably hard line he took on the {{question}} of the nation's northeastern boundary. [...] This dispute with the United Kingdom concerned the boundary between Maine and the British (now Canadian) province of New Brunswick, and had only been partially resolved after the 1794 Jay Treaty. [...] In the 1830s both sides pushed development into the disputed area, leading to petty conflicts (and by 1839 the possibility of war). [...] Massachusetts, which Maine had been a part of prior to 1820, maintained a property interest in some of the disputed land; Davis took a hard line on the matter, insisting that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> surrender any of the territory it claimed.|$|E

He was opposed by the Senate, which passed unanimously (95–0) the Byrd–Hagel Resolution (S.

[...] "I don't see myself as conservative," [...] Eastwood has stated, while noting in the same breath that he is not an [...] "ultra-leftist," [...] either. At times, he has supported Democrats in California, including Senator Dianne Feinstein in 1994, liberal United States House of Representatives member Sam Farr in 2002, and Governor Gray Davis, whom he voted for in 1998 and 2002 and hosted pricey fundraisers for in 2002 and 2003.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{proceeded}} {{to reject the}} {{clear and present danger}} test for the following reasons.
