5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, around 30 {{members of}} the Assiniboine First Nation {{were killed in the}} Cypress Hills Massacre, {{creating}} a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the North-West Mounted Police with the intention of mobilising the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> choose to intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy nationalists {{were mostly}} {{equipped}} with spears {{and had little}} protection from the firearms of the French military. They had expected that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> intervene in their favor, but no such action was taken by Washington. In addition, {{the majority of the}} population did not rise up to join them in their fight. Between July and September 1948, most of the key leaders of the Uprising were captured or killed. The last rebel stronghold, named Tsiazombazaha ("That which is inaccessible to Europeans"), fell in November 1948. Defeated, most of the remaining nationalist fighters disappeared into the eastern rainforest in December 1948.|$|E

50|$|Other resisters {{withhold}} {{a symbolic}} amount - for instance, in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> some <b>might</b> hold back $17.76/17.76% (symbolic {{of the revolutionary}} year 1776) or $10.40/10.4% (in tribute to Form 1040, which is used in federal income tax returns).|$|R
5|$|The {{borders in}} the region had been disputed since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867, {{and most of the}} influx of prospectors were American. Amid fresh concerns that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> annex the gold fields, the mounted police were tasked to assert Canadian control along the border line. The force set up control posts at the borders of the Yukon and at easily controlled mountain passes, equipping the posts with Maxim guns. The police checked for illegal weapons and prevented the entry of criminals and collected customs duties, while helping protect and guide the flow of migrants, mediating in their disputes and providing practical advice.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} 1890s, the {{government}} had no presence in the far north-west of Canada. In 1894, the rise of gold mining and a growing population led to calls for Ottawa to intervene, both to control whiskey trading {{and to protect the}} local First Nations. In response, the mounted police carried out a survey along the Yukon River and gathered customs duties. Fears grew that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> try to seize the mineral-rich region, and a twenty-man police team was established at Forty Mile in 1895. Although there was very little actual crime, frictions soon rose between the police and the Miners' Committees, which had been created to provide informal justice during the previous few years. The police brought the issue to a head in June 1896, sending a team into one of the mining camps to overturn the decisions of the local committee.|$|E
25|$|In a 15 January 2008 news release, the Republic of Lakotah {{proposed}} that {{independence from the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> follow a Compact of Free Association and suggested that the independence process could resemble that of the Philippines, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands.|$|E
5000|$|Vida Juvan (17 June 1905 [...] - [...] 4 October 1998) was a Slovenian {{actress who}} won the Prešeren Award in 1971. In the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> she <b>might</b> be best known for {{a role in the}} horror film [...]|$|R

50|$|The species ? Mimetodon nanophus {{was named}} by Holtzman in 1978. It {{has also been}} known as Neoplagiaulax nanophus (Holtzman 1978). Remains {{were found in the}} Middle-Upper Paleocene-age strata of the Tongue River Formation in North Dakota (<b>United</b> <b>States).</b> This <b>might</b> be the same as M. silberlingi.|$|R
25|$|A great {{boost to}} the {{popularity}} of the planetarium worldwide was provided by the Space Race of the 1950s and 60s when fears that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> miss out on the opportunities of the new frontier in space stimulated a massive program to install over 1,200 planetaria in U.S. high schools.|$|E
25|$|Hispanicization is {{the process}} by which a place or a person absorbs {{characteristics}} of Hispanic society and culture. Modern hispanization of a place, namely in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>might</b> be illustrated by Spanish-language media and businesses. Hispanization of a person might be illustrated by speaking Spanish, making and eating Hispanic American food, listening to Spanish language music or participating in Hispanic festivals and holidays - Hispanization of those outside the Hispanic community as opposed to assimilation of Hispanics into theirs.|$|E
25|$|As the Buddhist crisis deepened in July 1963, non-communist Vietnamese nationalists and the {{military}} began preparations for a coup. Bùi Diễm, later South Vietnam's Ambassador to the United States, reported in his memoirs that General Lê Văn Kim requested his aid in learning what the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> do about Diệm's government. Diễm had contacts in both the embassy and with the high-profile American journalists then in South Vietnam, David Halberstam (New York Times), Neil Sheehan (United Press International) and Malcolm Browne (Associated Press).|$|E
50|$|Behavioralism studies how {{individuals}} behave in group positions realistically rather than {{how they should}} behave. For example, {{a study of the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Congress <b>might</b> include a consideration of how members of Congress behave in their positions. The subject of interest is how Congress becomes an 'arena of actions' and the surrounding formal and informal spheres of power.|$|R
50|$|Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) (sometimes {{also written}} as Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) Status) {{is a special}} way for minors {{currently}} in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> to adjust status to that of Lawful Permanent Resident despite unauthorized entry or unlawful presence in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> that <b>might</b> usually make them inadmissible to the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and create bars to Adjustment of Status. The key criterion for SIJS is abuse, neglect, or abandonment by one or both parents.|$|R

25|$|He {{felt the}} Turks had overstepped {{the bounds of}} {{legitimate}} NATO interests in Cyprus and suggested that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> have to reexamine its military aid program to Turkey. During this time, President Gerald R. Ford had succeeded Nixon after his resignation; eventually Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made it clear with two presidential vetoes that they favored continued military assistance to Turkey as a valued NATO ally, but Congress overrode both vetoes and in December 1974 prohibited such aid, which instituted an arms embargo that lasted five years.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Roubini {{studied the}} {{collapse}} of emerging economies. He used an intuitive, historical approach backed up by an understanding of theoretical models to analyze these countries {{and came to the}} conclusion that a common denominator was the large current account deficits financed by loans from abroad. Roubini theorized that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> be the next to suffer, and as early as 2004 began writing about a possible future collapse. Business Week magazine writer Michael Mandel, however, noted in 2006 that Roubini and other economists often make general predictions which could happen over multiyear periods.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of hostilities in Europe in 1939, along with the growing realization that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> soon be drawn into World War II, resulted {{in the formation of}} the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP). The Piper J-3 Cub became the primary trainer aircraft of the CPTP and played an integral role in its success, achieving legendary status. About 75% of all new pilots in the CPTP (from a total of 435,165 graduates) were trained in Cubs. By war's end, 80% of all United States military pilots had received their initial flight training in Piper Cubs.|$|E

5000|$|Frank McDowell Leavitt (1856 - 1928) was an American {{engineer}} and inventor.

Leavitt was part of an emerging cadre of American engineers whose design feats were putting <b>United</b> <b>States</b> manufacturing <b>might</b> on the map {{at the dawn of the}} twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, American {{scientists}} have been experimenting with other renewable energy, including solar power. Although solar power generation is still not economical {{in much of the}} <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> recent developments <b>might</b> make it more affordable.|$|R
25|$|In 1896, {{huge amounts}} of gold were {{discovered}} in the Klondike valley, prompting an international gold rush. Local miners streamed from Forty Mile to the new town of Dawson and, once word got out to the external world the next year, around 100,000 more rushed to the region in search of gold. Although no more than 40,000 successfully reached the Klondike, an estimated 60 to 80 percent of these newcomers came from the United States. The mounted police deployed to the region in increasing strength, {{in part due to}} concerns that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> take the opportunity to annex the Klondike.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{a report}} {{prepared}} by {{the staff of the}} Parliamentary Information and Research Service of Canada suggested that because of the September 11 attacks, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> be less interested in pursuing the international waterways claim in the interests of having a more secure North American perimeter. This report was based on an earlier paper, The Northwest Passage Shipping Channel: Is Canada's Sovereignty Really Floating Away? by Andrea Charron, given to the 2004 Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute Symposium. Later in 2006 former United States Ambassador to Canada, Paul Cellucci agreed with this position; however, the succeeding ambassador, David Wilkins, stated that the Northwest Passage was in international waters.|$|E
25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{leveled at}} this justification {{is that it}} does not fulfill one of the requirements of a just war and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{landmarks}} can be characteristic features, such as mountains or plateaus. Examples {{of natural}} landmarks are Table Mountain in South Africa, Mount Ararat in Turkey, Uluru in Australia, Mount Fuji in Japan and Grand Canyon in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Trees <b>might</b> {{also serve as}} local landmarks, such as jubilee oaks or conifers. Some landmark trees may be nicknamed, examples being Queen's Oak, Hanging Oak or Centennial Tree.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, {{effective}} {{solutions to}} working poverty are multifaceted. Each {{of the aforementioned}} proposals could help reduce working poverty in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> but they <b>might</b> have a greater impact if {{at least a few}} of them were pursued simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Some see the {{practice}} of jury duty {{as a model for}} other types of civic service. National civic discussions about how to [...] "fix political gridlock and corruption" [...] in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> for instance, <b>might</b> benefit from deliberate structure.|$|R
25|$|General Ludendorff {{stated in}} his memoirs that he {{believed}} the entry of the Turks into the war allowed the outnumbered Central powers to fight on for two years longer {{than they would have}} been able on their own, a view shared by historian Ian F.W. Beckett. The war was extended to the Middle East with main fronts of Gallipoli, the Sinai and Palestine, Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus. The course of the war in the Balkans was also influenced by the entry of the Ottoman Empire {{on the side of the}} Central Powers. Had the war ended in 1916, some of the bloodiest engagements, such as the Battle of the Somme, would have been avoided. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> not have been drawn from its policy of isolation to intervene in a foreign war.|$|E
25|$|Though Italy did offer {{substantial}} aid, some German assistance also trickled through. After {{asking the}} new German Consul-General, Hans Döhle on 21 July 1937 for support, the Abwehr briefly made {{an exception to}} its policy and gave some limited aid. But this was aimed to exert pressure on Britain over Czechoslovakia. Promised arms shipments never eventuated. This {{was not the only}} diplomatic front on which al-Husseini was active. A month after his visit to Döhle, he wrote to the American Consul George Wadsworth (August 1937), to whom he professed his belief that America was remote from imperialist ambitions and therefore able to understand that Zionism 'represented a hostile and imperialist aggression directed against an inhabited country’. In a meeting with Wadsworth on 31 August, he expressed his fears that Jewish influence in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> persuade the country to side with Zionists. In the same period he courted the French government by expressing a willingness to assist them in the region.|$|E
25|$|In June 1958, the ARVN were {{involved}} in border clashes with Cambodia and made gains in the northeastern Cambodian province of Stung Treng. This provoked a war of words between Diệm and Sihanouk. On 31 August 1959, Nhu failed {{in an attempt to}} assassinate Sihanouk. He ordered his agents to send parcel bombs to the Cambodian leader. Two suitcases were delivered to the Sihanouks' palace, one addressed to the head of state, and the other to Prince Vakrivan, his head of protocol. The deliveries were labeled as originating from an American engineer who had previously worked in Cambodia and purported to contain gifts from Hong Kong. Sihanouk's package contained a bomb, but the other did not; however, Vakrivan opened both on behalf of the monarch and was killed instantly, as was a servant. The explosion happened adjacent to a room in the palace where Sihanouk's parents were present. At the same time, anti-Sihanouk broadcasts emanated from a secret transmitter located somewhere in South Vietnam, widely attributed to Nhu. Sihanouk quickly blamed the Ngôs and his aides made statements implying the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>might</b> {{have played a role in}} the assassination attempt.|$|E
5000|$|Kennedy {{dismissed}} Western {{fears that}} Israel might turn communist as [...] "fanatically absurd" [...] {{and argued that}} the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Britain <b>might</b> soon [...] "be looking to a Jewish state to preserve a toehold {{in that part of}} the world." ...|$|R
60|$|We may say that, {{for many}} reasons, {{it is to}} be regretted that this design was never carried into execution. Had Carlyle {{witnessed}} with his own eyes the admirable working of democratic institutions in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> he <b>might</b> have done more justice to our Transatlantic brethren, who were always his first and foremost admirers, and he might also have acquired more faith in the future destinies of his own countrymen.|$|R
50|$|Given that {{expedited}} removal now included {{people who}} were already present in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and therefore <b>might</b> affect people eligible for asylum, the INS also introduced a credible fear screening process for those who indicated {{that they might be}} eligible for asylum.|$|R
