40|$|AbstractBridges are {{the most}} {{significant}} components of the transport infrastructure {{from the viewpoint of}} safety, durability and serviceability and also from the economic aspects. Therefore, it is necessary to pay enhanced attention to their design and exploitation to fulfill required function during the bridge lifetime. Because of acting aggressive environment the resistance can be changed during the structures service time. The effort was focused on compression orthotropic deck creating the <b>upper</b> <b>flanges</b> of bridges with ballast beds. The degradation as well as material and geometric characteristics is stochastic in their nature, so the probabilistic approach to the structural reliability assessment is necessary to use. The probabilistic model was developed in ANSYS software environment using software support module PDS. Random variables were described by means of parameters of probability density distribution according to data determined experimentally. The parametric study was realized to obtain a dependence of the deck resistance on the variable structural and geometrical characteristics, as well as dependence on the environmental action in the form of corrosion. The time variable loss of deck resistance was computed based on some corrosion models...|$|R
40|$|A {{configuration}} of beam-to-column joint with circular hollow section columns is proposed. A vertical plate, called through-plate, {{passing through the}} column is used to support the beams. In order to facilitate connecting the beams, two horizontal plates, {{each side of the}} column, are welded to the upper side of the through-plate. The lower flanges of the steel beams are connected to the horizontal plates by bolts, and the <b>upper</b> <b>flanges</b> are attached to the concrete slab by shear connections. The joint is considered as hinges in the construction phase while semi-rigid and partial strength can be adopted for the joint behaviour during the exploitation time. A development on the through-plate component of the joint is presented in this paper. Global behaviour of the joint under hogging moment and shear force is analysed leading to a mechanical model of the through-plate component. Using the elastic buckling theory of plates, the analytical formulas for critical stresses of the through-plate are obtained. The coefficients taking into account boundary conditions, material plasticity and geometrical imperfection are determined by finite element analysis. The proposed model is validated by experimental results showing a good accuracy. The design guideline for the component is finally provided for the practical purpose. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Composite beam consisting of a concrete beam cased in a U-shaped steel beam has been recently reported in the literature. Such {{composite beam}} is cost effective if a thin-walled steel section is used, leading to some difficulties in welding shear stud connectors. Another shear connector devices have to be used. It is worth mentioning that during concrete encasement, the <b>upper</b> <b>flanges</b> of the U-section have to be linked in order to preserve the shape of the steel cross-section. It is then proposed here to use the linking element as a shear connector. This new type of shear connection is not covered in present norms of composite structures and it requires an investigation on its behavior and on force transfer mechanisms. The experimental investigation of the behavior of these shear connectors through asymmetrical push-out tests is presented in this paper. Two different cross-sections of shear connectors were considered. A finite element model has been developed in order to identify the stress behavior of shear connectors and the surrounding concrete. A good agreement of FEA results and experimental data is obtained.

The vertical centerline of these facilities is located 10.75 in. (27.31 cm) from the vertical centerline of the reactor and they are lined with a permanent aluminum liner having an inside diameter of 1.811 in. (4.6 cm). These facilities are designed for either instrumented or non-instrumented experiments. The instrumented capsule design can also employ sweep or cooling gases as necessary. Instrument leads and access tubes are accommodated through penetrations in the <b>upper</b> shroud <b>flange</b> and through special penetrations in the pressure vessel hatch.When not in use, these facilities contain beryllium or aluminum plugs. Because of their close proximity to the fuel, RB* experiments are carefully reviewed with respect to their neutron poison content, which is limited because of its effect on fuel element power distribution and fuel cycle length.These positions can accommodate (i.e., shielded) experiments, making them well suited for fusion materials irradiation.Uses for the RB* facilities have included the production of radioisotopes; High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) fuel irradiations; and the irradiation of candidate fusion reactor materials. The later type of experiment requires a fast neutron flux. A significant fast flux is present in addition to the thermal flux. For this application the capsules are placed in a liner containing a thermal neutron poison for spectral-tailoring.

40|$|AbstractThere {{is a lot}} {{of local}} {{corrosion}} damage on the upper flanges under rail sleepers in the plate girder railway bridges. Since the sleepers are put on the upper flanges directly, the corrosion at the boundary progresses faster and causes a lack of the flange thickness through erosion, wet conditions among others due to contact of sleepers. Consequently, the strength of the plate girder decreases. Since the local corrosion often occurs on the <b>upper</b> <b>flange</b> under the sleepers, evaluation of the remaining strength of the plate girder with such corrosion damage is a very important problem for the maintenance. This paper presents an evaluation method for the remaining strength of a plate girder with local corrosion on the <b>upper</b> <b>flange</b> under sleepers, in which the remaining strength can be derived easily based on the buckling stress of the <b>upper</b> <b>flange</b> with lack of thickness due to corrosion.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} the approaches and methods selected in fabrication of a carbon composite demonstration {{structure for the}} Composite Crew Module (CCM) Program. The program is managed by the NASA Safety and Engineering Center with participants from ten NASA Centers and AFRL. Multiple aerospace contractors are participating in the design development, tooling and fabrication effort as well. The goal {{of the program is}} to develop an agency wide design team for composite habitable spacecraft. The specific goals for this development project are: a). To gain hands on experience in design, building and testing a composite crew module. b) To validate key assumptions by resolving composite spacecraft design details through fabrication and testing of hardware. This abstract is based on Preliminary Design data [...] The final design will continue to evolve through the fall of 2007 with fabrication mostly completed by conference date. From a structures perspective, the. CCM {{can be viewed as a}} pressure module with variable pressure time histories and a series of both impact and quasi-static, high intensity point, line, and area distributed loads. The portion of the overall space vehicle being designed and. fabricated by the CCM team is just the pressure module and primary loading points. The heaviest point loads are applied and distributed to the pressure module at. an aluminum Service Module/Alternate Launch Abort System (SM/ALAS) fittings and at Main and Drogue Chute fittings. Significant line loads with metal to metal impact is applied at. the Lids ring. These major external point and line loads as well as pressure impact loads (blast and water landing) are applied to the lobed floor though the reentry shield and crushable materials. The pressure module is divided into upper and lower. shells that mate together with a bonded belly band splice joint to create the completed structural assembly. The benefits of a split CCM far outweigh the risks of a joint. These benefits include lower tooling cost and less manufacturing risk. Assembly of the top and bottom halves of the pressure shell will allow access to the interior of the shell throughout remaining fabrication sequence and can also potentially permit extensive installation of equipment and. crew facilities prior to final assembly of the two shell halves. A Pi pre-form is a woven carbon composite material which is provided in pre-impregnated form and frozen for long term storage. The cross-section shape allows the top of the pi to be bonded to a flat or curved surface with a second flat plate composite section bonded between two upstanding legs of the Pi. One of the regions relying on the merits of the Pi pre-form is the backbone. All connections among plates of the backbone structure, including the <b>upper</b> <b>flanges,</b> and to the lobe base of the pressure shell are currently joined by Pi pre-forms. The intersection of backbone composite plates is formed by application of two Pi pre-forms, top flanges and lobed surfaces are bonded with one Pi pre-form. The process of applying the pre-impregnated pi-preform will be demonstrated to include important steps like surface preparation, forming, application of pressure dams, vacuum bagging for consolidation, and curing techniques. Chopped carbon fiber tooling was selected over other traditional metallic and carbon fiber tooling. The requirement of schedule and cost economy for a moderate reuse cure tool warranted composite tooling options. Composite tooling schedule duration of 18 weeks compared favorably against other metallic tooling including invar tooling. Composite tooling also shows significant cost savings over low CTE metallic options. The composite tooling options were divided into two groups and the final decision was based on the cost, schedule, tolerance, temperature, and reuse requirements...|$|R
