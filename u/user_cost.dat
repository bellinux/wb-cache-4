In this study, we use Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CE) data to examine the relationship between <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and rents at the individual unit-level, in dollars, using unit-level information on house value, rent, taxes, and the like. This allows us to accurately estimate unit-specific <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and to control for unobservables like structure and neighborhood quality. We also make the point that in theory, after-tax <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> should equal net rent, i. e., expected rental income, rather than gross rent. Our findings are striking. In keeping with most previous research, we find tremendous divergence between conventional measures of <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and net rents, thus ruling out index construction errors as a possible explanation. This divergence does not result from a faulty rent measure: we find that reported rents are sensible, in that they move similarly to official rent indexes, and are not simply out-of-pocket expenses. Instead, and most perplexing, we find a surprisingly close correspondence between net rents and a particular estimate of <b>user</b> <b>costs,</b> one implicitly assuming zero transactions costs and constructed using an appreciation measure that is both theoretically suspect and empirically a poor predictor of actual appreciation. <b>User</b> <b>costs</b> House price appreciation Forecasting Rental equivalence...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{introduction}} to the concept of <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> and its determinants. Particular attention is given to the influence of taxation. The concept of <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> relates to the rental, the rate of return to capital, that arises in a profit maximising situation in which further investment in capital produces no additional profit. This paper sets out in some detail the range of assumptions involved in obtaining alternative expressions for the <b>user</b> <b>cost.</b> The <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> refers to a before-tax capital rental, the rate of return that ensures that the (after-tax) cost of capital is equal to the post-tax returns over its life. Hence, associated with the <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> measure is an effective marginal tax rate. This can differ substantially from the statutory marginal rate applicable to the investor.

40|$|Most {{models of}} the rental housing market assume a close linkage between the level of {{residential}} rents and the after-tax <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> of rental housing capital. However, little empirical evidence exists to establish {{the strength of this}} linkage or the speed with which rents adjust to changes in <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> or tax policy. This paper develops and estimates an econometric model of the rental housing market in order to shed light on both of these issues. United States annual data for 1964 through 1993 are used to generate two-stage least squares estimates of a four equation structural model. Although the results are generally consistent with expectations and reveal several interesting relationships among the system variables, the estimates fail to identify a strong relationship between rent and <b>user</b> <b>cost.</b> About half of an increase in <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> is ultimately passed along as higher rent. The adjustment process also takes a long time, with only {{about a third of the}} long-run effect realized within ten years of a <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> shock. The fundamental reason for this result is that our estimate of the <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> series, based upon widely accepted procedures, is much more volatile than the residential rent series. ...|$|E

Using a difference specification that does not rely on cointegration, we find highly significant estimates of the <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> elasticity {{on the order of}} - 0. 80. These estimates contrast sharply with many previous studies that obtained small and/or statistically insignificant estimates of the <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> elasticity using U. S. data. This discrepancy may owe to the possibility that the capital demand curve is better identified in a small open economy because shocks to capital supply {{are more likely to be}} exogenous. The economic embargo imposed on South Africa from 1985 to 1993 forced its economy to become more closed and therefore provides a unique natural experiment to assess this conjecture.

40|$|The <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> {{elasticity}} is a parameter {{of central}} importance in economics, with implications for monetary policy, macroeconomic models, tax policy, growth, {{and many other}} areas. If the supply curve for capital is upward sloping and shocks to demand are important (as {{they are likely to}} be over the business cycle), estimates of the <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> elasticity that rely on high-frequency movements in the variables will tend to be biased. This paper applies cointegration techniques to a small, open economy.
