5|$|M-45 was {{originally}} designated in the <b>UP</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> is now M-95 by July 1, 1919. The highway ran between M-12 in Sagola and M-15 in Humboldt Township. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US2 replaced most of M-12 through the UP. M-45 was extended south of Sagola {{to the north}} side of Iron Mountain. Along with this change, M-69 replaced another previous section of M-12 and all of M-90. M-69 ran concurrently with M-45 between Sagola and Randville to connect these two highway segments. By 1933, M-45 was extended concurrently along US2/US141 into Iron Mountain and then as an independent routing through Kingsford to the Wisconsin state line. Before the next year, the M-95 replaced M-45 in the UP.|$|E
25|$|Thursday {{qualifying}} {{was held}} in similar weather conditions to practice, but {{was interrupted by a}} brief shower of rain close {{to the end of the}} session. Alesi carried his form over from free practice, nudging the crash barriers lining the circuit on more than one occasion to set a provisional pole position time of 1:23.754. Berger was also impressive, power-sliding through Casino Square, to the delight of the crowd, on his way to the third-fastest time, although he complained that Alesi had held him <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> he thought would have been his quickest lap of the session. The form of the Ferraris came as something of a surprise, as the 41T2's unique V12 engine configuration theoretically produced less torque than its rivals, a disadvantage on a circuit as tight as Monaco. Alesi said that he believed the results of the session were due to the extreme effort that he and Berger were putting into their driving overcoming any deficiencies with the car. The Ferraris were split by Schumacher, who felt that the rain shower had prevented him from fulfilling his potential, as he did not complete his full quota of 12laps as a result of the track conditions becoming slower. His teammate, Herbert, took provisional sixthplace. Of the Williams drivers, Hill was fourth, but Coulthard admitted that he was still learning the track on his way to 11th, 2.8seconds slower than Alesi's best. Häkkinen continued McLaren's promising form with a provisional fifthplace, but was fined $10,000 for ignoring yellow flags during the season. Blundell was back in eighth after crashing into the barriers in the closing minutes of the session.|$|E

Although none of the novels explicitly say that Charles Wallace is anything but human, there are many hints throughout that Charles possesses senses and knowledge that are not of this world. He is telepathic and able to pick <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> those closest to him are thinking and feeling, especially Mrs. Murry and Meg. He often senses or knows about things which are about to happen before the other characters. Charles also has a much more open mind than his older siblings and friends.

2500|$|Lloyd {{was born}} on December 9, 1893, in Ann Arbor, MI. She was the first child of Alfred H. Lloyd and Margaret Crocker Lloyd. Academia ran in her family; her father was the former dean of the University of Michigan's {{graduate}} school, a former professor of philosophy, and also served as acting president of the University in 1925. She had a relatively typical upbringing, growing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> {{was at the time}} the outskirts of Ann Arbor and attending the now defunct Ann Arbor High and later Milton Academy in Milton, MA.

While reading newspapers to catch <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> happened during his imprisonment, Luthor learns of the resurrection of Superboy.

In an effort to mockingly prove his abilities to Superboy, Lex agrees to cure his sister's illness. With Superboy's aid, Luthor manages to cure Lena, allowing her to walk and think logically again for a brief moment, before he then quickly reverses the process, leaving Lena completely catatonic, and informs Superboy that so long as Superman is alive, he will never reveal how he did it. Luthor escapes with Brainiac, leaving Superboy, Lori, and Krypto horrified at his cruelty. Because Luthor now sees Superboy as a failed experiment of using the [...] "wrong alien DNA", he and Brainiac create another binary clone with their own genetics for another plan against the entire House of El.|$|E

[...] Your English [...] "dislike to be interfered with" [...] is in absolute fellowship with these, but only gathers itself in its places of Stalks, or chimneys, instead of oak trees, round its idols of iron, instead of wood, diabolically vocal now; strident, and sibilant, instead of dumb.|$|E
