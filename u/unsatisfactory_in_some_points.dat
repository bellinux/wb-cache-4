Th e two judgments must be welcomed insofar as they rectify the delay in Italian jurists approaching this issue, in spite of the clear signals received from the EU.

Even multidisciplinary approaches which include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography are <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases, especially with biliary stricture. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS) with its direct visualization for biopsy {{appears to be}} a promising technique for detecting cholangiocarcinoma at an early stage. We report a case of adenocarcinoma in situ of the distal common bile duct (CBD) that was confirmed by PTCS. This case suggests the useful role of PTCS in the differential diagnosis of a distal CBD obstruction, particularly when other diagnostic modalities do not provide definitive information...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the most important}} results of the report Czech Republic in 2005 : Economic Scenario which was elaborated {{within the framework of}} the project „Central and Eastern Europe in 2005 “ sponsored by the EC Commission (DG 12). An analysis of present macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions and the main problems experienced by the Czech economy during the initial phases of its transformation are presented and a tentative forecast of possible development until 2005 outlined. The main macroeconomic trends in GDP, employment and unemployment, inflation and external relations are described and the state of microeconomic restructuring (property rights change, financial and real) is evaluated. Microeconomic restructuring is considered to be <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> important areas, thus creating barriers for further sustainable development. The forecasts are based on overcoming these barriers and are connected with policy recommendations. Czech Sociological Review, 1994, Vol. 2 (No. 1 : 35 - 51...|$|R

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this paper to point out that seven crystal {{structure}} analyses published in Volume 16 of Inorganic Chemistry (1977) were almost certainly described in space groups of unnecessarily low symmetry. In two instances the decrease in symmetry resulted in a change of Laue symmetry (from 2 /m to 1); since in such cases there is no inherent problem in refinement, the reported molecular geometries are essentially correct, and our reformulations in the higher symmetry result in only minor adjustments. In the remaining five instances, however, the decrease in symmetry involved removing a center of symmetry without changing the Laue group. In such instances, singularities or near-singularities in the least-squares matrices-sometimes noticed by the original authors-led to refinement problems and the resulting structures are <b>in</b> all instances <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> aspects. For four of these latter cases we have carried out successful least-squares refinements in the higher symmetry space groups and have arrived at structures with improved agreement indexes and no unsatisfactory features...|$|R

[...] Robinson also argued that the usage of [...] "many" [...] of the Sanskrit terms inserted in the text was not necessary and that because Lamotte already used French equivalents of Sanksrit terms, Lamotte should have moved them to a French-Sanskrit glossary. Robinson argued that the Sanskrit terms would only be useful to a reader who knows Buddhist Sanskrit. In light of Robinson's criticisms of providing the Sanskrit, R. E. Emmerick, {{the author of a book}} review for the original French version of Śūraṃgamasamādhisūtra, The Concentration of Heroic Progress: An Early Mahayana Buddhist Scripture, another translation by Lamotte, argued that he was in favour of this practice by Lamotte.|$|R
