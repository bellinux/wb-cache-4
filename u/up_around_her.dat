At this time a group of young sisters was growing <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> —the {{children}} of her father's second marriage. Davis took the greatest interest in their education. She became their home instructor, and sought to form their taste in reading. When her suffering confined her to a darkened room, they became her readers and amanuenses.|$|E
25|$|Geera, {{who was now}} {{the only}} child left on their {{escarpment}} home, {{had no one to}} play with and no one to talk to as her father was often away. Geera spent all day sitting, hunched over and watching the camps of the local Aboriginals and looking out to sea to her five sisters. Eventually she turned to stone, dust and leaves building <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> until she became a part of the escarpment. She is known today as Mount Keira.|$|E

The next day, shortly before 3:00a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body {{in the rear of the}} basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A [...] strip of [...] wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried [...] deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around her hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.|$|E
2500|$|Early that February, {{the coldest}} for many years, Adams had {{sat with her}} in her room for forty minutes. A nurse entered, unnoticed, and saw Clara's [...] "bed clothes all off... and over the foot rail of the bed, her night gown <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> chest and {{the window in the}} room open top and bottom", while Adams read to her from the Bible. When later confronted by Hannam {{regarding}} this, Adams said [...] "The person who told you that doesn't know why I did it".|$|E

At May 26, 2009 Impact! taping, Anderson wrestled as [...] "Future Legend" [...] Melissa Anderson in a dark match where she was defeated by Awesome Kong. Her television return occurred on the edition of July 16, 2009 of Impact! as she wrestled under the revised name of [...] "Future Legend" [...] Alissa Flash, losing to the debuting Sarita and attacking her afterward. Flash's losing streak continued {{in the first round}} of the Knockouts Tag Team Championship tournament where she and Daffney lost to Sarita and Taylor Wilde.

60|$|Burton {{travelled}} down to Garden Green on {{the following}} morning by the Tube, which he hated, and walked along the familiar avenue with loathing at his heart. There was no doubt about Ellen's being at home. The few feet of back yard were full of white garments of unlovely shape, recently washed and fluttering in the breeze. The very atmosphere was full of soapsuds. Ellen herself {{opened the door to}} him, her skirts pinned <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> and a clothes-peg in her mouth.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have often}} thought of them since, the long glow upon the land, and the three little lights upon the sea, {{standing}} for so much, for the two great rivals face to face, for {{the power of the}} land {{and the power of the}} water, for the centuries-old battle, which may last for centuries to come. And yet, Frenchman as I am, do I not know that the struggle is already decided?--for it lies between the childless nation and that which has a lusty young brood springing <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> If France falls she dies, but if England falls how many nations are there who will carry her speech, her traditions and her blood on into the history of the future? ...|$|E
6000|$|By a fire, {{before one}} of the lodges, five pairs of snow-shoes stood on end in their element, and by the fire sat Su-Su. The hood of her squirrel-skin parka was about her hair, and well drawn <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> throat; but her hands were unmittened and nimbly at work with needle and sinew, {{completing}} the last fantastic design on a belt of leather faced with bright scarlet cloth. A dog, somewhere {{at the rear of}} one of the lodges, raised a short, sharp bark, then ceased as abruptly as it had begun. Once, her father, in the lodge at her back, gurgled and grunted in his sleep. [...] "Bad dreams," [...] she smiled to herself. [...] "He grows old, and that last joint was too much." ...|$|E

5000|$|Froggatt {{talked of}} how she had to perform scenes tied <b>up</b> with tape <b>around</b> <b>her</b> mouth as a gag.

60|$|Outside {{there was}} enough to do, in the disorganized state of the sick and panic-stricken household, where nobody was {{effective}} but the French valet and one very stupid kitchen-maid. Lena helped the St. Faith's nurse in her charge of the French maid, but almost all her time in the morning was spent in domestic cares for the sick and for her father; {{and when he was}} once up, he was half plaintive, half passionate, if she did not at once respond to his calls. She read the papers to him, walked up and down the terrace with him while he smoked, and played bezique with him late into the night, to distract his thoughts. And where were hers, while each day's bulletin from Compton Hall was worse than the last? Little Joe Reynolds had been sent home on being taken ill, and she would fain have gone to see him, but detentions sprang <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> and sometimes it would have been impossible to go so far from the house, so that days had become weeks, and the month of October was old before she was walking down the little garden of old Betty's house. The door opened, and Julius Charnock came out, startling her by the sight of his worn and haggard looks, as he made a deprecating movement, and shut the door behind him. Then she saw that the blinds were in the act of being drawn down.|$|E
6000|$|And now the Church had conquered. The weak {{things of}} this world had confounded the strong. In spite of the devilish cruelties of persecutors; {{in spite of the}} contaminating {{atmosphere}} of sin which surrounded her; in spite of having to form herself, not out of a race of pure and separate creatures, but by a most literal 'new birth' out of those very fallen masses who insulted and persecuted her; in spite of having to endure within herself continual outbursts of the evil passions in which her members had once indulged without cheek; in spite of a thousand counterfeits which sprang <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and within her, claiming to be parts of her, and alluring men to themselves by that very exclusiveness and party arrogance which disproved their claim; in spite of all, she had conquered. The very emperors had arrayed themselves on her side. Julian's last attempt to restore paganism by imperial influence had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold upon the hearts of the masses; at his death the great tide-wave of new opinion rolled on unchecked, and the rulers of earth were fain to swim with the stream; to accept, in words at least, the Church's laws as theirs; to acknowledge a King of kings to whom even they owed homage and obedience; and to call their own slaves their 'poorer brethren,' and often, too, their 'spiritual superiors.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The Carthaginian soldiers, {{following}} Hasdrubal's example, {{opened the}} gates of the citadel, and let the conqueror in. The deserters were now made absolutely desperate by their danger, and some of them, more furious than the rest, preferring to die by their own hands rather than to give their hated enemies the pleasure of killing them, set the building in which they were shut up in on fire. The miserable inmates ran to and fro, half suffocated by the smoke and scorched by the flames. Many of them reached the roof. Hasdrubal's wife and children were among the number. She looked down from this elevation, the volumes of smoke and flame rolling <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> and saw her husband standing below with the Roman general--perhaps looking, in consternation, for his wife and children, amid this scene of horror. The sight of the husband and father in a position of safety made the wife and mother perfectly furious with resentment and anger. [...] "Wretch!" [...] she screamed, in a voice which raised itself above the universal din, [...] "is it thus you seek to save your own life while you sacrifice ours? I can not reach you in your own person, but I kill you hereby in the persons of your children." [...] So saying, she stabbed her affrighted sons with a dagger, and hurled them down, struggling all the time against their insane mother's phrensy, into the nearest opening from which flames were ascending, and then leaped in after them herself to share their awful doom.|$|E

60|$|Peggy and I {{helped her}} to dress. She insisted on wearing her best black silk, in which she looked unnaturally fine. Her soft muslin became her much better, but we could not induce her to wear it. Anything more prim and bandboxy than Aunt Olivia when her toilet was {{finished}} {{it has never been}} my lot to see.

50|$|Born in Houston, Texas, the tomboyish Sibley grew <b>up</b> <b>around</b> wrestling. <b>Her</b> uncle, Ottoway Roberts, {{worked for}} local wrestling {{promoter}} Morris Siegel, {{and as she}} got older, she often hung around the wrestlers {{and asked them to}} teach her their moves. On one occasion while DeAlva was playing around in the ring, the women's wrestling promoter Billy Wolfe happened to see her and recognized her potential. Already divorced once and facing poverty, she accepted Wolfe's offer to be trained as a professional wrestler.|$|R
6000|$|No {{word of a}} new {{marriage}} had ever passed between them; but Rachael had taken great pity on him years ago, and to her alone he had opened his closed heart all this time, {{on the subject of}} his miseries; and he knew very well that if he were free to ask her, she would take him. He thought of the home he might at that moment have been seeking with pleasure and pride; of the different man he might have been that night; of the lightness then in his now heavy- laden breast; of the then restored honour, self-respect, and tranquillity all torn to pieces. He thought of the waste of the best part of his life, of the change it made in his character for the worse every day, of the dreadful nature of his existence, bound hand and foot, to a dead woman, and tormented by a demon in her shape. He thought of Rachael, how young when they were first brought together in these circumstances, how mature now, how soon to grow old. He thought of the number of girls and women she had seen marry, how many homes with children in them she had seen grow <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> how she had contentedly pursued her own lone quiet path - for him - and how he had sometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed face, that smote him with remorse and despair. He set the picture of her up, beside the infamous image of last night; and thought, Could it be, that the whole earthly course of one so gentle, good, and self-denying, was subjugate to such a wretch as that! ...|$|E
6000|$|But why, {{when the}} boys wanted to be begged off, was the schoolmistress to be their advocate? Because Grace Harvey exercised, without {{intending}} anything of the kind, an almost mesmeric influence on every one in the little town. Goodness rather than talent had given her wisdom, and goodness rather than courage a power of using that wisdom, which, to those simple, superstitious folk, seemed altogether an inspiration. There was a mystery about her, too, which worked strongly on {{the hearts of the}} West-country people. She was supposed to be at times [...] "not right;" [...] and wandering intellect is with them, as with many primitive peoples, an object more of awe than of pity. Her deep melancholy alternated with bursts of wild eloquence, with fantastic fables, with entreaties and warnings against sin, full of such pity and pathos that they melted, at times, the hardest hearts. A whole world of strange tales, half false, half true, had grown <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> as she grew. She was believed to spend whole nights in prayer; to speak with visitors from the other world; even to have the power of seeing into futurity. The intensity of her imagination gave rise to the belief that she had only to will, and she could see whom she would, and all that they were doing, even across the seas; her exquisite sensibility, it was whispered, made her feel every bodily suffering she witnessed, as acutely as the sufferer's self, and in the very limb in which he suffered. Her deep melancholy was believed to be caused by some dark fate--by some agonising sympathy with evil-doers; and it was sometimes said in Aberalva,--"Don't do that, for poor Grace's sake. She bears the sins of all the parish." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} {{care for her}} brother's health had ceased to be Henrietta's grand object, and she was obliged once more to see him depart to pursue his education, a whole circle of pursuits and occupations had sprung <b>up</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> and given her the {{happiness}} of feeling herself both useful and valued. Old Mr. Langford saw in her almost the Mary he had parted with when resumed in early girlhood by Mrs. Vivian; Mrs. Langford had a granddaughter who would either be petted, sent on messages, or be civil to the Careys, as occasion served; Aunt Roger was really grateful to her, as well for the Latin and Greek she bestowed upon Willy and Charlie, as for the braided merino frocks or coats on which Bennet used to exercise her taste when Henrietta's wardrobe failed to afford her sufficient occupation. The boys all liked her, made a friend of her, and demonstrated it in various ways more or less uncouth: her manners gradually acquired the influence over them which Queen Bee had only exerted over Alex and Willy, and when, saving Carey and Dick, they grew less awkward and bearish, without losing their honest downright good humour and good nature, Uncle Geoffrey only did her justice in attributing the change to her unconscious power. Miss Henrietta was also the friend of the poor women, the teacher and guide of the school children, and in their eyes and imagination second to no one but Mr. Franklin. And withal she did not cease to be all that she had ever been to her brother, if not still more. His heart and soul were for her, and scarce a joy and sorrow but was shared between them. She was his home, his everything, and she well fulfilled her mother's parting trust of being his truest friend and best-loved counsellor.|$|E
