50|$|The Federal Police {{announced}} on 15 March {{that they had}} captured the Iron Bridge, with the Rapid Response Division, putting them in complete control of three out of five bridges in Mosul, and also advanced to the al-Nuri Mosque. Iraqi officers stated that cloudy weather was slowing their advance, due to <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> air <b>cover.</b> Staff Brigadier Falah al-Obeidi stated that the CTS had captured the Dor al-Sikak and al-Nafut areas, the sites of ISIL's main weapons facilities, located {{to the west of}} the Old City. The International Organisation for Migration stated that the number of civilians who fled from western Mosul rose to 100,000. Samir Dawoud al-Mohsen, an officer of the 9th Armored Division stated that Iraqi forces had begun to advance on Bab al-Bayd district. Iraq’s military intelligence service stated that 3 senior ISIL leaders were killed in airstrikes on al-Jadida district by the Iraqi Air Force, including: Abu Anas al-Jubouri, who was an official of the suicide bomber units, Mohamed Fathy al-Jubouri, who was a military official of the group, as well as his aide, Ahmed Nawwaf al-Jubouri. The 9th Armored Division also captured the town of Badush, as well as a nearby village, taking control of the entire Badush region. The CTS also advanced in the Nablus, Yabsat, Risala, and Wadi al-Ayn districts.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{determining the}} quality of academic services at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences of Madako University. This research uses the theory of service quality proposed by Zenthaml Parasuraman. Type of research is qualitative. The informants of this research consist leccturers, teaching staff, students and alumni who are determined purposively, with data collection methods consisted of observation, interviews and documentation. Data analysis techniques include data reduction, data verification and drawing conclusions. Research results indicate that {{the quality of}} academic services in the context of teaching and learning process in Faculty of Social and Political Sciences of Madako University is not qualified yet. This is evidenced by five dimensions used as a benchmark; barely four dimensions go well namely the dimensions of Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance and Empathy. While the dimension of tangible is inadequate therefore the academic services are not running properly. This is due to the <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> sufficient facilities that can support the lecturing process, such as <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> representative study room, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> lecture rooms, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> parking space, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> worship facilities and library facilities that are not functioning...|$|R

40|$|Subject of Research. The {{processes}} of live migration without shared storage with pre-copy approach and move migration are researched. Migration of virtual machines {{is an important}} opportunity of virtualization technology. It enables applications to move transparently with their runtime environments between physical machines. Live migration becomes noticeable technology for efficient load balancing and optimizing the deployment of virtual machines to physical hosts in data centres. Before the advent of live migration, only network migration (the so-called, «Move»), has been used, that entails stopping the virtual machine execution while copying to another physical server, and, consequently, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> the service. Method. Algorithms of live migration without shared storage with pre-copy approach and move migration of virtual machines are reviewed {{from the perspective of}} research of migration time and <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services at migrating of virtual machines. Main Results. Analytical models are proposed predicting migration time of virtual machines and <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services at migrating with such technologies as live migration with pre-copy approach without shared storage and move migration. In the latest works on the time assessment <b>of</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services and migration time using live migration without shared storage experimental results are described, that are applicable to draw general conclusions about the changes <b>of</b> time for <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services and migration time, but not to predict their values. Practical Significance. The proposed models can be used for predicting the migration time and time <b>of</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services, for example, at implementation of preventive and emergency works on the physical nodes in data centres...|$|R

40|$|A general {{approach}} to optimizing the test schedules of the standby system is proposed. The system consists of interrelated component groups with different test intervals. Fault-tree analysis and Markov chains {{were used to}} estimate the <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> the system. In three partial cases, the average <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> the system was calculated through the average <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> its components. For a system where tests were started randomly, the problem {{was reduced to a}} nonlinear programming problem, for which the numerical technique (gradient methods) is proposed and tested with some examples. In the general case a technique to calculate the average unavailability is proposed, and the problem is reduced to a nonsmooth optimization proble...|$|R
