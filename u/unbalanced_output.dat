40|$|Abstract — In {{the past}} few years, a number of image {{encryption}} algorithms based on chaotic maps have been proposed.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  4 and Table  2 that the {{estimation}} accuracy by using the proposed method is generally better. Because the modified IEEE 123 -bus system operates under unbalanced conditions, the true three-phase outputs of DGs are not in balanced form as shown in Fig.  4. Consequently, the phase-based averaging assumption from the conventional method fails to reveal the unbalanced operating states of DGs, leading to a relatively low estimation accuracy of DG three-phase outputs. Furthermore, the inappropriate DG models used by the conventional method introduce an additional error (or can be understood as corrupted power injection measurements) to the SE calculation, hence the overall estimation accuracy of the whole network states decreases as shown in Table II. In comparison, attributed to the detailed modelling of <b>unbalanced</b> DG power <b>outputs,</b> SE results with a higher quality are available in the proposed method.|$|R

40|$|Techniques for {{interconnecting}} {{balanced and}} unbalanced equipment in audio systems {{seems to be}} a murky topic for many users, technicians, and system designers. It is the subject of numerous calls to our applications engineers. Confusion, and even controversy, is further fueled by some published "guides " whose engineering basis is dubious, at best. This paper briefly explains the hardware, some underlying engineering theory, and includes wiring diagrams for interfaces that solve many typical system problems. A BALANCED input or output uses two signal conductors which have equal impedances to ground. Balanced inputs and outputs are widely used in professional equipment because the input differential amplifier can, in theory at least, totally null its response to ground noise which exists equally on both signal lines. Examples of typical circuits are shown below. 1 - "UNBALANCED " and "BALANCED" What do these terms really mean? Since I have previously written about the subject of balanced lines in some detail, I will just summarize the most important points here. Balance is defined in terms of the impedances of the two signal conductors with respect to a reference, which is usually "ground". An <b>UNBALANCED</b> input or <b>output</b> connects one of its signal conductors to ground and has a non-zero impedance at the other signal conductor. <b>Unbalanced</b> inputs and <b>outputs</b> are very popular in consumer electronics, electronic musical instruments, and low cost (often called "semi-pro") audio equipment. Examples of typical circuits are shown below. Typical Balanced Input Because of its low cost and small size, this "active balanced" differential input circuit (or some variation of it) is very widely used. The pairs of 10 kS resistors are trimmed to match within 0. 01 % in order to null response to ground noise. When used in real-world systems, however, a major drawback of this circuit is its exquisite sensitivity to unbalances in the output (source) impedances of the line driver. This seriously compromises ground noise rejection or CMRR (Common-Mode Rejection Ratio) of the system. Typical Unbalanced Input Usual values for R L are 10 kS to 100 kS, regardless of the equipment type. It is R L that effectively determines the input impedance of the circuit...|$|R
40|$|Widespread {{growth of}} the {{consumer}} electronics market and the upward trend in harnessing electrical power from renewable sources has {{increased the number of}} power electronic converters connected to utility distribution systems. Power electronic converters offer flexibility in voltage and current control as well as improved energy efficiency, but generate harmonic currents which have detrimental effects on the power system. A particular challenge appears in 4 -wire networks where zero-sequence harmonics exist; such currents accumulate in the neutral conductor and pose threats of overheating and failure. This work investigates harmonic compensation using shunt active power filters with specific application to unbalanced distribution networks. Owing to its increased availabil- ity of switching states, the flying-capacitor multi-level inverter (FCMI) is explored; how- ever an additional challenge exists in the balancing of capacitor voltages. Furthermore, synthesis of <b>unbalanced</b> inverter <b>output</b> volt ages necessitates a three-dimensional pulse- width-modulation (3 D-PWM) strategy. This work proposes a new modulation scheme, specifically suited to 4 -limb FCMIs, which combines 3 D-PWM and natural flying-capacitor voltage control. To develop an optimal harmonic compensation strategy, {{it is important to understand}} the nature of harmonic distortion experienced in typical distribution systems. New data on harmonics generated by common single-phase appliances are presented and a compre- hensive power-quality study is performed on a typical 4 -wire network. Findings are used to develop a computer model which emulates realistic harmonic load current waveforms. The final contribution in this work lies in the development of an unbalanced harmonic extraction technique based on synchronous reference frame theory and a new modified deadbeat controller which compensates delays and improves reference current tracking. In conjunction with the proposed 3 D-PWM scheme, the complete control strategy pro- vides compensation of positive, negative and zero-sequence harmonic currents in addition to alleviating phase load imbalance.

In-depth {{studies on the}} development of the personal pronoun system have so far received little attention in the literature. The longitudinal study is a first attempt to trace the developmental route of personal pronouns in an unbalanced 2 L 1 Chinese Mandarin–English child. Pragmatic and semantic issues relating to pronoun usage are addressed in order to examine order of emergence and production patterns of personal pronouns in Mandarin and English. The results are discussed in relation to the theoretical hypotheses and are compared to monolingual data. Findings seem to support speech role hypothesis. In other words, the bilingual child has no problem with the speech role function of pronouns. Further, this study provides some exploration into the role of the weaker language in bilingual language development as well as the nature and extent of the early separation and interaction of two linguistic systems in a language environment which is fundamentally unlike the one-parent-one-language setting. The results suggest that the bilingual child has a differentiated development in his two languages: that the two languages are not developed at the same rate, nor by the same route or the same strategy. The weaker language develops smoothly and in the same pattern as L 1.

40|$|Normal motor {{signaling}} in the {{basal ganglia}} requires regulating which movements to suppress and which to enact. In Parkinson's disease, loss of dopamine levels due to loss of dopaminergic neurons results in <b>unbalanced</b> basal ganglia <b>output</b> {{and loss of}} motor control. Motor sequences {{are thought to be}} triggered by cortical inputs as these glutamatergic inputs provide the main excitatory drive to the striatal output neurons. Dopamine is a crucial modulator of corticostriatal activity and loss of its normal function {{plays an important role in}} the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. We hypothesize that the functional reorganization of the cortical inputs to the striatum following long-term dopamine depletion as well as the response to dopamine replacement therapies has important functional implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease motor symptoms. To address this hypothesis, we adapted an optical technique using lipophilic dye, FM 1 - 43, to characterize the activities of the two major classes of corticostriatal projection neurons - the ipsilateral and contralateral cortical projections - and compared the influence of dopamine D 2 receptors on these inputs. We found that both cortical projections shared similar patterns of terminal release and were both inhibited by D 2 receptor activation. A D 2 receptor-mediated inhibition specifically targeted the least active (slow-releasing) corticostriatal inputs with low probability of release. This "filtering" effect by D 2 receptors confirmed a role for dopamine in modulating excitatory cortical inputs that could be crucial to selection of proper motor functions. To study the loss of motor control during conditions of chronic dopamine depletion, we employed a classic Parkinson's disease rodent model in which dopamine is depleted from one hemisphere using the neurotoxin, 6 -hydroxydopamine. Behavior tests confirmed lateralized motor response due to loss of function in the forelimb contralateral to the side of lesion. The effect of chronic dopamine depletion on corticostriatal synaptic activity was assessed by comparing the activity between the dopamine-intact and dopamine-lesioned hemispheres. We proposed that in the dopamine-intact hemisphere, D 2 receptor activation exerted selective inhibitory influence or "filtering" on corticostriatal signaling through two mechanisms: presynaptic D 2 receptors directly inhibiting glutamate release and postsynaptic D 2 receptor-mediated retrograde endocannabinoid inhibition activating presynaptic CB 1 receptors. However, in the dopamine-lesioned hemisphere, there was a supersensitive inhibition by D 2 receptor activation and the "filtering" effect was lost: the "filtering" was partially restored by concurrently activating D 2 receptors and inhibiting CB 1 receptors. We then tested whether this endocannabinoid-mediated restoration of D 2 receptor "filtering" in corticostriatal inputs had an effect on motor function in vivo. We examined changes in motor function and corticostriatal activity in 6 -OHDA lesioned mice following DA replacement therapy with L-DOPA in combination with modulators of endocannabinoid transmission. We found that treatment with L-DOPA alone or with L-DOPA + URB 597 (an inhibitor of endocannabinoid breakdown) reduced contralateral akinesia and in fact led to a contralateral limb use preference. Following L-DOPA treatment, corticostriatal presynaptic activity was depressed in the lesioned striata and D 2 receptor-mediated inhibition was occluded. Treatment of L-DOPA with the CB 1 receptor antagonist, AM 251, completely normalized motor function. This treatment regime also completely normalized basal corticostriatal activity on the lesioned hemisphere, and the D 2 receptor "filtering" effect was restored. Our findings confirm that dopamine modulates excitatory corticostriatal activity presynaptically via D 2 receptor activation, a portion of which is due to cannabinoid effects. Furthermore, a correlation between dopamine-induced loss of motor function and loss of corticostriatal "filtering" by D 2 receptors was demonstrated by the fact that dopamine replacement treatment that restores behavior also preserves this "filtering" mechanism in corticostriatal inputs. These findings suggest that dopaminergic "filtering" of particular corticostriatal synaptic activity contributes to motor commands...|$|R
