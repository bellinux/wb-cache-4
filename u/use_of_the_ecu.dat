40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the European {{experience}} with a basket currency, the ECU. The ECU was initially introduced as a reference unit and later became the anchor of the European Monetary System. Public policy was complemented by private sector initiatives and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ECU</b> for denomination of financial instruments. In practice, {{it turned out that}} a basket currency entails considerable unexpected technical complexities. The technical particularities of a basket currency are discussed before we turn to the criteria for determining the shares of participating currencies. We show that there are no iron-clad economic principles and therefore there is some room for political considerations. In Europe three criteria were used for determining the weights: GDP shares, international trade shares, and financial market indicators. In addition, weights will change with exchange rate movements. Appreciating currencies will experience increasing weights and depreciating currencies decreasing weights. This may require a correction mechanism for political acceptability. In Europe, weights were rescaled by political authorities every five years. From an economic viewpoint, weights depend critically on the purpose of the basket currency: is it a reference indicator, is it a currency for international transactions, or is it a parallel currency? Thus, before weights are to be discussed a clear vision {{of the role of the}} basket currency would be desirable. The vastly different growth performance among Asian economies also suggests a preference to forward rather than backward-looking measures.

40|$|Purpose : {{to design}} the new {{combined}} technique of endoresection with intraoperative intraocular electrochemical lysis at the tumor destruction stage for large posterior intraocular tumors. Methods : 3 patients (3 eyes) with large choroidal melanomas t 3 N 0 M 0 (tumor thickness — 8 - 10 mm, base diameter — 13 - 15 mm, juxtapapillary localization). Mean age was 55. 4 years old. Endoresection with intraoperational intraocular electrochemical lysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumor was performed. Electrochemical lysis was performed with <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technical unit <b>ECU</b> 300 (Soering, Germany) and <b>the</b> original method <b>of</b> combined intratumoral positioning of two platinum electrodes: anode and cathode. Results : the tumor was removal completely in all 3 cases. the anatomical retinal reattachment was reached in all patients. Sclera was safe in all 3 cases. Visual acuity was not changed (NLP). At <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> removal tumor a surgical choroidal coloboma without pigmentation all over scleral bed and periphery was shown in all cases in distant postoperative period (from 1. 5 to 3 years). No local recurrences or metastasis were revealed in all patients. Conclusion : Further investigations in clinical group are necessarily to determinate <b>the</b> real possibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combined method and the indications for endoresection with intraoperative intraocular electrochemical lysis for large intraocular tumors.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{demands and}} {{expectations}} on <b>the</b> system architectures <b>of</b> contemporary consumer products like cars are increasing for each product generation. New features using new sensors and actuators, with different variants on different markets, and that {{interact with other}} features, create additional complexity in the system. This complexity needs to be managed in a cost-efficient manner, and {{with a focus on}} minimizing <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> product failure. This calls for new methods and tools. The problem we want to solve is how to predict <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> ROM-type memory that is needed in an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) in a distributed system like a car. <b>The</b> <b>ECU</b> shall have spare capacity in terms of processing and storage to last for software updates and additions during at least five years. At the same time the pressure on product cost is high due to <b>the</b> large number <b>of</b> produced cars and the existing over-capacity in the automotive industry. So we need to balance spare capacity with cost efficiency in the system architecture. We apply the FSM (Functional Size Measurement) method COSMIC to requirement specifications (including UML Component Diagrams) that are <b>used</b> for sourcing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ECU</b> hardware. We have used software components developed by GM (General Motors) to establish the linear relationship between CFP (COSMIC Function Points) and Bytes compiled code. The relationship is stronger than what is reported for similar work using SLOC (Source Lines-Of-Code) as Code Size Measure. Our idea is to use the linear relationship to convert CFP into Bytes, and hence estimate the needed memory size. <b>The</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear relationship are affected by factors like functionality type, quality constraints, development tools, etc. By investigating 46 software components of 4 different types, we have identified these factors that are dominant in our context and use them to select the proper conversion from CFP into Bytes. We have shown in our context that COSMIC FSM only need the information in the requirement specification available early in the development process, to predict the needed memory space in an ECU to be designed. In addition, we have identified a one-to-one mapping between the Generic Software Model (which is the basis for COSMIC FSM) and software components. Finally, we have shown that COSMIC FSM produces accurate Code Size Estimates of software containing complex operations like calculations, provided that similar software has been measured before and that the operations are proportional to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> data movements. This is contrary to what is reported by other researchers...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{from the}} past three years {{indicates}} that the exchange rate between <b>the</b> private <b>ECU</b> and <b>the</b> official <b>ECU</b> Basket can deviate substantially from par. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> private <b>ECU</b> is driven by expectations that a future European Central Bank will enforce par convertibility between <b>the</b> private <b>ECU</b> and <b>the</b> official <b>ECU</b> basket <b>of</b> currencies.
