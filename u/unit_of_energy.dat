5|$|A bronze bust of James Joule, the {{physicist}} who gave {{his name to}} the SI <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> is in Worthington Park. Originally a tower {{was to have been}} erected in his honour, but lack of donations led to the production of the bust as a substitute; it was unveiled in 1905. Joule moved to Sale in the 1870s for his health; he died at his home at 12Wardle Road in 1889, and is buried in Brooklands Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{system had}} two units of energy, the erg that {{was related to}} {{mechanics}} and the calorie that was related to thermal energy; so {{only one of them}} (the erg) could bear a coherent relationship to the base units. Coherence was a design aim of SI resulting in only one <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> being defined – the joule.|$|E
5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above {{the cost of}} new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> when metabolised. Their use {{allows for a}} diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the newton {{is defined as the}} force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one metre per second squared. If the mass of the IPK were to change slightly, so too must the newton by a proportional degree. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, is defined in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI unit of power, the watt, which is one joule per second. The ampere too is defined relative to the newton, and ultimately, the kilogram.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{power plant}} {{accidents}} include the Chernobyl disaster (1986), Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), and the Three Mile Island accident (1979).

In terms of lives lost per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> generated, analysis has determined that nuclear power has caused less fatalities per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> generated than the other major sources of energy generation.

However, the economic costs of nuclear power accidents is high, and meltdowns can take decades to clean up.

25|$|In {{terms of}} lives lost per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> generated, nuclear power has caused fewer {{accidental}} deaths per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> generated {{than all other}} major sources of energy generation. Energy produced by coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydropower has caused more deaths per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> generated, from air pollution and energy accidents. This {{is found in the}} following comparisons, when the immediate nuclear related deaths from accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from these other energy sources, when the latent, or predicted, indirect cancer deaths from nuclear energy accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from the above energy sources, and when the combined immediate and indirect fatalities from nuclear power and all fossil fuels are compared, fatalities resulting from the mining of the necessary natural resources to power generation and to air pollution. With these data, the use of nuclear power has been calculated to have prevented in the region of 1.8 million deaths between 1971 and 2009, by reducing the proportion of energy that would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuels, and is projected to continue to do so.|$|E
