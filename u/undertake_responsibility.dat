In terms of containment clearance (of sediment, soil, surface, and ground water), there are policies that work as a protective, rather than preventative measure. They are administered through response actions that are vital to repairing damaged media of the environment.

50|$|Beheshti, {{opposed to}} modernism, {{believed}} {{that there is a}} strict relationship between individual and collective aspects of human being. According to him, although the history of humans shows that they are always tend to falsehood (or Batil), the Quran says there is a strong link between humanity and truth. Beheshti also emphasized on the theory of Fitarat (innateness or primary nature) in anthropology. Beheshti also believed the human soul had to be considered in the whole rather than in part. According to the theory of primary nature, one of the characters of human soul is volition and choosing. At the same time humans <b>undertake</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their actions. Humans have two important qualities: freedom of choice and responsibility. In other words, Beheshti believes Islam has a realist slant in respect to humans as it considers humans as a mix of freedom of choice and responsibility. Whilst humans are given choice, faith has an important role in this way and could help humans in making decision.|$|E
50|$|Within a Foucauldian context, the Type I and Type II {{arguments}} {{presented in}} the summit negotiations represent two fundamentally opposing rationalities of government. The interventionist, state-centric approach to sustainable development favoured by advocates of the Global Deal represents a rationality of government which Foucault identified as bio-politics; the application of political power {{in an attempt to}} control or modify life processes. Such an approach to the pursuit of sustainable development offers little opportunity for participation by private or civil actors, in direct contrast to the multi-stakeholder premise of Type II partnerships. The eco-governmental, disciplinary ideas conveyed in the Global Deal suggest that the Type I approach typifies the centralised command-and-control method favoured by traditional government, whereas the decentralised, voluntary nature of Type II partnerships demonstrates an advanced liberal governmentality which empowers non-state actors to <b>undertake</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the governing of sustainable development, an approach which is representative of the participatory, multi-stakeholder methods by which governance is characterised. The eventual dominance of Type II partnerships in the outcomes of the Johannesburg summit therefore symbolises a wider shift in the understanding of the purposes, ends and means of government in relation to sustainable development and environmental governance.|$|E
50|$|In {{districts with}} points of social conflict, Street Football Workers train {{individual}} teams {{and spread the}} philosophy of buntkicktgut: fairplay, tolerance, participation and non-violence. Street Football Workers are mostly young people who know the league inside out, play football and have themselves made the leap to overcome difficult social relationships.With the “Street Football Work” programme and the follow-on “School Football Work” programme, buntkicktgut offers open training sessions in recreational grounds and parks based in targeted districts of the city. Street Football Workers are active in their own city district and <b>undertake</b> <b>responsibility</b> for younger participants there. Every Street Football Worker offers regular training sessions at set times (minimum once a week) for groups/teams of 8-12 children or young people on their “home pitch”, be it the school playground, the rec around the corner, a patch of grass in the park or the courtyard of their block of flats. The training session is open to everyone. The teams {{take part in the}} city leagues, which span all city districts and run all year round {{in the form of a}} summer and a winter season. On top of that there are regular events, camps, and tournaments for special occasions. An important component of the project is the unique organisation of the teams and the assumption of responsibility by young people in the different areas of participation. From this independence and responsibility stems a dynamic which keeps the leagues alive and running.|$|E

As {{an alternative to the}} regular classroom, program prototypes for the gifted are listed, including acceleration programs, enrichment programs, and guidance programs. The use of community resources is also a factor, and a mentor program can be used to fill the gap of needs unmet in the classroom. The final factor is the importance of evaluating the gifted program.

40|$|An {{effective}} and efficient public sector is largely dependent on employees who <b>undertake</b> <b>responsibility</b> to provide qualty public services. It {{can be argued that}} public management students as future employees in the public sector, need to be educated for responsible citizenship. Service learning can sewrve as a catalyst for developing responsible citizenship among public management students, since higher education institutions in South Africa are expected tp promote social and economic development. This article investigates how service learning as an experiential form of learning, which has its roots in community service, meets community needs, enhances teaching and learning and contributes toward responsible citizenship. Successful service learning necessitates the identification of real community needs and structured experiences, whereby students grow and learn from it. By being linked to specific community experiences, service learning contributes to increased knowledge, skills and inderstanding of challenges within communities. This article further explores the extent to which service learning within public management as a discipline, has been adopted by universities of technology in South Africa. It is argued that while public management students are expected to engage in experiential learning within the public sector, community based learning should be included as a compulsory component of experiential learning. It is contended that service learning can make a significant contribution toward enhanced socially responsible citizenship, an important value underpinning and public servant. This article suggests that the development of socially responsible citizenship as a learning outcome for public management as a discipline, is integral toward sustaining a lifetime commitment to community service, improving personal development skills and building good character within the South African public sector...|$|E

40|$|By {{conducting}} {{a case study}} of two diaconal institutions, Samariterhemmet in Uppsala/Sweden and the Evangelisches Diakoniewerk Schwäbisch Hall e. V. in Germany, the thesis compares the roles of church diaconal work within the Swedish and the German welfare system. These two systems are characterised by the different roles given to independent welfare organisations. The overarching research question is if and in which way the two diaconal institutions are effected by current changes within the field of welfare and how these changes challenge them to redefine their roles. The material analysed contains written documents, interviews with selected representatives and the results of participant observation in both institutions. As changes in the roles of independent welfare organisations were expected the results are unexpected. The two diaconal institutions show considerable persistence. Neither the orientation of their fields of work nor their own definitions of their roles within the welfare system have changed during the 1990 s. In addition, the study reveals that both institutions regard themselves as a critical voice within the welfare system although their welfare engagement differs considerably. The German institution is a huge welfare provider while the Swedish institution conducts targeted initiatives. The analysis of four decisions within hospital work reveals that security of planning and freedom of action motivate the institutions to <b>undertake</b> <b>responsibility</b> for social services. The study points especially to the fields of education and research helping the institutions to maintain and to develop the diaconal profile. Altogether the results underline the need for more research on the meso-level of the third sector. This would contribute to a more nuanced discussion on the future role of independent welfare organisations within the Swedish and the German welfare system...|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} the Niger Expedition of 1841 and renewed {{consciousness}} of the health hazards of West Africa led, in the early l 840 ' s, to {{a revival of the}} concept of native agency – that is, the idea that Africans should be trained t o <b>undertake</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their own affairs, so that European lives could he spared. The development of this concept, discussed by Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton in 'The Slave Trade' in 1840, was carried out most vigorously by the major British missionary societies in Sierra Leone, the Church Missionary Society (C. M. S.) and t he Wesleyan Missionary Society (W. M. S.), and, to a lesser extent, by succeeding governments. Henry Venn, at C. M. S., put emphasis on education and, while the Fourah Bay Institution was remodelled, a new grammar School was opened in Freetown. In the next decade, a Normal School was founded, experiments took place in cotton growing and boys were sent f o r naval training, to learn various trades, and into medical training in Britain. In the 1850 ’s and early 1860 's, Venn turned to the organisation of the Native Pastorate, an African- run Anglican church, inaugurated in 1861. The Wesleyans, working throughout British West Africa, had continued to encourage primary education and had set up their own college at King Tom's Point in Sierra Leone. A few Africans came to England for training, but most learnt the job of teaching or preaching in Africa and, throughout this period, a vigorous African church and education system thrived, sometimes to the dismay of individual missionaries. The government's contribution to education was smaller and concentrated more on formulating policy and encouraging existing mission-based work than on setting up institutions of their own. The Select Committee of I 865 made clear the unwillingness of many officials to spend money on West Africa and pointed out the advances made over the preceding thirty years. Their conclusion was that native agency should soon make it possible for Britain to abandon responsibility for most of West Africa altogether...|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{her mentor}} {{suggested}} reviewing {{the results of}} the strengths test that the woman entrepreneur had taken in parallel with the mentoring sessions. Thus, according to the Realise 2 © results and debrief, she was attributed with strengths such as Adherence, Catalyst and Feedback. These strengths were demonstrated in activities which she performed frequently and delivered high-quality work while also gave her energy. She understood that she could use her Adherence strength so as to focus on her goal and achieve it and also her Catalyst strength since she wanted to introduce and implement change as to the way her employees, and herself, worked. Further, she combined and complemented these strengths with her Feedback strength which could help her debrief her employees on their performance. According to the same test results, the behaviours she was frequently exhibiting at that period, at which she performed well but did not give her energy, were Optimism, Efficacy and Persistence. In fact, she felt that she was overusing her Efficacy and Persistence strengths in order to deliver high performance, often to compensate for the employees’ lower performance, and {{this was one of the}} main reasons as to why she felt de-energised. Further, she admitted that if she continued overusing them she would experience burn out. Thus, she had to act fast by making an effort to control these strengths, in particular, Efficacy and Persistence while simultaneously empowering her employees to <b>undertake</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their work. In this case, too, she used the Catalyst and Feedback strengths to compensate for her Efficacy and Persistence behaviours and introduce new ways of working in the company. The fact that Strategic Awareness was identified as a weakness (activities at which she did not deliver high performance and which de-energised her as well), could be justified since, being concerned with the everyday performance of the employees and the deliverables they had to produce, most of her time and attention was absorbed away from business strategy. Finally, the strengths that she was not employing at that period and which she could employ more in the future in order to reach her goal were Explainer, Narrator, Emotional Awareness, Order, Detail, Mission, and Planful. She truly believed that using these strengths would primarily motivate her since she would perform well and would also draw energy by applying them. Further, they could help her achieve her goal of introducing change in the ways her employees worked. In particular, she felt that using the strengths of Explainer, Mission and Planful more would enable her to communicate better with her employees, explain her feelings and subsequently draft a plan based on common understanding so as to change the way both her and the employees worked.|$|E
