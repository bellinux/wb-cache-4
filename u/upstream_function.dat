40|$|This work aims at {{investigating}} and quantifying the Urban Transport System (UTS) resilience enhancement enabled by {{the adoption}} of emerging technology such as Internet of Everything (IoE) and the new trend of the Connected Community (CC). A conceptual extension of Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and its formalization have been proposed and used to model UTS complexity. The scope is to identify the system functions and their interdependencies with a particular focus on those that have a relation and impact on people and communities. Network analysis techniques have been applied to the FRAM model to identify and estimate the most critical community-related functions. The notion of Variability Rate (VR) {{has been defined as}} the amount of output variability generated by an <b>upstream</b> <b>function</b> that can be tolerated/absorbed by a downstream function, without significantly increasing of its subsequent output variability. A fuzzy based quantification of the VR on expert judgment has been developed when quantitative data are not available. Our approach has been applied to a critical scenario (water bomb/flash flooding) considering two cases: when UTS has CC and IoE implemented or not. The results show a remarkable VR enhancement if CC and IoE are deploye...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe frizzled (fz) signaling/signal {{transduction}} pathway controls planar cell polarity in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Previous data implicated Rho 1 as {{a component}} of the fz pathway in Drosophila but it was unclear how it functioned. The existence of a G Protein Binding-Formin Homology 3 (GBD-FH 3) domain in Multiple Wing Hairs, a downstream component of the pathway suggested that Rho 1 might function by binding to and activating Mwh. We re-examined the role of Rho 1 in wing planar polarity and found that it had multiple functions. Aberrant Rho 1 activity led to changes in the number of hairs formed, changes in cell shape and F-actin and changes in cellular junctions. Experiments that utilized Rho effector loop mutations argued that these phenotypes were mediated by effects of Rho 1 on the cytoskeleton and not by effects on transcription. We found strong positive genetic interactions between Rho 1 and mwh, that Rho 1 regulated the accumulation of Mwh protein and that these two proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated. The Mwh GBD:FH 3 domain was sufficient for co-immunoprecipitation with Rho 1, consistent with this domain mediating the interaction. However, further experiments showed that Rho 1 function in wing differentiation was not limited to interacting with Mwh. We established by genetic experiments that Rho 1 could influence hair morphogenesis in the absence of mwh and that the disruption of Rho 1 activity could interfere with the zig zag accumulation pattern of upstream fz pathway proteins. Thus, our results argue that in addition to its interaction with Mwh Rho 1 has functions in wing planar polarity that are parallel to and upstream of fz. The <b>upstream</b> <b>function</b> may be an indirect one and associated with the requirement for normal apical basal polarity and adherens junctions for the accumulation of PCP protein complexes...|$|E
40|$|Ever since cloning {{the classic}} iv {{mutation}} identified the ‘left-right dynein’ (lrd) gene in mice, most research on body laterality determination {{has focused on}} its function in motile cilia at the node embryonic organizer. This model is attractive, as it links chirality of cilia architecture to asymmetry development. However, lrd is also expressed in blastocysts and embryonic stem cells, where it was shown to bias the segregation of recombined sister chromatids {{away from each other}} in mitosis. These data suggested that lrd is part of a cellular mechanism that recognizes and selectively segregates sister chromatids based on their replication history: old ‘Watson’ vs. old ‘Crick’ strands. We previously proposed that the mouse left-right axis is established via an asymmetric cell division prior to/or during gastrulation. In this model, left-right dynein selectively segregates epigenetically differentiated sister chromatids harboring a hypothetical ‘left-right axis development 1 ’ (‘lra 1 ’) gene during the left-right axis establishing cell division. Here, asymmetry development would be ultimately governed by the chirality of the cytoskeleton and the DNA molecule. Our model predicts that randomization of chromatid segregation in lrd mutants should produce embryos with 25 % situs solitus, 25 % situs inversus, and 50 % embryonic death due to heterotaxia and isomerism. Here we confirmed this prediction by using two distinct lrd mutant alleles. Other than lrd, thus far Nodal gene is the most <b>upstream</b> <b>function</b> implicated in visceral organs laterality determination. We next tested whether the Nodal gene constitutes the lra 1 gene hypothesized in the model by testing mutant’s effect on 50 % embryonic lethality observed in lrd mutants. Since Nodal mutation did not suppress lethality, we conclude that Nodal is not equivalent to the lra 1 gene. In summary, we describe the origin of 50 % lethality in lrd mutant mice not yet explained by any other laterality-generating hypothesis...|$|E

This transformation is inextricably interrelated with changes in firms’ organization. Some cities host <b>upstream</b> <b>functions</b> of the value chain while others attract production and assembly. This paper investigates the tendency toward functional specialization in Chinese cities by exploring divisions in multinational corporations’ (MNC) business operations in China. Based on data from Fortune Global 500 MNCs during 1979 - 2008, the study finds that MNCs have gradually expanded in China, both functionally and geographically. In that process, similar functions tend to agglomerate in certain cities while complementary functions co-agglomerate in others.

40|$|Pathogen-activated and damage-associated {{molecular}} patterns {{activate the}} inflammasome in macrophages. We report that mouse macrophages release IL- 1 b while co-incubated with pro-B (Ba/F 3) cells dying, {{as a result}} of IL- 3 withdrawal, by apoptosis with autophagy, but not when they are co-incubated with living, apoptotic, necrotic or necrostatin- 1 treated cells. NALP 3 -deficient macrophages display reduced IL- 1 b secretion, which is also inhibited in macrophages deficient in caspase- 1 or pre-treated with its inhibitor. This finding demonstrates that the inflammasome is activated during phagocytosis of dying autophagic cells. We show that activation of NALP 3 depends on phagocytosis of dying cells, ATP release through pannexin- 1 channels of dying autophagic cells, P 2 X 7 purinergic receptor activation, and on consequent potassium efflux. Dying autophagic Ba/F 3 cells injected intraperitoneally in mice recruit neutrophils and thereby induce acute inflammation. These findings demonstrate that NALP 3 performs key <b>upstream</b> <b>functions</b> in inflammasome activation in mouse macrophages engulfing dying autophagic cells, and that these functions lead to pro-inflammatory responses...|$|R

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{transcription}} of a secreted acid phosphatase, PHO 5, is repressed {{in response to}} high concentrations of extracellular inorganic phosphate. To investigate the signal transduction pathway leading to transcriptional regulation of PHO 5, we carried out a genetic selection for mutants that express PHO 5 constitutively. We then screened for mutants whose phenotypes are also dependent on the function of PHO 81, which encodes an inhibitor of the Pho 80 p-Pho 85 p cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex. These mutations are therefore likely to impair <b>upstream</b> <b>functions</b> in the signaling pathway, and they define five complementation groups. Mutations were found in a gene encoding a plasma membrane ATPase (PMA 1), in genes required for the in vivo function of the phosphate transport system (PHO 84 and PHO 86), in a gene involved in the fatty acid synthesis pathway (ACC 1), and in a novel, nonessential gene (PHO 23). These mutants can be classified into two groups: pho 84, pho 86, and pma 1 are defective in high-affinity phosphate uptake, whereas acc 1 and pho 23 are not, indicating that {{the two groups of}} mutations cause constitutive expression of PHO 5 by distinct mechanisms. Our observations suggest that these gene products affect different aspects of the signal transduction pathway for PHO 5 repression...|$|R

40|$|The RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} {{of viruses}} {{belonging to the}} order Mononegavirales {{is part of a}} large multifunctional L protein that also catalyzes viral mRNA capping and cap methylation. The L protein of this diverse group of agents displays six blocks of conserved sequences. The precise relationship between these conserved regions and individual functions is largely unknown, except for “domain” VI that clearly encodes a viral mRNA cap methylase. The L protein of morbilliviruses (family Paramyxoviridae) was reported to tolerate insertion of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in a region just upstream of domain VI. Recombinant viruses with this insertion grow well in cell culture but are highly attenuated in animal hosts. We show here that the L protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the prototype of the Rhabdoviridae family, also tolerates insertion of EGFP at a similar site. The modified protein (LEGFP) and the resultant recombinant virus both demonstrated a sharp temperature-sensitive phenotype for polymerase activity, with reduced activity at 37 °C and no activity at 37. 5 °C. Neither translation nor methylation of mutant virus transcripts was affected at 37 °C. Curiously, mutant virus grown at permissive temperature contained about threefold-less L protein than the wild-type virus did and displayed no virion-associated polymerase activity in vitro. These findings support the notion that a flexible “hinge” region separates the cap methylase domain of L proteins from <b>upstream</b> <b>functions</b> and open up a number of avenues for studies of L-protein function in the more-tractable VSV model system...|$|R

40|$|Dietary {{carotenoids}} are {{precursors for}} the production of retinoids, which participate in many essential processes, including the formation of the photopigment rhodopsin. Despite the importance of conversion of carotenoids to vitamin A (all-trans-retinol), many questions remain concerning the mechanisms that promote this process, including the uptake of carotenoids. We use the Drosophila visual system as a genetic model to study retinoid formation from β-carotene. In a screen for mutations that affect the biosynthesis of rhodopsin, we identified a class B scavenger receptor, SANTA MARIA. We demonstrate that SANTA MARIA <b>functions</b> <b>upstream</b> of vitamin A formation in neurons and glia, which are outside of the retina. The protein is coexpressed and functionally coupled with the β, β-carotene- 15, 15 ′-monooxygenase, NINAB, which converts β-carotene to all-trans-retinal.

40|$|The {{mismatch}} repair proteins <b>function</b> <b>upstream</b> in the DNA damage signaling pathways {{induced by the}} DNA methylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). We report that MSH 2 (MutS homolog 2) protein interacts with the ATR (ATM- and Rad 3 -related) kinase to form a signaling module and regulate the phosphorylation of Chk 1 and SMC 1 (structure maintenance of chromosome 1). We found that phosphorylation of Chk 1 by ATR also requires checkpoint proteins Rad 17 and replication protein A. In contrast, phosphorylation of SMC 1 by ATR is independent of Rad 17 and replication protein A, suggesting that the signaling pathway leading to SMC 1 phosphorylation is distinct from that mediated by the checkpoint proteins. In addition, both MSH 2 and Rad 17 are required for the activation of the S-phase checkpoint to suppress DNA synthesis in response to MNNG, and phosphorylation of SMC 1 is required for cellular survival. These data support a model in which MSH 2 and ATR <b>function</b> <b>upstream</b> to regulate two branches of the response pathway to DNA damage caused by MNNG...|$|R

40|$|Obesity is a {{major risk}} factor for the {{development}} of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. How obesity contributes to metabolic syndrome is unclear. Free fatty acid (FFA) activation of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) -dependent cJun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is implicated in this process. However, the mechanism that mediates SRC-dependent JNK activation is unclear. Here, we identify a role for the scaffold protein JIP 1 in SRC-dependent JNK activation. SRC phosphorylation of JIP 1 creates phosphotyrosine interaction motifs that bind the SH 2 domains of SRC and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV. These interactions are required for SRC-induced activation of VAV and the subsequent engagement of a JIP 1 -tethered JNK signaling module. The JIP 1 scaffold protein, therefore, plays a dual role in FFA signaling by coordinating <b>upstream</b> SRC <b>functions</b> together with downstream effector signaling by the JNK pathway...|$|R

Unlike TOF flow sensors using thermal tracers, there is no need of delicate microstructures in this sensor since the diffusion of oxygen in the wall of the channel is negligible. Backward implicit finite difference simulation is used to analyze the transportation of the oxygen pulse in the channel. The measurement results in different aqueous fluids are shown.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{cellular}} {{signaling pathway}} (network) {{is one of}} the main topics of organismic investigations. The intracellular interactions between genes in a signaling pathway are considered as the foundation of functional genomics. Thus, what genes and how much they influence each other through transcriptional binding or physical interactions are essential problems. Under the synchronous measures of gene expression via a microarray chip, an amount of dynamic information is embedded and remains to be discovered. Using a systematically dynamic modeling approach, we explore the causal relationship among genes in cellular signaling pathways from the system biology approach. Results In this study, a second-order dynamic model is developed to describe the regulatory mechanism of a target gene from the upstream causality point of view. From the expression profile and dynamic model of a target gene, we can estimate its <b>upstream</b> regulatory <b>function.</b> According to this <b>upstream</b> regulatory <b>function,</b> we would deduce the upstream regulatory genes with their regulatory abilities and activation delays, and then link up a regulatory pathway. Iteratively, these regulatory genes are considered as target genes to trace back their upstream regulatory genes. Then we could construct the regulatory pathway (or network) to the genome wide. In short, we can infer the genetic regulatory pathways from gene-expression profiles quantitatively, which can confirm some doubted paths or seek some unknown paths in a regulatory pathway (network). Finally, the proposed approach is validated by randomly reshuffling the time order of microarray data. Conclusion We focus our algorithm on the inference of regulatory abilities of the identified causal genes, and how much delay before they regulate the downstream genes. With this information, a regulatory pathway would be built up using microarray data. In the present study, two signaling pathways, i. e. circadian regulatory pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana and metabolic shift pathway from fermentation to respiration in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are reconstructed using microarray data to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. In the circadian regulatory pathway, we identified mainly the interactions between the biological clock and the photoperiodic genes consistent with the known regulatory mechanisms. We also discovered the now less-known regulations between crytochrome and phytochrome. In the metabolic shift pathway, the casual relationship of enzymatic genes could be detected properly. </p...|$|R
