40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{risk factors}} for urinary tract infection (UTI) after <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> by evaluating patients' clinical characteristics and urodynamic parameters. Materials and methods: Two hundred and sixty-one female patients (mean age 58. 7  ±  12. 3 years) from May to December 2011 who had lower urinary tract symptoms or needed definite diagnosis before pelvic floor reconstruction or anti-incontinence surgery received <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> All patients received urinalysis on the scheduled day of <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> and 3 days after <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> Mid-stream urine samples were obtained for urinalysis before <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> If patients had UTI based on our urinalysis criteria before <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination,</b> the investigation was postponed until the patient had a 3 – 7 -day course of antibiotic treatment and urinalysis showed no UTI. Results: Among 261 patients, 19 and 51 patients had UTI before and after <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination,</b> respectively. Our data suggest that <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> causes significantly increased incidence of UTI. Increased number of vaginal births, UTI before investigation, diabetes and decreased average flow rate are {{risk factors for}} UTI after <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> Conclusion: When the prevalence of UTI after <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> is higher than 10 %, we recommend that prophylactic antibiotics should be given for high-risk patients with parameters such as older age, diabetes and multipara (> 3). Those who have UTI before <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> and who are {{found to have a}} low average flow rate of less than 7  mL/second should take prophylactic antibiotics after examination...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To {{assess the}} {{impairment}} of supraspinal control over spinal sympathetic centres and {{the occurrence of}} autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord injury. Autonomic dysreflexia {{is caused by the}} disconnection of spinal sympathetic centres from supraspinal control and is characterised by paroxysmal hypertensive episodes caused by non-specific stimuli below the level of the lesion. Therefore, patients with spinal cord injury were examined clinically and by different techniques to assess the occurrence of autonomic dysreflexia and to relate disturbances of the sympathetic nervous system to episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. RESULTS: None of the paraplegic patients, but 59 % (13 / 22) of tetraplegic patients (91 % of the complete, 27 % of the incomplete patients) presented signs of autonomic dysreflexia during <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> Only 62 % of the tetraplegic patients complained about symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. Pathological sympathetic skin responses (SSRs) of the hands were related to signs of autonomic dysreflexia in 93 % of cases. No patient with preserved SSR potentials of the hands and feet showed signs of autonomic dysreflexia, either clinically or during <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> Ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPMs) indicated a loss of circadian blood pressure rhythm (sympathetic control) but preserved heart rate rhythm (parasympathetic regulation) only in patients with complete tetraplegia. Pathological ABPM recordings were seen in 70 % of patients with symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> was more sensitive in indicating signs of autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord injury, whereas SSR allowed the assessment of the degree of disconnection of the sympathetic spinal centres from supraspinal control. Using ABPM recordings the occurrence of episodes of autonomic dysreflexia over 24 hours and the effectiveness of therapeutical treatment can be assessed...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In this {{preliminary}} study we report {{the development of}} the video urodynamic technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 6 women with genuine stress urinary incontinence, diagnosed by history and physical examination. <b>Urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> was performed on multichannel equipment with the patient in the supine position. Coughing and Valsalva maneuvers were performed at volumes of 150, 250 and 350 mL. Simultaneously, MRI was carried out by using 1. 5 T GE Signa CV/i high-speed scanner with real time fluoroscopic imaging possibilities. Fluoroscopic imaging was accomplished in the corresponding planes with T 2 -weighted single shot fast spin echo sequences at a speed of about 1 frame per second. Both studies were recorded and synchronized, resulting in a single video <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> RESULTS: Dynamic MRI with cine-loop reconstruction of 1 image per second demonstrated the movement of all compartment of the relaxed pelvis during straining with the concomitant registration of abdominal and intravesical pressures. In 5 patients, urinary leakage was demonstrated during straining and the Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) was determined as the vesical pressure at leak subtracted from baseline bladder pressure. Mean VLPP was 72. 6 cm H 2 O (ranging from 43 to 122 cm H 2 O). CONCLUSIONS: The concept of MRI video urodynamics is feasible. In a clinical perspective, practical aspects represent a barrier to daily use and it should be recommended for research purposes.

40|$|Introduction: Radical {{hysterectomy}} {{is associated}} with a significant amount of urinary functional complications and a negative impact on quality of life. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the neurological etiology of lower urinary tract dysfunction following radical hysterectomy and to establish an optimal postoperative management strategy. Material and methods: We performed a comprehensive overview using the following terms: "radical hysterectomy" and "urologic diseases etiology" or "urologic disease prevention and control". Results: The reported incidence of lower urinary tract dysfunction after radical hysterectomy varies from 12 to 85 %. Several animal and clinical urodynamic studies corroborate the neurologic etiology of the dysfunction. Lower urinary tract dysfunction is a common postoperative finding (70 - 85 %) but spontaneous recovery is to be expected within 6 - 12 months after surgery. The most frequent long term sequela is stress urinary incontinence (40 % of cases) and its management is complex and challenging. Postoperative refractory overactive bladder and bladder underactivity can be treated by neuromodulation of sacral roots and superior hypogastric plexus, respectively. In the absence of good clinical predictors, preoperative <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examinations</b> could have a role in understanding the pathophysiology of the dysfunction before such interventions. Conclusion: The pathophysiology of lower urinary tract dysfunction following radical hysterectomy is multifactorial. Its management is complex and should be multidisciplinary.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{clinical}} outcomes of anti-incontinence surgeries employing the transobturator sling and single-incision sling (SIS). Our hypothesis is that the outcome of the SIS is not inferior to the obturator sling. This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent anti-incontinence surgery with the transobturator sling or SIS from July 2005 to November 2014. Patients who underwent concomitant pelvic organ reconstruction with an artificial mesh were excluded. Assessments included preoperative and postoperative <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examinations,</b> perioperative complications, and postoperative urogenital symptoms. A total of 122 women were recruited according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among them, 68 patients underwent transobturator sling procedures while 54 patients underwent SIS procedures. The subjective failure rate of the transobturator sling and SIS were 10. 2 % and 18. 5 %, respectively (p =  0. 292). The objective failure rate, defined as a pad test showing more than 2  g of urine, was 10. 2 % for the transobturator sling and 12. 9 % for the SIS (p =  0. 777). SIS resulted in less blood loss, operative time, length of hospital stay, and transient voiding dysfunction after the operation. No major complication occurred after either surgical intervention. In conclusion, SIS and transobturator slings might have similar efficacy, safety, and effects on new-onset urogenital symptoms...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the curative effect and histo-compatibility of reconstruction of traumatic urethral defect of rabbit using urethral extracellular matrix (ECM). MethodsUrethral ECM {{was obtained by}} excision of the urethra in 20 donor rabbits. In experimental group, 20 rabbits were resected a 1. 0 cm- 1. 5 cm segment of the urethra and artificially made a model of traumatic urethral defect, then reconstructed by the urethral extracellular matrix of the same length. The rabbit immunity response was assessed by lymphocyte transformation test and serum TNF-α level. The reconstructed urethral segments were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Van Gieson stain and observed by histological examination postoperatively. The urethrography, urethroscopy and <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examinations</b> were performed. ResultsThere {{was no significant difference}} in stimulative index of lymphocyte transformation between ECM group and control group. The serum TNF-α levels of ECM group slightly rose, but the increase was not significant as compared with control group. On postoperative day 10, epithelial cell had migrated from each side and small vessels were found in the extracellular matrix. In the 3 rd week, several layers of urothelium covered the whole surface of the matrix tube. In the 6 th week, the disorganized arrangements of smooth muscle fibers were firstly observed by Van Gieson staining. In the 24 th week, the smooth muscle cells increased and the matrix tube appeared fairly similar to normal urethral wall components. The urethroscopy and urodynamic evaluation revealed that the surface of reconstructed urethra was smooth and emiction was unobstructed.

40|$|Aims: {{the goal}} {{of this study was to}} {{evaluate}} whether the intravaginal electrode used to perform vaginal electrical stimulation could induce acute changes on the cystometrograms and urethral pressure profiles (UPP) recordings. Methods: Three consecutive <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examinations</b> were performed on 30 women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) symptoms. the first exam was performed without the electrode, the second with the electrode inserted into the vagina, but with the stimulator switched off and the third with the stimulator turned on. We used the INNOVA (Empi) stimulator with electrical parameters set at 50 Hz and 60 mA and on an intermittent cycle during the cystometries and a continuous stimulation during the UPP. the data of functional profile length (FPL), maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP), and area of the resting UPP as well as the filling sensations and its respective bladder volumes during the cystometries, were compared. With regard to the cystometries. Results: No effect of the electrode was observed on cystometry. However, the simple presence of the electrode improved the FPL, MUCP, and areas of the UPP similar to those when the stimulation was applied. Conclusions: We conclude that, the presence of the intravaginal electrode induces changes in the UPP not related to the stimulation itself. the physiotherapeutic effect of the electrode itself is still to be evaluated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Verify {{if there}} is any {{difference}} in sensitive and motor bladder response in the presence of solutions with different osmolarities, simulating physiological extremes of urinary osmolarity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients (24 men and 9 women) with mean age of 46. 4 years (8 to 87 years) took part in this study. They were all subjected to 2 consecutive <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examinations.</b> In each exam, the vesical filling was accomplished by using a hyperosmolar (1000 mOsm/L) or hypo-osmolar (100 mOsm/L) sodium chloride solution in similar speed. The sequence in which each solution was instilled was determined by a double blind draw. The urodynamic results obtained from the infusion of both solutions were compared, regardless the sequence of administration. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (45. 4 %) showed detrusor hyperactivity, 12 of whom with neurological antecedents. The mean age of those with detrusor hyperactivity was 45. 8 years, against 46. 9 for those without hyperactivity. The infusion of the hyperosmolar/hypo-osmolar solution generated the following results, when comparing patients without vs. with detrusor hyperactivity: initial sensation of vesical filling (mL) : 167. 5 / 159. 2 vs. 134. 9 / 157. 3 (p > 0. 05); volume of occurrence of the first involuntary bladder contraction (mL) : 163. 9 / 151. 9 (p > 0. 05); detrusor micturition pressure (cm H 2 O) : 24. 0 / 24. 4 vs. 13. 8 / 27. 5 (p > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The vesical filling with solutions simulating extreme urinary osmolarities, accomplished with similar speed and without previous identification, did not likewise alter the sensitive and motor urodynamic behavior in the current study.

40|$|Background: The {{abuse of}} antimicrobical drugs has {{increased}} the resistance of microorganisms to treatments, thus to make urinary tract infections (UTIs) more difficult to eradicate. Among natural substances used to prevent UTI, literature has provided preliminary data of the beneficial effects of D-mannose, N-acetylcysteine, and Morinda citrifolia fruit extract, due to their complementary mechanism of action which contributes respectively to limit bacteria adhesion to the urothelium, to destroy bacterial pathogenic biofilm, and to the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the administration of an association of D-mannose, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Morinda citrifolia extract versus antibiotic therapy in the prophylaxis of UTIs potentially associated with urological mini-invasive diagnostics procedures, in clinical model of the urodynamic investigation. Methods: 80 patients eligible for <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination,</b> 42 men and 38 women, have been prospectively enrolled in the study and randomised in two groups (A and B) of 40 individuals. Patients of group A followed antibiotic therapy with Prulifloxacine, by mouth 400 mg/day for 5 days, while patients of the group B followed the association of mannose and NAC therapy, two vials/day for 7 days. Ten days after the urodynamic study, the patients were submitted to urine examination and urine culture. Results: The follow up assessment didn't show statistical significant difference between the two groups regarding the incidence of UTI. Conclusions: The association of mannose and NAC therapy resulted similar to the antibiotic therapy in preventing UTIs in patients submitted to <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> This result leads to consider the possible use of these nutraceutical agents as a good alternative in the prophylaxis of the UTI afterwards urological procedures in urodynamics...|$|E

A total of 311 patients participated in this study. Of the all female patients included, 215 participated in a and immediatel stress-urge- incontinence-questionnaire (SIQ) received an <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> The main goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether a significant relationship exists between the scores of the SIQ and the results of the examination. Furthermore, this study evaluated the importance of the score in relation to a stepwise diagnostic for urinary incontinence. The study showed that: 1. 	with a stress-score of 13 - 26 and an urge-score of 0 - 6 the positive predictive value to develop stress-incontinence was 80 %. 2. 	The SIQ lacked predictability potential to determine urge-incontinence in the evaluated patient group. No significance could be found between the urge-score and the <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination.</b> The SIQ appears to be important during anamnesis. Used as an orientation device the questionnaire proofs practical during step-by-step diagnostic to determine urinary incontinence. One of the benefits established, was the accurate reception of micturition (urination) history and comfort level of the patient. In addition, the SIQ proofed to be a valuable instrument to distinguish between a predicted stress- and an urge-incontinence. The SIQ is a valuable tool during stepwise diagnostic; however, physicians should be aware not to use it as the only instrument to determine surgical intervention. To improve quality it is principally recommended to use these types of surveys at centers for Continence and Pelvic floor; and preferentially to use questionnaires that received a grade A or B from the International Consultation on Urinary Incontinence...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the urodynamic findings and characteristics of lower urinary tract dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Materials and Methods: Thirty patients (25 male, 5 female) with TBI, who had neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, were investigated retrospectively. <b>Urodynamic</b> <b>examinations</b> were performed, maximum cystometric capacity, residual urine, presence of storage dysfunction (bladder capacity 50 ml), and presence of bladder filling sensation, type of detrusor activity and bladder emptying method were determinedResults: The mean age of the subjects was 31. 9 ± 16. 3 years. The mean maximum cystometric capacity was 228 ± 155 ml. Postvoiding residual urine was present in 15 patients and the mean residual urine was 128 ± 143 ml. Bladder filling sensation was normal in 16 (55. 2 %), diminished in 11 (37. 9 %) and was absent in 2 (6. 9 %). Frequencies of storage and emptying dysfunctions were 20 (66. 7 %) and 8 (26. 7 %), respectively and 4 patients (13. 3 %) had both storage and emptying dysfunctions. Three patients (10 %) had normoactive, 23 (76. 7 %) had overactive and 4 (13. 3 %) had underactive detrusor. Twenty-five patients (83 %) were emptying their bladder spontaneously, 4 (13. 3 %) by intermittent catheterization and 1 (3. 3 %) by indwelling catheter. Nine (36 %) of the 25 patients who were emptying their bladder spontaneously were using urinary condom, 2 (8 %) were using diapers. In the evaluation of nine patients who were given anticholinergic/antispasmodic therapy and had control urodynamic investigation pre- and post-treatment, the median values of cystometric capacities were 99 (min: 48 -max: 420) and 158 (min: 52 -max: 448) ml, respectively. Increase in cystometric capacity was observed in eight of nine patients. Conclusion: Bladder storage dysfunction is frequent in patients with TBI which is mainly due to detrusor overactivity. Bladder filling sensation was present at least to some degree in the great majority of them and again, a great majority of the patients were able to void spontaneously.

40|$|Purpose Children with an overactive {{neurogenic bladder}} need clean {{intermittent}} catheterisation and anticholinergics {{to protect their}} upper urinary tract. Oral oxybutynin is the pharmacological treatment of choice, but it is known to induce several systemic anticholinergic side effects. Intravesical instillation of oxybutynin has been proven {{to be an effective}} alternative by escaping the first pass metabolism and therefore causing less systemic side effects in adults. Evidence about the dosage of intravesical oxybutynin in children is still unavailable. Furthermore, the stability of oxybutynin stored at different conditions has to be investigated. Material and methods The dosage of intravesical oxybutynin was retrospectively evaluated in 29 children (aged 0 – 16 years) with detrusor overactivity using <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examinations.</b> The activity of oxybutynin, stored at - 18 ˚C, 4 ˚C and 20 ˚C, was investigated in vitro in bladder strips of the detrusor muscle of 33 male Wistar rats (weight 250 – 345 gram). After increasing concentrations of oxybutynin (1 * 10 - 7 – 1 * 10 - 4 M) were applied to the bladder strips, the contractile force was measured. Results	 The present study showed that the dosage of intravesical oxybutynin was mainly dependent on bodyweight and bladder compliance. The effect of intravesical oxybutynin could be predicted for boys and girls using the following factors: weight, bladder capacity, intravesical pressure and follow-up. A relationship between the oral dosage and the initial intravesical dosage seems to be present. The dose-response relation of oxybutynin in bladder strips of rats was significant (p< 0. 0001). No influence of storage conditions was seen in contractile response when using oxybutynin within 6 weeks. Oxybutynin stored in the refrigerator for 12 weeks showed an unexpectedly strong inhibiting effect compared to 2 or 6 weeks (p= 0. 01). Conclusions Primarily, intravesical oxybutynin in children is mainly a function of bodyweight and bladder compliance. This study provides a guide to start treatment and a formula to calculate further dosages. Secondarily, the storage instructions of the syringes containing oxybutynin can probably be less strict compared to the current opinion. These conclusions contribute to an improvement in convenience of the treatment. Overall, this study enhances the knowledge of the application of intravesical oxybutynin in children. ...|$|R

Continuous retrograde cystometry was also performed on 30 healthy adults, 10 cerebral bladder, 20 spinal bladder, and 5 peripheral bladder under the loading of autonomic nerve drugs. A. Results 1. Urethral resistance of healthy male adults was 0. 60 cmH[2]O/m 1 [2] 2 /sec[2] in average according to the simplified voiding method. In prostatic hypertrophy, it was much greater than normal but decreased to almost normal value after surgery. 2. Uroflometric examinations on healthy adult males showed the lowest urethral resistance 0. 24 mmHg/ml[2]/sec[2], initial intravesical pressure 54. 9 mmHg, maximum voiding pressure 58. 8 mmHg, and maximum flow rate 16. 4 ml/sec in average. In prostatic hypertrophy and urethral stricture, the minimum urethral resistance and intravesical pressure were higher and the maximum flow rate was lower than normal, and these values returned about normal after treatment. In urethral stricture, however, the intravesical pressure generally remained higher than that in prostatic hypertrophy even after urethral dilatation. 3. Continuous retrograde cystometry under administration of autonomic nerve drugs showed that normal or cerebral bladder scarecely responded to these drugs. In cerebral bladder, vesical capacity was greater and the maximum voluntary pressure was strikingly lower than values observed in normal bladder. On the other hand, spinal or peripheral bladder responded to these drugs. Injection of Buscopan® produced a low and that of bethanechol chloride a high cystometric curve. These responses seemed to be most striking at the time of maximum vesical capacity in spinal bladder and at the beginning of intravesical infusion in peripheral bladder. Vesical capacity was also affected by these drugs in spinal bladder and much less in peripheral bladder. B. Clinical significance of the <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examinations.</b> 1. The simplified measurement of urethral resistance is clinically useful as a screening method to evaluate the lower urinary tract obstruction. 2. Urofiometric examinations enable us to know grade and nature of the obstruction more accurately and concretely than the above, and they give us clinically useful informations as to treatment and its evaluation. 3. Continuous retrograde cystometry under administration of autonomic nerve drugs is also helpful in diagnosis and clinical judgment of neurogenic bladder...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIvE: We {{characterized}} the population with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome {{with regard to}} genital prolapse, urinary incontinence, and other gynecologic disorders. METHODS: Forty-one adult women who had registeredfor a first-ever Ehlers-Danlos multidis-ciplinary clinic participated in the study. Each had a comprehensive standardized evaluation, including gynecologic history, physical <b>examination,</b> <b>urodynamic</b> testing, and physical therapy evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed to determine means for various gynecologic disorders of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. RESULTS: The frequencies of incontinence complaints (59 %), endometriosis (27 %), dyspa-reunia (57 %), and previous hysterectomy (44 %) were higher than expectedfor a population {{with a mean age}} of 4 l years. Incontinence could not be demonstrated objectively. Prolapse was diagnosed in 12 (29. 3 %). CONCLUSIONS: Careful attention should be paid to women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome because of an association with many gynecologic complaints. Women with Ehlers-Danlos syn-drome should be questioned regarding incontinence, genital prolapse, endometriosis, and dyspa-reunia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Aim of {{the study}} was to {{correlate}} urethral retro resistance pressure with the maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) and functional urethral length (FUL) in patients with urinary incontinence and healthy individuals. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred and twenty patients with the complaint of urinary incontinence had a <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> including urethral pressure profiles and URP. Additionally, 15 healthy individuals without the complaint of any incontinence had their URP and urethral pressure profiles measured. The correlation of MUCP, FUL and URP were calculated using Graph Pad Instat 4. 0 for windows. RESULTS: URP correlates well with the diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence. Correlation coefficient between URP and MUCP is 0. 9262. Healthy individuals have significantly higher values for URP and MUCP. CONCLUSION: URP is a valuable less invasive test than conventional urethral function tests for the diagnosis of urodynamic incontinence with an excellent correlation of MUCP and URP...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{affected}} by Parkinson's disease (PD) may present with lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction characterized by involuntary detrusor overactivity. We evaluated possible {{impact of a}} 2 -week course of low frequency 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on LUT behavior in eight advanced PD patients complaining of urinary disturbances. We tested the effects of rTMS measuring <b>urodynamic</b> <b>examination</b> and the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) questionnaire, used for evaluation of subjective LUTS. rTMS was able to improve temporarily LUT behavior in PD patients, increasing bladder capacity and the first sensation of filling phase. Moreover, a reduction of IPSS score was noticed, due to an improvement on filling phase symptoms. The beneficial effects assessed with the IPSS lasted for up to 2 weeks {{after the end of}} the stimulation. rTMS seems to be an effective, noninvasive alternative treatment for PD patients with urinary disturbances...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} current knowledge, attitudes, {{and management}} of urinary incontinence among family physicians in Canada. DESIGN: Cross-sectional mailed survey. SETTING: Family physicians in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 1500 members of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-assessed knowledge, self-reported attitudes, and rating of various tests and treatments in the investigation {{and management of}} incontinence. RESULTS: The overall unadjusted response rate was 43. 3 % (650 / 1500). Although most respondents reported that urinary incontinence was common in their practices, less than half (46. 0 %, 284 / 617) indicated that they clearly understood incontinence and just 37. 9 % (232 / 612) had an organized plan for incontinence problems. Only 35. 0 % (214 / 612) of respondents felt very comfortable dealing with incontinence.

40|$|Objective. This study aims {{to compare}} {{clinical}} outcomes using the Perigee versus Elevate anterior devices {{for the treatment}} of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Study Design. One hundred and forty-one women with POP stages II to IV were scheduled for either Perigee (n= 91) or Elevate anterior device (n= 50). Preoperative and postoperative assessments included pelvic <b>examination,</b> <b>urodynamic</b> study, and a personal interview about quality of life and urinary symptoms. Results. Despite postoperative point C of Elevate group being significantly deeper than the Perigee group (median: − 7. 5 versus − 6; P 0. 05). Apart from urgency incontinence, women with advanced POP experienced significant resolution of irritating and obstructive symptoms after both procedures (P< 0. 05), generating the improvement in postoperative scores of Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI- 6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ- 7) (P< 0. 01). On urodynamics, only the residual urine decreased significantly following these two procedures (P< 0. 05). Women undergoing Perigee mesh experienced significantly higher visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and vaginal extrusion rates compared with the Elevate anterior procedure (P< 0. 05). Conclusions. With comparable success rates, the Elevate procedure has advantages over the Perigee surgery with lower extrusion rate and postoperative day 1 VAS scores...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Coital {{incontinence}} (CI) during orgasm {{is a form}} of {{urinary incontinence}} possibly because of detrusor overactivity (DO), as the underlying pathophysiological condition. Women with this symptom usually show a pharmacological lower cure rate than those with DO alone. The ultrasound measurement of the bladder wall thickness (BWT) allows an indirect evaluation of detrusor muscle thickness, giving a potential index of detrusor activity. AIM: We wanted to understand if CI at orgasm could be a marker of severity of DO by comparing BWT in women with both DO and CI at orgasm vs. women with DO alone. In addition we aimed to confirm if CI during orgasm is related to antimuscarinics treatment failure. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study performed in two tertiary urogynecological referral departments, recruiting consecutive patients seeking treatment for symptomatic DO. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients were thoroughly assessed including physical <b>examination,</b> <b>urodynamic</b> evaluation, and BWT measurement according to the International Continence Society/International Urogynecological Association and ICI recommendations. Solifenacine 5 mg once daily was then prescribed and follow-up was scheduled to evaluate treatment. Multiple logistic regression (MLR) was performed to identify risk factors for treatment failure. RESULTS: Between September 2007 and March 2010, 31 (22. 6...|$|R
