5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a severe weather event could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010. Nonetheless, the predictability of the event was too low as the event was several days out. As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though <b>uncertainties</b> in the timing and extent of the tornado outbreak still existed. These <b>uncertainties</b> remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more severe weather could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast. In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.|$|E

40|$|Innovation {{is defined}} as a process that is fraught with <b>uncertainty.</b> This article’s aim is to {{diminish}} lack of knowledge of the factors that create <b>uncertainty</b> in innovation processes. The basic thrust of the present argument is that the potential value integral to innovation {{may or may not be}} materialized in the future. Given that the future entails <b>uncertainty,</b> it is reasonable to expect that <b>uncertainty</b> is inherent in every innovation process. <b>Uncertainty</b> results from the fact that, on the one hand, events in the future do not follow the course of past events, and, on the other, knowledge of the future is always incomplete. Using a systematic approach to reviewing the literature, eight factors which create <b>uncertainty</b> in processes of innovation were identified, namely: technological <b>uncertainty,</b> market <b>uncertainty,</b> regulatory/institutional <b>uncertainty,</b> social/political <b>uncertainty,</b> acceptance/legitimacy <b>uncertainty,</b> managerial <b>uncertainty,</b> timing <b>uncertainty,</b> and consequence <b>uncertainty...</b>|$|R

40|$|When {{modeling}} output <b>uncertainty,</b> the multiplicative specification {{is consistently}} chosen over the additive form, despite {{the latter being}} arguably intuitively more obvious. The rationale for {{this seems to be}} that when production risk is the only source of <b>uncertainty,</b> additive <b>uncertainty</b> does not reduce output below the certainty level, while multiplicative <b>uncertainty</b> does. We show that, regardless of the specification of output <b>uncertainty,</b> if hedging is absent and there is simultaneous price and output <b>uncertainty,</b> output is always lower than the situation in which one or both sources of <b>uncertainty</b> are absent. Thus, both models yield qualitatively identical results, i. e., adding a source of <b>uncertainty</b> reduces expected output.

In three studies, we {{examined the effects of}} target and perceiver causal <b>uncertainty</b> on attitudes toward the target. Target causal <b>uncertainty</b> was manipulated via responses on a causal <b>uncertainty</b> scale in Studies 1 and 2, and with a scenario in Study 3. In Studies 1 and 2, we found that participants liked the low causal <b>uncertainty</b> target more than the high causal <b>uncertainty</b> target. This preference was stronger for low relative to high causal <b>uncertainty</b> participants because high causal <b>uncertainty</b> participants held more uncertain ideals. In Study 3, we examined the value individuals place upon causal understanding (causal importance) as an additional moderator. We found that regardless of their own causal <b>uncertainty</b> level, participants who were high in causal importance liked the low causal <b>uncertainty</b> target more than the high causal <b>uncertainty</b> target. However, when participants were low in causal importance, low causal <b>uncertainty</b> perceivers showed no preference and high causal <b>uncertainty</b> perceivers preferred the high causal <b>uncertainty</b> target.

40|$|Information <b>uncertainty</b> is {{inherent}} in many real-world problems and adds a layer of complexity to modeling and visualization tasks. This often causes users to ignore <b>uncertainty,</b> {{especially when it comes}} to visualization, thereby discarding valuable knowledge. A coherent framework for the modeling and visualization of information <b>uncertainty</b> is needed to address this issue In this work, we have identified four major barriers to the uptake of <b>uncertainty</b> modeling and visualization. Firstly, there are numerous <b>uncertainty</b> modeling tech- niques and users are required to anticipate their <b>uncertainty</b> needs before building their data model. Secondly, parameters of <b>uncertainty</b> tend to be treated at the same level as variables making it easy to introduce avoidable errors. This causes the <b>uncertainty</b> technique to dictate the structure of the data model. Thirdly, propagation of <b>uncertainty</b> information must be manually managed. This requires user expertise, is error prone, and can be tedious. Finally, <b>uncertainty</b> visualization techniques tend to be developed for particular <b>uncertainty</b> types, making them largely incompatible with other forms of <b>uncertainty</b> information. This narrows the choice of visualization techniques and results in a tendency for ad hoc <b>uncertainty</b> visualization. The aim of this thesis is to present an integrated information <b>uncertainty</b> modeling and visualization environment that has the following main features: information and its <b>uncertainty</b> are encapsulated into atomic variables, the propagation of <b>uncertainty</b> is automated, and visual mappings are abstracted from the <b>uncertainty</b> information data type. Spreadsheets have previously been shown to be well suited as an approach to visu- alization. In this thesis, we devise a new paradigm extending the traditional spreadsheet to intrinsically support information <b>uncertainty.</b> Our approach is to design a framework that integrates <b>uncertainty</b> modeling tech- niques into a hierarchical order based on levels of detail. The <b>uncertainty</b> information is encapsulated and treated as a unit allowing users to think of their data model in terms of the variables instead of the <b>uncertainty</b> details. The system is intrinsically aware of the encapsulated <b>uncertainty</b> and is therefore able to automatically select appropriate <b>uncertainty</b> propagation methods. A user-objectives based approach to <b>uncertainty</b> visualization is developed to guide the visual mapping of abstracted <b>uncertainty</b> information. Two main abstractions of <b>uncertainty</b> information are explored for the purpose of visual mapping: the Unified <b>Uncertainty</b> Model and the Dual <b>Uncertainty</b> Model. The Unified <b>Uncertainty</b> Model provides a single view of <b>uncertainty</b> for visual mapping, whereas the Dual <b>Uncertainty</b> Model distinguishes between possibilistic and probabilistic views. Such abstractions provide a buffer between the visual mappings and the <b>uncertainty</b> type of the underly- ing data, enabling the user to change the <b>uncertainty</b> detail without causing the visual- ization to fail. Two main case studies are presented. The first case study covers exploratory and forecasting tasks in a business planning context. The second case study inves- tigates sensitivity analysis for financial decision support. Two minor case studies are also included: one to investigate the relevancy visualization objective applied to busi- ness process specifications, and the second to explore the extensibility of the system through General Purpose Graphics Processor Unit (GPGPU) use. A quantitative anal- ysis compares our approach to traditional analytical and numerical spreadsheet-based approaches. Two surveys were conducted to gain feedback on the from potential users. The significance of this work is that we reduce barriers to <b>uncertainty</b> modeling and visualization in three ways. Users do not need a mathematical understanding of the <b>uncertainty</b> modeling technique to use it; <b>uncertainty</b> information is easily added, changed, or removed at any stage of the process; and <b>uncertainty</b> visualizations can be built independently of the <b>uncertainty</b> modeling technique...|$|R
