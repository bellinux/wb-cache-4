Six composite beams with concentric rectangular web openings were tested to failure. Varying moment to shear ratios were used to help develop and verify the <b>ultimate</b> strength <b>model.</b> One steel beam was tested to demonstrate the contribution of the concrete to the capacity of composite beams. Two steel sections were used, while the concrete slab size was held constant for all beams. Three elastic tests were performed on each beam before it was tested to failure. An <b>ultimate</b> strength <b>model</b> was developed to predict the strength of composite beams at the web openings in the form of moment-shear inter-action diagrams.

40|$|First-generation {{sheeting}} {{may fail}} if loaded by combined bending moment and concentrated load. This failure can be predicted by an existing <b>ultimate</b> failure <b>model</b> that calculates the out-of-plane deflection {{of a part}} of the compressed flange due to the concentrated load. This deflection is then used as an imperfection for Marguerre's plate equations. The sheeting is assumed to fail if the plate in Marguerre's equations starts to yield. In this paper a major improvement of the <b>ultimate</b> failure <b>model</b> is presented by replacing the complex Marguerre's equations with the fictitious strain method. This method predicts plate failure by an analytical model describing pre and post buckling behaviour and an empirical expression for the fictitious elastic strain at failure determined by finite element simulations. The new prediction method is compared with Eurocode 3. It is shown that the <b>ultimate</b> failure <b>model</b> using the fictitious strain method performs equally well as Eurocode 3, but provides more insight in the failure behaviour. Finally, suggestions to improve the method further are given based on a parameter study...|$|R

The starting point is compartmental systems modelling with backflows. It appears however that only a limited set of low-dimensional structures is identifiable.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a probabilistic procedure for deriving design <b>models</b> for the <b>ultimate</b> strength and strain of fiber-reinforcedpolymer (FRP) -confined concrete.

The database is also employed for deriving a probabilistic model for the FRP strain efficiency factor.

Then, using the Central Limit Theorem and considering uncertainty in the mechanical properties of the concrete and FRP material as well as their correlation, analytical probabilistic design <b>models</b> for the <b>ultimate</b> strength and strain of FRP-confined concrete are derived.

5000|$|The {{tension between}} zero waste, viewed as post-discard total {{recycling}} of materials only, and zero waste as the reuse of all high level function remains a serious one today. It {{is probably the}} defining difference between established recyclers and emerging zero-wasters. A signature example {{is the difference between}} smashing a glass bottle (recovering cheap glass) and refilling the bottle (recovering the entire function of the container). The tension between the literal application of natural processes and the creation of industry-specific more efficient reuse modalities is another tension. Many observers look to nature as an <b>ultimate</b> <b>model</b> for production and innovative materials. Others point out that industrial products are inherently non-natural (such as chemicals and plastics that are mono-molecular) and benefit greatly from industrial methods of reuse, while natural methods requiring degradation and reconstitution are wasteful in that context. Biodegradable plastic is the most prominent example. One side argues that biodegradation of plastic is wasteful because plastic is expensive and environmentally damaging to make. Whether made of starch or petroleum, the manufacturing process expends all the same materials and energy costs. Factories are built, raw materials are procured, investments are made, machinery is built and used, humans labor and make use of all normal human inputs for education, housing, food etc. Even if the plastic is biodegraded after a single use, all of those costs are lost so it is much more important to design plastic parts for multiple reuse or perpetual lives. The other side argues that keeping plastic out of a dump or the sea is the sole benefit of interest. Companies moving towards [...] "zero landfill" [...] plants include Subaru, Xerox and Anheuser-Busch.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary urban form, {{particularly}} in the cities of South Africa, lacks distinction and quality. The majority of developments are conceived as private and dislocated initiatives, surveiled enclaves with gated access being the only conduit to the outside world. Any concern for a positive contribution to the matrix of public activity is seldom a consideration. The urban form responds to the perception that traffic systems are paramount to the successful flux {{of the city in}} satisfying the escalating demands of vehicular movement. In contrast many of the urban centres around the world, the great historical centres of Europe, Americas and the Sub-Continent are admired and considered the <b>ultimate</b> <b>models</b> in urban experience. The colonnades, bazaars and boulevards hosting an abundance of street activity are the characteristics of such centres and are symptomatic of a city growth based on pedestrian movement patterns, an urbanism supportative of human interaction and exchange, a form which has nurtured the existence of a public realm.
