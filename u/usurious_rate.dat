She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a <b>usurious</b> <b>rate</b> of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.|$|E

Even today, after the rise of corporate payday lending in the United States, unlicensed loan sharks continue to operate in immigrant enclaves and low-income neighborhoods. They lend money to people who work in the informal sector or who are deemed to be too risky even by the check-cashing creditors. Some beat delinquents while others seize assets instead.

40|$|The {{idea that}} real estate could {{have contributed to}} banking crises during the Great Depression has been downplayed due to the {{conservatism}} of mortgage contracts at the time. For instance, loan-to-value ratios often did not exceed 50 per cent. Using newly discovered archival documents and data from 1934, this article uncovers a darker side of 1920 s US mortgage lending: the so-called ‘second mortgage system’. As borrowers often could not make a 50 per cent down payment, a majority of them took second mortgages at <b>usurious</b> <b>rates.</b> As theory predicts, debt dilution, even {{in the presence of}} seniority rules, can be highly detrimental to both junior and senior lenders. The probability of default on first mortgages was likely to increase, and commercial banks were more likely to foreclose. Through foreclosure they would still be able to retrieve 50 per cent of the property value, but often after a protracted foreclosure process. This would have put further strain on banks during liquidity crises. This article is thus a timely reminder that second mortgages, or ‘piggyback loans’ as they are called today, can be hazardous to lenders and borrowers alike. It provides further empirical evidence that debt dilution can be detrimental to credit...|$|R

40|$|To the {{knowledge}} of the author, {{this is the first time}} it has been shown that interest rates that are extremely high by modern standards (100 % and higher) are necessary within a zero-sum monetary system, and not just driven by greed. Extreme interest rates that appeared in various places and times reinforce the idea that hard money may have contributed to high rates of interest. Here a model is presented that examines the interest rate required to succeed as an investor in a zero-sum fixed quantity hard-money system. Even when the playing field is significantly tilted toward the investor, interest rates need to be much higher than expected. In a completely fair zero-sum system, an investor cannot break even without charging 100 % interest. Even with a 5 % advantage, an investor won't break even at 15 % interest. From this it is concluded that what we consider <b>usurious</b> <b>rates</b> today are, within a hard-money system, driven by necessity. Cryptocurrency is a novel form of hard-currency. The inability to virtualize the money creates a system close to zero-sum because of the limited supply design. Therefore, within the bounds of a cryptocurrency system that limits money creation, interest rates must rise to levels that the modern world considers usury. It is impossible, therefore, that a cryptocurrency that is not expandable could take over a modern economy and replace modern fiat currency. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, 3 equation...|$|R

25|$|Small landholders and sharecroppers {{were still}} {{required}} to pay rent and taxes and pay off their debts, which were characterised by <b>usurious</b> <b>rates</b> of interest. Any poor harvest thus exacted a heavy toll, given their lack of legally defined security. The accumulation of consumer debt, seasonal loans, and crisis loans began a cycle of spiraling, perpetual indebtedness. This dynamic was reinforced by laws, originally designed to alleviate usury, that restricted access to credit and discouraged or prevented the practice of using farmlands as collateral for loans. This had the unintended effect of making creditors less willing to accept farmlands as a pledge against a debt, {{and more likely to}} simply wait until their debtors were unable to repay their loans. Then it was relatively easy for the jotedars to use litigation to force debtors to sell all or part of their landholdings at a low price or forfeit them at auction. Debtors then became landless or land-poor sharecroppers and labourers, usually working the same fields they had once owned. The credit-driven slide into poverty converted farmers from smallholders into dwarfholders, and from dwarfholders into sharecroppers or agricultural labourers. The accumulation of household debt to a single, local, informal creditor (who also held power over land and sometimes grain or jute) also bound the debtor nearly inescapably to the creditor/landlord; it became nearly impossible to settle the debt after a good harvest and simply walk away. In this way, the jotedars effectively dominated and impoverished the lowest tier of economic classes in several districts of Bengal.|$|R

Jeromi* Re-emergence of informal financial institutions (IFIs) in the provision of credit has been a policy challenge in recent years in India. Though they meet the credit requirements of a section of the society, who are not served by the formal financial institutions, their unbridled growth, unlawful activities and links with other institutions may pose threats to the stability of financial system and makes the monetary policy less effective. Furthermore, they create social problems when they charge <b>usurious</b> <b>rates</b> of interest and resort to unethical practices for recovery of loans, which in turn, leads to suicides committed by indebted farmers. In this context, the study attempts to analyse the working of money lenders in Kerala. Based on a sample survey, the paper has estimated the volume of deposits and credits of money lenders in Kerala and brought out the undesirable aspects of their working {{and its impact on the}} society. The paper finds that the existing legal provisions and regulatory and supervisory mechanisms are inadequate to protect the interests of both depositors and creditors. The paper calls for strengthening the Kerala Money Lenders Act by passing an Act for the protection of depositors and creating a separate wing for their registration, monitoring and supervision by the State Government. In the long-term, the strategy for financial inclusion, strengthening of co-operatives and promotion of self help groups will be helpful in bringing down the role of moneylenders...|$|R
50|$|From {{the very}} early days of British rule, the tribesmen resented the British encroachments upon their tribal system. They were found {{resisting}} or supporting their brethren of Tamar and Jhalda in rebellion. Nor did their raja welcome the British administrative innovations. Beginning in the 18th century, the British added to the consolidation of feudalism in India, first under the Jagirdari system and then under the zamindari system. Beginning with the Permanent Settlement imposed by the British in Bengal and Bihar, which later became the template for a deepening of feudalism throughout India, the older social and economic system in the country began to alter radically. Land, both forest areas belonging to adivasis and settled farmland belonging to non-adivasi peasants, was rapidly made the legal property of British-designated zamindars (landlords), who in turn moved to extract the maximum economic benefit possible from their newfound property and subjects. Adivasi lands sometimes experienced an influx of non-local settlers, often brought from far away (as {{in the case of}} Muslims and Sikhs brought to Kol territory) by the zamindars to better exploit local land, forest and labour. Deprived of the forests and resources they traditionally depended on and sometimes coerced to pay taxes, many adivasis were forced to borrow at <b>usurious</b> <b>rates</b> from moneylenders, often the zamindars themselves. When they were unable to pay, that forced them to become bonded labourers for the zamindars. Often, far from paying off the principal of their debt, they were unable even to offset the compounding interest, and this was made the justification for their children working for the zamindar after the death of the initial borrower. In the case of the Andamanese adivasis, long isolated from the outside world in autonomous societies, mere contact with outsiders was often sufficient to set off deadly epidemics in tribal populations, and it is alleged that some sections of the British government directly attempted to destroy some tribes.|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{focuses on}} the nature of payday loans in Texas, {{including}} what a payday loan is, its cost to borrowers, and a brief discussion of how the payday loan industry is thriving. In order to understand these problems, a review of the relevant Texas usury laws as well as Texas statutes and the scope of their coverage as they relate to payday loans will be examined. Furthermore, the most favored lender doctrine as well as the exportation doctrine will be discussed, as these two doctrines permit payday lenders to avoid Texas law. Then, the unique relationship between payday lenders and federally regulated, state-chartered banks will be analyzed, as the nature of this relationship raises several concerns. Possible reforms include prohibiting lenders from being able to target the economically disadvantaged, and legislation that would impose severe penalties on lenders who take advantage of borrowers. In addition, a number of solutions will be proposed, which include (1) having the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) properly regulate the state-chartered banks they insure, (2) creating new Texas law that, instead of attacking the <b>usurious</b> interest <b>rates,</b> seeks to eliminate the practice of payday lending in Texas, and (3) providing borrowers with low credit an alternative to payday loans that does not trap them in a cycle of debt...|$|R
40|$|Access to {{loans and}} credit {{facilities}} has been, and still is, {{a major problem}} for {{a large portion of the}} South African society. The problem is particularly significant in the disadvantaged and rural areas where the majority of people do not have access to formal banking services. Against this background the government further exacerbated the problem by prescribing legislation, which is thought to protect borrowers from perceived <b>usurious</b> <b>rates.</b> This particular law in contention is the Usury Act (No. 73 of 1968). The Act imposes interest rate ceilings on loan finance provided by money lending institutions. The objective of this study was to examine the impact that interest rate ceilings will have on the micro lending market. This was done through looking at a case study based on information obtained from a micro lender. Firstly the study undertook the financial impact analysis on a micro lending business to determine the effect of a change in the maximum interest rate that could be charged by the micro lenders. This process was conducted to help understand the costs, revenues and profits of a micro lending business. The data, which were based on the micro lender’s financial statements, were analysed and evaluated on the basis that the statements reflect the financial position of the micro lender charging an interest rate not exceeding 30 per cent. Calculations were then made to reflect their financial position in the event of them being allowed to charge a maximum rate of 20 per cent, 12. 08 per cent and 10 per cent per month. The results showed that micro lenders could make a profit when charging rates of between 30 and 20 per cent. However when the interest rate is reduced to 10 per cent the micro lender start to lose. The bottom line for micro lenders is greatly influenced by their turnover, as large portions of their costs are fixed. Therefore one micro lender might earn economic profits at 12. 08 per cent per month, while another might just break-even. Simple and multiple regression techniques were used to analyse the data pertinent to the study. The analyses were performed to show the impact, which ceilings on the interest rate have on the market structure, company size and on the characteristics of loan services. The results were evaluated according to their significance. The findings showed that interest rate ceilings can have positive significant effect on risk and the market structure. Based on the findings of both methods applied to this study, it is evident that the interest rate ceilings could act as a constraint to the provision of credit to low-income earners and operators of small and micro enterprises. The micro lenders offer small amounts of credit to a large number of people, therefore interest rate ceilings may not only ration consumers out of the legal market, but also drive smaller lenders from the market and thus diminish competition.

40|$|Defence date: 19 December 1990 First made {{available}} online on 11 April 2014. The views of Greek historians on {{the conditions of}} existence and the strategy of peasant families tend to converge around a set of assumptions that may be depicted as following: - The peasantry held virtual control over {{large part of the}} land it cultivated. A great part of this land consisted of "National Estates" - that is, of land which before 1830 belonged to the Porte and to Ottoman subjects and after that date became property of the Greek state. Until 1871, any individual, as well as peasant families, might occupy and cultivate part of this land, by paying a relatively low rent, proportional to gross output, as a "right of usufruct" to the Treasury. Although the legal framework was unclear and liable to changes, regular occupants of this land might sell, rent, give as a dowry or even mortgage their rights on it. Thus, rights of occupancy on national land were de facto almost as strong as rights of property. -Ownership of large estates represented an exceptional and rather marginal situation; the wealthy and powerful strata of the population were mainly oriented towards commerce, money-lending, political and administrative careers, and showed a relative indifference towards the prospect of acquisition and exploitation of agricultural estate property. -The massive sale of "National Estates", organized according to the law of 1871, which gave priority to longstanding occupants, permitted a further consolidation of the peasants' position. It is commonly held that longstanding occupants became full proprietors of the land they traditionally cultivated. -Peasant farms, which represented the prevalent type of productive unit in Greek agriculture, were "target producers" oriented towards subsistence. This they sought through a varying combination of activities, including production of foodstuffs for home consumption, occasional wage-labour, and highly commercialized crops, such as currant viticulture, growing of cotton or tobacco. These latter were a supplementary opportunity for further differentiation of activities - differentiation which contributed to the security of household income - and a way to face monetary needs, aggravated by the <b>usurious</b> interest <b>rates</b> charged by money-lenders on their advances to the peasantry...|$|R

Taken together, they help explain why the economy has been progressively disembedded from society and interpersonal relationships have been subsumed under either bureaucratic processes or commercial transactions (or indeed both at once). Crucially, state and market have increasingly converged and even colluded at the expense of civil society, i. e. the ‘complex space’ of intermediary institutions such as free hospitals, friendly societies, manufacturing and trading guilds or universities whose autonomy is upheld by the Church. The global ‘market-state’ has subordinated the sanctity of life, land and labour to abstract values and standards, reducing the dignity of the person to ‘bare individuality’ and the shared quest for the common good to the individual pursuit of either utility or happiness. Linked to the advance of secularism is the twin triumph of social-cultural and economic-political liberalism since the 1960 s, which has coincided with the de-christianisation of Britain. Decades of liberalisation have certainly provided greater opportunities for many and afforded some protection against the worst transgressions upon the liberty of some by the liberty of others, especially given the growing disagreement about substantive notions of justice and the good life. However, socio-economic liberalism has also eroded the social bonds and civic ties on which vibrant democracies and market economies ultimately depend for trust and cooperation. Paradoxically, the two liberalisms have engendered a society that is simultaneous more interdependent and more atomised – tied to global finance that undermines the real economy and further fragments the United Kingdom. Following the global crash in 2008, we are left with a broken economy and a broken society. Five years later, British politics has returned to the old orthodoxies, notably the secular liberalism of both left and right and the collusive convergence of state and market at the expense of civil society. Among the few exceptions are ideas and movements such as ‘Red Tory’ and ‘Blue Labour’ that have challenged the secular liberal consensus. Such paradoxical combinations are characteristic of the new post-liberal politics, which seeks to combine greater economic justice with an emphasis on interpersonal relationships, supportive of family loyalty without wanting to decree in what a ‘real’ family should consist. But as both Red Tory and Blue Labour struggle to gain traction with the mainstream of the Conservative and the Labour party or indeed with the public at large, the role of the Church in shaping a politics of the common good is increasingly coming to the fore. Catholic Social Thought has provided much inspiration to the post-liberal thinking of Blue Labour in particular, both in terms of rejecting the false opposition between state collectivisation and market commodification and in relation to concrete policy alternatives such as the ‘living wage’, caps on <b>usurious</b> interest <b>rates,</b> proper workers’ representation in firms, a vocational economy as well as robust regional banks constrained to lend within specific sectors and counties or cities, as Maurice Glasman has advocated. As the established Church with its unique parochial system, the Church of England is exceptionally well positioned to offer courageous leadership and translate perennial principles into transformative practices. Far from being a mere ‘super-NGO’ or the poster-institution and moral conscience of civil society, the Church of England is a polity in her own right that co-constitutes together with Parliament the shared public realm under the aegis of the monarchy. In this manner, the established Church has a particular duty to promote a sense of individual virtue and public honour on which a society governed by reciprocity or gift-exchange depends. The Church of England is indispensable to a new politics of the common good beyond the liberalism of both left and right that underpins the global ‘market-state’...|$|R
