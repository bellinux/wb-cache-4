The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated neuromuscular inhibitory technique (INIT) along with specific strength training exercises in reducing pain, improving ROM and functional activities in subjects with <b>upper</b> trapezius <b>trigger</b> point. Methods: Thirty subjects were diagnosed with <b>upper</b> trapezius <b>trigger</b> points were included in the study. These patients were randomly allocated to intervention group (n= 15), which underwent a 4 - weeks training program of INIT along with specific strength training & control group (n= 15) that received INIT alone. The outcome measures were taken before and after treatment. Outcomes were measured by visual analogue scale, cervical range of motion and neck disability index. Within the groups VAS, NDI, and cervical lateral flexion and rotation showed significant change in the mean value. The comparison of pre and post VAS in experimental group and control group showed a significant change in the experimental group. Paired sample t- test was used to analyze changes from before and after intervention programmed. Results: There is a statistically significant (p< 0. 00) improvement in both variables from baseline to 4 th week in experimental group and control group but compared to control group, experimental group shows highly significant values in all parameters. Conclusion: INIT along with specific strength training is proved to be effective in reducing pain, decreasing disability and improving range of motion in individuals with <b>upper</b> trapezius <b>trigger</b> points...|$|R

The purpose of this clinical trial was to compare the effects of two manual treatment regimens on individuals with <b>upper</b> trapezius <b>trigger</b> points. Sixty patients, 19 – 38 years of age with non-specific neck pain and <b>upper</b> trapezius <b>trigger</b> points, were randomized into one of two, 4 week physical therapy programs. One group received muscle energy techniques while the second group received an integrated neuromuscular inhibition technique (INIT) consisting of muscle energy techniques, ischemic compression, and strain–counterstrain (SCS). Outcomes including a visual analog pain scale (VAS), the neck disability index (NDI), and lateral cervical flexion range of motion (ROM) were collected at baseline, 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of therapy. Results revealed large pre–post-effect sizes within the INIT group (Cohen’s d  =  0. 97, 0. 94 and 0. 97). Additionally, significantly greater improvements in pain and neck disability and lateral cervical flexion ROM were detected in favor of the INIT group (0. 29 – 0. 57, 0. 57 – 1. 12 and 0. 29 – 0. 57) at a 95 % CI respectively.

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Myofascial trigger {{points are}} very common and {{can become a}} painful part of most people’s life {{at one time or}} another. According to Travell and Simons (1999), active <b>upper</b> {{trapezius}} myofascial <b>trigger</b> points are common in patients presenting with neck pain. Myofascial pain syndrome is a regional muscle disorder {{that is one of the}} most common causes of persistent pain in the head, face and neck regions (Rachlin, 2002). The PAIN®GONE pen is a device that produces a high voltage, low frequency pulse for only a brief period of time. The electrical stimulation activates endorphins in the hypothalamus which plays a role in pain relief (Puskas, 2004). The technical system of the device is clinically proven and uses Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS), based on the pain gate control theory of Melzack and Wall (1965). The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of treating active <b>upper</b> trapezius <b>trigger</b> points with PAIN®GONE therapy combined with cervical spine chiropractic adjustments. This study consisted of two groups, the PAIN®GONE therapy group (Group 1) with fifteen participants and the placebo PAIN®GONE therapy group (Group 2) with fifteen participants. The participants were between the ages of 18 and 40 years of age. Prior to becoming a participant of this study, individuals were assessed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a case history, physical examination, cervical regional examination and upper trapezius muscle palpation to assess for <b>upper</b> trapezius myofascial <b>trigger</b> points. Treatment was applied to the cervical spine by Chiropractic adjustments, and to the upper active trapezius myofascial trigger points via PAIN®GONE therapy or placebo PAIN®GONE therapy, from which the subjective and objective data were based.

Prior to the initiation of treatment, each participant was requested to complete a Vernon-Mior Neck Pain and Disability Index questionnaire and Numerical Pain Rating Scale. Algometer readings were obtained for the active <b>upper</b> trapezius myofascial <b>trigger</b> points. The Cervical Range of Motion (CROM) goniometer was used to obtain numerical values for the participant’s active cervical spine ranges of motion in flexion, extension, lateral flexion androtation.

40|$|Agriculture remains {{vulnerable}} to many sources of weather related risks, especially from extreme temperature and rainfall events. The present study employs a precipitation contract in {{the lines of}} a weather derivative contract as an alternative to traditional crop insurance to combat risks due to drought in Romania. The precipitation contract is designed to trigger payments to the insured when rainfall during a period falls below a set <b>trigger</b> <b>amount.</b> The preliminary structure of the contract is designed and tested for seven judets in southeastern Romania. The impact of such contract on the risk management strategy of producers across risk preference levels is also investigated.

The study uses a combination of insurance design methods along with expected mean variance model to accomplish its objectives. Preliminary results suggest that if sufficient partnerships are forged to share risk, such contracts can prove useful in Romania.
