5|$|R. Parthiepan as Chola King, {{successor}} {{and last}} of the Chola dynasty after escaping an attack from the Pandyas. The city that the Cholas lived in perished, resulting in the city becoming haunted with Parthiepan, {{the head of the}} people. The images for the Chola King, not dated or named in the film, were kept <b>under</b> <b>wraps</b> prior to the movie's release. Parthiepan signed for the role after much speculation that Dhanush would be selected, and his performance won plaudits from critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{paramount}} chief maintained some loyalty for his subjects. He {{persuaded the}} Germans {{to carry out}} infrastructure improvements such as the building of roads, schools, health clinics, and churches; and he defended his subjects from colonial reprisals. In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable with a stiff prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to porter duty. However, the paramount chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of Duala leader Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to secure Atangana's backing for a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot <b>under</b> <b>wraps,</b> but he instructed the envoy to urge Manga Bell to reconsider.|$|E

The study naturally {{brings up the}} question on comparing two versions of wrapped Fukaya categories of the product manifold, which we prove quasi-isomorphism {{on the level of}} wrapped Floer cohomology. To prove representability of these functors constructed from Lagrangian correspondences, we introduce the geometric compositions of Lagrangian correspondences <b>under</b> <b>wrapping,</b> as new classes of objects in the wrapped Fukaya category, which we prove to represent the functors by establishing a canonical isomorphism of quilted version of <b>wrapped</b> Floer cohomology <b>under</b> geometric composition...|$|R

She was provisionally named SF99, as painted on the stern. Six weeks later she emerged again, to perform some brief trials in the waterway adjacent to the shipyard. Finally, in March, the vessel sailed north out of the Kiel Fjord, to perform her first sea trials off the coast of Rügen in the Baltic Sea.|$|E

A car-chase scene using 67 cars closed main thoroughfares (including the Brandenburg Gate) for three weeks. Each day, alternate routes were provided around roads cordoned off for filming. The shooting schedule also included a special appearance by Hrithik Roshan, whose presence was kept <b>under</b> <b>wraps</b> by filmmakers. In December 2010, the Berlin shooting ended.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Bengals' {{superior}} {{regular season}} record and Esiason's MVP award, the 49ers were heavily {{favored to win}} the Super Bowl, mainly because of Montana. Montana had already led the 49ers to two previous Super Bowls and both times left with a championship ring and Super Bowl MVP honors. Esiason was also suffering from a sore left (throwing) shoulder, although the Bengals tried to keep it <b>under</b> <b>wraps</b> and made up {{for a lack of}} big-play passing attack with a run-heavy offense led by Woods and Brooks against their first two playoff opponents, Seattle and Buffalo.|$|E
25|$|A senior Scottish police officer, James Mackay QPM, was {{appointed}} in June 2000 by the Crown Office {{to investigate the}} matter. Mackay's interim report in August 2000 suggested that the evidence given in court by the four SCRO personnel amounted to 'collective manipulation and collective collusion'. As a result, the four fingerprint officers were immediately suspended by SCRO, and Scottish ministers were informed. Mackay's final confidential report {{was presented to the}} Lord Advocate in October 2000. The report remained <b>under</b> <b>wraps</b> until extracts were published in the Scotsman newspaper in February 2006. Mackay had concluded that 'cover-up and criminality' had taken place at SCRO and recommended that the four fingerprint officers should be prosecuted. However, the Scotsman also revealed that Boyd had decided in September 2001 to take no action in response to Mackay's recommendation, and the four SCRO officers were reinstated.|$|E
25|$|In late 2013, divers {{found that}} the wreck of Perth was being {{stripped}} by Indonesian marine salvagers. Reports in September indicated that crane-equipped barges had stripped off most of the wreck's superstructure, forward turrets, and forward decking, and that explosives {{have been used to}} break the ship up for easier recovery. These actions have compromised the structural integrity of the wreck site, and have potentially exposed live munitions and oil tanks. Perths wreck is not protected as a war grave, either through the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (Australia and Indonesia are not signatories to the treaty) or through legislation in either nation. The stripping of Perths wreck was not publicly reported until December 2013; the Australian Broadcasting Corporation speculated that the government departments made aware of the issue tried to keep it <b>under</b> <b>wraps</b> to avoid further deteriorating relations between Australia and Indonesia, particularly following the Australia–Indonesia spying scandal.|$|E
5000|$|Kőbánya has had {{a socialist}} party-dominated {{municipal}} assembly since 1990. Before 2002 the mayor {{was a member of}} the Christian Republic party. At that time a socialist bureaucrat became mayor. The inefficient and in-fighting Kőbánya council has become a symbol of corruption and feud, both too common to Hungarian politics. Kőbánya recently has been drawn into a financial and political scandal, domestically known as the [...] "broker scandal" [...] and lost huge investments, pushing the district into great debts. After much political manipulation, some of this sum was recovered, when the affected bank decided to pay to keep the even nastier issues <b>under</b> <b>wrap.</b>|$|R

25|$|Rob Donovan reads {{an article}} in the {{newspaper}} about Johnny at the factory. He then requests a visit from Tracy and tells his prison cellmate that he plans for revenge on Tracy and Carla of how they disowned him and how they called the police and had him jailed. Tracy turned up to visit Rob and wondered why he had chosen to contact her after such time, however Rob confessed to being angry at first but could never stop loving her and he did not blame her for him being arrested. After Tracy's visit, Rob requested a visit from Johnny, and reveals that he is the father of Carla. He demands £10,000 from Johnny to keep it secret. Johnny told him that Tracy was with Robert Preston. Johnny does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. Rob then sent a visiting order to Robert. He told him about Tracy wanting to start a new relationship with him. Robert was disgusted and stormed out. He then split up with Tracy.

Carla is furious, however Johnny continues to plead with Carla not to tell Aidan and Kate. Carla Sleeps with Robert. She instantly regrets it, and confides in Michelle, who attempts to persuade Carla not to tell Nick. Carla continues to threaten to tell Johnny's children the truth unless he moves away, which he does not. Carla reveals that she is their half-sister to Kate and Aidan, who are distraught. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their affair to Nick if she does not let him buy into the Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit <b>under</b> <b>wraps.</b> She also begins bonding with Kate. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, but changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the bistro to confront him. Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows. However, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton), and his friend, Lee, burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase. She jumps into the car, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the car drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious. She survived and Tracy pressures her to persuade Nick to sell the Bistro. He eventually sells to Robert, and Carla and Nick make plans to move to Devon.|$|E
