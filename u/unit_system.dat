5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI <b>unit</b> <b>system</b> will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E

He was offered the presidency of the Commission for the reform of weights and measures (la Commission des Poids et Mesures) when he was preparing to escape. And after Lavoisier's death in 1794, it was largely owing to Lagrange's influence that the final choice of the <b>unit</b> <b>system</b> of metre and kilogram was settled and the decimal subdivision was finally accepted by the commission of 1799.

25|$|Shortly {{taking over}} control of the studio, Rogers {{announced}} that the <b>unit</b> <b>system</b> would remain in place, and {{that he was going to}} schedule 36 film for production for the 1936–37 production season; there would also be another eight western films starring Buck Jones, making a total of 44 films slated. The fourteen films still remaining on the Universal schedule for the 1935–36 season would also be completed as planned. This was almost a 33% increase over the prior year's production for the studio. In May Rogers was elected to Universal's Board of Directors. Roger's first production for Universal was 1936's My Man Godfrey, starring William Powell and Carole Lombard, which premiered on September 6, 1936, and was received quite favorably. The success of Godfrey, as well as several management decisions made by Rogers, led to Universal deciding to expand its 1937–38 production schedule to 52 features, including six westerns. Another accomplishment of Roger's during his tenure at Universal was the signing of teenage singer/actress Deanna Durbin. Her pictures, which usually did quite well at the box office, helped keep Universal profitable during the final years of 1930s.|$|E

Whereas Black voted with the majority under strict construction to uphold the state constitutional provision, his colleagues Douglas and Fortas dissented. According to Douglas, Georgia tradition would guarantee a Maddox victory though he had trailed Callaway by some three thousand votes {{in the general election}} returns. Douglas also saw the issue as a continuation of the earlier decision Gray v. Sanders, which had struck down Georgia's County <b>Unit</b> <b>System,</b> a kind of electoral college formerly used to choose the governor.
