25|$|Today, modern {{bookbinding}} {{is divided}} between hand binding by individual craftsmen {{working in a}} one-room studio shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high speed machines in a production line factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from {{one of a kind}} custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. A step up to the next level of mechanization is determined by economics of scale <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory employing a dozen or more workers.|$|E
500|$|While {{singing the}} lines [...] "So rock {{right up to}} the side of my {{mountain}} / Climb <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> my peak babe my peak, the peak / And reach right into the bottom of my fountain", Beyoncé uses sexual innuendos. [...] She also incorporates similar double entendres and euphemisms in the lyrics, [...] "Reach right into the bottom of my fountain / dip me under to where you can feel my river flow / Rock it till water falls". During the end of the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "You rock hard / I rock steady" [...] eventually [...] "erupting into an orgasmic finish" [...] as stated by Puja Patel of Spin. During the last part, she sings [...] "Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin / And you're comfortable in my skin". It was noted that during the end of the song, the protagonist becomes ready to be sexually subordinate and [...] "discipline" [...] as opposed to the first part where she adopted a more dominant persona; this is further exemplified in the lines [...] "Punish me, punish me please" [...] where Beyoncé uses soft vocals.|$|E

5000|$|Working in a French {{tradition}} of abjection reaching back to Baudelaire and his paradoxes - [...] "O filthy grandeur! O sublime disgrace!" [...] - Bataille was early struck {{by what he}} saw as [...] "the fact that these two complete contrasts were identical - divine ecstasy and extreme horror". He went on to challenge surrealism with a kind of anti-idealism searching for what he called the impossible by breaking rules <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>reached</b> something beyond all rules.|$|R
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} {{before he was}} executed, Bundy granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist {{and founder of the}} Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. <b>Until</b> <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E

50|$|To get a rough idea {{of where}} the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is, recall that {{the left and right}} hemispheres of the brain are {{separated}} the longitudinal cerebral fissure.

Your palm would be touching a part of the prefrontal cortex, which is in the front part of the brain and the lower part of your palm would be touching the ventral medial prefrontal cortex.|$|R

That hour struck for you nearly a year ago, and, although you heard nothing of it, this decree was debated by the Court.

2500|$|The few {{instances}} of criticism the game received were mainly {{directed at the}} repetitiveness of the levels. Turner listed this repetitiveness, specifically for the shooter stages, {{as one of the}} game's [...] "cons." [...] Harris stated that some of the levels [...] "are the absolute pits and feel completely out of place because of their slapped-together feel." [...] 1UP.com's Sam Kennedy stated that the levels are [...] "more of a formality than anything – you casually battle a set of enemies <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> a boss, which is where the real gameplay begins." ...|$|E

Last, {{it goes to the}} Wishing Well and goes to a sign where they honor veterans who come from Page County and it climbs out through a small passage where you see the [...] "Fried Eggs" [...] rock formation.

50|$|Keith {{was born}} in Hillsboro Bridge, New Hampshire. He joined the circus after {{attending}} Van Amburg's Circus and then worked at Bunnell's Museum in New York City in the early 1860s. He later joined P.T. Barnum and then joined the Forepaugh Circus, before he opened a curio museum in Boston, in 1883, with Colonel William Austin. In 1885 he joined Edward Franklin Albee II, who was selling circus tickets and operating the Boston Bijou Theatre. Their opening show was on July 6, 1885. The theatre {{was one of the}} early adopters of the continuous variety show which ran from 10:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night, every day. Previously, shows ran at fixed intervals with several hours of downtime between shows. With the continuous show, you could enter the theatre at any time, and stay <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>reached</b> the point in the show where you arrived.|$|R

We are aware that you went down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were seen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous reason to suspect you. He saw your theft, but could not give the alarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at your heels <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>reached</b> this very house. There he intervened, and then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more terrible crime of murder." ...|$|R
5000|$|Aegeus, {{one of the}} {{primordial}} kings of Athens, was childless. Desiring an heir, he asked the oracle at Delphi for advice.

[...] Aegeus {{did not understand the}} prophecy and was disappointed. He asked the advice of his host Pittheus, king of Troezen.

However, there are some returning characters from other Onimusha games such as Saika Magoichi, Ankokuji Ekei, Fūma Kotarō, and Akechi Mitsuhide. Onimaru battles the genma <b>until</b> <b>you</b> ultimately <b>reach</b> the notorious Nobunaga. New to the series are additional chosen warriors who receive the power of the phoenix, tortoise, tiger and dragon to assist Onimaru. These animals correspond with the Chinese celestial animals that represent the cardinal directions. This reference was also a puzzle in Onimusha 2.|$|R

Players are then given a period of protection (based on their server of choice) which grants them immunity from attack so they may build up their country and defences.
