Naturally, the emphasis on AN design is to provide cost-efficient implementations without degrading the agreed Quality of Service (QoS). This is reflected in both the reduction of the AN physical equipment and in the limitations imposed on the AN functionality such as the inability to interpret signaling information. The lack of connection-related information forces the establishment of several AN internal mechanisms that compensate for the effects of traffic concentration. In our attempt to generalize and extend results and experiences obtained from our involvement in the specification, design and implementation of an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) -based AN, we introduce the concept of a real-time VB interface Control Protocol (V-CP). We demonstrate the V-CP ability to serve for a number of AN internal functions while preserving the highest possible degree of transparency to the SN. The V-CP services provide for the dynamic operation of the AN by conveying all those connection-related parameters required for dynamic resource allocation, traffic policing and routing in the AN, as well as information on the status of the AN before a new connection is accepted by the SN. The V-CP operates in real time on a connection by connection basis. This is reflected in its simple design making it considerably faster than usual management protocols...|$|R
40|$|Traffic and {{congestion}} control {{are important in}} enabling ATM networks to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) required by end users. A Call Admission Control (CAC) strategy ensures that the network has sufficient resources available {{at the start of}} each call, but this does not prevent a traffic source from violating the negotiated contract. A policing strategy (User Parameter Control (UPC)) is also required to enforce the negotiated rates for a particular connection and to protect conforming <b>users</b> from <b>network</b> overload. The aim of this work is to investigate traffic policing and bandwidth management at the <b>User</b> to <b>Network</b> <b>Interface</b> (<b>UNI).</b> A policing function is proposed which is based on the leaky bucket (LB) which offers improved performance for both real time (RT) traffic such as speech and video and non-real time (non-RT) traffic, mainly data by taking into account the QoS requirements. A video cell in violation of the negotiated bit rate causes the remainder of the slice to be discarded. This 'tail clipping' provides protection for the decoder from damaged video slices. Speech cells are coded using a frequency domain coder, which places the most significant bits of a double speech sample into a high priority cell and the least significant bits into a high priority cell. In the case of congestion, the low priority cell can be discarded with little impact on the intelligibility of the received speech. However, data cells require loss-free delivery and are buffered rather than being discarded or tagged for subsequent deletion. This triple strategy is termed the super leaky bucket (SLB). Separate queues for RT and non-RT traffic, are also proposed at the multiplexer, with non pre-emptive priority service for RT traffic if the queue exceeds a predetermined threshold. If the RT queue continues to grow beyond a second threshold, then all low priority cells (mainly speech) are discarded. This scheme protects non-RT traffic from being tagged and subsequently discarded, by queueing the cells and also by throttling back non-RT sources during periods of congestion. It also prevents the RT cells from being delayed excessively in the multiplexer queue. A simulation model has been designed and implemented to test the proposal. Realistic sources have been incorporated into the model to simulate the types of traffic which could be expected on an ATM network. The results show that the S-LB outperforms the standard LB for video cells. The number of cells discarded and the resulting number of damaged video slices are significantly reduced. Dual queues with cyclic service at the multiplexer also reduce the delays experienced by RT cells. The QoS for all categories of traffic is preserved...|$|R

Javia implements a special buffer abstraction that allows Java programs to allocate arrays in pinned memory and use them as communication buffers without copy. The location and lifetime of these arrays are controlled through small modifications to the garbage collector.
