5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by the curve shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> {{independent of the}} curve. Therefore, the total time for a curve to shrink to a point is proportional to its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E

5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units {{standardized}} its <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the second, on {{the properties}} of cesium in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The cesium atomic clock, maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is accurate to 30billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and rubidium vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of rubidium clocks).|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{meaning of the}} word dimension, in Fourier's Theorie de la Chaleur, was the numerical value of the exponents of the base units. For example, acceleration was considered to have the dimension 1 with respect to the unit of length, and the dimension −2 with respect to the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> This was slightly changed by Maxwell, who said the dimensions of acceleration are LT−2, instead of just the exponents.|$|E

25|$|If p is the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> the {{quotient}} t/p {{is simply}} the number of units of time. Using the notation t for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, t/p can be replaced by t, but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by p in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.|$|E

For any fixed b not equal to 1 (e.g. e or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time τ. For any non-zero time τ the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive numbernbsp&b.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} each period is {{determined}} by the rate of change and the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor's attack and release controls are labeled as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (often milliseconds). This is the amount of time it takes for the gain to change a set amount of dB, decided by the manufacturer—often 10dB. For example, if the compressor's time constants are referenced to 10dB, and the attack time is set to 1ms, it takes 1ms for the gain to decrease by 10dB, and 2ms to decrease by 20dB.|$|E

25|$|Inductive loops can {{be placed}} in a roadbed to detect {{vehicles}} as they pass through the loop's magnetic field. The simplest detectors simply count the number of vehicles during a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (typically 60 seconds in the United States) that pass over the loop, while more sophisticated sensors estimate the speed, length, and class of vehicles and the distance between them. Loops {{can be placed}} in a single lane or across multiple lanes, and they work with very slow or stopped vehicles as well as vehicles moving at high speed.|$|E
25|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} is always positive. A negative sign is present {{to indicate that}} the reactant concentration is decreasing.) The IUPAC recommends that the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> should always be the second. The rate of reaction differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor (the reciprocal of its stoichiometric number) and for a reactant A by minus the reciprocal of the stoichiometric number. The stoichiometric numbers are included so that the defined rate is independent of which reactant or product species is chosen for measurement. For example, if a = 1 and b = 3 then B is consumed three times more rapidly than A, but v = -d/dt = -(1/3)d/dt is uniquely defined.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{fraction}} of a radioisotope's atoms decaying per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes (such as the decay chain of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each over the crust's 3 ton mass). For instance, over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by ≈ 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume, although {{the vicinity of the}} site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.|$|E
