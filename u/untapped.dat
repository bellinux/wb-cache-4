5|$|Iceland is {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to create an economy {{generated}} through industries fueled by renewable energy, and there is still a large amount of <b>untapped</b> hydroelectric energy in Iceland. In 2002 it was estimated that Iceland only generated 17% of the total harnessable hydroelectric energy in the country. Iceland’s government believes another 30 TWh of hydropower every year could be produced, whilst taking into account the sources that must remain <b>untapped</b> for environmental reasons.|$|E
5|$|The shale {{contains}} largely <b>untapped</b> {{natural gas}} reserves, and {{its proximity to}} the high-demand markets along the East Coast of the United States makes it an attractive target for energy development and export.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is mined as {{chromite}} (FeCr2O4) ore. About two-fifths of the chromite ores and concentrates in {{the world}} are produced in South Africa, while Kazakhstan, India, Russia, and Turkey are also substantial producers. <b>Untapped</b> chromite deposits are plentiful, but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Economically {{important}} {{sources of}} boron are the minerals colemanite, rasorite (kernite), ulexite and tincal. Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still <b>untapped,</b> are in Central and Western Turkey, including {{the provinces of}} Eskişehir, Kütahya and Balıkesir. Global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes, against a yearly production of about four million tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Huntington {{knew the}} {{railroad}} could transport coal eastbound from West Virginia's <b>untapped</b> natural resources. His agents began acquiring land in Warwick County in 1865. In the 1880s, he oversaw {{extension of the}} C's new Peninsula Subdivision, which extended from the Church Hill Tunnel in Richmond southeast down the peninsula through Williamsburg to Newport News, where the company developed coal piers on the harbor of Hampton Roads.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, {{after the}} Scopes and Dennett victories, Baldwin {{perceived}} {{that there was}} vast, <b>untapped</b> support for civil liberties in the United States. Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, African American rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties. The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the international efforts.|$|E
5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast <b>untapped</b> silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{volcanic}} {{nature of the}} islands, mineral deposits are abundant. The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa {{and one of the}} largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite, and zinc. Despite this, poor management, high population density, and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely <b>untapped.</b> Geothermal energy is a product of volcanic activity that the Philippines has harnessed more successfully. The Philippines is the world's second-biggest geothermal producer behind the United States, with 18% of the country's electricity needs being met by geothermal power.|$|E
5|$|Huntington {{was also}} {{aware of the}} {{potential}} to ship eastbound coal from West Virginia's <b>untapped</b> natural resources with {{the completion of the}} new railroad. His agents began acquiring property in Warwick County in eastern Virginia. In the 1880s, he oversaw the extension of the C's new Peninsula Subdivision, which extended from the Church Hill Tunnel in Richmond southeast down the peninsula through Williamsburg to Newport News, where the company developed coal piers on the harbors of Hampton Roads and Newport News.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account {{presented}} as a parody of the game designer Peter Molyneux. Created by game artist Adam Capone in 2009, it posts audacious game design ideas {{in the style of}} Molyneux. The account presents Molyneux as a tragicomic character with unrelenting, creative ideas that are continually received by an apathetic audience. Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a list of potential game concepts. A common theme of the tweets is the <b>untapped</b> potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came to appreciate the parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E
5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large <b>untapped</b> labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{was formed}} {{approximately}} 4.5billion years ago. As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were <b>untapped</b> sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing and oxidizing gasses that {{set the stage for}} primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left <b>untapped,</b> it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E

25|$|Thaksin's most {{effective}} policies were reducing rural {{poverty and the}} introduction of universal healthcare, allowing him to galvanise the vast and largely <b>untapped</b> support base of the rural poor, especially in the populous northeast.|$|E
25|$|Granada Television was {{considered}} bolder than other franchisees and the BBC, and placed great emphasis displaying the northern style which distinguished it from them. Bernstein believed the north had <b>untapped</b> creative energy that needed cultivation.|$|E
25|$|However, several {{challenges}} remain. Chief {{among them}} are the still very low level of access in rural areas and the <b>untapped</b> potential of some renewable energies, in particular wind and solar energy, due to an inadequate regulatory framework.|$|E
25|$|According to the Central Bank of Somalia, as {{the nation}} embarks {{on the path of}} reconstruction, the economy is {{expected}} to not only match its pre-civil war levels, but also to accelerate in growth and development due to Somalia's <b>untapped</b> natural resources.|$|E
25|$|Argentina's {{hydroelectric}} {{potential is}} being exploited only partially. While the identified potential is 170,000 GW·h/year, in 2006 hydroelectric production amounted just to 42,360 GW·h. There are also <b>untapped</b> mini-hydropower resources, whose potential {{is estimated at}} 1.81% of overall electricity production (in contrast with its current 0.88%).|$|E
25|$|In Honduras, {{there is}} great {{potential}} of <b>untapped</b> indigenous renewable energy resources. Due to the likely long-term trend of high oil prices, such resources could be developed at competitive prices. However, except for the large hydro projects, {{the potential for the}} development of renewable energy is yet to be explored.|$|E
25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Argentina constitutes {{the third largest}} power market in Latin America. It relies mostly on thermal generation (60% of installed capacity) and hydropower generation (36%). The country still has a large <b>untapped</b> hydroelectric potential. The prevailing natural gas-fired thermal generation is at risk due to the uncertainty about future gas supply.|$|E
25|$|The Underwater Archaeology Branch, as the Department of the Navy's sole {{expertise}} on underwater cultural heritage, envisions the Navy's sunken {{ship and}} aircraft {{as a unique}} resource for interpreting the Navy's history and traditions through the science of underwater archaeology. The Navy's sunken military craft represent a non-renewable, fragile, and <b>untapped</b> repository for science, technology, and history.|$|E
25|$|That summer, Ford {{took part}} in a Chautauqua, another venue {{previously}} <b>untapped,</b> and rather farther afield, out of Lincoln, Nebraska. About a month later she gave a talk on culinary choices for the heat of the summer in Chicago, and then a talk at a recital. Then she assists with an exhibition from artists in the public school system.|$|E
25|$|Gold mining is more {{recently}} a fast-growing industry with vast <b>untapped</b> gold {{reserves in the}} Eastern Desert. To develop this nascent sector the Egyptian government took a first step by awarding mineral concessions, in what was considered the first international bid round. Two miners who have produced encouraging technical results include AngloGold Ashanti and Alexander Nubia International.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} actions {{take place at}} the beginning of combat step. This step mainly exists to allow players to cast spells and activate abilities that may alter how combat progresses. As the most common example, only <b>untapped</b> creatures may attack, so the defending player may cast instants or activate abilities that will tap a creature, preventing it from attacking.|$|E
25|$|Arunachal Pradesh {{accounts}} for a large percentage share of India's <b>untapped</b> hydroelectric potential. In 2008, the government of Arunachal Pradesh signed numerous memorandum of understanding with various companies planning some 42 hydroelectric schemes that will produce electricity in excess of 27,000 MW. Construction of the Upper Siang Hydroelectric Project, {{which is expected to}} generate between 10,000 and 12,000 MW, began in April 2009.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have {{recently}} begun to explore acid mine drainage and mine reclamation sites for unique soil bacteria capable of producing new pharmaceutical leads. Soil microbes have long been a source for effective drugs and new research, such as that conducted at the Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation, suggests these extreme environments to be an <b>untapped</b> source for new discovery.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1890s, William N. Page, a civil {{engineer}} who had previously worked building the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C) had a dream. He knew of rich <b>untapped</b> bituminous coal fields lying between the New River Valley and the lower Guyandotte River in southern West Virginia in an area not yet reached by the C and its major competitor, the Norfolk and Western Railway (N).|$|E
25|$|By 1768, {{the rapid}} growth of Glasgow had vastly {{increased}} the demand for coal, and its price: several bodies expressed concern, and the magistrates of Glasgow took action. The Lord Provost was James Buchanan of Drumpellier, and the rich Monklands coalfield was practically <b>untapped.</b> Canals were being promoted all over the country, and seemed to be the obvious solution here; the magistrates commissioned James Watt to recommend a route.|$|E
25|$|Alaska {{contains}} {{some of the}} most dramatic and <b>untapped</b> scenery in the country. Tall, prominent mountain ranges rise up sharply from broad, flat tundra plains. On the islands off the south and southwest coast are many volcanoes. Hawaii, far to the south of Alaska in the Pacific Ocean, is a chain of tropical, volcanic islands, popular as a tourist destination for many from East Asia and the mainland United States.|$|E
25|$|Brazil has an <b>untapped</b> {{hydropower}} {{potential of}} 180,000 MW, including about 80,000 MW in protected regions {{for which there}} are no development plans. The government expects to develop the rest by 2030. Most new hydropower plants are run-of-river plants that are less damaging to the environment, because their reservoirs are small. However, they are more vulnerable to droughts and less efficient, because only a fraction of their capacity can be used during the dry season.|$|E
25|$|Lithuanian achievements, {{particularly}} Lithuania's {{achievements in}} biochemistry and the biosciences have attracted Israeli entrepreneurs and investors {{to invest in}} Lithuania's science and technology sector and Lithuania is enthusiastic in combining Israel's knack for unlocked <b>untapped</b> entrepreneurial and intellectual potential combined with Lithuania's strong science and technology research base and talented workforce. Both nations have concluded an agreement on cooperation in industrial research and experimental development as further cooperation within venture capital to fund joint research projects remains underway.|$|E
25|$|Atienza’s {{urban renewal}} {{programs}} also faced certain controversies {{when he decided}} to build a new campus for the Universidad de Manila, (formerly called City College of Manila) on the historical Mehan Gardens. Environmentalists and historians were opposed to the project stating that Mehan Gardens should remain as an open space, {{one of the few remaining}} open spaces in the City of Manila and for historical reasons, with the gardens an <b>untapped</b> archaeological resource that dates back to the time of the Spanish colonial era.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, a {{large share}} of Iran's natural gas {{reserves}} were <b>untapped.</b> The addition of new hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts. Of that amount, about 75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power. In 2004, Iran opened its first wind-powered and geothermal plants, and the first solar thermal plant was to come online in 2009. Iran is the world's third country to have developed GTL technology.|$|E
25|$|Nagaland {{has a high}} {{literacy}} rate of 80.1 per cent. The {{majority of the population}} in the state speaks English, which is the official language of the state. The state offers technical and medical education. Nevertheless, agriculture and forestry contribute majority of Nagaland's Gross Domestic Product. The state is rich in mineral resources such as coal, limestone, iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, and marble. Nagaland has a recoverable reserve of limestone of 1,000 million tonnes plus a large <b>untapped</b> resource of marble and handicraft stone.|$|E
