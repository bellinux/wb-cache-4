40|$|The {{temperature}} and humidity of expired air from three adult Merino sheep were measured at air temperatures of 20, 30 and 40 degrees C {{before and after the}} animals were shorn. Expired air was apparently always saturated with water vapour. At the higher air temperatures the temperature of expired air was close to deep body temperature; at lower air temperatures, expired air had been significantly cooled, e. g. to 32. 3 degrees C in shorn sheep at 20 degrees C air temperature. Expired air was cooler from shorn than from unshorn animals at 20 and 30 degrees C air temperature, possibly due to thermally induced vasomotor changes in the upper respiratory tract. Cooling of expired air would be expected to lead to recovery of some of the water evaporated during inspiration; at 20 degrees C air temperature, this fraction was estimated to be 25 % in <b>unshorn</b> <b>sheep</b> and 36 % in shorn sheep...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between {{environment and the}} water intake and output of young Merino sheep living in the hot dry tropics on lat. 21 ° S. has been studied for 3 years. The tip wool of sheep standing in the sun heats to 189 °F by absorption of radiant energy, most of which is re-radiated. Wool, especially when {{it is more than}} 3 cm long, assists in protecting sheep from radiant energy. The respiratory rates of sheep shorn during summer were more than twice those of <b>unshorn</b> <b>sheep</b> standing in the sun. On the open plains summer shearing appears to add to the thermal strain. Acclimatizing sheep respired more rapidly in the sun than tropical sheep. Evaporative cooling, by panting, increases water demand, and in summer Merinos drank on the average 12 times as much water as in winter, when they took 7. 3 ml/kg/day. Water intake is related closely to respiratory rate. Urine output was lower in summer than in winter...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} with the main objectives of studying: 1. {{the extent to which}} the voluntary food intakes of sheep receiving diets, differing in physical form and digestible energy concentration, change with an increase in energy demand of the sheep 2. the effect of differences in body condition and an increase in energy demand on the voluntary food intake of sheep 3. the effect of an increase in the energy demand of sheep on measurements such as the retention time of food residues, alimentary tract fill and weight of alimentary organs 4. the extent to which increases in the energy intake of sheep equate with increases in energy demand. The increase in energy demand was achieved by shearing Romney sheep, held at an ambient temperature of 13 °C. A section of the work also compared the retention times of food residues using various diets stained with safranine, treated with radiocerium 144 (Ce), or potassium permanganate (Mn). There were considerable differences in mean retention times depending on the method used. Because the variation in mean retention time was lower within and between sheep for 144 Ce than for the other methods, and because retention times could be determined rapidly with 144 Ce, the decision was made to use it in subsequent experiments. Following shearing, there was a consistent increase in the voluntary intakes of sheep receiving chopped hay or ground hay of low digestible energy concentration. The increase in voluntary intake, with the exception of that for a hay of low protein content in one experiment, to a considerable extent met the increased energy expenditure when the sheep were shorn. An increase in the amount of dry matter in the reticulorumen and a decrease in mean retention time was observed with sheep receiving chopped hay and ground hay. Evidence was also obtained of hypertrophy of the gut, measured as an increase in weight of the empty alimentary organs, when sheep receiving chopped hay or ground hay were shorn. No evidence was obtained of cause and effect, but it appeared that increases in intake were accomplished through a range of physical changes. Evidence was also obtained that reticulorimen fill, in terms of the amount of dry matter, was unimportant in limiting the intake of chopped hay. Following shearing, the increase in the voluntary intake of sheep receiving ground hay was greater than that of sheep receiving chopped hay. The increase in the intake of sheep receiving ground hay more than met the increase in energy expenditure following shearing. The result is consistent with the postulation that the rate of removal of dry matter from the reticulorumen imposed a limitation on the voluntary intake of sheep receiving chopped hay. This observation was further supported by the greater amount of dry matter caudal to the reticulorumen, with the shorn sheep receiving ground hay, than that of the <b>unshorn</b> <b>sheep.</b> Voluntary intakes were invariably higher with sheep receiving foods of high digestible energy concentration, than with those receiving foods of low concentration, but the response in terms of changes in voluntary intake following shearing were variable. In some of the experiments, increases in the voluntary intakes of sheep receiving dried grass were small, after shearing. However in an experiment which compared the effects of body condition, and of shearing on voluntary intake, fat sheep increased their energy intake of dried grass following shearing to about the same extent as the increase in energy expenditure. In the same experiment, the greatest increase in intake following shearing occurred with the thin sheep, and it appeared that the effects of shearing, in increasing voluntary intake, were reinforced by the condition of thinness. The voluntary intakes of <b>unshorn</b> <b>sheep</b> receiving dried grass decreased as the experiments progressed. Physical restriction of the abdominal cavity by fat did net appear to be the cause of the decrease. Measurements of oxygen consumption in two experiments (values converted to heat production) were obtained before and after shearing, with Romney wethers receiving dried grass or ground hay. Heat production increased after shearing, the increase being greater for the sheep receiving dried grass than for those receiving ground hay. The evidence obtained showed that, particularly with sheep receiving hay in the intake experiments, the increase in intake following shearing would have met the increase in energy expenditure in many cases. Changes in feeding behaviour and activity of the sheep occurred following shearing. The effects of these changes on energy expenditure were discussed. It was concluded that, even where voluntary intake is predominantly limited by physical factors, these can be overriden by changes in energy demand...|$|E
50|$|Similar effects {{apply to}} animals, with fur acting as {{additional}} factor for both increased particle retention and partial skin shielding. <b>Unshorn</b> thickly wooled <b>sheep</b> are well protected; while the epilation threshold for sheared sheep is between 23-47 Gy (2500-5000 rep) and the threshold for normally wooled face is 47-93 Gy (5000-10000 rep), for thickly wooled (33 mm hair length) sheep it is 93-140 Gy (10000-15000 rep). To produce skin lesions comparable with contagious pustular dermatitis, the estimated dose is between 465-1395 Gy.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of severe extreme thermal stress on the respiratory rate (panting) of unsheared and sheared rams in standing and lying position, and to analyse two temperature-humidity indices (THIs). Six mature Australian Merino rams from Northern Patagonia, three unshorn and three shorn, were subjected to 40 hours (8 hours each day for five days) of gradual increase in temperature from 25 °C to 40 °C, guaranteeing 4 h daily at 40 °C in a heat chamber. Respiratory rate (RR) was registered continuously by counting flank movements, and the ambient air temperature and relative humidity were recorded every five minutes inside the heat chamber. From 1413 RR measurements, descriptive and modelling analyses were performed. Panting as a response variable was distributed into five categories, and fixed effects such as THI, wool (unshorn/shorn), and position (standing/lying) were considered. No significant differences were observed between the panting score in the unshorn (standing or lying) and standing (<b>unshorn</b> or shorn) <b>sheep,</b> but significant differences were observed in shorn and lying rams. The explanations could be that heat production from muscle activity was lower and the transfer and heat lost by conduction to the floor was easier in the rams with shorter fleece (at least 0. 7 inches long). However, in the unshorn rams, their wool acted as an insulator, both with air as well as the floor. Australian Merino rams from Northern Patagonia are heat tolerant to an environment between 31. 5 °C and 42 °C, and 32 % to 48 % humidity for 40 hours over five days. The rams were in the first phase of panting, and the normal rectal temperatures registered daily when leaving the heat chamber confirmed that regulation of body temperature was possible. The LPHSI’s THI was adjusted to improve the analysis of the RR more than the National Research Council’s THI...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the variation of the temperature after shearing in sheep under dry and hot environment conditions and to compare the temperature changes with variation in cardiac and respiratory frequencies, ruminal movements and hydration status. Twenty Suffolk unshorn ewes were studied. Physical examination was performed in all animals three times a day at 7 : 00 AM, 1 : 00 PM and 7 : 00 PM, during 42 days (22 days before shearing and 20 days after shearing). The skin temperature was measured by infrared thermometer over several surfaces of the body. Data were submitted to analysis of variance, for comparisons between groups (shorn versus unshorn) at each time, and the significant difference was evaluated at level of P< 0. 05 by Tukey test. The respiratory frequency was statistically significant at all times. When air humidity was high, the respiratory frequencies were low. The thermal stress was clear in sheep of this study, reflecting marked changes in cardiac and respiratory frequencies and rectal temperature. The respiratory frequency was the parameter more reliable to establish a framework of thermal stress in the <b>unshorn</b> <b>sheep,</b> with values on average three times higher than those reported in the literature. The heart rate monitors the thermal variation of the environment and is also an indicator of heat stress. This variation shows the Suffolk breed is well adapted to hot climates. The correlation between the body surface temperatures with environment temperature and air humidity was negative, as explained by the effect of wool insulation, i. e. even with an increase in environment temperature and humidity, the body temperature tends to maintain a compensating balance. In the shorn animals, the correlation between skin temperature with environment temperature and air humidity showed that the skin temperature increases when the environment temperature increases. The increase in the environment temperature does not affect the body temperature of unshorn animals due the insulating effect of the wool. However, when environment temperature rises, the presence of the wool starts to affect the thermal comfort as the heat absorption is larger than the capacity of heat loss. In this study, the best thermal stress indicators were the respiratory frequency and rectal and skin temperatures. The temperatures of the skin measured at the perineum, axillae and inner thigh were considered the most reliable...|$|E
