5|$|Born in Wigan, Lancashire, {{he was the}} son of George Formby Sr, {{from whom}} he later took his stage name. After an early career as a stable boy and jockey, Formby took to the music hall stage after the early death of his father in 1921. His early {{performances}} were taken exclusively from his father's act, including the same songs, jokes and characters. In 1923 he made two career-changing decisions – he purchased a <b>ukulele,</b> and married Beryl Ingham, a fellow performer who became his manager and transformed his act. She insisted that he appear on stage formally dressed, and introduced the <b>ukulele</b> to his performance. He started his recording career in 1926 and, from 1934, he increasingly worked in film to develop into a major star by the late 1930s and 1940s, and became the UK's most popular entertainer during those decades. The media historian Brian McFarlane writes that on film, Formby portrayed gormless Lancastrian innocents who would win through against some form of villainy, gaining the affection of an attractive middle-class girl in the process.|$|E
5|$|George Formby, OBE (born George Hoy Booth; 26 May 1904– 6 March 1961), was an English actor, singer-songwriter and comedian {{who became}} known to a {{worldwide}} audience through his {{films of the}} 1930s and 1940s. On stage, screen and record he sang light, comical songs, usually playing the <b>ukulele</b> or banjolele, and became the UK's highest-paid entertainer.|$|E
5|$|As the Second World War progressed, Sellers {{continued}} {{to develop his}} drumming skills, and played {{with a series of}} touring bands, including those of Oscar Rabin, Henry Hall and Waldini, as well as his father's quartet, before he left and joined a band from Blackpool. Sellers {{became a member of the}} Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war. Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of George Formby, with Sellers accompanying his own singing on <b>ukulele.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dave Guard and Bob Shane {{had been}} friends since junior high school at the Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii where both had learned to play <b>ukulele</b> in {{required}} music classes. They had developed an interest in and admiration for native Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. While in Punahou's secondary school, Shane taught first himself and then Guard the rudiments of the six-string guitar, and the two began performing at parties and in school shows doing {{an eclectic mix of}} Tahitian, Hawaiian, and calypso songs.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward William Purvis (July 4, 1857 – August 16, 1888) was a British {{army officer}} and settler of the Kingdom of Hawaii {{who served as}} Vice-Chamberlain {{during the reign of}} King Kalākaua. After resigning from the royal household, Purvis {{published}} two political satires aimed at undermining the image of the king and his prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, who had been responsible for the removal of Purvis' superior. These actions and other factors led to the demise of the Gibson regime and the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Purvis died in the following year, after going to the United States to seek medical attention for his health. According to popular legend, he was an expert player of the Portuguese machete or cavaquinho and was believed to be the inspiration for the name of the Hawaiian <b>ukulele.</b>|$|E
5|$|Country {{music is}} {{primarily}} a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with Appalachian folk music, adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s. The origins of country are in rural Southern folk music, which was primarily Irish and British, with African and continental European musics. Anglo-Celtic tunes, dance music, and balladry were the earliest predecessors of modern country, then known as hillbilly music. Early hillbilly also borrowed elements of the blues and drew upon more aspects of 19th-century pop songs as hillbilly music evolved into a commercial genre eventually known as country and western and then simply country. The earliest country instrumentation revolved around the European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar later added. String instruments like the <b>ukulele</b> and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian musical groups in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|During the Spanish era Rondalya music, where {{traditional}} string orchestra mandolin type {{instruments were}} used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to {{any group of}} stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the <b>Ukulele,</b> the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|In late 1917 Dyer faced Tommy Robson {{again in}} two {{encounters}} in Massachusetts. The first, fought in Boston, was a disputed result after the bout went the distance, {{though it is}} recorded as a win for Robson. The second match, at Cuddy's Arena in Lawrence, {{was intended to be}} between Robson and Ted Lewis, but when Lewis could not fight, Dyer stepped in. This second bout also ended in a newspaper decision for Robson. Despite fighting for twelve rounds against Robson, Dyer entertained the crowd after the fight by playing his <b>ukulele</b> and singing popular songs. As in Australia, Dyer continued to appear at charity events in aid of the war effort. In January 1918 he appeared as part of a fundraiser for the basketball team The Newark Elks, who had several players fighting in Europe. Headlining the bill was world boxing champion Benny Leonard.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Morenz {{became an}} {{apprentice}} with the Canadian National Railways (CNR) factory in Stratford. When not playing hockey, Morenz bet avidly on horse races and played the <b>ukulele.</b> In 1926 he married Mary McKay; together, they had three children: Howie Jr. in 1927 (d. 2015), Donald in 1933 (died 1939), and Marlene in 1934. Marlene later married Bernie Geoffrion, who played for both the Canadiens and Rangers from 1950 to 1968. Their son, Morenz's grandson Dan, played for the Canadiens in 1979-80. Dan's son, Blake, played with the University of Wisconsin and won the Hobey Baker Award as best collegiate player in 2010. Selected in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators, he made his debut with the Predators in 2011, becoming the first fourth-generation NHL player. Blake was traded to Montreal in 2012, meaning that all four generations of the Morenz-Geoffrion family have played within the Canadiens organization.|$|E
5|$|Terry-Thomas {{made his}} {{professional}} stage début on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric Railwayman's Dining Club in South Kensington. He {{was billed as}} Thos Stevens, but only appeared as a minor turn. His performance brought heckles from the drunken audience, but earned him a commission of 30shillings. After this, he played a few minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions by the Edgware Operatic Society at the Scala Theatre. In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became travelling salesman of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing {{in order to make}} his pitch. In his spare time, he began playing the <b>ukulele</b> with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs. He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of Jessie Matthews. The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues, and they earned well from it. News soon travelled of the couple's talent, and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in Cricklewood. He found the dance-style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment.|$|E
25|$|Breen {{issued the}} first {{recorded}} <b>ukulele</b> lesson, a 78 rpm record entitled <b>Ukulele</b> Lesson {{that came with}} the Peter Pan Uke Method book, that gave a 6-minute <b>ukulele</b> tutorial on the Victor Label. Building on the popularity of the instrument as promoted by Arthur Godfrey Breen published the New <b>Ukulele</b> Method in 1950.|$|E
25|$|Palmer {{began using}} the <b>ukulele</b> during a concert as a goof, but soon {{it became a}} regular part of her repertoire. Later, she {{recorded}} a full album with <b>ukulele</b> accompaniment: Amanda Palmer Performs the Popular Hits of Radiohead on Her Magical <b>Ukulele.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shimabukuro plays a {{custom-made}} 4 string tenor <b>ukulele</b> from Kamaka <b>Ukulele.</b> Early in {{his career}} he experimented {{with the use of}} effect pedals, but {{for the last eight years}} has relied on the natural sounds of the <b>ukulele</b> and avoided sound manipulation. For his Grand <b>Ukulele</b> Tour, he has added the use of a couple of effects pedals to his show. One of them is used to take a sound sample that he loops and accompanies.|$|E
25|$|Shimabukuro's 2012 album, Grand <b>Ukulele,</b> was {{produced}} by music producer/engineer Alan Parsons, at Parsons' request. It features a 29-piece orchestra and a rhythm section, with the <b>ukulele</b> soloing, and was recorded live with no over-dubbing. The album has reached #2 in Billboards Top World Music Albums.|$|E
25|$|Shimabukuro's {{mother gave}} him a <b>ukulele</b> at age four and he quickly took an {{interest}} in the instrument, playing it many hours a day. His mother, an accomplished <b>ukulele</b> player and singer, was his first teacher, and he also took lessons for seven years under Tami Akiyami at Roy Sakuma Studios.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ukulele</b> can {{be played}} with simple or {{elaborate}} strums, as well as fingerpicking.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ukulele</b> {{is mostly}} {{recognized}} as being Hawaiian, {{even though it}} is originally based on the Madeiran machete.|$|E
25|$|Breen is {{credited}} with convincing publishers to include <b>ukulele</b> chords on their sheet music. The Tin Pan Alley publishers hired her to arrange the chords and her name {{can be found on}} hundreds of examples of music from the 1920s on. Her name appears as a music arranger on more pieces than any other individual. Her earliest known credit for a <b>ukulele</b> arrangement was in 1917 but her arrangements began to appear in large numbers in 1923.|$|E
25|$|Koa wood {{is one of}} {{the more}} higher quality woods which creates a deep and also clear sound for the <b>ukulele.</b> This makes Koa ukuleles very {{distinguishable}} by sound. Because of this, koa wood is known as a revered wood to create an <b>ukulele.</b> Not only are koa ukuleles distinguishable by sound, but also by looks. They have a very unique grain pattern and color that allows them to stand out more than the average wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} tuning is C–G–B–D (from lower to higher pitches); other tunings include D–A–B–E (Portuguese ancient tuning, made popular by Júlio Pereira) and G–G–B–D and A–A–C–E. Guitarists often use D–G–B–E tuning {{to emulate the}} highest four strings of the guitar (also the same tuning as the {{baritone}} <b>ukulele).</b> The G–C–E–A tuning is sometimes used to emulate the soprano/tenor <b>ukulele,</b> an instrument developed from the braguinha and rajão, brought to Hawaii by Portuguese immigrants, from Madeira Island, in the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Other tunings used in {{recordings}} {{include a}} root position G chord, and root position F chord, {{and even the}} standard <b>ukulele</b> tuning of G-C-E-A.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{dramatic}} dance motivated by the sea. It tells the sea adventures of the first navigators in its songs accompanied by guitar and <b>ukulele.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jake Shimabukuro's 2011 {{solo album}} Peace Love <b>Ukulele</b> {{includes}} a song titled Go For Broke {{inspired by the}} World War II all-Japanese American 442nd US Army unit.|$|E
25|$|In the United States (especially Hawaii), it was {{introduced}} by Portuguese and became {{an important part of}} the popular music of that place. The Hawaiian islands have an instrument very similar to the cavaquinho, called the <b>ukulele,</b> which is based on the machete or braguinha (variation on the cavaquinho), brought to the islands by Portuguese immigrants. The Hawaiian <b>ukulele</b> also has four strings, though tuned differently (usually G–C–E–A), and a shape somewhat similar to the cavaquinho. The machete {{was introduced}} into Hawaii by Augusto Dias, Manuel Nunes, and João Fernandes in 1879.|$|E
25|$|During {{their time}} based at Grand Coulee, the 4-year-old Lawney became a {{reasonably}} competent {{player of the}} <b>ukulele.</b> He and 2-year-old sister Luana toured for a brief spell with their father on the Eastern Washington vaudeville circuit performing Hawaiian music.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Vedder {{married his}} {{longtime}} girlfriend, musician Beth Liebling. The couple divorced in 2000. Vedder's music style transformed around this same period with more focus on <b>ukulele</b> and deeper lyrics. Vedder married his longtime girlfriend, model Jill McCormick, on September 18, 2010. They have two daughters.|$|E
25|$|Many folk punk bands also {{feature the}} mandolin. One such band is Days N' Daze, who {{make use of}} the mandolin, banjo, <b>ukulele,</b> as well as several other {{acoustic}} plucked string instruments. Other folk punk acts include Blackbird Raum, and Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} scratch band ensemble varied, {{but always}} used a percussive instrument, either the squash, tambourine, or a local form of double-headed barrel drum {{similar to the}} Dominican tambora, {{as well as an}} accordion, cane flute or violin as a melodic instrument. String instruments were also common, including the banjo, <b>ukulele</b> or a six-string guitar. The ass pipe, made out of a car exhaust tube, often provided the bass, and was played similar to the tuba. Since about the 1980s, the instrumentation for scratch bands became more rigid. The alto saxophone became the most common melodic instrument, replaced sometimes by a silver flute. Conga drums, squash, electric guitar or bass guitar, and a steel (a triangle). Banjo or <b>ukulele,</b> keyboard and additional saxophones or other melodic instruments are more rarely found in modern bands.|$|E
25|$|Shimabukuro {{decided to}} pursue a solo career as Colón disbanded in early 2002. With {{the help of his}} newly {{acquired}} manager, Japanese native Kazusa Flanagan, in June 2002 he became the first Hawaii artist to sign a recording contract with Epic Records International, a division of Sony Music Japan International. Shimabukuro toured extensively in Japan – a practice he still continues – and from the start his albums received extensive airplay on various Japanese radio stations. He has also released numerous Japan-only CDs: Skyline (2002), Haruyo Koi (2007), Yeah (2008), Ichigo Ichie (2008), Annon (2009), The Music of Sideways (2009), Across the Universe (2009), Aloha To You (2011), <b>Ukulele</b> X: 10th Anniversary Collection (2011), <b>Ukulele</b> Disney (2012).

25|$|He is also {{involved}} in making music and contributes to albums by other artists. In 2007, Vedder released his first solo album as a soundtrack for the film Into the Wild (2007). His second album <b>Ukulele</b> Songs and a live DVD titled Water on the Road were released in 2011.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Shimabukuro {{secured a}} {{nationwide}} U.S. distribution deal for his Hitchhike Records label, which {{had previously been}} confined to the Hawaii market. In 2005 he also did his first nationwide mainland U.S. concert tour, and released a DVD of instructional segments, concert footage, and interviews called Play Loud <b>Ukulele.</b>|$|E
25|$|During these years, Shane (the phonetic {{spelling}} {{he has used}} since 1957) taught himself to play first <b>ukulele</b> and then guitar, influenced especially by Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. It was also during these years that Shane met Punahou classmate Dave Guard and began performing with him at parties and school variety shows.|$|E
25|$|Three weeks later, in May 1961, the Millington family {{departed}} from the Philippines for the United States on the SS President Cleveland. While on board ship, Millington switched from playing the <b>ukulele</b> to acoustic guitar. On June 22, 1961, the Millington family arrived in the USA, and then settled at 2571 Portola Way, Sacramento, California.|$|E
