5|$|Wood Badge was {{introduced}} to America by Baden-Powell and the first course was held in 1936 at the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation, the Boy Scouts of America national training center until 1979. Despite this early first course, Wood Badge was not formally adopted in the United States until 1948 {{under the guidance of}} Bill Hillcourt who became national Deputy Camp Chief of the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Today</b> the national training center of the Boy Scouts of America is the Philmont Training Center, which hosts a few camps each year. Nearly all Wood Badge courses are held throughout the country at local council camps under the auspices of each BSA region.|$|E
5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Today,</b> historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E

25|$|The American Quarter Horse, or Quarter Horse, is an American {{breed of}} horse that excels at sprinting short distances.

The American Quarter Horse {{is the most popular}} breed in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today,</b> and the American Quarter Horse Association is the largest breed {{registry}} in the world, with almost 3 million living American Quarter Horses registered in 2014.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, Amrum {{still had}} a {{considerably}} lower population than today. Church records from 1821 to 1833 show an average population of 587, a census in 1860 noted 642 inhabitants, and in 1871, the population had dropped to 571. Among other factors, the decrease owed {{to the fact that}} large parts of Amrum's population had emigrated — mainly to the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Today,</b> more people with ancestors from Amrum live in the United States than there are on Amrum proper, and the connections between Amrum and the U.S. are still being cultivated.|$|E

25|$|Fifteen {{years after}} he had arrived in Pittsburgh, Father Hehir became {{president}} of the Pittsburgh Catholic College, succeeding Father John Murphy on August 20, 1899. His first move was to reorganize the College, creating a clearly defined College Division (akin to the four-year college track common in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today),</b> as distinct from the Preparatory School, as well as taking steps to reconcile ethnic tensions between the Irish administration of the College and the German Catholic community in Pittsburgh. He also reconciled the college debt by 1900.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{difference}} between the European races or subspecies of bees kept by beekeepers and the African stock is attributable to both selective breeding and natural selection. By selecting only the most gentle, non-defensive races, beekeepers have, over centuries, eliminated the more defensive races and created a number of subspecies suitable for apiculture. The most common race used in Europe and the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today</b> is the Italian bee, Apis mellifera ligustica, which {{has been used for}} over a thousand years {{in some parts of the}} world and in the Americas since the arrival of the European colonists.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{containerization}} {{and other}} advances in shipping were impeded by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), {{which was created}} in 1887 to keep railroads from using monopolist pricing and rate discrimination but fell victim to regulatory capture. By the 1960s, ICC approval was required before any shipper could carry different items in the same vehicle or change rates. The fully integrated systems in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today</b> became possible only after the ICC's regulatory oversight was cut back (and abolished in 1995); trucking and rail were deregulated in the 1970s and maritime rates were deregulated in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Alvin M. Weinberg {{pioneered the}} use of the MSR at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At ORNL, two {{prototype}} molten salt reactors were successfully designed, constructed and operated. These were the Aircraft Reactor Experiment in 1954 and Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment from 1965 to 1969. Both test reactors used liquid fluoride fuel salts. The MSRE notably demonstrated fueling with U-233 and U-235 during separate test runs. Weinberg was removed from his post and the MSR program closed down in the early 1970s, after which research stagnated in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Today,</b> the ARE and the MSRE remain the only molten salt reactors ever operated.|$|E
