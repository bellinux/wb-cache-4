40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{encourage}} legislators, practitioners, academics, and others concerned with this issue to reflect on this fundamental question before making a commitment to any specific set of standards: What general conception of the mediation process and the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> should govern that set of standards? Specifically, I challenge the reader to resist adopting what seem to be the two currently prevailing conceptions of the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role.</b> I argue instead for a conception based on traditional mediation theory and practice, and implied in recent state legislation. Part II of this article identifies two current conceptions of the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role.</b> While both are popular among their respective constituencies, both are fundamentally flawed. According to the first, the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> is to facilitate agreements in as many cases as possible, thus obviating the need for trial in court. According to the second, the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> is to ensure that neither party 2 ̆ 7 s rights are compromised in the settlement process. The first I refer to as the efficiency conception, and the second as the protection-of-rights conception. This article explains why neither conception is coherent, and why neither is a sound basis for mediator standards. In Part III, I argue in favor of a third, sounder conception of the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> - the empowerment-and-recognition conception. According to this conception, the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> is neither to promote agreement nor to protect rights per se. Instead, the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> is to encourage the parties 2 ̆ 7 exercise of their autonomy and independent choice in deciding whether and how to resolve their dispute, and to promote their mutual recognition of each other as fellow human beings despite their conflict. Part IV explores how this third conception would guide us in choosing, and rejecting, specific mediator standards. The concrete focus of this article, particularly the final section, is on the impact of the conception of the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> on standards of ethical mediation practice. Moreover, this article focuses on the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> and responsibilities as mediator, regardless of whether the mediator is a professional who occupies other roles as well.

Data was collected electronically using the survey method in one urban Florida school district. Qualitative and quantitative data were captured using the Principal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Role</b> Questionnaire (PRQ) (Goodwin, 2002). Thirty-six principal role descriptor statements on the PRQ survey requested a level of agreement from research participants regarding changes, current and future roles of the secondary principal. Four open ended comment requests allowed participants to comment on the principal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> in those areas. Role descriptor statements were categorized into four areas: strategic leadership, instructional leadership, organizational leadership and political and community leadership.

40|$|The conical-domain {{model is}} a {{computational}} model, now undergoing development, for estimating ionospheric delays of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Relative to the standard ionospheric delay model described below, the conical-domain model offers improved accuracy. In the absence of selective availability, the ionosphere is the largest source of error for single-frequency users of GPS. Because ionospheric signal delays contribute to errors in GPS position and time measurements, satellite-based augmentation systems (SBASs) {{have been designed to}} estimate these delays and broadcast corrections. Several national and international SBASs are currently in various stages of development to enhance the integrity and accuracy of GPS measurements for airline navigation. In the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) of the United States, slant ionospheric delay errors and confidence bounds are derived from estimates of vertical ionospheric delay modeled on a grid at regularly spaced intervals of latitude and longitude. The estimate of vertical delay at each ionospheric grid point (IGP) is calculated from a planar fit of neighboring slant delay measurements, projected to vertical using a standard, thin-shell model of the ionosphere. Interpolation on the WAAS grid enables estimation of the vertical delay at the ionospheric pierce point (IPP) corresponding to any arbitrary measurement of a user. (The IPP of a given <b>user</b> <b>s</b> measurement is the point where the GPS signal ray path intersects a reference ionospheric height.) The product of the interpolated value and the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> thin-shell obliquity factor provides an estimate of the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> ionospheric slant delay. Two types of error that restrict the accuracy of the thin-shell model are absent in the conical domain model: (1) error due to the implicit assumption that the electron density is independent of the azimuthal angle at the IPP and (2) error arising from the slant-to-vertical conversion. At low latitudes or at mid-latitudes under disturbed conditions, the accuracy of SBAS systems based upon the thin-shell model suffers due to the presence of complex ionospheric structure, high delay values, and large electron density gradients. Interpolation on the vertical delay grid serves as an additional source of delay error. The conical-domain model permits direct computation of the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> slant delay estimate without the intervening use of a vertical delay grid. The key is to restrict each fit of GPS measurements to a spatial domain encompassing signals from only one satellite. The conical domain model is so named because each fit involves a group of GPS receivers that all receive signals from the same GPS satellite (see figure); the receiver and satellite positions define a cone, the satellite position being the vertex. A user within a given cone evaluates the delay to the satellite directly, using (1) the IPP coordinates of the line of sight to the satellite and (2) broadcast fit parameters associated with the cone. The conical-domain model partly resembles the thin-shell model in that both models reduce an inherently four-dimensional problem to two dimensions. However, unlike the thin-shell model, the conical domain model does not involve any potentially erroneous simplifying assumptions about the structure of the ionosphere. In the conical domain model, the initially four-dimensional problem becomes truly two-dimensional in the sense that once a satellite location has been specified, any signal path emanating from a satellite can be identified by only two coordinates; for example, the IPP coordinates. As a consequence, a <b>user</b> <b>s</b> slant-delay estimate converges to the correct value in the limit that the receivers converge to the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> location (or, equivalently, in the limit that the measurement IPPs converge to the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> IPP) ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to uncover and compare patient and physical therapist perceptions regarding the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> in outpatient physical therapy. · We hypothesized that therapist and patient perceptions would not be consistent with·one another, and indicate therapists believed the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> to encompass a higher level of participation.
