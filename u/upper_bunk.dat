25|$|The closest {{compartment}} to {{the doors}} is {{slightly larger than}} the others, allowing for enough space for a wheelchair to access it. However, the toilet is not sufficiently large for a wheelchair. Each compartment has a twin-bunk bed. The <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> can be collapsed into the wall, allowing the room to be converted to a single. In this configuration the lower bunk {{can also be used}} as a sofa, with the walls being upholstered. Initially children could sleep on a balcony room. On the reverse wall of the beds are three niches, two which {{can be used as a}} wardrobe and one which features a folding ladder to the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk.</b> There is a folding ladder and a sink in each compartment.|$|E
25|$|The beds {{inside the}} cabins {{are made of}} aluminium. Every cabin has a {{wall-hung}} wash basin (with running hot and cold water from a tap), a curtained wardrobe niche, a folding table, a stool, and a ladder for climbing into the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk.</b> The cabins also have electrical lighting and are ventilated and heated.|$|E
60|$|O'Sullivan's {{troubles}} were over. The {{man in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> {{had completed}} the mad, sad span of his life with the marlin-spike.|$|E
60|$|But {{the thing}} which caught {{and held the}} {{attention}} of the boys most was a big bearskin which had been thrown on one of the <b>upper</b> <b>bunks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Wilfrid {{assisted}} to set his mother's {{cabin in}} order, {{and then went}} to his own. It was a good-sized cabin, and when the ship was full accommodated four passengers; but the two <b>upper</b> <b>bunks</b> had now been taken down, and there was, Wilfrid thought, ample room for two. On his own bunk were piled his two portmanteaus, a gun-case, a bundle of fishing-rods, and other odds and ends, and a somewhat similar collection of luggage was on that opposite. Wilfred read the name on the labels. [...] "Atherton," [...] he said; [...] "I wonder what he is like. I do hope he will be a nice fellow." ...|$|R
50|$|At 06:00 the {{survivors}} held reveille and prepared breakfast. Utilizing the signal ejector, communication was passed {{that the crew}} was in good spirits with enough air to last for seventy-eight hours based on calculations of available oxygen and lithium hydroxide. They also had adequate supplies of water, but no food after eating what little they had, including cake, for breakfast. While inspecting the submarine, {{the survivors}} noted a heavy black cloud rising from below the deck in the forward battery compartment. No one entered this compartment again. Two more canisters of lithium hydroxide were opened and spread on the <b>upper</b> <b>bunks.</b> Later in the morning another four canisters were opened. Approximately twenty canisters were unopened. One eight-cubic-foot (230 l) oxygen cylinder was bled into the compartment; three oxygen cylinders were left unused.|$|R
60|$|The cook {{leaned forward}} and {{regarded}} his col-league favourably; then he pursed his lips, and nodded significantly at an <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> from which the face of Tommy, pale and scared, looked anxiously down.|$|E
60|$|He {{gave her}} a sidelong glance with his pale, blue eyes, but did not reply. After many years of married life he had learned {{that it was more}} conducive to peace to leave his wife with the last word. He was undressed before she was, and {{climbing}} into the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> he settled down to read himself to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Norgate {{made his}} way back to his compartment, undressed leisurely and climbed into the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk.</b> For an hour or two he indulged in the fitful slumber usually engendered by night travelling. At the {{frontier}} he sat up and answered the stereotyped questions. Herr Selingman, in sky-blue pyjamas, and with face looking more beaming and florid than ever, poked his head cheerfully out of the lower bunk.|$|E
6000|$|The noise increased. Little Belfast seemed, in {{the heavy}} heat of the forecastle, to boil with facetious fury. His eyes danced; in the crimson of his face, comical as a mask, the mouth yawned black, with strange grimaces. Facing him, a half-undressed man held his sides, and, {{throwing}} his head back, laughed with wet eyelashes. Others stared with amazed eyes. Men sitting doubled up in the <b>upper</b> <b>bunks</b> smoked short pipes, swinging bare brown feet above the heads of those who, sprawling below on sea-chests, listened, smiling stupidly or scornfully. Over the white rims of berths stuck out heads with blinking eyes; but the bodies {{were lost in the}} gloom of those places, that resembled narrow niches for coffins in a whitewashed and lighted mortuary. Voices buzzed louder. Archie, with compressed lips, drew himself in, seemed to shrink into a smaller space, and sewed steadily, industrious and dumb. Belfast shrieked like an inspired Dervish:--"... So I seez to him, boys, seez I, 'Beggin' yer pardon, sorr,' seez I to that second mate of that steamer--'beggin' your-r-r pardon, sorr, the Board of Trade must 'ave been drunk when they granted you your certificate!' 'What do you say, you------!' seez he, comin' at me like a mad bull... all in his white clothes; and I up with my tar-pot and capsizes it all over his blamed lovely face and his lovely jacket.... 'Take that!' seez I. 'I am a sailor, anyhow, you nosing, skipper-licking, useless, sooperfloos bridge-stanchion, you! That's the kind of man I am!' shouts I.... You should have seed him skip, boys! Drowned, blind with tar, he was! So..." ...|$|R
50|$|Campaspe had {{a similar}} history until 1927 when it was {{replaced}} with a steel dining car; at {{that time it was}} transferred to Albury Express as a buffet car, then a hospital car from 6 February 1942 for the length of WWII. It was stored at North Melbourne from 1945 to 1952 when it was converted to sleep 16 men in longitudinal <b>upper</b> and lower <b>bunks</b> with a centre aisle, and retaining a small kitchen and tables for those 16 people to feed. It ended up on Breakdown train at Dynon in the 1980s. Eventually it was allocated to Plan R (Seven-O-Seven Operations) Victoria and later transferred to the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre, where it is currently awaiting restoration to operational condition.|$|R
60|$|The {{source of}} the smoke must be very close to Wolf Larsen—my mind was made up to this, and I went {{straight}} to his bunk. As I felt about among his blankets, something hot fell {{on the back of}} my hand. It burned me, and I jerked my hand away. Then I understood. Through the cracks in the bottom of the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> he had set fire to the mattress. He still retained sufficient use of his left arm to do this. The damp straw of the mattress, fired from beneath and denied air, had been smouldering all the while.|$|E
60|$|The steward {{brought me}} coffee, and I read till {{daylight}} and after, when Wada served me breakfast {{and helped me}} dress. He, too, complained of inability to sleep. He had been bunked with Nancy {{in one of the}} rooms in the 'midship-house. Wada described the situation. The tiny room, made of steel, was air-tight when the steel door was closed. And Nancy insisted on keeping the door closed. As a result Wada, in the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk,</b> had stifled. He told me that the air had got so bad that the flame of the lamp, no matter how high it was turned, guttered down and all but refused to burn. Nancy snored beautifully through it all, while he had been unable to close his eyes.|$|E
60|$|The Dutch {{boy could}} not speak a word of English. He was a farmer's boy, serving ninety days as {{punishment}} for having got into a scrap with some one. He prefaced his fits with howling. He howled like a wolf. Also, he took his fits standing up, which was very inconvenient for him, for his fits always culminated in a headlong pitch to the floor. Whenever I heard the long wolf-howl rising, I used to grab a broom and run to his cell. Now the trusties were not allowed keys to the cells, so I could not get in to him. He would stand {{up in the middle}} of his narrow cell, shivering convulsively, his eyes rolled backward till only the whites were visible, and howling like a lost soul. Try as I would, I could never get the Cockney to lend him a hand. While he stood and howled, the Cockney crouched and trembled in the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk,</b> his terror-stricken gaze fixed on that awful figure, with eyes rolled back, that howled and howled. It was hard on him, too, the poor devil of a Cockney. His own reason was not any too firmly seated, and the wonder is that he did not go mad.|$|E

50|$|The cabin of the Actros {{is built}} with {{consideration}} for the driver. It provides a silent, smooth and pleasant ride. Pneumatic suspension of both the cab and the tractor itself makes for a really smooth feeling even on the roughest road. The high-roof sleeper version provides two bunks (the upper one not usable while driving, as the seats must be folded). The <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> is somewhat wider, but all the controls (radio, windows, auxiliary heater, etc.) {{are available from the}} lower bunk. However, most of the controls one would need (auxiliary heater, sunroof, etc.) while resting are doubled overhead of the driver, and the width of the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> allows for a person to use them by merely stretching their hand.|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} cabins were available: a normal day cabin and {{sleeping}} cabin which is 200 mm longer. The sleeping cabin {{is equipped with}} bunk bed of which <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> can be lifted close to ceiling for better visibility. The bunks and rear windows are with curtains.|$|E

50|$|Despite its name, the bunks are padded, only {{less than}} soft {{sleepers}}. Like soft sleepers {{they have a}} table, hot water and a rubbish bin.The lower bunk (下) is the roomiest followed by the middle bunk (中). The <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> (上) {{not only has the}} least room, but one has to be relatively agile to climb up to it. There are slight differences in ticket cost depending on the bunk position.|$|E
50|$|Amtrak {{designed}} {{new types}} of sleeping-car accommodations when it began constructing new long-distance equipment in the late 1970s, and today it uses two primary types of sleeping cars. Most long-distance trains use double-deck Superliner equipment, while a few eastern trains use single-level Viewliner cars. Roomettes on these sleeping cars include single bench seats {{on both ends of}} the room; the seats fold together to form a single bunk bed, and an <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> folds down from the ceiling. Superliner roomettes do not include private toilets or washbasins, but Viewliner roomettes do.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story is}} set in [...] "The yellow arrow". It is a train without an end or a beginning, it makes no stops going to the {{destroyed}} bridge, which is a whole world for characters. The main character tries to understand this world and {{to get out of}} the train in contrast to the other passengers who being indifferent to their fate carry on as usual - trading in nickel melted down from the carriage doors, attending the <b>Upper</b> <b>Bunk</b> avant-garde theatre, and leafing through Pasternak’s Early Trains.|$|E
50|$|When {{the ship}} parted I had been {{promoted}} to Maintenance AB and shared a cabin on the aft upper deck with the Boatswain, Ray North. In the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk,</b> I was thrown {{up to the ceiling}} when the break occurred about 2300(+/-) hours. Looking forward amidships there was nothing but steam, but on the starboard was our bow. We continued under way for some time and soon lost sight of the bow section. After checking the hull, there was no rupture of the exposed tank bulkheads (now our bow). Then there was a little less concern for the ship’s safety.|$|E
50|$|In the end, Wheeler and Walker are {{side by side}} in the ambulance, still {{fighting}} and cursing at one another. Finally, they cease and declare a truce. Walker attempts to strike a deal with Wheeler as he points out how much fun the two of them could have with an ambulance, revealing that he still has his craft knife he used to torture the stoner's girlfriend. However, one of the EMTs rams syringes full of air into their chests, apparently killing them both. The new killer tells the driver that he plans to save Stacia (bound and gagged in an <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> of the ambulance) for later.|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{house is}} {{rectangular}} with a rounded front, 20.42 ft long and 8.42 ft wide (6.22 m × 2.57 m). It {{is covered with}} vertical tongue-and-groove sheathing. The pilot house {{is divided into three}} compartments, each formerly divided from the others by doors, now missing. The wheel room occupies the front compartment, housing the rope-and-pulley-operated wheel, with five windows on the front, two on either side, and doors on either side. A heater stands at the rear. A flush deck hatch gives access to the engine compartment. The next compartment behind the wheel room, and a little lower, is the bunk room, 6.5 ft long, with three bunks on the port side and a shower on the starboard side, replacing the original head. There is a porthole for the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk.</b> Behind the bunkroom lies the kitchen, 4 ft long, with a window on each side and a door aft. At the fore, in the foc'sle compartment, two more bunks are provided.|$|E
5000|$|Inside on {{a wooden}} bunk lay a young Indian woman. She {{had been trying to}} have her baby for two days ... She screamed just as Nick and the two Indians {{followed}} his father and Uncle George into the shanty .... In the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> was her husband. He had cut his foot very badly with an axe three days before .... The room smelled very bad. — [...] "Indian Camp" [...] Hemingway biographer Philip Young writes that Hemingway's emphasis in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] was not primarily on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on young Nick Adams, who witnesses these events and becomes a [...] "badly scarred and nervous young man". In [...] "Indian Camp", Hemingway begins the events that shape the Adams persona. Young considers this single Hemingway story to hold the [...] "master key" [...] to [...] "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Critic Howard Hannum agrees. He believes the trauma of birth and suicide Hemingway paints in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] rendered a leitmotif that gave Hemingway a unified framework for the Nick Adams stories.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveHead injury {{caused by}} fan blades is rare among children. We {{analysed}} 14 cases of such injury {{and discuss the}} causes, type of injury and preventive measures. MethodsA retrospective analysis of 14 cases of children who were admitted to the Pediatric Neurosurgical Unit of Hospital Kuala Lumpur after sustaining head injuries caused by fan blades between January 2000 and December 2002 was performed. ResultsThe causes of fan-blade head injury included jumping on the <b>upper</b> <b>bunk</b> of a bunk-bed, climbing on a ladder, climbing up onto a table, and being lifted by an adult. Thirteen patients were injured by ceiling fans and one by falling onto an uncovered table fan. School-aged boys were the predominant victims. Mean patient age was 7. 9 years (range, 1. 0 - 12. 2 years). There was a twin peak incidence of when the accidents occurred: just before lunch {{in the afternoon and}} bedtime at night. The types of injury were scalp lacerations, compound depressed fractures and multiple intracranial haemorrhages. Two patients had the complication of wound infection, and one of these patients developed cerebral spinal fluid leak. One patient died from severe head injuries. ConclusionSafety awareness among parents and caretakers are important as fan-blade head injury among children is preventable...|$|E
