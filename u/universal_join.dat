These modular {{systems are}} composed of driving modules (which use mechanisms with articulated elements) and passive modules. The first module (driving module) generates the traction force. The passive module is necessary to carry the control electronic equipment and for the transport of the needed equipment for realization of the in-pipe inspection. The joint disposed (<b>universal</b> <b>join)</b> by the two modules of the robot offers the capacity of orientation of this one...|$|E
40|$|Conceptual graphs {{support a}} notion called a "line of identity" (also called a "co-referent link") that {{specifies}} a single concept which is denoted {{by two or}} more concept boxes. The multiple concepts can be joined into a single concept (if {{they are in the}} same context). This work proposes a richer notion, expressible using existing conceptual graph constructs, that allows finer distinctions to be made about what concepts are allowed to be joined, and also addresses the problem of joining between different contexts. In the course of describing an entire relational database with multiple graphs (one for each database relation). We encountered a problem in joining these graphs into one large graph (the <b>universal</b> <b>join</b> relation); namely, the existence of some instance constraints on joins. In some cases, foreign key attributes in one relation's graph cannot be joined unconditionally with their corresponding attributes in another relation. We describe a new notion, a conditional join, to ha [...] ...|$|E

5|$|South Wales miners, {{including}} those at Universal, were paid on a rate {{determined by the}} Sliding Scale Committee, which fixed wages on the price coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led to industrial unrest and, in 1898, a strike that the men at <b>Universal</b> <b>joined</b> {{at the end of}} April. The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners.

5000|$|The first Now was {{released}} on 28 November 1983 and featured 30 UK hit singles from that year on a double vinyl LP or cassette. Although the compilation of recent hit songs into a single release was not a new concept (K-tel and Ronco, for example, had been issuing various artists' compilations for some years), {{this was the first}} time that two major record labels had collaborated on such a venture. Virgin agreed to a deal with EMI, which allowed a greater number of major hits to be included (the first album in the series included a total of [...] "eleven number ones" [...] on its sleeve). The album went to number one, and soon after, CBS/WEA's The Hits Album, adopted a similar format to Now!. The two series co-existed for the rest of the 1980s, but when <b>Universal</b> <b>joined</b> the collaboration the Now! series was more successful commercially. The Out Now series by MCA and Chrysalis was also established as a rival to the series, but was short lived.|$|R
