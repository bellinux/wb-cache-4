We consider sphere packings {{determined by}} lattices {{and study the}} density function in the symmetric space, showing that the density function ρ(Ak) decreases to 0 if Ak is a sequence of matrices in SL(n, R) with limk→ ∞ ‖Ak ‖ = ∞. As a consequence, we give a simple prove that the optimal solution for the sphere packing problem is attained. The sphere packing problem {{is one of the}} famous open problems in mathematics. In short, it asks about the densest way a set of equal spheres can be packed in space n-dimensional Euclidean space R n, without overlapping one the other. In this context, the density means the proportion between the covered and the <b>uncovered</b> <b>amount</b> of space. It has many variations: one could replace spheres of equal radii by spheres of radii 0 < a ≤ r ≤ b bounded from above and below, replace spheres by a collection of identical (preferably convex) bodies, Euclidean space may be replaced by elliptical or hyperbolic space, and man...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Purity Analysis is {{the problem}} of {{determining}} whether or not a method may have side-effects. This has applications in automatic parallelisation, extended static checking, and more. We present a novel purity system for Java that employs purity annotations which can be checked modularly. This is done using a flow-sensitive, intraprocedural analysis. The system exploits two properties, called freshness and locality, to increase the range of methods that can be considered pure. JPure also includes an inference engine for annotating legacy code. We evaluate our system against several packages from the Java Standard Library. Our results indicate it is possible to <b>uncover</b> significant <b>amounts</b> of purity efficiently. ...|$|R

To address this dilemma, several techniques have been suggested for anonymizing network data by obfuscating sensitive fields.

Via analyses on three different network datasets, we quantify the effectiveness of our techniques, showing that they can <b>uncover</b> significant <b>amounts</b> of sensitive information.

However, this response is slow, and therefore its use is thought to be limited to measurements of slow tasks or tasks in which meaningful events are temporally well separated. Here we show that high-temporal-resolution tracking of attention and cognitive processes can be obtained from the slow pupillary response. Using automated dilation deconvolution, we isolated and tracked the dynamics of attention in a fast-paced temporal attention task, allowing us to <b>uncover</b> the <b>amount</b> of mental activity that is critical for conscious perception of relevant stimuli. We thus found evidence for specific temporal expectancy effects in attention that have eluded detection using neuroimaging methods such as EEG.

40|$|Dictation is {{commonly}} used as an integrative test of listening skills, yet relatively little has been published about the psychometric qualities of this format. Moreover, dictation test scores are problematic to analyze because typically one point is awarded for each correctly written word, which may result {{in violation of the}} assumption of local independence required by many statistical analyses. This study examined the psychometric properties of an English dictation test currently used for placement purposes at the University of Hawai`i. While initial classical and Rasch analyses suggested that the test was reliable and the items were generally functioning well, subsequent factor and other analyses indicated that the assumption of independence of items (words) did not hold. Re-scoring the test by pooling words within bursts (segments of text separated by pauses during reading) may provide a method for avoiding the local independence problem. Classical analysis suggested that scoring by burst produced good results, but Rasch analysis <b>uncovered</b> large <b>amounts</b> of person misfit and overfit.

Around five thousand ostraca of assorted works of commerce and literature were found in a well close to the village.

40|$|Genotypic fitness landscapes are {{constructed}} by assessing the fitness {{of all possible}} combinations of a given number of mutations. In the last years, several experimental fitness landscapes have been completely resolved. As fitness landscapes are high-dimensional, their characterization relies on simple measures of their structure, {{which can be used}} as statistics in empirical applications. Here we propose two new sets of measures that explicitly capture two relevant features of fitness landscapes: epistasis and constraints. The first set contains new measures for epistasis based on the correlation of fitness effects of mutations. They have a natural interpretation, capture well the interaction between mutations, can be obtained analytically for most landscape models and can therefore be used to discriminate between different models. The second set contains measures of evolutionary constraints based on "chains" of forced mutations along fitness-increasing paths. Some of these measures are non-monotonic in the amount of epistatic interactions, but have instead a maximum for intermediate values. We further characterize the relationships of these measures to the ones that were previous proposed (e. g. number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of non-additive components, etc). Finally, we show how these measures can help <b>uncovering</b> the <b>amount</b> and the nature of epistatic interactions in two experimental landscapes. Comment: 37 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
