50|$|A candy {{thermometer}} {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> except that it can read higher temperatures (usually 400 °F/200 °C or more).|$|R
25|$|A direct {{indicating}} {{dial thermometer}} (such as a patio <b>thermometer</b> or <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer)</b> uses <b>a</b> bimetallic strip wrapped into a coil. One {{end of the}} coil is fixed to the housing of the device and the other drives an indicating needle. A bimetallic strip is also used in a recording thermometer. Breguet's thermometer consists of a tri-metallic helix.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> is <b>a</b> unit {{which will}} measure core {{temperature}} of meats while cooking. It {{will have a}} metal probe with a sharp point which is pushed into the <b>meat,</b> and <b>a</b> dial or digital display. Some show the temperature only; others also have markings to indicate when different kinds of meat are done to a specified degree (e.g., [...] "beef medium rare").|$|R
2500|$|Beef can {{be cooked}} to various degrees, from very rare to well done. The degree of cooking {{corresponds}} to {{the temperature in the}} approximate center of the meat, which can be measured with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Beef can be cooked using the sous-vide method, which cooks the entire steak to the same temperature, but when cooked using a method such as broiling or roasting it is typically cooked such that it has a [...] "bulls eye" [...] of doneness, with the least done (coolest) at the center and the most done (warmest) at the outside.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>meat</b> <b>{{thermometer}}</b> or cooking thermometer is {{a thermometer}} {{used to measure}} the internal temperature of meat, especially roasts and steaks, and other cooked foods. The degree of [...] "doneness" [...] of meat or bread correlates closely with the internal temperature, so that a thermometer reading indicates when it is cooked as desired. When cooking, food should always be cooked so that the interior reaches a temperature sufficient, {{that in the case of}} meat is enough to kill pathogens that may cause foodborne illness or, in the case of bread, that is done baking; the thermometer helps to ensure this.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> 2012 chicken <b>meat</b> {{study found}} 60% of home cooks {{were at risk}} of food {{poisoning}} by washing whole poultry before it was cooked, which can spread bacteria around the kitchen.

40|$|A hand injury {{occurred}} at a U. S. facility in 1985 involving a pointed shaft (similar to <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer)</b> that <b>a</b> worker was using to remove scrap solid plutonium from a plastic bottle. The worker punctured his right index finger on the palm side at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint. The wound was not through-and- through, although it was deep. The puncture wound resulted in deposition of ~ 48 kBq of alpha activity from the weapons-grade plutonium mixture with a nominal 12 to 1 Pu-alpha to {sup 241 }Am-alpha ratio. This case clearly showed that DTPA was very effective for decorporation of plutonium and americium. The case is a model for management of wounds contaminated with transuranics: (1) a team approach for dealing {{with all of the}} issues surrounding the incident, including the psychological, (2) early surgical intervention for foreign-body removal, (3) wound irrigation with DTPA solution, and (4) early and prolonged DTPA administration based upon bioassay and in vivo dosimetry...|$|R

Five years later, Edie is having a party with her friends Johnny, Eva, Colin, Liz and Shane in her house. Colin puts on the same mask as Edie's mother's killer and scares Edie. This causes her to have a psychotic break and stab him {{to death with a}} kitchen knife. She then hacks Liz to death with a cleaver, stabs Shane in the neck with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer,</b> and bludgeons Johnny with a frying pan. She then advances menacingly towards Eva, but Eva coaxes Edie out of her psychotic episode. However, a still living Johnny then appears and smashes a block of ice on Eva's head. He then reveals that he killed Edie's mother and [...] strangles Edie with the cord for the refrigerator. However, just as Johnny is about to leave the house, a dying Eva beats him to death with two frying pans before collapsing on the floor.|$|R
50|$|Upon waking, Chad and Scarlet {{discover}} that Sam and Lilith intend to torture and kill them. They nearly drown Scarlet in a barrel, but {{after they leave}} the room Chad resuscitates her, and the couple tries to flee the farmhouse. Chad is caught by Lilith, but wrestles away a shotgun from her and knocks her unconscious. Scarlet, aided by Alal, runs away into a vineyard field, but is eventually caught by Sam, who kills Alal and takes Scarlet back into the house. While Sam goes to look for Chad, Lilith tortures Scarlet by scraping the flesh off her knees with a grater. Chad interrupts the torture session and kills Lilith by stabbing her {{in the head with}} <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Chad tries to set Scarlet free, but is unable to do so before Sam gets back. Chad and Sam fight, and Scarlet stabs Sam in the back with a chef's knife. The couple flees in Sam's pickup truck, but Sam revives and pursues them; Chad runs Sam over with the truck several times before they drive off.|$|R

40|$|Field {{procedures}} for collecting soil cores and soil {{samples from the}} steam injection plot were modified {{in an effort to}} minimize VOC losses that can occur when sampling soil at elevated temperatures (Battelle, 2001). The primary modifications included: (1) additional personnel safety equipment, such as thermalinsulated gloves for core handling; (2) the addition of a cooling period to bring the soil cores to approximately 20 ºC before collecting samples; and (3) capping the core ends while the cores were cooling. Concerns were raised about the possibility that increased handling times during soil coring, soil cooling, and sample collection may result in an increase in VOC losses. An experiment was conducted using soil samples spiked with a surrogate compound to investigate the effectiveness of the field procedures developed for LC 34 in minimizing VOC losses. Materials and Methods Soil cores were collected in a 2 -inch diameter, 4 -foot long acetate sleeve that was placed tightly inside a 2 -inch diameter stainless steel core barrel. The acetate sleeve was immediately capped on both ends with a protective polymer covering. The sleeve was placed in an ice bath to cool the heated core to below ambient groundwater temperatures (approximately 20 ºC). The temperature of the soil core was monitored during the cooling process with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> that was pushed into one end cap (see Figure G- 1). Approximately 30 minutes was required to cool each 4 -foot long, 2 -inch diameter soil core from 50 - 95 ºC to below 20 ºC (see Figure G- 2). Upon reaching ambient temperature, the core sleeve was then uncapped and cut open along its length to collect the soil sample for contaminant analysis (see Figure G- 3) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{best way}} to prevent {{trichinellosis}} is to fully cook <b>meat.</b> <b>A</b> food <b>thermometer</b> can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough. Infection is typically treated with antiparasitic medication such as albendazole or mebendazole. Rapid treatment may kill adult worms and thereby stop further worsening of symptoms. Both medications are considered safe but {{have been associated with}} side effects such as bone marrow suppression. Their use during pregnancy or in {{children under the age of}} 2 years is poorly studied but appears to be safe. Treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases. Without treatment symptoms typically resolve within three months.|$|R
50|$|For beef, lamb, or veal {{insert the}} <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> away from bone, fat, or cartilage. The <b>meat</b> should reach <b>a</b> {{temperature}} of between 63 °C (145 °F) for medium-rare, and 77 °C (170 °F) for well done.|$|R
50|$|For poultry {{insert the}} <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> into the thigh, {{but do not}} touch the bone. The {{suggested}} temperature for poultry to reach before {{it is safe to}} consume is 74 °C (165 °F), unless the poultry is stuffed, in which case the temperature {{in the center of the}} stuffing should be about 74 °C (165 °F).|$|R
5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other <b>until</b> appeasement occurs. <b>A</b> <b>meat</b> ant detects <b>a</b> foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|R
50|$|Once the Porirua {{restaurant}} was open, there were additional {{problems with the}} supply chain, with frequent industrial unrest often shutting down suppliers without warning for weeks on end. An industrial dispute shut down the bun supplier in mid-1976, resulting in McDonald's staff having to drive all over Wellington to find substitute buns, and then cutting the sesame seed buns for the Big Mac using two bandsaws placed side-by-side. Beef patties were initially supplied from the Gear Meat Company in Petone, although supply was haphazard <b>until</b> <b>a</b> purpose-built <b>meat</b> forming machine was acquired in 1977. Like many other companies at the time, Gear Meat was plagued by industrial unrest and closed down without warning in 1982, leaving McDonald's to import beef patties from Australia. The affiliate acquired Gear Meat's patty-forming machine and moved it to Auckland to secure production. By coincidence, part of Gear Meat's former site now contains a McDonald's restaurant.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> {{are usually}} {{designed}} {{to have the}} probe in the meat during cooking. Some use a bimetallic strip which rotates a needle which shows the temperature on a dial; the whole thermometer can be left inside the oven during cooking. Another variety commonly used on turkey is the pop-up timer, which uses a spring held in by a soft material that [...] "pops up" [...] when the <b>meat</b> reaches <b>a</b> set temperature.|$|R
50|$|Thermometers are {{important}} in food safety where food at temperatures within 41 and 135 F can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours {{which could lead to}} foodborne illness. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.Cooking thermometers {{are important}} for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular <b>meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> are used to aid in cooking <b>meat</b> to <b>a</b> safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a bimetallic coil, or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.Candy thermometers are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.|$|R
