The shadows {{are present}} {{from the very}} first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end.</b> More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.|$|E

5|$|All {{specimens}} of Majungasaurus {{have been recovered}} from the Maevarano Formation in the Mahajanga Province in northwestern Madagascar. Most of these, including all of the most complete material, came from the Anembalemba Member, although Majungasaurus teeth have also {{been found in the}} underlying Masorobe Member and the overlying Miadana Member. While these sediments have not been dated radiometrically, evidence from biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism suggest that they were deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, which lasted from 70 to 66 Ma (million years ago). Majungasaurus teeth are found up <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the Maastrichtian, when all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{resigned}} {{after the}} Confederate government had fled from Richmond {{at the end}} of the war, and he and several of his colleagues in the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end.</b> He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E
5|$|The most elite, veteran Antigonid-period Macedonian {{infantry}} from {{at least}} the time of Antigonus III Doson were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected {{to serve in the}} elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The amount of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men (the largest figure mentioned by ancient historians, an amount that existed in the Social War of 219 BC). They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into chalkaspides 'bronze shield' and leukaspides 'white shield' regiments, up <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the kingdom in 168 BC.|$|E

25|$|<b>Until</b> almost <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of its {{period of}} power in Northern Ireland, the UUP was led by a {{combination}} of landed gentry (Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough and James Chichester-Clark), aristocracy (Terence O'Neill) and gentrified industrial magnates (James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon and John Miller Andrews – nephew of William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie). Only its last Prime Minister, Brian Faulkner, was from a middle-class background. During this era, all but 11 of the 149 UUP Stormont MPs were members of the Orange Order, as were all Prime Ministers.|$|R
5|$|The {{signing of}} former Phillies closer Billy Wagner by the Mets between the 2005 and 2006 seasons {{was a factor}} in the {{intensification}} of the rivalry. Pat Burrell and Wagner became embroiled in heated media discussions after Wagner departed the Phillies. For the first time in 2006, both franchises fielded contenders until deep into the season. The Mets steadily led the NL East (finally supplanting the decade-long division champions, the Atlanta Braves), while the Phillies maintained pace as a wild card contender <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the season. The Mets won the head-to-head season matchup, beating the Phillies 11 out of 18 times. The Mets won the division, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government {{made no effort to}} train Congolese commissioned officers <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to Congolese was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold water on the soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.|$|E
5|$|In French medieval cuisine, banquets {{were common}} among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but {{served in a}} style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was {{generally}} eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, {{and it was not}} <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E
50|$|The {{fragments}} {{take the}} form of Crystal Flowers and are scattered throughout the five worlds; Human, Demon, Heaven, Spirit, and Fairy. Strangely enough, the five candidates Yucie, Glenda, Elmina, Cocoloo and Beth are representatives of these five existing worlds in this story's universe. As the legend goes, once the Eternal Tiara is complete, it will select the Princess from the worthy candidates and can grant her one wish. Unknown to the candidates and <b>the</b> viewers, <b>until</b> almost <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end,</b> is <b>the</b> sad history of the Eternal Tiara and the inevitable fate of the Platinum Princess and all the other candidates.|$|R
50|$|The {{play has}} {{its origins in}} a 12th-century legend which Spanish writer José Zorrilla y Moral turned into a {{dramatic}} poem entitled Margarita La Tornera (Margarita the Gatekeeper). The poem differs from The Miracle in resetting the story in 19th-century Spain, as the 1959 film would do, and in not letting the reader know that the statue has taken the nun's place in <b>the</b> convent <b>until</b> nearly <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end.</b> Zorrilla's poem was made 1909 into an opera (Margarita la tornera) by Spanish zarzuela composer Ruperto Chapí. It was his last work before his death. The poem was also loosely adapted into a Spanish film, Milagro de amor, in 1946.|$|R

5|$|There is {{reliance}} on repetition of themes within {{the plot of}} Thalaba. Three times he attained a paradise {{that turns out to}} be false, and this is followed by the death of a woman who are gone <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise the evil of magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they take away from any Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.|$|E
5|$|While pre-dreadnoughts {{were adopted}} worldwide, {{there were no}} clashes between pre-dreadnought battleships <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of their period of dominance. The First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–95 {{influenced}} pre-dreadnought development, but {{this had been a}} clash between Chinese battleships and a Japanese fleet consisting of mostly cruisers. The Spanish–American War of 1898 was also a mismatch, with the American pre-dreadnought fleet engaging Spanish cruisers. Not until the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 did pre-dreadnoughts engage on an equal footing. This happened in three battles: the Russian tactical victory during the Battle of Port Arthur on 8–9 February 1904, the indecisive Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904, and the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. These battles upended prevailing theories of how naval battles would be fought, as the fleets began firing at one another at much greater distances than before; naval architects realized that plunging fire (explosive shells falling on their targets largely from above, instead of from a trajectory close to horizontal) was a much greater threat than had been thought.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end.</b> The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above {{appears to be in}} error for the period from 1979 to 1983, but in fact it is given correctly in the table. Note also that vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, as it seems to be from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.|$|E
50|$|Despite his {{unhappiness}} with President Richard Nixon {{over the}} Vietnam War, Javits {{was slow to}} join the anti-Nixon forces during the Watergate scandal of 1973-1974. <b>Until</b> almost <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> affair, his position reflected his legal training: Nixon was innocent until proven guilty, {{and the best way}} to determine guilt or innocence was by legal due process. His position was unpopular among his constituency, and his re-election in Watergate-tainted 1974 elections over Ramsey Clark was by fewer than 400,000 votes, a third of his 1968 margin of victory. During his last term Javits shifted his interests more and more to world affairs, especially the crises in the Middle East. Working with President Jimmy Carter, he journeyed to Israel and Egypt to facilitate discussions that led to the 1978 Camp David Accords.|$|R
5000|$|The Dead Man (prog 650-662) An unknown {{man with}} no memory is found almost dead and badly scarred in the Cursed Earth {{by a group of}} settlers.

Along the way, he recovers his memory and recalls that he is Dredd, having lost his memory when he encountered the Sisters of Death. This was not billed as a 'Judge Dredd' story when it first appeared in 2000 AD and great pains were taken to hide its connection with the series.

5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end,</b> thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking.

2500|$|According to Anthony Seldon and Guy Lodge, {{the authors}} {{of a book on}} Gordon's tenure as Prime Minister, Sarah brought {{stability}} to both Gordon and his office, and was [...] "a forceful voice in encouraging him to stay on <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> end". That <b>end</b> came following the 2010 General Election, which resulted in the first hung parliament since 1974. The Conservative Party led by David Cameron won the most seats, and on 11 May 2010 formed a government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats after her husband's attempts to keep Labour in power failed.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{opens with}} a scene {{near the end of}} the story, Humbert's murder of Quilty. This means that the film shows Humbert as a murderer before showing us Humbert as a seducer of minors, and the film sets up the viewer to frame the {{following}} flashback as an explanation for the murder. The film then goes back to Humbert's first meeting with Charlotte Haze and continues chronologically <b>until</b> <b>the</b> final murder scene is presented once again. The book, narrated by Humbert, presents events in chronological order from <b>the</b> <b>very</b> beginning, opening with Humbert's life as a child. While Humbert hints throughout the novel that he has committed murder, its actual circumstances are not described <b>until</b> near <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end.</b> NPR's Bret Anthony Johnston notes that the novel is sort of an inverted murder mystery: you know someone has been killed, but you have to wait to find out who the victim is. Similarly, the online Doubleday publisher's reading guide to Lolita notes [...] "the mystery of Quilty's identity turns this novel into a kind of detective story (in which the protagonist is both detective and criminal)." [...] This effect is, of course, lost in the Kubrick film.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet Union entered World War II when Germany invaded in June 1941, and in December 1941 Japan {{entered the}} war by attacking Allied forces and territories in the Pacific and East and Southeast Asia. Although these events placed the {{countries}} on opposite sides in the war, neither {{had an interest in}} engaging in military operations against the other, both being fully occupied with the wars in which they already were involved. Thus, the countries maintained a scrupulous neutrality toward one another <b>until</b> almost <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of World War II; other than inspecting cargos to ensure they did not include war materials and protesting the reflagging of American ships as Soviet ones, Japan did not deliberately interfere militarily with Lend-Lease convoys carrying war supplies from the United States to the Soviet Union in the North Pacific, and the Soviet Union turned down American requests to base American aircraft on Soviet territory for operations against Japan and ignored Allied requests for any other actions which might provoke Japan, its leader Josef Stalin stating only that Soviet entry into the war against Japan would not be possible <b>until</b> after <b>the</b> defeat of Germany.|$|R

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B+, {{explaining}} [...] "It was the atmosphere that sold me on [...] "Northwest Passage", an episode {{with a fairly}} middling mystery and only minimal advancement of the master-plot. (Though the end-point of that advancement was a doozy, and has me eating a little crow.) At times tonight the show almost felt like a backdoor pilot for a new series, with Peter tooling around the Pacific Northwest meeting local law enforcement and cracking cases. And while that's a show I'd definitely watch, I confess I'm anxious to jump ahead to next week, when there'll be inter-dimensional conflict and doppelgangers galore". Murray considered the ending {{with the appearance of}} Walternate a [...] "strong finish to a mostly strong episode". IGN's Ramsey Isler gave it 7.8/10, writing that [...] "Fringe sophomore season is building up to an epic 2-part finale. This episode doesn't reveal much in terms of overall Fringe mythology <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> awesome <b>ending,</b> and even then it just confirms what we already knew or suspected. Still, this installment deserves credit for using a different formula and giving Joshua Jackson some much-deserved time in the spotlight all by himself".|$|R
2500|$|The Confederate States Congress was {{sometimes}} unruly. The journal clerk {{shot and killed}} the chief clerk, and Henry S. Foote was attacked with [...] "fists, a Bowie knife, a revolver and an umbrella". In a Senate debate, Benjamin H. Hill threw an inkstand at William Lowndes Yancey, and Yancey and Edward A. Pollard had such fierce attacks on one another that newspapers would not publish the exchange for fears of their personal safety. Military glory redounded to those on the battlefield, but Congress and Congressmen were held in contempt, in some part due to members habit of berating one another in personal terms. Nevertheless, one historian of the Confederacy assessed the Congress as [...] "better than its critics made it." [...] The Confederacy lived out its existence during wartime, and virtually all of Congressional action addressed that fact. While it {{took an interest in}} military affairs, it never followed the U.S. Congress' example of harassing either the President, his cabinet, or military commanders. Despite Jefferson Davis' bitter Congressional critics, he dominated the Congress throughout most of <b>the</b> war <b>until</b> near <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end.</b> Davis vetoed thirty-nine bills in total, deemed unconstitutional or unwise, and these were upheld in the Congress for all but the bill for free postage for newspapers addressed to soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|Cranford {{described}} Heineman's musings as [...] "disparaging slant" [...] and [...] "fiction", {{noting that}} Heineman ("a storyteller with an agenda") {{at the time}} was (paraphrased) a loner who [...] "sat isolated in a cubicle in the back corner of the room", wasn't involved in the company's business operations nor deeply involved in The Bard's Tale, and therefore would not know all the details of the situation. As far as he (Cranford) could remember the situation, Brian Fargo would not produce a written contract for <b>the</b> game <b>until</b> near <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> development, and then only under pressure from Cranford withholding the final product. When he finally did, the contract was not what Cranford thought they had verbally agreed on when he had started working on the project, nor something he felt he could or would have agreed to at the onset. Although a compromise was found, Fargo asked Cranford to leave the company after The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight was finished. The experience contributed to Cranford walking away from game development to pursue a different career. Cranford would later realize that the attorney who had represented him had misled him into assuming the worst, and upon realizing this Cranford apologized to Fargo.|$|R
