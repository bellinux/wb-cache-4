5|$|She left Soda Creek for {{her first}} trip {{upstream}} on May 23, leaving at the break of day and arriving in Quesnel at 11 am. Captain Browne made semi-weekly trips between Quesnel and Soda Creek until June 23 when he decided that the BX was ready for testing in the two canyons between Quesnel and Fort George, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. He left Quesnel at 1pm and upon arriving at the Cottonwood Canyon, offloaded the passengers and lined through using the steam capstan. However, Browne soon realized that the light and powerful BX {{did not need to}} line through and could run the canyons unaided. By law passengers were forced to disembark and walk around any canyon that a steamer was lining through and be picked <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. However, by the fall of 1910, the federal steamboat inspector decided that the BX was allowed to keep her passengers on board. This gave her a huge advantage over her rivals, all of which had to line through both canyons, wasting time and fuel as well as inconveniencing the passengers.|$|E
5|$|The German {{artillery}} bombardment was heaviest in {{the sector}} {{held by the}} right company of the 47th Battalion and the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers {{on either side of}} the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. I/230 RIR had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It advanced through the British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, with part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw a number of German bayonets sticking <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the pioneers in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back far enough to bring one of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from this gun drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this counter-attack was launched, Foord, feeling his position to be insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of Highland Light Infantry were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they moved down the exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down.|$|E

25|$|As in Campaign 139, the PAVN {{pulled up}} {{just short of}} {{overrunning}} Long Tieng and ending the Laotian Civil War. The Royalists were battered and in questionable shape to undertake an offensive. With further North Vietnamese offensives in the offing, the American government found itself presented with a double-edged dilemma. L'Armee Clandestine was the only Lao military force still ready to fight in northern Laosbut barely ready. Continued defense of Long Tieng could lead to their defeat and loss of the war. On the other hand, removing the Hmong from their traditional homeland might irretrievably break their fighting spirit, and lose the war. However, Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley, who actually directed the war, believed that with the PAVN being attrited by air strikes, the Hmong could endure. Besides, Vang Pao had returned from hospital, and Hmong morale consequently perked <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, CIA Chief of Station Hugh Tovar believed that the Lao were becoming disgusted with the Americans risking only money and supplies while Lao were being killed.|$|E

[...] While {{working as an}} assistant coach at Michigan, Schulz has been credited with introducing the technique of overshifting a lineman on defense. [...] In 1913, Schulz developed a new blocking technique by shifting one of the linemen. [...] Coach Yost was unconvinced until Schulz performed a demonstration using Michigan's left guard Royce Traphagen. [...] Schulz first put Traphagen in the line position designated by Yost, Schulz lined <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the line and charged, [...] "almost wrecking Traphagen".

Attacking the Dutch line of battle in two loose groups, Duncan's ships broke through at the rear and [...] and were subsequently engaged by Dutch frigates lined <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side.

As the Dutch fleet attempted to reach shallower waters {{in an effort to}} escape the British attack, the British leeward division joined the windward combat and eventually forced the surrender of the Dutch flagship Vrijheid and ten other ships.|$|E

It grew back twice as large the next year. To avoid an epidemic as in the United Kingdom, some provinces in Canada are pushing for relaxation of provincial limits on the use of herbicides close to waterways so knotweed can be aggressively managed with strong chemicals.
