As in the uncorrelated case the theory predicts an enhancement of the density of states over Debye's ω^d- 1 law ("boson peak") as a result of disorder.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{develop and}} solve a new {{molecular}} model for nonlinear elasticity of entangled polymer networks. This model combines and generalizes several succeseful ideas introduced {{over the years}} in the field of the rubber elasticity. The topological constraints imposed by the neighboring network chains on a given network are represented by the confining potential that changes upon network deformation. This topological potential restricts fluctuations of the network chain to the nonaffinely deformed confining tube. Network chains are allowed to fluctuate and redistribute their length along the contour of their confining tubes. The dependence of the stress ó on the elongation coefficient ì for the uniaxially deformed network is usially represented {{in the form of the}} Mooney stress, f*(1 /ì)) ó/(ì- 1 /ì 2). We find a simple expression for the Mooney stress, f*(1 /ì)) Gc + Ge/(0. 74 ì + 0. 61 ì- 1 / 2 - 0. 35), where Gc and Ge are phantom and entangled network moduli.

40|$|For a {{quenched}} and tempered {{and subsequently}} shot peened steel plate of SAE 4140 the residual stress depth distribution was determined non-destructively by means of neutron diffraction at the STRESS-SPEC instrument at the research reactor FRM II, Garching (Germany). In contrast to conventional methods using strain scanning here an alternative approach was chosen. Strain scanning experiments suffer {{from the fact that}} for through surface scanning experiments laborious corrections have to be applied in order to compensate the geometrical effects of the partly immersed gauge volume.
