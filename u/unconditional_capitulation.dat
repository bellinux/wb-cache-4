The Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact was signed in Moscow on April 13, 1941, but was unilaterally renounced by the Soviet Union in 1945. On August 14, 1945, Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and {{on the following day}} announced <b>unconditional</b> <b>capitulation.</b> The Soviet operation to occupy the Kuril Islands took place between August 18 and September 3. Japanese inhabitants were repatriated two years later.|$|E
50|$|After the Chilean {{victories}} at {{the battles}} of Tacna and Arica, the southern department of Peru was on Chilean hands, so the Chilean government {{had no desire}} to continue the war. After all, the Bolivian zone in dispute which started the conflict was under Chilean domain, as well as the southernmost Peruvian department of Tarapaca, which was not in dispute but had started to {{play a significant role in}} financing the Chilean war effort. Despite this, the public opinion was divided. One side desired to end the war by conquering Lima, and the other one wanted to end the conflict right then, avoiding more casualties. The public debate reached the Chilean Congress, were José Miguel Balmaceda declared: The peace is at Lima, and nowhere else. This political and social climate forced both the Chilean government and its high command to plan a new campaign with the objective to obtain an <b>unconditional</b> <b>capitulation</b> at the Peruvian capital city. Hence, the peace talks on the Lackwanna known as the Conference of Arica were futile.|$|E

Early in July, Twining joined Task Force 38, with Admiral W.F. Halsey embarked in , {{for seven days}} of intensive training exercises {{in preparation for the}} long-awaited assault on the Japanese homeland. On 10 July, the task force arrived off Tokyo and, four days later, began launching strikes. On the 24th, Twining joined in antishipping sweeps off the Kure-Kobe area and, on the night of 24 and 25 July, took part in the bombardment of Shiono-Misaki airfield. Frequent enemy air activity occurred as Twining screened the carriers. Air strikes against Kure and Kobe late in July were followed early in August by additional strikes against northern Honshū. On 9 August, a kamikaze attempted to crash into Twining but, under intense fire from the ship, overshot the destroyer. At 06:05 on 15 August, Twining heard the carriers recall strikes bound for Tokyo targets; and, two hours later, Radio San Francisco announced the welcome news of Japans <b>unconditional</b> <b>capitulation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Under the [...] "Two Plus Four Treaty" [...] {{both the}} Federal Republic and the GDR {{committed}} {{themselves and their}} unified continuation to the principle that their joint pre-1990 boundaries constituted the entire territory that could be claimed by a Government of Germany, and hence {{that there were no}} further lands outside those boundaries that were parts of Germany as a whole. The 1990 Basic Law amendments required for German reunification also explicitly excluded providing redress or restitution for actions undertaken under the authority of the Soviet Occupation 1945-1949 prior to the founding of the Federal Republic and the GDR. This raised a further complex of constitutional issues, as a number of private individuals challenged the constitutionality of the reunification treaties; specifically in respect of the levels of compensation and restitution offered to persons whose property had been expropriated between 1945 and 1949 under Soviet authority. These plaintiffs argued that, as the Federal Republic had historically claimed its sovereignty to be a continuation of that of the former governments of the German Reich, so post-1990, it should provide restitution in favour of expropriated property owners (or their heirs) for actions in the period when German sovereign power had been suspended. The cases were eventually heard before the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in 2005; who found consistently in favour of the post-1990 actions of the Federal Republic - hence rejecting arguments from claimed continuity of the Federal Republic with the German Reich; declaring that the four Allied Powers had, in the years 1945 to 1949, exercised [...] "an occupation sui generis following a war and <b>unconditional</b> <b>capitulation,</b> which conferred powers of 'sovereignty' on the occupying forces." ...|$|E
40|$|After {{signing the}} Act of <b>Unconditional</b> <b>Capitulation,</b> and ending the Second World War in Europe, Germany {{was divided into}} four {{occupation}} zones, whereas Berlin was splitted into four sectors. The control and responsibility for zones and sectors were bom upon the USA, the USSR, the Great Britain and France, due to the acts signed within the years: 1944 and 1945. The acts were {{to make a decision}} about the future concerning four countries enumerated above. Dispersion o f the common politics of four superpowers towards “Germany and Great Berlin as the integrity” caused the actual setting of two German countries in 1949, namely the Republic of Federal Germany and German Democratic Republic, closely connected witch the political - military blocks, that is NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and The Warsaw Pact (Alliance of Communist Nations) since 1955. From that time the Gentian issue has become the core element of reality. In the first half of 1950 s the previous suspense connected with the German issue was inferior to difficult dialogue between the East and the West initiated in Geneva (from 18 th July until 23 rd July 1955) during the conference of political leaders of four superpowers, specified as “the ghost of Geneva”. The antagonistic blocks of the countries, being aware of danger of the new war outbreak, to with the politics of power would uneritably lead, started the period of transient cooperation. The period was characterized with attempts to develop the new rules of safety and disarmament. The German issue stepped down to the background, in comparison to the previous years, being the core point of the superpowers interest any more. Germany started to be viewed and treated as the element of militant balance to witch the countries on the oid continent were striving for after determining the political influences. As it turned out, the real prospects of achieving the detente and normalization of relations between the East and West were faint. First of all, a state of affairs resulted from the irreconcilable position taken by the sides of the dialogue as far as the above mentioned issues and concerned. The natural consequence was the impossibility of solving the German case, that is creating the premise enabling the unification of the nation being tom between two countries. Not only was the pan - German politics (the Deutschlandpolitic) absorbing the Republic of Federal Germany and German Democratic Republic, but also constituted the essential element of international politics, that is was its function. Taking into consideration the period in this facet, one should view it as time assigned for regeneiation of strength, modification of strategy and political tactics as well as military structure inside the blocks, in a word - for “taking a deep breath before the next confrontation which was initiated by USSR being disappointed with ineffectiveness ot diplomatic endeavours taken up so for. Thanks to the USSR, the centre of political gravity was transmitted again from macro- to micro-scale on more and more urgent Berlin ground, tipping the balance and being the barometer of moods and relationships prevailing between four superpowers and two German countries.
