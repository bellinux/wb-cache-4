30|$|The {{occurrence}} of pesticides residue, especially organochlorines (OCs) {{in the environment}} is a great worry due to their tendency for long-range transport. Also their capacity to bioaccumulate in food chain {{poses a threat to}} {{human health and the environment}} (Chau 2005; Zhou et al. 2006; Pandit et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2008). Pesticides enter and pollute any component of the environment in a number of ways, including application, accidental spillage or through the <b>unauthorized</b> <b>dumping</b> of pesticide products or their containers (Cox 2002). Contamination of water bodies for example is a major concern for fish and other aquatic organisms such as mussels, oysters, prawns and lobsters which are major sources of protein (Essumang and Chokky 2009). Accumulation of pesticides in these organisms has become a serious public health issue worldwide. Fish are used extensively for environmental monitoring because they concentrate pollutants directly from water and diet, thus enabling the assessment of transfer of pollutants through the food web (Bruggeman 1982; Fisk et al. 1998; Lanfranchi et al. 2006; Das et al. 2002).|$|E
40|$|Marais des Cygnes National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) {{was added}} to the National Wildlife Refuge system in 1992. The Refuge {{occupies}} approximately 2, 550 ha of bottomland hardwoods habitats along the Marais des Cygnes River in Linn County, Kansas. During public involvement in acquisition planning, the Service committed to opening the Refuge to recreational fishing. There are several water bodies on the Refuge which would provide recreational fishing opportunities. These include abandoned coal strip mines, small man-made farm ponds, and the Marais des Cygnes River and several tributaries to the river. Fish have been established in the coal mine and farm ponds either through human stocking efforts or by occasional flooding by the Marais des Cygnes River. As part of the obligation to provide safe recreational opportunities, an investigation of fish tissues was conducted to ensure that fish are not contaminated by heavy metals or other pollutants, and to establish that it is appropriate for the Service to open the Refuge to public fishing. Previous efforts investigated contaminant concerns prior to acquisition of the Refuge (Allen and Nash 1992, Allen et al. 1995). These efforts showed no evidence of major contaminant concerns on the Refuge. However, the evaluations did not include all bodies of water on the Refuge that might be opened to fishing. The water in the impoundments originates from watersheds that extend beyond the boundaries of the Refuge, and, as a result, may be influenced by various land uses, including agricultural runoff, urban point and non-point sources, and <b>unauthorized</b> <b>dumping.</b> Other water bodies are fed by ground water, which also may be impacted by anthropogenic or natural sources. Tissue samples collected in 1998 were analyzed for trace element, chlorinated hydrocarbon, and total petroleum hydrocarbon residue concentrations. While several contaminants were detected in many samples, none of the mean concentrations from any sample were sufficient to require creation of consumption advisories at the Refuge...|$|E

50|$|In Hungary, the {{proximity}} of Romani settlements to garbage dumps, along {{with a lack of}} access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure has been an ongoing concern. In a Romani shantytown in Heves, the recycling of car batteries from an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>dump</b> for income caused the death of one child and serious disabilities among a number of residents. In Hungary, it is believed that environmental health conditions contribute to the low life expectancy of Romani people, whose life expectancy is on average 10-15 years lower than for non-Romani.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{subsidence}} {{of structures}} above the mine shafts, along with encroaching contaminated mine waste compelled authorities to relocate residents from Pätoracké to new homes in Spišská Nová Ves and Smižany. However, the Romani shantytowns were not relocated, nor were new Romani migrants prevented from settling in the area. In 2007, {{in response to}} a sinkhole incident in 2001, 257 residents were relocated to new apartments, which while outside the landslide and subsidence danger zones, are still surrounded by dumps of mine waste, while also continuing to be ethnically segregated. As of 2009, over 300 people remained in the danger zone, living in a shantytown without sewers, sewage treatment, running water, or garbage collection. Meanwhile, residents from the main village of Rudňany municipality regularly dispose of household waste in an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>dump</b> 300 meters below the Pätoracké settlement.|$|R

In these areas the workers' exposure to the aforesaid contaminants potentially can involve of the biological equilibrium with consequent poisonings and/or professional diseases. The aim of this paper is the evaluation of the sanitary risk for the agricultural employees that operate in a rural area of southern Italy in the Campania Region, characterized by the presence of agrarian crops in open fields and inside greenhouses. This area is also concerneded by the presence of pollutants released during the years by <b>unauthorized</b> <b>dumps.</b> The results point out that the hazard index HQ and the cancer increase risk R for the agricultural operators that work inside greenhouses or on open fields are widely below the legal limits. Furthermore the agricultural operators that work inside greenhouses, where the air replacements are produced by side and ridge openings and defective tightness of the covering, are exposed to a much greater sanitary environmental risk (HQ and R) than the labourers employed on open fields...|$|R
40|$|Few {{countries}} in the world task their military with the role of marine pollution response in addition to its responsibility as a military service. One country that does is the United States of America. The United States Coast Guard has, in addition to its military and security missions, the task of marine pollution response and enforcement. This program includes the prevention of oil and chemical spills, <b>unauthorized</b> ocean <b>dumping</b> and to prevent the introduction of invasive marine species into the maritime environment. This paper considers the operational and environmental costs associated with a major oil spill and the revenue recovered from the responsible parties. It does this through the example of the USCGC Alex Haley and its role in preventing a major oil spill and protecting local wildlife sanctuaries during its search and rescue efforts following the grounding of the M/V Selendang Ayu in December 2004. The vessel was carrying approximately 1, 601, 055 litres of fuel and was seen as a potential risk. The paper concludes with a summary of recent emergencies involving the US Coast Guard...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen portal systems {{installed}} {{at the entrance of}} as many iron scrap recycling plants have been tested. The systems which underwent the test were supplied bythree manufacturers: Bicron, Eberline and Exploranium. For the tests, a truck trailer loaded with iron scrap was equipped with guide tubes for the introduction of radioactive sources. During the whole experimental campaign, the truck trailer was not modified, to assure test reproducibility. Analyzing the collected data, it was determined the lowest exposure intensityin air from a 137 Cs source still able to cause an alarm when, centered in the load, passes through anyportal. On the basis of this value it follows a risk evaluation for a steelworks equipped (in agreement with the rules of Lombardia region) with a portal at the entrance, area monitors for critical sites and gamma spectrometer for steel specimen. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords: Orphan sources; Portal system; Smelting accident 1. Introduction Several reports (Lubenau and Yusko, 1998) on accidental smelting of radioactive sources in furnaces confirm the possibilitythat radioactive material might be mixed with scrap. In Italysome accidents took place in the past; the major are here listed (Risica and Neccetelli, 2000) : • 1990 137 Cs contamination of an aluminium refineryin two facilities and the relevant waste dump; • 1991 137 Cs contamination of an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>dump</b> of wastes from aluminium melting; • 1991 241 Am contamination of some copper alloymanufacturer and melting firms; • 1993 137 Cs contamination of a part of the Brescia and Montirone goods yard; ∗ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. doi: 10. 1016 /j. radmeas. 2004. 05. 007 • 1995 137 Cs contamination of dust from settled fumes in a steel mill in the decommissioning phase; • 1997 137 Cs and 60 Co contamination of the Alfa Acciai steel mill; • 1998 137 Cs contamination of the soil in a scrap storage depot. The most severe accident was that happened at Alfa Acciai steel mill, in which 7 GBq of 60 Co and 150 GBq of 137 Cs were molten in furnace. The consequences of the accident were rather limited. Indeed, part of the final product was contaminated byCo- 60, but the dust abatement plant had been effective in avoiding release of 137 Cs in the surrounding environment. Nevertheless, the total cost of the accident was more than 25 million Euros, including the decontamination of the plant and the missed profits. After this accident, the Lombardia Regional Council issued an Ordinance (Regione Lombardia, 1997) to impose different radiometric surveys on metal scrap to be recycled. A first monitoring must be performed on the scrap container at the entrance of the steel mill. The Ordinance does not specifywha...|$|R
40|$|The {{demographic}} {{expansion of}} {{cities in the}} Alto Valle and the regional tendencies for social practices of leisure and recreation, mark an increasing preference of population towards the surrounding rugged landscape and the consequent increase in the load pressure on semi-arid and sparsely anthropied environments of the south margin of the rivers Limay and Negro. As an example, {{it is enough to}} mention the practice of not regulated sport activities that are aggressive for environment, which contribute to accelerate erosion processes, loss of vegetation and soils, etc., while the unplanned urban development characterized by the lack of basic services in the suburbs, has led to a high rate of extraction of wood resources of the bush, the emergence of <b>unauthorized</b> micro rubbish <b>dumps,</b> greater frequency in the fire occurrence, etc. Given this context, the Rio Negro provincial government has materialized in 2010 an old regulation initiative aimed at sustainable management of those lands. This paper is a revised and shortened version of the biophysical studies of carried out {{as a part of the}} interdisciplinary technical reports for the "Management Plan of the Protected Natural Area (PNA) Cretaceous Valley" of the Rio Negro Province. The physiographic systems study shows that there is a marked susceptibility to the erosion processes increase, especially gully erosion. The natural vegetation, as a consequence of its physiognomic characteristics adapted to semiarid and mesothermal climate and of the historical social land use overloading, currently presents a low coverage, associated with low levels of soil aggregation. This is the starting point to explain the most obvious features of land degradation in the area. The approach with a perspective oriented to the dynamic nature of natural processes, contributes to the goal of designing proposals for conservation, remediation and management of resources in terms of a sustainable landscape and cultural appropriation by the regional society. ...|$|R
