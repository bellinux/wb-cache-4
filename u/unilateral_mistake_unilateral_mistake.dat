40|$|The {{most common}} {{contract}} defenses are duress, unconscionability, incapacity, fraud, {{and the basic}} assumption. defenses 4 of mutual <b>mistake,</b> <b>unilateral</b> <b>mistake,</b> impossibility, frustration of purpose and commercial impracticability. In this Article, I limit my discussion to basic assumption defenses. Several prevailing rationales explain why a party {{should be allowed to}} escape contractual liability despite the sufficiency of consideration where there has been a failure of a basic assumption material to the transaction. No single rationale or principle, however, unifies all basic assumption defenses. Several commentators have noted that similar fact patterns applying a given doctrine often yield inconsistent results. Parties’ employment of these defenses, and courts’ analyses of them, is often confusing and inaccurate. This Article proposes that basic assumption defenses can best be explained and analyzed through the prism of contractual intent. Although typically discussed in terms of a singular concept, contractual intent in fact comprises various facets, which I refer to as volitional intent, cognitive intent, and contextual purposive intent. Part II provides an introduction to, and description of, my proposed expanded intent analysis. Part III applies expanded intent analysis to cases involving basic assumption defenses. Part IV addresses possible concerns with using a dynamic approach/expanded intent analysis. This Article concludes that adopting my proposed intent-based analysis has several advantages over the current application of contract defenses. First and foremost, it directly addresses and incorporates contract law’s two primary objectives: furthering autonomy and facilitating transactions. Second, because it removes artificial doctrinal distinctions, it eliminates or minimizes confusion and simplifies analysis. Consequently, it provides for greater consistency in judicial decisions. Finally, the approach is flexible, and therefore better accommodates technological advancements, such as the Internet, in the modern marketplace...|$|R

This comment focuses on the effect of a <b>unilateral</b> <b>mistake</b> on a contract, particularly on the potential paths of developments following from the case. The court found that the plaintiffs knew or had a real belief, or ought to have known, that the defendant was acting under a mistake that was fundamental and related to an essential term of the contract, and the contract was therefore void under the common law.

Mr Smith was held to be under no duty to inform Mr Hughes of his possible mistake {{about the kind of}} oats, reaffirming the old idea of caveat emptor (buyer beware). A <b>unilateral</b> <b>mistake</b> is therefore in principle no ground for rescission of a contract. Cockburn CJ gave the first judgment.|$|R

HCA 5] It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in Lewis v.

50|$|Generally, a <b>unilateral</b> <b>mistake</b> {{by itself}} {{is not enough to}} win an order.

The conduct must be unconscionable, perhaps by diverting one's attention with false and misleading leading statements, but not amounting to a mistake caused by misrepresentation. So for instance, in George Wimpey UK (Ltd) v VI Construction Ltd a land buyer misunderstood the formula for assessing extra payments if the sale price of flats exceeded a particular figure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I ask whether English Law should permit {{rescission}} for <b>unilateral</b> <b>mistakes</b> {{in the formation}} of contract, in circumstances where the defendant (D) knew or should have known about the claimant’s (C) mistake, and if so, should Equity be (re) employed to deploy the remedy. The paper introduces the Caveat Emptor Common Law rule on this issue, which rules out rescission, and the various considerations that count in its favour. I argue that neither considerations from efficiency, nor those based in ethics can justify the current rule, and that new, flexible and morally-sensitive resolution is called for. If we examine the way in which Equity intervenes to reform areas of law where the Common Law fails to provide a satisfactory solution to legal disputes, we will see that the Caveat Emptor rule displays exactly the kind of defects that Equity does a very good job at remedying. The law on the duty to disclose information at the precontractual stage emerges as an excellent example for Equity’s great potential as a vehicle for improving the law in a measured, nuanced and imaginative way.
