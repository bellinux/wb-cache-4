40|$|In {{recent years}} several factors changed the {{importance}} of the Arctic in international relations. Firstly, the rapid melting of Arctic ice cover opened potential access to vast natural resources within the Arctic Ocean seabed. It is estimated that the Arctic may contain one quarter of world's <b>undiscovered</b> <b>reserves</b> of oil and gas. Secondly, the water ways along the Russian and Canadian northern coasts became ice-free, although so far just for few days every year. Should the Arctic Ocean continue to melt, then in several decades the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage could become navigable for greater part of the year. This would shorten the journey distance from Europe to Asia by as much as forty percent, thereby cutting travel times and shipping costs. Finally, as the Arctic does not belong to any single country, there has been an increasing interest among the Arctic rim states, which have been working on delineating their maritime boundaries in order to ensure their territorial claims. This process has proceeded in accordance with the international legal framework as established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

40|$|The Exploration Node {{focuses on}} the search for {{assessment}} and quantification of phosphate reserves and resources {{in relation to the}} geopotential (i. e., the <b>undiscovered</b> <b>reserves</b> and resources). The Exploration Node encompasses all aspects of the predevelopment stages of phosphate deposits from initial discovery of deposits to the involved feasibility studies required to obtain funding {{for the development of a}} mine. The feasibility of producing phosphate rock (PR) can be broadly defined in terms of technical feasibility and economic feasibility. In order for potential ores to be classified as reserves, consideration must be given to issues of grade, quality, operating, and investment costs which include studies of the accessibility and availability of financing. Details about these considerations are often proprietary, making it difficult to publically assess the resource picture. Phosphorus is the eleventh most abundant element. P is essential for life and cannot be sub stituted by other elements in food production. The given knowledge about reserves and resources, the accessibility, and scarcity of phosphorus and phosphate rock may depend on available technologies and is finally an economic question. We discuss a number of parameters which may indicate whether scarcity of a resource may be an increasing concern. These include the resource/consumption ratio, Hubbert-curve-based peak predictions, trends in ore grade, new resource discovery rates, and resource pricing as they are important for understanding exploration efforts. We further discuss estimates of reserves and the trends in actual estimates of phosphate reserves. P reserve estimates are dynamic and will increase for some time. Nevertheless, at some time in the long-term future, there will be a peak such as there will be a point in time that mined P becomes less economical than conservation and recovery...|$|E

Chapter 1 describes a dynamic model designed to calculate the EROI of offshore energy extraction in the U. S.

In 2004, the EROI of the process is estimated to range from 10 to 25 depending on how comprehensively energy costs are defined. In comparison, the EROI of U. S. onshore petroleum extraction in the 1930 s was at least 100. Ecosystem services are those functions of ecosystems that support, directly or indirectly, human welfare. Although interest in ecosystem services has surged in recent decades and is currently still on the rise, these phenomena have yet to be universally quantified.

40|$|In mature {{hydrocarbon}} provinces, {{the impact}} of production induced pressure depletion on un-produced or <b>undiscovered</b> <b>reserves</b> is a concern. Reduced formation pressure has an adverse effect on recoverability, but more problematic are accumulations that are filled to spill, where a reduction of formation pressure results either in gas exsolution or gas cap expansion and loss of liquids from the trap. In the Australian context, the latter is of significant concern owing to the gas rich nature of many of its sedimentary basins. Standard reservoir engineering techniques {{have been used to}} evaluate {{the impact of}} pressure depletion with mixed results. There are three assumptions typically made in the reservoir models that are normally valid for a single pool, but can add significant uncertainty when applied to a region of several pools, or worse yet, at the sub-basin or basin-scale. The first assumption is that the virgin pressure state of the aquifer {{at the base of the}} hydrocarbon column can be approximated by an average hydrostatic formation water pressure gradient. The second is that all pressure data can be referenced to a common reservoir datum by correcting each measured formation pressure using an assumed fluid pressure gradient. The third is that the aquifer which supports one or more hydrocarbon pools has a fixed volume. The study of basin hydrodynamics uses techniques that take into account the fact that, while the pre-production trapped hydrocarbon phase is static, the aquifer at the base of the hydrocarbon accumulation is dynamic. Regional boundary conditions can be identified that drive formation water flow and help define formation water influx and discharge from an aquifer system rather than assuming a fixed aquifer volume. Pressures in an aquifer may therefore vary for a given depth, due to variations in the hydraulic potential field resulting from differences in aquifer properties across a sub-basin. Hydrodynamic techniques also characterise formation pressure data using a hydraulic head to avoid the requirement of referencing a formation pressure to a depth datum. It removes the need to assume a particular fluid pressure gradient when the fluid composition is not known. This paper describes how hydrodynamic techniques can be incorporated into the static and dynamic reservoir models to reduce errors and uncertainty in the model results. These include the use of a potentiometric energy distribution for the aquifer to obtain aquifer pressure rather than an average hydrostatic gradient and a basin wide depth datum, and the characterisation of natural inflows and discharges rather than assuming a fixed aquifer volume. The approach is exemplified with data from various basins...|$|E

As the quest turns to deeper water, new advances in technology will be {{required in order to}} utilize these remote reserves economically. Large floating storage tanks, often converted oil tankers, have been used as part of the development scheme for several offshore fields. These tanks eliminate the need for expensive pipelines to shore. In this paper, a new mooring system concept for such permanently moored storage vessels is presented. This mooring system, referred to as the Storage Production Terminal (SPT), maintains the floating storage vessel on location even during the worst possible storm. The SPT consists of a submerged swivel structure attached directly to the bow of a ship. Chains emanating from the swivel connect to anchors on the seafloor. Hoses connect the seabed pipeline to the swivel structure. The historical background leading to the SPT concept is presented, and existing mooring systems are described. The features and characteristics of the system are discussed. Design loads were calculated and confirmed by small scale model tests.

Moreover, it is estimated that approximately 84 % of the undiscovered oil and gas occurs offshore. There are numerous challenges and environmental factors that must be overcome before one can conduct oil and gas exploration, and engage production activities in Arctic regions. Superstructure icing from sea spray and atmospheric icing affect operation and maintenance of offshore production facilities in various ways including repair time, failure rate of mechanical and electrical components, power losses, life cycle cost, and safety hazard and can cause downtime in the facilities. These problems are motivating designers, manufacturers and safety researchers to find better practical solutions for ice protection technologies. Many active and passive anti-icing and de-icing techniques have been used in different industries such as electric power. However, Arctic offshore operational conditions provide new challenges for application of these methods and they have limitation of usage due to harsh and sensitive environment and wilderness, lack of infrastructure as well as distance to the market. Hence, such conditions must be considered during design and operation phase for anti-icing and de-icing techniques. This paper discusses how operational conditions of Arctic region can affect the application of available anti-icing and de-icing techniques.

Bringing together prominent Arctic experts from the three North Pacific arctic coastal states (Canada, Russia, and the United States) and three leading North Pacific non-arctic states (China, Japan, and Korea), the book goes beyond generalities; it addresses the details of major concerns {{in an effort to}} identify practical solutions to Arctic marine issues and move them from paper to practice. On implications of Arctic transformation for the North Pacific, the book explores the consequences of the changes across the Arctic in a world affairs framework, within a governance framework for the North Pacific nations. The consequences of climate and environmental changes and the realities of globalization are explored, as well as the implications of these changes of Arctic and non-Arctic countries and indigenous and other peoples of the North. On opening of the NSR and changes in North Pacific transportation and logistics, the book reviews, in considerable detail, the implications of the opening of the Arctic near-continent seaways, particularly along the NSR. The potential for maritime operations along the NSR has substantially increased because the annual minimum of the extent of Arctic sea ice for 2011 is only 50 % of what it was only 35 years earlier, a reduction in extent that is the lowest in 10, 000 years and a first in modern human history. On North Pacific access to Arctic energy resources, the book addresses the implications of the strategic importance of Arctic oil and gas for energy security in the North Pacific. The Arctic region is likely to contain substantial <b>undiscovered</b> hydrocarbon <b>reserves</b> that are projected to include about 13 % of the world's <b>undiscovered</b> oil <b>reserves</b> and 30 % of its natural gas. It has been noted that the major parts of these oil reserves are close to Alaska's coast, while practically all the natural gas reserves are near Russia's shores, with over 90 % on the Yamal Peninsula. Overall, more than 60 % of Arctic oil and gas resources are deposited in areas that belong to or are claimed by the Russian Federation. On promoting North Pacific cooperation on the governance of Arctic marine shipping and energy resource development, the book examines the implications of major international governance issues for access to and use of the three major Arctic routes: the Bering Strait, Northwest Passage and NSR. The book underscores the many ways in which the Arctic is changing and the challenges and opportunities that this represents: There is increasing interaction and feedback between the regions of the Northern Hemisphere and the Arctic, with consequences for climate change, ecosystems, human health, economic and resource development, and societies.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Increasing {{seasonal}} ice free Arctic {{waters and}} market demand to expand hydrocarbon extraction to previously undeveloped offshore regions has accelerated an Arctic priority in national strategies and international forums. It is proposed that geo-strategically, {{the sheer size}} of the Kara Sea hydrocarbon fields is of a predictive magnitude great enough to impact the progression or regression of the Russian economy; and thereby have a predictive value on the capacity for Russian unilateral foreign policy decisions. Rosneft has released figures of a potential 30 to 40 billion barrels of recoverable <b>undiscovered</b> oil <b>reserves</b> in the South Kara Sea basin and significantly more in the more remote northern waters, representing the largest unexploited hydrocarbon potential remaining for the Russian Federation. There are also undercurrents of skepticism that the Russians may not achieve offshore production at the pace and or scale they envision. Though the direct economic contributions to the global economy of exploitation of Kara Sea hydrocarbons is likely not a game changer, the technological sophistication it will require and the level of cooperation and integration needed between the most advanced Western corporate techniques and Russian partners, could well be for Russian central state stability. In this context, hydrocarbon development in the Kara Sea region lends itself to interdisciplinary study as a means to assess Russia's relative strategic stability. The research incorporated two primary tools to assess the drivers impacting successful Russian hydrocarbon development of its Kara Sea resources. The first was a survey-interview of experts and the second was the creation of scenario narratives (assisted by a workshop of Arctic experts and stakeholders). The four scenarios were designed to explore the complexity of the interplay of the drivers of hydrocarbon development in the Kara Sea, with the objective, of identifying plausible future decision points for planners and policy makers...|$|R

Transportation of the natural gas from the remote ANS is the key issue in effective utilization of this valuable and abundance resource. The throughput of oil through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) has been on decline and is expected to continue to decline in future. It is projected that by the year 2015, ANS crude oil production will decline to such a level that there will be a critical need for pumping additional liquid from GTL process to provide an adequate volume for economic operation of TAPS. The pumping of GTL products through TAPS will significantly increase its economic life. Transporting GTL products from the North Slope of Alaska down to the Marine terminal at Valdez is no doubt the great challenge facing the Gas to Liquids options of utilizing the abundant natural gas resource of the North Slope. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate and assess the economic feasibility of transporting GTL products through the TAPS. Material testing program for GTL and GTL/Crude oil blends was designed and implemented for measurement of physical properties of GTL products. The measurement and evaluation of the properties of these materials were necessary so as to access the feasibility of transporting such materials through TAPS under cold arctic conditions. Results of the tests indicated a trend of increasing yield strength with increasing wax content. GTL samples exhibited high gel strengths at temperatures as high as 20 F, which makes it difficult for cold restart following winter shutdowns. Simplified analytical models were developed to study the flow of GTL and GTL/crude oil blends through TAPS in both commingled and batch flow models. The economics of GTL transportations by either commingled or batching mode were evaluated. The choice of mode of transportation of GTL products through TAPS would depend on the expected purity of the product and a trade-off between loss in product value due to contamination and cost of keeping the product pure at the discharge terminal...|$|R

Furthermore, according to the data reported by the US Geological Survey, over one tenth of the undiscovered oil and around one third of the <b>undiscovered</b> natural gas <b>reserves</b> are believed to be stored in the Arctic region. There is a huge potential for the energy exploration in the Arctic. Due to the public concerns regarding the safety and environmental sensitive in this region, sailing and operation in the Arctic region has been attracted increasing attention. In marine industry, great challenge can also come from the technical immaturity related to the icebergs and low temperature effects, which are the major threats to the safe vessel operating in the Arctic region. The iceberg with huge inertia can cause serious damage on vessels' structure if there is a collision happened between the ship and iceberg even though the ice is considered to be fragile. The low temperature can contribute to a higher steel yield stress but also lead to be brittle characteristics. The steel will have lower failure strain value due to low temperatures. In addition to these factors, the consequence of an ice-ship collision may be affected by other factors like the shape of the iceberg, boundary conditions, collisions etc. In order to have a detail investigation into the collision in the Arctic region, FE simulation is implemented in this thesis project. It is expected that the collision will lead to non-linear deformation of the metal structure. The explicit simulation method is used to model the collision phenomena. The simulation is carried out by the FE software ANSYS Workbench Explicit using the dynamic explicit solver of AUTODYN. Many cases are raised in this thesis report to conclude the factors that influence the collision results. Different ambient conditions and collision scenarios are distinguished in those cases.

40|$|Conversion {{of natural}} gas is {{becoming}} increasingly relevant {{in the future as}} the world energy market will demand cleaner fuels, cleaner production of fuels and better utilization of the large, remote, and still <b>undiscovered</b> gas <b>reserves</b> in the world. The refining of the natural gas to synthetic gasoline, diesel and future energy fuels such as methanol and hydrogen is a solution for making the most of these gas reserves. The intermediate process step in gas refining, the synthesis gas production from natural gas, represents 60 – 80 % of the total investment cost of a methanol or synthetic fuels plant. This drives the technological development within this process field towards improvements for increasing the efficiency and reducing the costs. The synthetic gas production by steam reforming is a widely used, expensive and energy demanding technology. Steam reformers demand large base areas and are heated by natural gas combustion. Technological developments {{over the past two decades}} have lead to an alternative steam reformer, the gas heated reformer, which is a compact unit heated by flue gas or by further converted and heated synthesis gas. This doctoral thesis is treating the gas heated steam reformer (GHR). The motivation was to develop a complete mathematical model combining of the reactor side and the hot gas side of the reformer and furthermore to investigate the best mathematical descriptions of the heat transport mechanisms involved. The complete model should be as simple as possible but nevertheless be on a level where the important heat transport mechanisms are adequately modelled. The resulting model is a two-dimensional, finite difference model of a packed bed catalytic tube enclosed by an annular section for counter current flow of the heating gas. The separate partial models, the reactor model and the annulus model, are connected by iterative solution with direct substitution of the temperature and heat flux profiles of the outer reactor tube wall. The reactor model comes in two versions: a heterogeneous model and a pseudohomogeneous model. The species transport is described by radial dispersion, axial convection and chemical reaction. The heat transport is modelled with terms for radial conduction, axial convection and the heat sink related to the net endothermic reactions. The annulus model is a simplified plug flow model disregarding the turbulence present. The effect of the turbulent flow on the radial heat transport is still included, by using an effective radial thermal conductivity in the temperature equation. The values for the effective radial thermal conductivities are provided by external simulations in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), where turbulence is modelled by the k-ε turbulence model. The radial heat transport by gas radiation is included by solving the radiative intensity equations by the discrete ordinates method. The method of importing data for the effective radial thermal conductivity calculated with CFD was evaluated by running test simulations comparable to the CFD simulations. The results showed almost identical axial and radial temperature profiles in the two models when all dissimilarities in the models were allowed for. This simplifying method was thus approved adequate for the purpose. It was also found that the inclusion of the radial profile of the effective radial thermal conductivity was significant for the overall GHR simulations. Using a mean value for the effective radial thermal conductivity did not result in temperature profiles similar to the profiles of the CFD simulations where turbulence was modelled. The restrictions related to the mass and heat transport between the gas bulk and the porous pellets were investigated. These resistances are usually neglected in heterogeneous steam reformer modelling based on assumptions that they do not affect the overall reactor simulation results. The heterogeneous reactor model of this thesis includes all pellet transport resistances. Estimations showed that the reaction effectiveness factors, which are defined relative to the pellet surface conditions, were greater than the alternative effectiveness factors defined relative to the bulk conditions. This implies that there exist transport limitations between the two phases. These transport restrictions were found to be of importance when evaluating local effects, as reaction kinetics in general and approach to equilibrium for the coke reactions responsible for catalyst deactivation. On the other hand, the overall reactor simulations were hardly influenced by the interphase transport limitations. This was seen from comparative simulations of the pseudo-homogeneous model using the effectiveness factors and the alternative effectiveness factors. These simulation results were almost equal, while the latter was identical to the results of the heterogeneous model accounting for the resistances. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
