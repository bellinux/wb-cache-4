25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E
500|$|Miles {{was one of}} {{only three}} men (Hargest was one of the others) known to British Military Intelligence to have escaped from an Italian prisoner-of-war camp and make their way to another country prior to the {{armistice}} with Italy. In Switzerland, Miles and Hargest split up and travelled independently. As Hargest wrote in his book Farewell Campo 12, [...] "I was over in Lucerne when Miles rang <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was off, and to suggest I should follow him later". Having travelled as far as the Spanish frontier on 20 October 1943, exhausted and depressed, Miles shot himself. He was buried with military honours, and escorted to his final resting place in the Figueras Municipal Cemetery by members of the British Consulate and a party of Spanish officers. Shortly before his death, his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire was confirmed.|$|E
500|$|Hargest was {{transported to}} Italy {{where he was}} {{initially}} held in a villa near Sulmona but was transferred, along with a fellow New Zealander, Brigadier Reginald Miles, who had been captured in December 1941, to Castle Vincigliata, known as Campo 12, near Florence. Campo 12 was a prison camp for officers of general and brigadier rank and the prisoners were held under more comfortable conditions than soldiers of lesser rank. In late March 1943, a group of officers, including Hargest and Miles, managed to escape using a tunnel dug from a disused chapel within the castle walls. Of the six escapees, Hargest and Miles {{were the only two}} to reach safety in neutral Switzerland, where they split up to independently try to make their way to England. As Hargest later related [...] "I was over in Lucerne when Miles rang <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was off, and to suggest I should follow him later". Miles made it to Figueras, close to the Spanish frontier, but, overcome with depression, killed himself on 20 October. With the help of the French Resistance, Hargest travelled through France to Spain, where he reached the British Consulate in Barcelona. He flew to England in December 1943.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{remarkable}} turnaround, Lewis {{became the most}} bankable country star in the world. [...] He was so hot in 1970 that his former Smash producer Shelby Singleton, who purchased Sun Records from Sam Phillips in July 1969, {{wasted no time in}} repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. [...] One of his latter unreleased Sun recordings, [...] "One Minute Past Eternity," [...] was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent Mercury hit [...] "She Even Woke Me <b>Up</b> <b>To</b> <b>Say</b> Goodbye." [...] Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following The Golden Cream of the Country with A Taste of Country later in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice", {{directed}} by Sophie Muller, uses {{the contrast of}} dark and white colors. The video starts with a scene of Natalie painting the white clothes {{of the other two}} band members, Martie and Emily, with black paint, which symbolizes the boycott of the band. Then, Natalie is seen wearing a black dress with her hands on a puddle of black paint. In another scene, the band members are sitting in a chair and when Natalie gets <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something, Martie and Emily pull her back in to the chair. Then, Natalie and the other Dixie Chicks are seen in an environment that looks like a classroom and the teacher sends Natalie to write the English proverb [...] "To talk without thinking is to shoot without aiming" [...] on the blackboard. On the final scenes of the video, Natalie is seen in front of three doctors in {{what appears to be a}} mental institution, trying to escape from them. The video ends with a close shot of Natalie.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, {{including}} four chart toppers. [...] Hits include [...] "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", [...] "To Make Love Sweeter For You", [...] "She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", [...] "Since I Met You Baby", [...] "Once More With Feeling", [...] "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)", and [...] "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as Another Place, Another Time and She Even Woke Me <b>Up</b> <b>To</b> <b>Say</b> Goodbye, was sparse, {{quite different from}} the slick [...] "Nashville sound" [...] that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. [...] The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as George Jones and Merle Haggard. [...] In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording [...] "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".|$|E
6000|$|Sir Richmond {{manifested}} {{no surprise}} at the warning. But he stuck to his point. His voice was faint but firm. [...] "Couldn't make <b>up</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her. Anything she'd like." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a {{separate}} interview, Jackson stated that {{while on the}} surface Lucky may not want the child to be his, deep down he thinks {{a part of the}} character does. Elizabeth hopes Lucky is the father, thinking {{it is the only way}} she can salvage their relationship, and has a difficult time coming to terms with Lucky not wanting her anymore. After Lucky finds her suffering from hypothermia in the church where they said their vows as teenagers, and later has to talk her down off the roof of the hospital, she is sent to Shadybrook sanitarium. This prompts Lucky to be gentler about his anger, and to stop drinking before suffering a serious relapse. Jackson explained: [...] "The crisis that's going on with Elizabeth, the fact that Cam and Jake don't have a mother right now, I think that sort of wakes Lucky <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'I need to get my stuff together because I need to be present for those kids.'" [...] Elizabeth gives birth to Aiden, and they believe Nikolas to be the father due to Helena tampering with the DNA test. Aiden is kidnapped by Franco, forcing Lucky to work together with Nikolas, which starts to repair their relationship. Still feeling lost, Lucky accepts an undercover assignment to pose as an Irish hitman named Ronan O'Reilly, coincidentally his doppelgänger. Lucky works to take down [...] "The Balkan", and meets Siobhan McKenna (Chambers), who initially puts an end to his romantic bad luck streak. They face trouble when Siobhan is blackmailed by The Balkan and hides it from Lucky, who is sensitive to betrayal after Elizabeth's affair. They eventually plan a green card marriage so that she can stay in the country with him. During their first ceremony, Lucky learns his son Jake has been in a hit-and-run accident, that eventually renders him braindead. Jake's death sets another string of tragic events in motion. Lucky finds out his father was the driver, and accuses Luke of driving drunk. Lucky is adamant that his father is an alcoholic, but Luke refutes that Lucky wants to blame the alcohol so that he does not have to blame him. Lucky eventually stages an intervention, which only angers Luke. Lucky tracks Luke down to the brothel where Luke grew up, but when Luke tells Lucky that it liberated him to kill Jake, Lucky leaves. Distraught, he burns down his childhood home, accidentally injuring Siobhan. Elizabeth finds Lucky and tells him that he is Aiden's father, stopping Lucky from drinking. In May 2011, Jackson spoke of the unending turmoil in Lucky's life: ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding another {{possible}} {{run for office}} by {{her husband in the}} 2012 presidential election, Romney said in March 2010 that this time the process would hold no surprises, and that if he decided in favor of doing it, [...] "I'm <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>saying,</b> go storm the castle, sweetie."
