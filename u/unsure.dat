5|$|In a 2010 interview, Armstrong {{explained}} that NASA limited his Moon walk {{to two hours}} because they were <b>unsure</b> how the spacesuits would handle the extreme temperature of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} {{historically}} {{placed in the}} wood-warblers (Parulidae) but nonetheless most authorities were <b>unsure</b> if it belonged there. It was placed in its own family in 2017.|$|E
5|$|After the play, the revolutionaries {{returned}} to Peña's house. They learned {{the result of}} the meeting with Cisneros, but were <b>unsure</b> as to whether Cisneros intended to keep his word. They organized a demonstration for the following day to ensure that the open cabildo would be held as decided.|$|E
5|$|However, Larson's {{streak of}} hitting his marks every time {{stretched}} {{the length of}} the episode well past the usual thirty minutes and the producers were <b>unsure</b> how to proceed. While the entire episode was recorded in one shot, the production staff decided that it would need to be split up for airing.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, the Ministry of Civil Aviation {{resolved}} {{that the}} domestic terminal of RGIA would be named after N. T. Rama Rao, resulting in protests {{from members of}} the Rajya Sabha. Airport officials remained <b>unsure</b> as to how the naming would occur.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unsure</b> {{when the}} sermon was {{actually}} given, but some critics suggest it was read {{immediately following the}} publication of Swift's Letter to the Whole People of Ireland while others place it in October 1724.|$|E

5|$|Scott—still <b>unsure</b> who his {{ships were}} firing at, and {{afraid that they}} might be firing on his own destroyers—ordered a ceasefire at 23:47, {{although}} not every ship complied. Scott ordered Farenholt to flash her recognition signals and upon observing that Farenholt was close to his formation, he ordered the fire resumed at 23:51.|$|E
5|$|The Confederates {{were still}} able to {{evacuate}} Winchester (including a hospital), and Averell did not pursue the retreating rebels because he was <b>unsure</b> {{if the rest of}} Confederate General Early's army was nearby. This Union victory was the second of three major Union victories won under the leadership of General Averell.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{record deal}} was {{relatively}} poor for the time: a £5,000 advance over five years, low royalties and no free studio time. However, it did include album development, and EMI, <b>unsure</b> {{of exactly what}} kind of band they had signed, gave them free rein to record whatever they wanted.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{about the}} failure of the project, The New York Times and other {{newspapers}} suggested that Copia had failed to clearly define its focus. Potential tourists were left feeling <b>unsure</b> whether they were visiting a museum, a cooking school, or a promotional center for wine.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were <b>unsure</b> of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{receives}} a hero's welcome, Katniss is warned by Haymitch {{that she has}} now become a target after defying the Capitol so publicly. Afterward, Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that her actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to gain sympathy from the audience. However, Katniss is <b>unsure</b> of her own feelings.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are <b>unsure</b> if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Disney was <b>unsure</b> {{whether to}} release the film in theaters or direct-to-video. The studio was {{interested}} in Matthew McConaughey as Sparrow because of his resemblance to Burt Lancaster, who had inspired that script's interpretation of the character. If they chose to release it direct-to-video, Christopher Walken or Cary Elwes would have been their first choices.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} album had been completed, Collins was unhappy about leaving the drumkit to sing lead, {{and the band}} were <b>unsure</b> he would be {{comfortable}} as frontman on tour. The group decided to try anyway, and needed someone to drum while Collins was singing. Collins insisted on choosing the touring drummer himself, selecting Bill Bruford, who he had already worked with in Brand X. Collins continued to drum during instrumental sections.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium, {{once one}} of the best stadiums in Triple-A baseball, began to be out shined by newer {{state-of-the-art}} ballparks being built in the late 1980s. The Reds let their player development contract (PDC) with the Sounds expire so they could place their Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis, which was closer to Cincinnati and was planning to build a new stadium. Nashville entered the offseason <b>unsure</b> of their next major league affiliate.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{quicksand}} predator trap {{was discovered}} containing multiple Utahraptor specimens {{ranging in age}} from fully grown adult to tiny 3 foot long baby. Some scientists have hypothesized this is evidence of family hunting behaviour, however the full sandstone block is yet to be opened and researchers are <b>unsure</b> {{as to whether or not}} the animals died at the same time or not.|$|E
5|$|In August 1964, the Beatles {{returned}} to the United States for a second visit, this time remaining for a month-long tour. Epstein was <b>unsure</b> about the group's popularity in the US, and avoided booking them into stadiums. At the opening date at the Cow Palace, San Francisco on August 19, over 17,000 fans turned out to see the group.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s several {{managers}} {{realized the}} economic effect of design, which increased {{the demand for}} design management. As companies were <b>unsure</b> how to manage design, there was a market for consultancy; focusing on helping organizations manage the product development process, including market research, product concepts, projects, communications, and market launch phases—as well as the positioning of products and companies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the short}} time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford {{engineers}} produced many significant technological advances. As {{no one had ever}} built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were <b>unsure</b> how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, DuPont engineers installed ammonia-based refrigeration systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Campbell {{traveled}} with Angie Lewis to New Orleans {{for the annual}} convention of the American Nursing Association in June, where they gave a 45-minute or hour-long presentation — possibly a plenary session — about AIDS and HIV, having been invited at the last minute; Lewis suggested {{this may have been}} because the ANA were <b>unsure</b> about hosting the session.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1959, Hordern {{made his}} debut on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in Marcel Aymé's comedy Moonbirds, {{alongside}} the comedian Wally Cox. The play {{was a disaster}} and closed after only two nights and three performances. Little was offered {{in the way of}} praise, although critics singled out Hordern's performance in particular as being good. He was <b>unsure</b> why the play failed, and attributed it to clashes of personality between cast and management.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting on Hoffman's work in {{the late}} 2000s, Mosher writes that the actor {{remained}} impressive, but had not delivered a testing performance {{on the level of}} his work in Capote. The film critic David Thomson believed that Hoffman showed indecisiveness at this time, <b>unsure</b> whether to play spectacular supporting roles or become a lead actor who is capable of controlling the emotional dynamic and outcome of a film.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else {{he might make}} a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still <b>unsure</b> what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E
5|$|Roy faced {{challenges}} {{before entering}} college. His parents {{and his older}} brother had not attended college, and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT; his reading comprehension was slow, which increased the time he needed for tests. He had taken the test four times (with tutors) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements. <b>Unsure</b> whether {{he would be able to}} attend a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping containers for $11/hour.|$|E
5|$|Scientists are <b>unsure</b> of {{the purpose}} of whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E
5|$|The French were {{initially}} opposed to Albani's election, but they quickly dropped {{their opposition to}} him. He was elected unanimously on 23 November 1700. He was <b>unsure</b> whether he should accept the papacy {{due to the fact}} that he had nephews who he suspected would be angry if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept the papacy by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The oak tree, {{under which}} Andy leaves a note for Red {{directing}} him to Zihuatanejo, {{became a symbol}} of hope for its role in the film. It was split by lightning on July 29, 2011; officials were <b>unsure</b> if the tree would survive. However, after urging by a group raising money to protect the tree, government arborists inspected the tree which was found to be alive and well. The tree was completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The prose, while simple at {{the level}} of the {{sentence}} (and we can safely assume that Hofmann's translation is very faithful to the original), is shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left <b>unsure</b> as to what exactly is going on – a deliberate flight from causation, quite understandable in a country where everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has been driven mad by fear.|$|E
5|$|The show borrows {{elements}} and its design style from his Uncle Grandpa short, which was pitched {{to the network}} as a pilot. According to Browngardt, they were <b>unsure</b> about having a series centered on the title character, and felt the monster characters from the pilot had more potential. Character designer Robertryan Cory and David P. Smith (a director and storyboard artist on Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls) were brought on board to help shape the project's development.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} on Cream's second album Disraeli Gears in November 1967, {{which was a}} best seller. Atco Records, the group's American label, was initially <b>unsure</b> of the song's potential. After recommendations by other label-affiliated artists, it released an edited single version in December 1967. The song became Cream's first and highest charting American single {{and one of the}} most popular singles of 1968. In September 1968, it became a modest chart hit after being released in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after {{portion of the}} {{starboard}} side of the Houston, blowing 20 men overboard and spreading gasoline fires in the waters around the cruiser. Initially <b>unsure</b> whether the ship would hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In {{the end it was}} determined she would stay afloat. Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|They {{decided to}} have a scene where Lisa and Bart visit Homer before his surgery and were <b>unsure</b> of how to do it, so they {{approached}} Brooks. Brooks made up the entire scene on the spot. Originally, the surgery was supposed to be performed by Dr. Hibbert, but it was later changed to Dr. Nick. In the original airing of the episode, Dr. Nick's phone number was the number of a real legal clinic, whose lawyers made them change it to 1-600-DOCTORB.|$|E
5|$|Though he was {{initially}} <b>unsure</b> whether {{he wanted to}} go to university, Fox's mother convinced him to enrol at Simon Fraser University, where he studied kinesiology as a stepping stone to becoming a physical education teacher. He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team, earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unsure</b> {{of how the}} 1987 {{game would}} be received, Sierra's {{management}} chose to release it with no publicity or advertising budget. Many stores also refused to stock the game because of its adult content, which was subject to controversy. In effect, its first-month sales were lower than any new Sierra product launch in years.|$|E
