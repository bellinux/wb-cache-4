5|$|Hundreds of {{television}} channels, thousands {{of local and}} national radio stations, several dozen newspapers, a productive and profitable national cinema and a rapid growth of broadband Internet use all make <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> vibrant media industry in Turkey. In 2003 a total of 257 television stations and 1,100 radio stations were licensed to operate, and others operated without licenses. Of those licensed, 16 television and 36 radio stations reached national audiences. The majority of the audiences are shared among public broadcaster TRT and the network-style channels such as Kanal D, Show TV, ATV and Star TV. The broadcast media {{have a very high}} penetration as satellite dishes and cable systems are widely available. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) is the government body overseeing the broadcast media. By circulation, the most popular newspapers are Posta, Hürriyet, Sözcü, Sabah and Habertürk.|$|E
5|$|Stay-at-home dads make <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{small portion}} of the Australian {{population}} although this appears to be rapidly changing. In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay-at-home dad role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately 7% of two parents families with {{children under the age of}} 14 have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{typically}} {{occurring in}} evergreen forests. It prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies {{and has an}} extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size. Its diet consists of sap, floral nectar, fruit and arthropods. It will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees. The species is generally solitary; one study showed only 8% of its active time was spent near other individuals. Social behavior makes <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{small part of the}} activity budget, though it has monogamous mating system with the offspring living with the parents. It sleeps during the day, rolled up in a ball in hidden parts of trees above the ground, often on branches, twigs, palm fronds, or lianas. The species is polyoestrous, usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days. The young disperses between 16 and 27 months, generally when it is sexually mature.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} Test as captain, Jardine clashed with several players. Frank Woolley {{was unhappy with}} his captain's manner, feeling humiliated at his {{treatment}} in the field at one point. He also rebuked Ian Peebles and Walter Robins, two young amateur bowlers, for their amusement over an incident in the match. The home team's fortunes were mixed, as New Zealand put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good fight in their first Test in England, and both sides could have won. The New Zealanders were so successful that a further two Tests were arranged. Jardine was criticised in the press for not instructing his batsmen to score quickly enough {{to win in the}} fourth innings, although this strategy was unlikely to succeed, and the match was drawn. England won the second Test by an innings and the third Test was drawn, sealing the series 1–0. Jardine had a top score of just 38 in the series, but only batted four times and was not out in three of the innings. At the beginning of the following season, Wisden's editor believed that, as Jardine had failed to impress (unspecified) people with his captaincy, he was no longer a certainty to lead the side to Australia, and only Percy Chapman's lack of form prevented his reinstatement at Jardine's expense. As a batsman, Jardine was more impressive in Wisden's opinion, showing himself to be good in defence despite his lack of cricket in the past two seasons. A notable innings was his 104 for The Rest to prevent defeat against champion county Yorkshire. The opposition bowling, particularly from Bill Bowes, was short and hostile, but Jardine survived for over four hours. He scored 1,104 first-class runs for the season at an average of 64.94.|$|E

The Jemadar led the assault, killing several of the enemy himself and then pressed on regardless of machine-gun fire from another feature.

However, he was probably associated with Gallienus's cavalry army and shone as an officer of that corps d'élite because, when he finally emerged in a historically reliable context {{in the early part}} of the reign of Claudius II, he seems to have been its commander.|$|E
25|$|While {{indigenous}} people make <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{small percentage of}} the population of the region, the Huasteca culture has had a strong impact since the pre Hispanic period.

Huapango is the dominant native musical and dance style in the Sierra Gorda, with festivals dedicated to it in Xichú, Pinal de Amoles, San Joaquín, where Huasteca influence is strongest. Most of the population lives in very small rural communities, many under 500 inhabitants. There are no notable social conflicts in this area, which is free of problems related to the illegal drug trade that afflict other parts of the country.|$|E

25|$|A {{key factor}} {{in the success of}} Italian cuisine is its heavy {{reliance}} on traditional products; Italy has the most traditional specialities protected under EU law. Cheese, cold cuts and wine are a major part of Italian cuisine, with many regional declinations and Protected Designation of Origin or Protected Geographical Indication labels, and along with coffee (especially espresso) make <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important part of the Italian gastronomic culture. Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato, tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.|$|E

She moved to London, where she bought a spacious apartment overlooking Hyde Park. Unfortunately, it was next door to the Iranian embassy. During the May 1980 incident, West, then 87, had to be evacuated. In the last two decades of her life, West kept <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> active social life, making friends with Martha Gellhorn, Doris Lessing, Bernard Levin, comedian Frankie Howerd, and film star and director Warren Beatty, who filmed her for the movie Reds, a biography of journalist John Reed and his connection with the Russian Revolution. She also spent time with scholars such as Jane Marcus and Bonnie Kime Scott, who began to chronicle her feminist career and varied work. She wrote at an unabated pace, penning masterful reviews for the Sunday Telegraph, publishing her last novel The Birds Fall Down (1966), and overseeing the film version of the story by BBC in 1978. The last work published in her lifetime was 1900 (1982). 1900 explored the last year of Queen Victoria's long reign, which was a watershed in many cultural and political respects.|$|E

25|$|Romanov was {{the owner}} of the Lithuanian Premier League {{basketball}} club and Euroleague participant BC Žalgiris since May 2009. He made numerous controversial decisions including firing head coaches one by one, first Ramūnas Butautas, and more famously firing head coach Darius Maskoliūnas in the middle of LKL finals series, players had to draw their own tactic schemes and making substitutions, which resulted in losses to the rivals Lietuvos Rytas in decisive games. He also had famous feud with Lietuvos Rytas owners Jonas Vainauskas and Gedvydas Vainauskas, exchanging letters with insults between them. Žalgiris did win the BBL championship, and had a good showing in the Euroleague, nearly making the Top8 phase. Before 2010–11 season started, Zalgiris have purchased several high profile players and a new head coach. In {{the first half of the}} season Zalgiris was consistent, which led to impressive victories in all tournaments. After a positive start that hadn't been seen for years, Vladimir Romanov once again shocked the entire country by firing head coach Aco Petrovic, who was replaced by Elias Zouros, which resulted in a series of losses and Mirza Begić's decision to leave the team. This time, however, Žalgiris won back the LKL championship, as well as the LKF Cup, beating Lietuvos Rytas each time, as well as defeating VEF Rīga in the BBL finals. During the 2011–12 season, Romanov fired two other Žalgiris coaches – head coach Elias Zouros and his assistant coach. The new coach, Aleksandar Trifunović, former longtime head coach of Lietuvos Rytas, became Romanov's favorite, as even with a series of losses, Romanov chose to let the coach continue his work, resulting in repeats as LKL, BBL and LKF cup champions, once again beating rivals Lietuvos Rytas. Before the 2013 season, Romanov built <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> powerful team, with many fans even thinking of a spot in the Euroleague playoffs, as well as hiring new coach Joan Plaza. After an incredible start, with wins in the Euroleague, LKL and VTB tournaments, Romanov admitted to running out of money. Romanov resigned from Zalgiris on 28 February 2013, two weeks after the collapse of Ūkio Bankas. Before leaving, Romanov sold his shares to the team veterans.|$|E
25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a round of applause from both judges. Then it was off to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fresh and light Mexican chicken with a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E
