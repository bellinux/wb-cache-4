40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a nontrivial local {{oscillator}} <b>uncorrelated</b> phase <b>noise</b> analysis is proposed for frequency synthesizer of a passive millimeter-wave Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radiometer (SAIR) imager BHU- 2 D designed for concealed weapon detections on human bodies with high imaging rates. The frequency synthesizer provides {{local oscillator}} signals for both millimeter-wave front-ends and intermediate frequency I/Q demodulators for the receivers. The influence of local oscillator <b>uncorrelated</b> phase <b>noise</b> in different offset frequency ranges on the visibility phase errors have been systematically investigated, {{and the corresponding}} system-level visibility specifications are drawn. The integrated RMS phase error {{has been applied to}} set <b>uncorrelated</b> phase <b>noise</b> requirements in the most critical offset frequency range for visibility error control. The synthesizer design is given, and measurement results have proved that the visibility phase error requirement is achieved by the PN analysis method proposed with system-level visibility error tests performed. To conclude, the phase noise effects on SAIR visibility phase errors are investigated by theory, and are properly limited by the PN requirement analysis method to ensure that the system-level visibility phase error specification is satisfied...|$|R

Summing up <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>noise</b> increases its amplitude by sqrt(N), while {{summing up}} a coherent signal increases its average by N. As a result, the SNR (or signal/noise) increases by sqrt(N). In the example, that means while with N=256 there {{is an increase in}} Dynamic range by 8 bits, and the content of [...] "coherent signal" [...] increases by N, but the noise changes by a factor of sqrt(N)=sqrt(256)=16 in the example (not to be confused with an increase of 16 bits), so the SNR changes by a factor of 16.|$|E
50|$|Random Jitter, {{also called}} Gaussian jitter, is {{unpredictable}} electronic timing noise. Random jitter typically follows a Gaussian distribution or Normal distribution. It usually follows this pattern because most noise or jitter in an electrical circuit {{is caused by}} thermal noise, which has a Gaussian distribution. Another reason for random jitter to have a distribution like {{this is due to}} the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem states that composite effect of many <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>noise</b> sources, regardless of the distributions, approaches a Gaussian distribution.One of the main differences between random and deterministic jitter is that deterministic jitter is bounded and random jitter is unbounded.|$|E

The long term average of random ultrasound waves can reconstruct the impulse response between two points on an aluminum block. However, they had assumed random diffuse noise, limiting interferometry in real world conditions. In a similar case, it was shown that the expressions for <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>noise</b> sources reduce to a single crosscorrelation of observations at two receivers. The interferometric impulse response of the subsurface can be reconstructed using only an extended record of background noise, initially only for the surface and direct wave arrivals.|$|E

Our analysis, together with experiments using up to three superconducting qubits, shows that for the realistic <b>uncorrelated</b> <b>noises,</b> qubit motion increases the dephasing time of the logical qubit as √(n).

50|$|To {{judge the}} {{distance}} of the object, we correlate the received signal with a matched filter, which, in the case of white (<b>uncorrelated)</b> <b>noise,</b> is another pure-tone 1-Hz sinusoid. When the output of the matched filter system exceeds a certain threshold, we conclude with high probability that the received signal has been reflected off the object. Using the speed of propagation and the time that we first observe the reflected signal, we can estimate {{the distance of}} the object. If we change the shape of the pulse in a specially-designed way, the signal-to-noise ratio and the distance resolution can be even improved after matched filtering: this is a technique known as pulse compression.|$|E
