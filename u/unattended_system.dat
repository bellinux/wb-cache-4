40|$|A {{methodology}} for designing Unattended Monitoring Systems starting at a systems level {{has been developed}} at Sandia National Laboratories. This proven methodology provides a template that describes the process for selecting and applying appropriate technologies to meet <b>unattended</b> <b>system</b> requirements, {{as well as providing}} a framework for development of both training courses and workshops associated with unattended monitoring. The design and implementation of unattended monitoring systems is generally intended to respond to some form of policy based requirements resulting from international agreements or domestic regulations. Once the monitoring requirements are established, a review of the associated process and its related facilities enables identification of strategic monitoring locations and development of a conceptual system design. The detailed design effort results in the definition of detection components as well as the supporting communications network and data management scheme. The data analyses then enables a coherent display of the knowledge generated during the monitoring effort. The resultant knowledge is then compared to the original system objectives to ensure that the design adequately addresses the fundamental principles stated in the policy agreements. Implementation of this design methodology will ensure that comprehensive unattended monitoring system designs provide appropriate answers to those critical questions imposed by specific agreements or regulations.

40|$|Software drive {{encryption}} {{systems are}} vulnerable to memory attacks, in which an attacker gains physical accesses to the unattended computer, obtains the decryption keys from memory and consequently decrypts the drive. We reviewed the currently existing mitigations and have found that they provide only partial protection, {{and none of them}} protect against the full range of memory attacks. We propose a new method for protecting encryption systems against memory attacks, by converting them to use two tiers of keys, a single Master Key and a set of File or Sector keys. When the computer is unattended, the Master Key and part of the second-tier keys are erased from memory. The method is secure against any type of memory attack, including attackers who gain complete control of the <b>unattended</b> <b>system.</b> Compared to previous methods of protection, which erase keys and shut down the computer, our method allows to keep the computer operational by a combination of cryptographic and operating systems techniques. Applications may continue running, and can access any unencrypted data as well as a chosen subset of the encrypted data, at the cost of leaving that data unsecured against memory attacks. We first describe the application of the method to file-based encryption systems, where we have implemented and tested it in practice, and then describe a possible adaptation to disk-based encryption systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is {{developing}} {{the concept of}} an automated UF 6 cylinder verification station that would be located at key measurement points to positively identify each cylinder, measure its mass and enrichment, store the collected data in a secure database, and maintain continuity of knowledge on measured cylinders until the arrival of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors. At the center of this <b>unattended</b> <b>system</b> is a hybrid enrichment assay technique that combines the traditional enrichment-meter method (based on the 186 keV peak from 235 U) with non-traditional neutron-induced high-energy gamma-ray signatures (spawned primarily by 234 U alpha emissions and 19 F(alpha, neutron) reactions). Previous work by PNNL provided proof-of-principle for the non-traditional signatures to support accurate, full-volume interrogation of the cylinder enrichment, thereby reducing the systematic uncertainties in enrichment assay due to UF 6 heterogeneity and providing greater sensitivity to material substitution scenarios. The work described here builds on that preliminary evaluation of the non-traditional signatures, but focuses on a prototype field system utilizing NaI(Tl) and LaBr 3 (Ce) spectrometers, and enrichment analysis algorithms that integrate the traditional and non-traditional signatures. Results for the assay of Type- 30 B cylinders ranging from 0. 2 to 4. 95 wt% 235 U, at an AREVA fuel fabrication plant in Richland, WA, are described for the following enrichment analysis methods: 1) traditional enrichment meter signature (186 keV peak) as calculated using a square-wave convolute (SWC) algorithm; 2) non-traditional high-energy gamma-ray signature that provides neutron detection without neutron detectors and 3) hybrid algorithm that merges the traditional and non-traditional signatures. Uncertainties for each method, relative to the declared enrichment for each cylinder, are calculated and compared to the uncertainties from an attended HPGe verification station at AREVA, and the IAEA’s uncertainty target values for feed, tail and product cylinders. A summary of the major findings from the field measurements and subsequent analysis follows: • Traditional enrichment-meter assay using specially collimated NaI spectrometers and a Square-Wave-Convolute algorithm can achieve uncertainties comparable to HPGe and LaBr for product, natural and depleted cylinders. • Non-traditional signatures measured using NaI spectrometers enable interrogation of the entire cylinder volume and accurate measurement of absolute 235 U mass in product, natural and depleted cylinders. • A hybrid enrichment assay method can achieve lower uncertainties than either the traditional or non-traditional methods acting independently because there is a low degree of correlation in the systematic errors of the two individual methods (wall thickness variation and 234 U/ 235 U variation, respectively). This work has indicated that the hybrid NDA method has the potential to serve as the foundation for an unattended cylinder verification station. When compared to today’s handheld cylinder-verification approach, such a station would have the following advantages: 1) improved enrichment assay accuracy for product, tail and feed cylinders; 2) full-volume assay of absolute 235 U mass; 3) assay of minor isotopes (234 U and 232 U) important to verification of feedstock origin; single instrumentation design for both Type 30 B and Type 48 cylinders; and 4) substantial reduction in the inspector manpower associated with cylinder verification...|$|E

Calibration of photoresponse allowed the successful correction of spectral data and the modeling of biases in reflectance at different levels of the dynamic range. Finally, the impact of nonlinearities on a spectral estimator of photosynthetic status, the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is discussed. Significance of the biases proved that, although nonlinearity can potentially affect reflectance along most of the dynamic range of the instrument, experimental uncertainties can limit its impact. Nonlinearity biased PRI by affecting the reference band of the index and suggested unreal changes on plant physiology. Results show that nonlinearity could be a significant problem in field spectroscopy, {{especially in the case of}} spectroradiometers integrated in <b>unattended</b> <b>systems</b> to monitor vegetation responses to radiation.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of emerging technologies due to the recent advances in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology. WSN are considered to be <b>unattended</b> <b>systems</b> with applications ranging from environmental sensing, structural monitoring, and industrial process control to emergency response and mobile target tracking. The distributed nature and the limited hardware capabilities of WSN challenge the development of effective applications. The strength of a sensor network, which turns out to be also its weakness, is the capability to perform inter-node processing while sharing data across the network. However, the limited reliability of a node, due to the low-cost nature of the hardware components, drastically constrains this aspect. For this reason, the availability of a mechanism to build distributed robust connectivity topologies, where robustness is meant against random failures of nodes and intentional attacks of nodes, is crucial. The complex network theory along with the percolation theory provides a suitable framework to achieve that. Indeed, topologies such as multi-modal and scale free ones, show interesting properties which might be embedded into a sensor network to significantly increase its robustness. In this work, a mechanisms to build robust topologies in a distributed fashion is proposed, its effectiveness is analytically investigated and results are validated through simulations...|$|R
