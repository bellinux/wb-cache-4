(also 'ultramicrofiche') is an {{exceptionally}} compact {{version of a}} microfiche or microfilm, storing analog data at much higher densities. <b>Ultrafiche</b> can be created directly from computers using appropriate peripherals. They are typically used for storing data gathered from extremely data-intensive operations such as remote sensing.|$|E

The normal commercial method of providing this assurance is to form and fund a small foundation or trust. The trust then maintains a mailbox and deposits copies (usually in <b>ultrafiche)</b> in a secure location, such as rented space in a university's library (managed as a special collection), or (more rarely now) buried in a cave or a desert location.|$|E
50|$|Old {{data from}} remote sensing is often {{valuable}} {{because it may}} provide the only long-term data for a large extent of geography. At the same time, the data is often complex to interpret, and bulky to store. Modern systems tend to store the data digitally, often with lossless compression. The difficulty with {{this approach is that}} the data is fragile, the format may be archaic, and the data may be easy to falsify. One of the best systems for archiving data series is as computer-generated machine-readable <b>ultrafiche,</b> usually in typefonts such as OCR-B, or as digitized half-tone images. Ultrafiches survive well in standard libraries, with lifetimes of several centuries. They can be created, copied, filed and retrieved by automated systems. They are about as compact as archival magnetic media, and yet can be read by human beings with minimal, standardized equipment.|$|E

Emphasis ulill be on a discussion of the problem of selection of microform soft~vare and a delineation of the major sources. A cursory review of hardware problems will also be presented. DEFINITIONS AND DELIMITATIOKS As used in this article, microform is a generic word used to describe a large variety of photographically reduced printed sources which must be mechanically enlarged for satisfactory use. Included are microforms of various sizes and types- 16 mm and 35 mm roll film, microfiche (from the French word fiche meaning- card), and microopague (sometimes referred to as microprint). This article will deal primarily with the microforms commonly used in libraries today. Except for some mention under a discussion of trends and developments, it will therefore not deal with the still-limited use of computer output microfilm (COM); nor will it deal with <b>ultrafiche</b> (where approximately 3200 pages at a reduction ratio of 150 :l are placed on one 4 " x 6 " fiche), since several major projects have not been widely accepted on the marketplace, and "it appears that <b>ultrafiche</b> will have no significant impact upon library microforms," at least in the immediate future. &apos...|$|E
