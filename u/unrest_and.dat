5|$|Following the 1967 Detroit riot, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead {{an investigation into the}} cause of the <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> interview civil rights leaders for the Kerner Commission.

5|$|On 11 June, a Buddhist monk, Thích Quảng Đức, self-immolated in {{downtown}} Saigon. Images were shown by news outlets across the world, embarrassing Diệm's government and bringing negative global attention. A few days later, under mounting American pressure, Diệm signed the Joint Communique with senior Buddhist leaders, making various {{concessions to the}} Buddhists, who in turn agreed to stop the civil <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> return to normal life.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 August, ten senior ARVN generals met to discuss the {{situation}} regarding the Buddhist <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> decided martial law was needed.

5|$|Several Weiquan lawyers, {{including}} Teng Biao, Jiang Tianyong, and Li Fangping, offered {{legal aid}} to Tibetans {{in the wake}} of the March 2008 Tibetan protests. The protests resulted in the imprisonment of at least 670 Tibetans, and the execution of at least four individuals. Chinese government sources asserted that the <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> violence in Tibet had been masterminded by the Dalai Lama and executed by his followers for the purpose of fomenting <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> disrupting the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The Open Constitution Initiative (OCI), operated by several Weiquan lawyers and intellectuals, issued a paper in May 2009 challenging the official narrative, and suggesting that the protests were instead a response to economic inequities, Han Chinese migration, and religious sentiments. The OCI recommended that Chinese authorities better respect and protect the rights and interests of the Tibetan people, including religious freedom, and pursue the reduction of economic inequality and official corruption.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Poland from 1945 to 1989 spans {{the period of}} Soviet {{communist}} dominance imposed {{after the end of}} World War II over what had become the Polish People's Republic. These years, while featuring general industrialization and urbanization and many improvements in the standard of living in Poland, were marred by social <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> severe economic difficulties.|$|E

50|$|Being {{known as}} the first female poet whose works were {{published}} in Aydınlık Dergisi (Enlightenment Journal), Yaşar Nezihe also became prominent for supporting labour <b>unrests</b> <b>and</b> her activist identity.

50|$|Revivalism began post Mao {{era when}} ethnic {{identity}} was allowed. By 1980s, Manchu became {{the second largest}} minority group in People's Republic of China.

5|$|As Hammurabi was {{assisted}} {{during the}} war in the south by his allies from the north such as Yamhad and Mari, the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest. Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> soon after crushing Eshnunna. Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although {{it is possible that the}} 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict.|$|E
5|$|Despite winning four of {{the first}} five league matches of the 2014/15 season, and with Watford sitting in 2nd place, Sannino's {{position}} had become {{the subject of much}} speculation following rumours of dressing-room <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> some players taking a dislike to his style of management. Sannino resigned from his position as head coach on 31 August 2014 after just over eight months in charge. His final game in charge was a 4–2 win at home to Huddersfield Town the day before.|$|E
5|$|Like {{its parent}} show, The Legend of Korra {{received}} critical acclaim, drawing favorable comparisons with the HBO series Game of Thrones {{and the work}} of Hayao Miyazaki. It has been praised for its production values, such as its animation quality, art style, and musical score. The series has been nominated for and won awards from the Annie Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award, and a Gracie Award. The series was also praised for addressing sociopolitical issues such as social <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> terrorism, as well as for going beyond the established boundaries of youth entertainment with respect to issues of race, gender, and sexual identity.|$|E

60|$|About dawn, his {{physical}} fatigue asserted itself, {{and he went}} to bed and slept at last in spite of dreaming. He rose late, <b>unrested</b> <b>and</b> anxious, and in considerable facial pain. The morning papers had no news of Mr. Bessel's aberration--it had come too late for them. Mr. Vincey's perplexities, to which the fever of his bruise added fresh irritation, became at last intolerable, and, after a fruitless visit to the Albany, he went down to St. Paul's Churchyard to Mr. Hart, Mr. Bessel's partner, and, so far as Mr. Vincey knew, his nearest friend.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Poland's {{economy was}} in shambles. Hyperinflation fueled public <b>unrest,</b> <b>and</b> the {{government}} {{was unable to find}} a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis. Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centered around former members of the Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organization as well as some left-wing and intelligentsia parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government, eventually issuing statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.|$|E

The Division was charged with the mission of quelling civil <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> restoring order to the country, and the DISCOM provided logistical support during this mission. In 1972, the band {{was removed from the}} Division Support Command.|$|E
5|$|Portugal's wars against {{independence}} guerrilla {{fighters in}} its 400-year-old African territories began in 1961 with Angola. In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in 1964 {{as a result}} of <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> frustration amongst many indigenous Mozambican populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment, which served only to further Portuguese economic interests in the region. Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal's policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and limited access to Portuguese-style education and skilled employment.|$|E

2500|$|The Russian Revolution of 1905 was {{a wave of}} mass {{political}} unrest through vast {{areas of}} the Russian Empire. Some of it was directed against the government, while some was undirected. [...] It included terrorism, worker strikes, peasant <b>unrests,</b> <b>and</b> military mutinies. It led {{to the establishment of}} the limited constitutional monarchy, the establishment of State Duma of the Russian Empire, and the multi-party system.|$|R
5|$|South Wales miners, {{including}} those at Universal, were paid on a rate {{determined by the}} Sliding Scale Committee, which fixed wages on the price coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led to industrial <b>unrest</b> <b>and,</b> in 1898, a strike that the men at Universal joined {{at the end of}} April. The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners. The colliery resumed production and in 1899 was producing 3,000 long tons (3,400short tons) of coal a week.|$|E
5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} {{protection}} from the hazards of open land. The prairie could be dangerous in time of native <b>unrest,</b> <b>and</b> trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high {{unemployment}} and social <b>unrest,</b> <b>and</b> many critics {{on the left}} of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E

5000|$|In Turin and Milan, factory councils - {{which the}} leading Italian Marxist {{theoretician}} Antonio Gramsci {{considered to be}} the Italian equivalent of Russia’s soviets - were formed and many factory occupations took place under the leadership of revolutionary socialists and anarcho-syndicalists. The agitations also extended to the agricultural areas of the Padan plain and were accompanied by peasant strikes, rural <b>unrests</b> <b>and</b> armed conflicts between left-wing and right-wing militias.|$|R
40|$|Social microblogs such as Twitter and Weibo are {{experiencing}} an explosive growth with billions of global users sharing their daily observations and thoughts. Beyond public interests (e. g., sports, music), microblogs can provide highly detailed information {{for those interested}} in public health, homeland security, and financial analysis. However, the language used in Twitter is heavily informal, ungrammatical, and dynamic. Existing data mining algorithms require extensive manually labeling to build and maintain a supervised system. This paper presents STED, a semi-supervised system that helps users to automatically detect and interactively visualize events of a targeted type from twitter, such as crimes, civil <b>unrests,</b> <b>and</b> disease outbreaks. Our model first applies transfer learning and label propagation to automatically generate labeled data, then learns a customized text classifier based on mini-clustering, and finally applies fast spatial scan statistics to estimate the locations of events. We demonstrate STED’s usage and benefits using twitter data collected from Latin America countries, and show how our system helps to detect and track example events such as civil <b>unrests</b> <b>and</b> crimes. 1...|$|R
5|$|The Reverend John Vachell {{stayed on}} as vicar of St George's Littleport in title until 1830; he {{appointed}} a curate, George Britton Jermyn from 1817. Some of the St George's church registers were destroyed during the riots. The remaining registers start from 1754 (marriages), 1756 (burials), and 1783 (baptism). General <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> riots {{such as that}} at Littleport {{may have been a}} factor in the government passing the Vagrancy Act of 1824. Due in part to some difficulties in enforcing the law and to continued public unease, the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 was created leading to the first modern police force.|$|E
5|$|The banking {{sector is}} one of the {{principal}} foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the Arab Spring uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector currently consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left {{the city for the}} country. It was an {{intensely}} hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused <b>unrest</b> <b>and</b> anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E
