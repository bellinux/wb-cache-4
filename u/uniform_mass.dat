It is shown that, for an isotropic three‐dimensional array of <b>uniform</b> <b>masses,</b> the root‐mean‐square frequency is easily evaluated and the maximum square must always be less, but not much less, than twice the mean square. For two commonly studied simple cubic systems, the maximum square is evaluated and shown to be twice the mean square. The Debye expression for the frequencies in terms of standing wave components is modified empirically to give the correct maximum and mean squares by substituting linear crystal frequencies for the components and introducing a second force constant. The resulting expression, a simplified form of the factored secular equation, should yield a more realistic and probably therefore a more widely useful distribution function than the Debye equation...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{examination}} of the kinematics and stellar populations of a sample of 3 Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) and 3 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in X-ray groups and clusters. We have obtained high signal-to-noise Gemini/GMOS (Gemini South Multi-Object Spectrograph) long-slit spectra of these galaxies and use Lick indices to determine ages, metallicities and alpha-element abundance ratios out to at least their effective radii. We find that the BGGs and BCGs have very <b>uniform</b> <b>masses,</b> central ages and central metallicities. Examining the radial dependence of their stellar populations, we find no significant velocity dispersion, age, or alpha-enhancement gradients. However, we find a wide range of metallicity gradients, suggesting a variety of formation mechanisms. The range of metallicity gradients observed is surprising given the homogeneous environment these galaxies probe and their uniform central stellar populations. However, our results are inconsistent with any single model of galaxy formation and emphasize the need for more theoretical understanding of both the origins of metallicity gradients and galaxy formation itself. We postulate two possible physical causes for the different formation mechanisms. Comment: 21 pages plus appendices, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, we quantitatively {{discuss the}} effect of {{individual}} SWCNT length on electrical conductance and load transfer. Assuming that the electrical and mechanical properties {{are related to the}} number of junctions, the approximate double electrical conductivity and tensile strength exhibited by forests with heights of 1, 500  μm compared with those of heights 350  μm indicates that half the number of SWCNT junctions are present for electron/load. We estimated that the SWCNTs from a 1, 500 -μm forest were, in fact, four times longer than those in a 350 -μm forests by constructing a simple model describing the effective area of a SWCNT of a certain length as it spreads in a buckypaper. To make this model solvable, we assumed that the SWCNTs fell into a circular island with a <b>uniform</b> areal <b>mass</b> (i.e., SWCNT mass per unit area) within the buckypaper plane. The <b>uniform</b> areal <b>mass</b> assumption is justified by the overall macroscopic homogeneity of the buckypaper. With this consideration, the diameter of the effective area is proportional to the square root of the SWCNT length, and the effective area, where a SWCNT can make contact with another effective area, would be proportional to the length of the SWCNT. Therefore, we find that the four-time difference in forest height (1, 500 : 350) matches well with the four-time difference in effective areas which would result in a twofold difference in junctions along a path and thusly explain the difference in electrical conductivity and mechanical strain. Importantly, we can also conclude that the length of a SWCNT within a forest, at least to a large extent, spans the height of the forest from the substrate to the forest top.|$|R

50|$|Production of a {{black hole}} {{requires}} concentration of mass or energy within the corresponding Schwarzschild radius.

Even so, at that time, the Universe was not able to collapse into a singularity due to its <b>uniform</b> <b>mass</b> distribution and rapid growth. This, however, does not fully exclude the possibility that black holes of various sizes may have emerged locally. A black hole formed in this way is called a primordial black hole and is the most widely accepted hypothesis for the possible creation of micro black holes. Computer simulations suggest that the probability of formation of a primordial black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, the most likely outcome would be micro black holes.|$|E

40|$|Shaking a lattice system, by {{modulating}} {{the location}} of its sites periodically in time, is a powerful method to create effective magnetic fields in engineered quantum systems, such as cold gases trapped in optical lattices. However, such schemes are typically associated with space-dependent effective masses (tunneling amplitudes) and non-uniform flux patterns.
