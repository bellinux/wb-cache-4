40|$|Constantly {{there is}} a {{necessity}} for carrying out tests on hardened concrete to determine the parameters of concrete strength in structure. Nowadays for concrete control quality testing nondestructive test methods are widely used. For this purpose mostly used methods are ultrasonic pulse velocity and rebound hardness by applying portable devices <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>tester</b> and Schmidt rebound hammer. Although, many such tests have been carried out, they all still lead to difficulties in interpretation of the results, because they are affected {{by a number of}} factors. During the inspections of different building objects, comprehensive information on technical condition of concrete and reinforced concrete constructions have collected, simultaneously applying the nondestructive test methods and testing specimens taken from constructions of buildings until failure. It has been defined some novelties by working with two aforesaid nondestructive test methods in conformity with determination of concrete actual strength. And namely, there are comparing dispersions of the measurement data by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>tester</b> and Schmidt rebound hammer. Besides, compli-ance of the groups of measurement data for these testing methods to the normal distribution nature is to be related. Simultaneously it is established also how the amount of measurements affected to correlation relations between re-sults of the concrete nondestructive test methods and the strength destructive testing data. Finally, obtained test re-sults are compared to the interpretation of measuring data for concrete strength theoretical calculation by other scien-tists from countries outside the Europ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} Korean pine specimen by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>tester.</b> The effect of hole size and holes amount in axial direction of wood {{as well as the}} distribution of end holes on ultrasonic wave velocity were respectively studied. A comparison test was carried out between the specimens of one hole defect and no defect with different lengths. Then regression analysis of the relation between hole size and ultrasonic wave velocity was done using SPSS software. The experimental results show that the length of wood components has significant effect on ultrasonic wave velocity. The ultrasonic wave velocity has negative correlation with hole size and holes amount. End hole has no significant effect on ultrasonic wave velocity. This research will provide some theoretical basis for the detection of internal defects in wood materials, material evaluation and the evaluation of physical and mechanical properties testing...|$|E
40|$|Wood Plastic Composites (WPCs) are a {{relatively}} new family of composite materials which {{are becoming more and}} more commonplace by the development of new production techniques and processing equipment. So it is necessary to develop an effective nondestructive technique to evaluate these products. Among the nondestructive techniques, ultrasonic method is often used for nondestructive evaluation of composites. For WPC, firstly need to study ultrasonic wave propagation in such composites. For this reason, in this research the through transmission ultrasonic method was used to measure the ultrasonic wave velocity in WPC using a commercial <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>tester</b> (Sylvatest Duo) of 16 kHz longitudinal waves. Wood flour/E-glass fiber hybrid polypropylene composites were manufactured in a counter-rotating twin-screw extruder. The effect of wood flour content, compatibilizers(MAPP), glass fiber contents and specimen length on ultrasonic velocity were investigated. Also ultrasonic wave velocities were measured in wood and polypropylene and were compared to ultrasonic velocity in WPCs. Wood plastic composites (WPCs) are relatively new family composites that are becomin...|$|E
40|$|Rotary <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>testers</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{industry}} to inspect tubes for both surface and internal defects. Typically occurring natural defects are modeled by surface notches and flat bottomed holes. The most frequently used artificial defects are longitudinal notches. These are notches having a depth of 5 % or 10 % of wall thickness, typically 10 to 25 mm long oriented parallel to the center line of the tube. More stringent requirement is to find transverse notches which are oriented 90 degrees to the center line. Lately, more companies require finding oblique defects which are oriented at some angle between the longitudinal and transverse directions. The paper examines the applicability of rotary testers to find obliquely oriented defects...|$|R

40|$|During the {{evaluation}} of ultrasonic images, e. g. SAFT-reconstructed B-scan images (SAFT=Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique) {{it is often difficult}} to decide, what is the origin of reconstructed image points: were the caused by defects, specimens geometry of modeconversions. To facilitate this evaluation a tool based on the comparison of data was developed. Different kinds of data comparison are possible: identification of that RF-Signals, which caused the reconstructed image point. This is the comparison of a reconstructed image with the corresponding RF-data. Comparsion of two reconstructed images performing a superposition using logical operators. In this case e. g. the reconstruction of an unknown reflector is compared with that of a known one. Comparison of raw-RF-data by simultanous scanning through two data sets. Here the echoes of an unknown reflector are compared with the echoes of a known one. The necessary datasets of known reflectors may be generated experimentally on refer ence reflectors of modelled. The aim is the identification of the reflector type, e. g. cracklike or not, the determination of position, size and orientation as well as the identification of accompenying satellite echoes. The interpretation of the SAFT-reconstructed B-scan image is carried out by a complete description of the reflector. In addition to the aim of interpretation the tool described is well suited to educate and train <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>testers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pistons used in {{automobile}} {{engines are}} made of aluminum alloy; and endurance of high pressure and high temperature is required. Recently, high strength pistons are needed {{to cope with the}} increase of pressure and temperature in the engine cylinder. A high strength piston is possible when the piston casting has little or no casting defects, such as micro-pores and cracks. Generally the defects can be evaluated by non-destructive testing (NDT), and the most efficient ways for evaluation are using ultrasonics and computer tomography. In the present study, two NDT methods were compared and evaluated to investigate the defects in the aluminum piston castings. Artificial defects were machined by using very small drill bits with diameters 1, 0. 5, 0. 3, 0. 2 and 0. 1 mm. The defects were investigated by using an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>tester</b> and a computer tomography system. Defects smaller than 0. 3 mm may not be found by using the ultrasonic test, but the defects may be found by using the computer tomography system. The investigation conditions for detecting small defects and the scanning time for in-line defect analysis are discussed in the present study...|$|E
40|$|In practice, it {{is often}} {{required}} to evaluate the technical condition and the load carrying capacity of the hollow core slabs made of the precast reinforced concrete. Quality of the slabs is also characterized by the structural properties of the concrete. However, it is problematic to drill out the full value concrete specimens from such constructions for carrying out the research {{with the help of}} the material destructive control methods. The physiccal and mechanical properties of concrete are known to be best characterized by its density, porosity and strength, as well as its integrity indexes, which can be determined by using the material nondestructive control methods – by applying the ultrasonic pulse velocity measuring devices. However, at the same time, it is also known that there are several factors that influence the ultrasonic pulse propagation velocity in the concrete and the reinforced concrete structures. The earlier performed investigations have established that the reinforcement increased concentration in the upper layers of the tested unit increases the ultrasonic pulse propagation velocity. Explanations to different standards indicate to the effect of reinforcement as well. Still, when widely applying the concrete structure sounding {{with the help of the}} ultrasonic longitudinal waves (by using the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>tester</b> "УК- 1401 " for this purpose) at a number of different building objects and determining the longitudinal waves propagation velocity in case of the single-sided (i. e. surface) sounding, doubts have arose with regards to essentiality of the effect of reinforcement. To further investigate it, 5 model specimens were manufactured – the reinforced concrete specimens different from each other, where the reinforcement diameters were in conformity with the work reinforcement of the typical reinforced concrete hollow core slabs. When performing measurements in the zones exactly over the rebars and in the rebar-free zones, there were no significant differences in the ultrasonic longitudinal waves propagation velocity established. A conclusion can be drawn that for the uncracked precast hollow core slabs and other construction elements made of the reinforced concrete, which maximal rebars diameter does not exceed 22 mm, the concrete integrity measurements with the help of the "УК- 1401 " tester can be performed sufficiently correctly even, when the rebars are quite close to the sounded surface...|$|E
40|$|The most {{commonly}} used nondestructive inspection (NDI) technique for adhesively bonded and composite structures is the ultrasonic C-scan technique operating in a pulse-echo or through-transmission mode. They are most effective in detecting disbonds, voids, delamination and foreign inslusions, but are ineffective {{for the detection of}} weak bonds at the adhesive points. Weak bonds are mostly caused by improper surface cleaning of substrates. There is no air space at the adhesive joints where the substrate and the adhesive are in intimate contact with each other. This results in a lack of interface for ultrasound reflection required for their detection by conventional ultrasonic NDI techniques. Other ultrasonic techniques such as ultrasonic spectroscopy and <b>ultrasonic</b> resonance <b>testers</b> also suffer from the same disadvantage...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{efficiency}} and improved performance associated with light-weight materials were investigated in this study. Numerous studies have investigated surface treatments {{to improve the}} fatigue strength of metals. Laser heat treatment is a promising method because the power and spot size can be easily controlled, allowing a small heat affected zone (HAZ). However, changes in the material properties can result; in particular, the material can become more brittle. In this study, a combination of laser heat treatment and vibration peening was proposed to increase fatigue strength without changing the material characteristics. SCM 440 H was investigated experimentally, and specimens were tested using a giga-cycle <b>ultrasonic</b> fatigue <b>tester.</b> The {{results show that the}} combination of these two processes significantly increased the fatigue strength and, furthermore, different fracture types were observed after a small and large number of cycles...|$|R

40|$|In 1993 Romanian National Company for Motorways and National Roads (C. N. A. D. N. R.) {{decided to}} perform quality {{controls}} {{by its own}} research branch, Center for Technical Road Studies and IT (CESTRIN), for works executed on bridges. Thus, three equipments were purchased: Schmidt hammer, <b>ultrasonic</b> concrete <b>tester</b> and pachometer, allowing CESTRIN to perform tests on road bridges, in a multi-year monitoring process. After 1989 in Romania almost all bridge technical data have been lost, thus leading to errors in rehabilitation designs. In 2009 CESTRIN will be beneficiary of a PHARE Project “Improvement of safety, quality of services and institutional capacity in transport sector”. Thus, new equipments that offer information about road structures and riverbed will fulfill the needs of C. N. A. D. N. R.

40|$|The reuse system {{proposed}} by the authors is an overall business system for realizing a cyclic reuse flow through the processes of design, fabrication, construction, maintenance, demolition and storage. The reuse system {{is one of the}} methods to reduce the environmental burden in the field of building steel structures.

In this paper, focusing on building steel structures used for plants, warehouses and offices without fire protection, the performance of steel structural members for reuse is evaluated by a non-destructive test. First, performance evaluation procedures for a non-destructive test, such as mechanical properties, chemical compositions, dimension and degradation, are shown. Tensile strengths are estimated using Vickers hardness measured by a portable <b>ultrasonic</b> hardness <b>tester,</b> and chemical compositions are measured by a portable optical emission spectrometer.

40|$|A cobalt-containing {{hardfacing}} alloy NiCoCrB (Ni- 17. 1 % Co- 19. 6 % Cr- 14. 5 % Fe- 3. 5 % B- 1 % C- 0. 9 % Si) was surface-alloyed on mild steel AISI 1050 {{and stainless steel}} AISI 316 L as presented in Part I, together with their microstructures and cavitation erosion behaviour in deionised water. In Part II, the corrosion and cavitation erosion-corrosion behaviour in 3. 5 % NaCl at 23 °C was studied with a potentiodynamic polarisation technique and <b>ultrasonic</b> vibration <b>tester,</b> respectively. The corrosion resistance of mild steel 1050 was somewhat increased, owing {{to the presence of}} Cr in the alloyed layer, while that of stainless steel 316 L decreased, due to the presence of borides and boro-carbides which weakened the passive film. The cavitation erosion-corrosion resistance Rec in 3. 5 % NaCl was improved by a factor of 8. 3 and 9. 9 for 1050 316 L, respectively. Corrosion and erosion-corrosion synergism {{played a significant role in}} the overall cavitation erosion-corrosion resistance, leading to a drop in resistance of approximately 50 - 70 % for laser-alloyed 1050 specimens and approximately 20 % in the case of laser-alloyed 316 L specimens. Thus, it might be concluded that it is difficult to simultaneously achieve significant improvements in both erosion and corrosion resistance. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{laboratory}} measurement of compression and shear waves in Basalt rock. Compression or primary waves were produced using a standard <b>ultrasonic</b> pulse velocity <b>tester.</b> However, {{it is well}} accepted that the production of pure shear waves in rock is difficult because of which suitable assumptions {{are made in the}} testing. Since bender elements have traditionally been used to produce pure shear at very small strains in soft materials, their use has been extended in this study to Basalt rock. The fabrication and setup of bender element tests is first discussed. The transducers were accommodated in pre-drilled slots at the two flat ends of the samples, the effect of which was carefully investigated using experimental and numerical studies. For 10 - 12 mm long piezoceramic plates, the shear wave velocity was found to reduce by about 5 % because of the slots. The shear wave velocity was estimated using the first arrival method after removing the near field and the crosstalk effects from the output signal. The shear wave velocity ranged between 1. 15 and 3. 31 km/s and was nearly equal to one-half of the primary wave velocity. The results also show that the ratio of the shear wave velocity and the compression wave velocity was independent of the density and porosity of the Basalt rock. Because most of the rock was unweathered and compact and, its cavities filled with secondary minerals such as zeolites, calcites and silicates, {{it is unlikely that the}} high overburden pressures would affect the observed wave velocities.
