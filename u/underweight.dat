Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines (BCG, measles and full courses of polio and DPT), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut. The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births. The survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic, and up to 20% of children are <b>underweight,</b> while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Initially Los Alamos was {{supposed}} to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him <b>underweight</b> at , diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain. The plan to commission scientists fell through when Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.|$|E

40|$|Two {{paradigms}} {{are commonly}} used to examine risky choice based on experiential sampling. The feedback paradigm involves {{a large number of}} repeated, consequential choices with feedback about the chosen (partial feedback) or chosen and foregone (full feedback) payoffs. The sampling paradigm invites cost-free samples before a single consequential choice. Despite procedural differences, choices in both experience-based paradigms suggest <b>underweighting</b> of rare events relative to their objective probability. This contrasts with overweighting when choice options are described, thereby leading to a &# 039;gap&# 039; between experience and description-based choice. Behavioural data and model-based analysis from an experiment comparing choices from description, sampling, and partial- and full-feedback paradigms replicated the &# 039;gap&# 039;, but also indicated significant differences between feedback and sampling paradigms. Our results suggest that mere sequential experience of outcomes is insufficient to produce reliable <b>underweighting.</b> We discuss when and why <b>underweighting</b> occurs, and implicate repeated, consequential choice as the critical factor...|$|R
40|$|Field {{studies suggest}} that {{providing}} summarized information concerning the prevalence of risks can increase risk taking when the hazard is rare. We study a simple experimental model of this phenomenon based on repeated descriptive summaries of past outcomes. Under cumulative prospect theory and experience-sampling models, descriptions of rare events should increase the weighting of rare events. On the other hand, if individuals {{are sensitive to the}} frequency of events, then event summaries are expected to accentuate the <b>underweighting</b> of rare events despite adding descriptive information. These contrasting predictions were examined in three experiments using a multi-alternative decision task with two sets of options: safe and risky. In all three experiments, repeated descriptive summaries of past outcomes from all alternatives or from a randomly drawn alternative were found to accentuate the <b>underweighting</b> of rare events by a similar amount. The results shed light on the role of frequency-based judgments in the extreme <b>underweighting</b> of rare events and highlight that providing information about the incidence of rare hazards can have the unintended effect of increasing, rather than decreasing, people's propensity to take risks...|$|R
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered <b>underweight</b> to what is now the normal range {{played a significant role in}} the development of industrialized societies. Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E

5|$|Brabham {{had been}} working with the German engine {{manufacturer}} BMW since 1980 on the development of a turbocharged engine for Formula One. The BMW-powered BT50 made its debut {{at the start of the}} 1982 season, taking advantage of the high-altitude Kyalami circuit in South Africa, which favoured turbocharged cars. However, the as yet unreliable BMW-powered cars were dropped for the next two races. Piquet finished first at the Brazilian Grand Prix in a BT49D, but was disqualified after a protest from Renault and Ferrari on the grounds that the car had raced <b>underweight</b> due to its water-cooled brakes. FISA ruled that in future all cars must be weighed before coolants were topped up, resulting in a boycott of the fourth race of the season by most of the DFV-powered teams, including Brabham. Under threat from BMW, Brabham did not use its Ford-powered BT49s again until the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, where one was entered for Riccardo Patrese alongside Piquet in a BT50. Patrese won the race after a chaotic final lap on which several other cars stopped. Patrese used the BT49 for the next two races, taking a second place behind Piquet's BMW-powered car in the BT49's final Formula One race, the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E

5000|$|The {{results from}} experience-based studies {{may be the}} result of a recency effect. The recency effect shows that greater weight or value is {{assigned}} to more recent events. Given that rare events are uncommon, the more common events are more likely to take recency and therefore be weighted more than rare events. The recency effect, then, may be responsible for the <b>underweighting</b> of rare events in decisions made from experience. Given that description-based studies usually involving responding to a limited number of trials or only one trial, recency effects likely do not have as much of an influence on decision making in these studies or may even be entirely irrelevant. Another variable which may be driving the results for the experience-based decisions paradigm is a basic tendency to avoid delayed outcomes: alternatives with positive rare events are on average advantageous only in the long term; while alternatives with negative rare events are on average disadvantageous in the long term. Hence, focusing on short term outcomes produces <b>underweighting</b> of rare events. Consistent with this notion, it has been found the increasing the short term temptation (e.g., by showing outcomes from all options; or foregone payoffs) increases the <b>underweighting</b> of rare events in decisions from experience ...|$|R

5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually <b>underweight</b> and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers.

The rest of the difference is consistent with two well established mechanisms: judgment error and the use of small samples in choice.
