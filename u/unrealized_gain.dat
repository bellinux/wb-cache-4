50|$|The AMT was {{designed}} to prevent people from using loopholes in the tax law to avoid tax. However, the inclusion of <b>unrealized</b> <b>gain</b> on incentive stock options imposes difficulties for people who cannot come up with cash to pay tax on gains {{that they have not}} realized yet. As a result, Congress has taken action to modify the AMT regarding incentive stock options. In 2000 and 2001, people exercised incentive stock options and held onto the shares, hoping to pay long-term capital gains taxes instead of short-term capital gains taxes. Many of these people were forced to pay the AMT on this income, {{and by the end of}} the year, the stock was no longer worth the amount of alternative minimum tax owed, forcing some individuals into bankruptcy. In the Nortel example given above, the individual would receive a credit for the AMT paid when the individual did eventually sell the Nortel shares.

50|$|With {{that out}} of the way, here's how basic {{earnings}} and gains/losses work on a mutual fund. The fund records income for dividends and interest earned which typically increases the value of the mutual fund shares, while expenses set aside have an offsetting impact to share value. When the fund's investments increase (decrease) in market value, so too the fund shares value increases (or decreases). When the fund sells investments at a profit, it turns or reclassifies that paper profit or <b>unrealized</b> <b>gain</b> into an actual or realized gain. The sale has no effect on the value of fund shares but it has reclassified a component of its value from one bucket to another on the fund books—which will have future impact to investors. At least annually, a fund usually pays dividends from its net income (income less expenses) and net capital gains realized out to shareholders as an IRS requirement. This way, the fund pays no taxes but rather all the investors in taxable accounts do. Mutual fund share prices are typically valued each day the stock or bond markets are open and typically the value of a share is the net asset value of the fund shares investors own.|$|E

The {{realization}} requirement is a pervasive, popularly supported aspect of our tax system, and there is no indication Congress is about to reverse course in this regard.According to Burke and Friel, there are policy arguments to be made for and against taxing appreciation. If Congress chose to tax appreciation, taxpayers' tax income would likely match their economic income: [...] "it would thus tend to place on the same tax footing persons who are economically similarly situated." [...] However, the current system allows the IRS a degree of [...] "administrative convenience." [...] Moreover, it is arguably unfair to treat unrealized gains as income if the taxpayer may not have the appropriate funds to cover the tax liability, presumably forcing the taxpayer to sell the asset in question simply to pay the tax resulting from it. [...] In the end, economic gain will be taxed. [...] "Realization is fundamentally a matter of timing.... the unrealized total gain, of course, may fluctuate from time to time as the property's value changes, but that total will be treated as income only on realization. To describe realization as a matter of timing should, nonetheless, not be seen as a dismissive comment. In taxes, as in life, timing can be everything...." ...|$|E

This association is weaker for firms that have the ability to pass input price changes through to customers. Finally, I find that investors do not immediately price the information conveyed by cash flow hedges. Instead, investors appear surprised by future realizations of gross margin, consistent with the view that a lack of transparent disclosure on future hedged transactions leads to a delay in pricing.

This study investigates whether reporting an <b>unrealized</b> <b>gain</b> or loss in a separate line item on the income statement, as opposed to disclosure only in a footnote, affects how financial analysts use and evaluate information on such gains and losses.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the issues of disclosure of and corporate governance of insider trading in Malaysia. Insider trading has evolved itself in various jurisdictions from the agency theory to the misappropriation theory. In Malaysia, the mere fact of the receipt of information itself resulted in a triggering of a breach of insider laws regardless of <b>unrealized</b> <b>gain</b> or loss. In this paper, documents from several articles, section 183 - 188, Capital Market and Services Act 2007 (CMSA), including the inclusion of ``Chinese walls'' were used as a defence for a corporation with regard to conduct of its officers under section 194 of the CMSA. Moreover, the Malaysian disclosure best practises guidelines of 2004 were scrutinized in studying and establishing an evolution of insider provisions leaning towards the philosophy of disclosure theory. The findings indicated that should the insider misappropriated the ``property information'' of a Company by non-disclosure, by not disclosing it in a timely manner, by being inaccurate, by being ambiguous, or by disclosing to another person who have proprietary information before it officially reached the market warrant the prospect of violating insider-trading rules?

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} trading {{incentives}} {{of financial institutions}} induced by the interaction between regulatory accounting rules and capital requirements by investigating insurance companies’ trading behavior during the recent financial crisis. According to insurance regulation, life insurers have {{a greater degree of}} flexibility to hold downgraded instruments at historical cost, whereas property and casualty insurers are forced to re-mark many of their downgraded securities to market prices. Using firm-level insurance company transaction and position data, we study the implications of this accounting difference, and document direct evidence of ‘gains trading’ associated with historical cost accounting during the financial crisis. When faced with severe downgrades among their holdings in asset-backed securities (ABS), life insurers largely continue to hold the downgraded securities at historical cost and instead selectively sell their corporate bond holdings with the highest <b>unrealized</b> <b>gains.</b> This is particularly true for insurers facing regulatory capital constraints and with high ABS exposures. This behavior is largely absent among property and casualty insurers; they instead disproportionately sell their re-marked ABS holdings. Finally, we find that the gains trading among life companies induces significant price declines in the otherwise unrelated corporate bonds that happen to exhibit high <b>unrealized</b> <b>gains.</b> ...|$|R
