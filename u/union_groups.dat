2500|$|The {{industrial}} unions (sometimes {{referred to}} as [...] "branch unions") form the base structure of the CNT. Each industrial <b>union</b> <b>groups</b> together workers of different crafts within an industry. When there are fewer than 25 people working in one particular industry, a various posts union is formed for that industry, rather than multiple industry unions. A various posts union can include workers from different crafts and industries; it requires a minimum of five people. If this number cannot be reached, four or fewer workers can form a confederal group. Due to {{the small size of}} the CNT, a majority of its unions are various posts unions.|$|E
2500|$|On July 17–18 {{a part of}} the Spanish army, led by a {{group of}} {{officers}} (among them Generals Jose Sanjurjo, Francisco Franco, Emilio Mola, Manuel Goded and Gonzalo Queipo de Llano), tried to overthrow the Popular Front Government of the Second Spanish Republic. The occupation of the capital, Madrid, was one of the prime goals of the Spanish coup of July 1936. However the coup in this particular location was ill-planned and clumsily executed. [...] There was no coordination between the diverse elements who were hostile to the Republic (the falangists, some army officers, {{and the members of the}} UME). The coordinator of the plot in Madrid: Colonel Galarza had been detained and the elderly and indecisive General Villegas took his place. However Villegas decided at the last minute to avoid direct participation and General Joaquín Fanjul replaced him at short notice. [...] There was a particularly strong concentration of pro-government forces in Madrid. These included para-military security forces and organized (though at this stage generally unarmed) <b>union</b> <b>groups.</b> Finally, a large portion of the officers and soldiers of the regular Madrid army garrison were uninvolved in the plot and pre-disposed to remain loyal to the elected government.|$|E
2500|$|America West Airlines and the US Airways merged FAA {{certificates}} on September 25, 2007.

Until October 2008, former America West aircraft flew with their respective crews and used the call sign [...] "CACTUS", while the pre-merger US Airways crews primarily flew with their respective aircraft and used the call sign [...] "US AIR". In October 2008, the company began operating under a single operating certificate (that of the former US Airways). This required operation under a single call sign and identifier, and that of America West ("CACTUS" [...] and [...] "AWE") were chosen {{as a sign of}} the company lineage. In addition, flights operated using former America West aircraft and crews were numbered 1–699, whereas flights operated by pre-merger US Airways aircraft and crews were numbered 700–1999. (Flights numbered 2000–2199 were shuttle services and those 2200 and higher were operated by express subsidiaries.) Aircraft operated by pre-merger US Airways crews or former America West crews flew under two different United States Department of Transportation operating certificates until September 25, 2007. However, until pilot and flight attendant <b>union</b> <b>groups</b> from both sides successfully negotiated a single contract, each group of crewmembers would fly only on its pre-merger airlines' aircraft and the flights would be marked accordingly.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{with his}} first union in 1937, Local 1185 of the Retail Clerks International Association, Barasch began {{organizing}} smaller <b>union</b> <b>groups,</b> including Local 105 of the International Leather Goods Workers Union, Local 22806 (Powder Puff & Cosmetics Workers Union), Local 20646 (Cosmetics, Soap & Perfumery Workers Union), Local 20734 (Vinegar & Mustard Workers Union), and Local 18943 (Hardware & Grocery Workers Union). In 1942, he created and served as {{managing editor of the}} Unity News, an official labor newspaper publication of the Manufacturers, Wholesale, and Retail Unions to inform and connect union workers during and after World War II. The newspaper received a citation award from the United States Treasury Department from Henry Morgenthau, Jr. on May 27, 1943 for [...] "distinguished services rendered in behalf of the War Savings Program." [...] On January 1, 1947, Barasch created the Allied Trades Council to incorporate the unions he had organized in the past decade, and soon after, he sought and was granted affiliation with the International Leather Goods, Plastic & Novelty Workers Union, which allowed Allied Trades Council to be designated as an AFL (American Federation of Labor) organization. The AFL designation was maintained until the two groups parted ways in 1965. [...] Under his leadership, the union expanded to the distributing and manufacturing, leather, drug and novelty fields which included over 10,000 members by 1948. Barasch was later issued a charter for a second union in 1952 (Local 815 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters) to aid in his expansion efforts in New York when he began having jurisdictional disputes with Teamsters locals. By 1965, Allied Trades Council represented 88 businesses, including pharmacies, restaurants, and candy stores and Local 815 grew to represent 165 pharmacies, perfumeries, bakeries, and other businesses.|$|E
