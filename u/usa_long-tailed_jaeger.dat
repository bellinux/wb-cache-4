40|$|The <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Jaeger</b> is an {{accidental}} migrant in Nebraska {{with just one}} accepted record through the mid- 1990 s. Based on records from adjacent states, especially Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992) and Wyoming (Faulkner 2010), the species is probably more frequent than these records indicate, and its status is further complicated by possible confusion with Pomarine and Parasitic jaegers. In this article I report details of four records of <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Jaegers</b> in western Nebraska and comment on the species 2 ̆ 7 identification and status in the state...|$|R
5000|$|Identification is {{complicated}} by similarities to <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger</b> and pomarine jaeger, {{and the existence of}} three colour morphs. Small for a skua, the parasitic jaeger measures 41 - 48 cm in length, 107 - 125 cm in wingspan and weighs 300 - 650 g. The tail streamer of the breeding adult accounts for about 7 cm of their length. Light-morph adults have a brown back, mainly white underparts and dark primary wing feathers with a white [...] "flash". The head and neck are yellowish-white with a black cap and there is a pointed central tail projection. Dark-morph adults are dark brown, and intermediate-phase birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts, head and neck. All morphs have the white wing flash.Identification of juveniles is even more problematic, {{and it is difficult to}} separate parasitic <b>jaegers</b> from <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaegers.</b> Parasitic jaegers are bulkier, shorter-winged, and less tern-like than <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaegers.</b> They are usually warmer toned, with browner shades, rather than grey. However, they show the same wide range of plumage variation. The flight is more falcon-like.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is known}} {{for a number of}} bird species, {{including}} pectoral sandpiper, cactus wren, Baird's sandpiper and the more rare <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger,</b> red knot and red phalarope, as well as others. Pyrrhuloxia, scarlet tanager and various waterfowl can also be seen in the spring and fall migrations.|$|R

50|$|Birds include brant goose, snowy owl, {{parasitic}} <b>jaeger,</b> <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger,</b> pomarine jaeger, {{and common}} raven. Thayer's gull and glaucous gull {{are to be}} found here also, but the island is most notable for ivory gull, found on Seymour Island from May to September. The gulls of Seymour Island breed on raised beaches unlike other Canadian ivory gull colonies. The island supports Canada’s largest known ivory gulls breeding colony, approximately 10-12 percent of the known Canadian population. In 2005, Gilchrist and Mallory postulated that Seymour Island gulls may represent forty percent of the surviving Canadian population of this species. The Seymour Island population represents approximately one percent of the world population of ivory gulls.|$|R
50|$|Water {{birds of}} all kinds nest in the monument. Nesting species include tundra swan, mallard, green-winged teal, common eider, Canada goose, and horned and red-necked grebes. Sandhill cranes also nest on the tundra, with common, Arctic and yellow-billed loons. Seabirds include {{glaucous}} gulls, Arctic terns, <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaegers</b> and common murres. Landbirds include willow and rock ptarmigans. Predatory landbirds include peregrine falcons, snowy owls and goshawks. Endangered species at Cape Krusenstern include the possibly extinct Eskimo curlew, and threatened spectacled eider and Steller's eider.|$|R

50|$|The Denali Highway is an {{important}} birding destination. It offers road access to alpine terrain - not that common in Alaska - and, in the brief birding season there, good viewing {{of a number of}} alpine breeders, including Arctic Warbler, Smith's Longspur, <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Jaeger,</b> Whimbrel, Surfbird, Lapland Longspur, Horned Lark, Short-eared Owl, Wandering Tattler, Gyrfalcon and much more. A walk north along The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Maclaren Summit Trail (MP 39) can be very productive. There are also trumpeter swans and various other waterfowl in the lakes and ponds along the route.|$|R
50|$|They nest on dry tundra {{or higher}} fells laying two spotted olive-brown eggs. On the {{breeding}} grounds {{they can be}} heard making yelping and rattling sounds. Outside of the breeding season they {{spend most of their}} time over open ocean and have a harsh kreeah cry. This bird feeds on fish (mainly caught from other seabirds), smaller birds, food scraps, small mammals, fruit and carrion. On migration, <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaegers</b> are more likely to catch their own food, and less likely to steal from gulls and terns than larger species.|$|R
50|$|Some wildlife, notably Arctic hares, lemmings, muskoxen and Arctic wolves {{reside in}} this {{national}} park, but sparse vegetation and low temperatures support only small populations. There {{is a very}} small Peary caribou population as well. Other animal inhabitants include ringed seals, bearded seals, walruses, polar bears, and narwhals. During summer months, birds nest in the park including semipalmated plovers, red knots, gyrfalcons and <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaegers.</b> Common plants include dwarf willow and Arctic cotton, in addition to grasses and lichens. Plant and animal life is more concentrated in the Lake Hazen region, which has a milder climate than the surrounding ice cap-covered mountains and valleys.|$|R
5|$|Several {{animal species}} inhabit Level Mountain, notably brown bears, wolves, <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaegers,</b> caribou, {{mountain}} goats, ptarmigans, moose, long-tailed ducks and Stone sheep. Wolves occupy valleys {{and use the}} alpine areas for hunting and denning. Also common in the alpine are brown bears, which are potential predators of newborn caribou calves. The caribou at Level Mountain form a herd {{that is part of}} a larger population ranging west of the Dease River and north of the Stikine River into Yukon. More than 400 caribou were identified at Level Mountain in 1978, although the Ministry of Environment and Parks considered the herd to be declining due to poor recruitment. By 1980, the caribou population was estimated to have been roughly 350.|$|R
50|$|Gedser Odde {{is a good}} {{site for}} observing migratory birds, {{especially}} on windy days. Common eiders {{can be seen in}} large numbers around the point in the spring (from the end of March to the beginning of April) and autumn. It is not uncommon for as many as 40,000 per day to fly past. The common scoter is viewable throughout the year in flocks of as many as 3,000. In the autumn, migratory geese can be seen in their thousands. Other species crossing the area include the red-throated loon, pomarine skua, the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger,</b> and great skua. Gedser Odde is probably the area with the most little gulls in both the spring and the autumn with up to a thousand per day.|$|R
50|$|Kongsfjorden Bird Sanctuary (Kongsfjorden fuglereservat) is a 140 ha bird reserve at Svalbard, Norway, {{established}} in 1973. It includes islands and islets in Kongsfjorden, Haakon VII Land. It {{lies at the}} inner end of the fjord and consists of about ten islands, mainly covered with grassy vegetation and having small freshwater ponds. The fjord is surrounded by steep mountains, cliffs, glaciers and tundra. The reserve has been recognised as a {{wetland of international importance}} by designation under the Ramsar Convention. It has also been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. It supports breeding populations of pink-footed and barnacle geese, common and king eiders, long-tailed ducks, purple sandpipers, red phalaropes, glaucous gulls, <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaegers</b> and snow buntings.

50|$|The {{wetlands}} are not {{the only}} places where there are birds in the reserve. Regular inventories conducted in Tjulträsk Valley show that between 400 and 500 pairs of birds nest in one square kilometer of birch forests, half of which are the willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus). These forests and the alpine willow bushes are also the territory of the bluethroat (Luscinia svecica), the Lapland longspur (Calcarius lapponicus) and the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus). The moorlands, on the other hand, are the territory of the northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), the meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) and the occasional horned lark (Eremophila alpestris). At higher altitudes, birds are sparse, but snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) can be found in this region. Finally, the mountains are an important hunting ground for the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus), the common Raven (Corvus corax), the snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger</b> (Stercorarius longicaudus), the gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) and the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Breeding density, timing, chick {{growth and}} food habits {{of a high}} {{population}} of <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger</b> were studied in 1966. Breeding density fluctuated from O to 2 pairs per square mile (259 hectares) from 1961 to 1966; peak years were 1962 and 1966. Breeding success was 12 to 13 per cent of eggs laid in 1966, and only 1 of 7 nests in 4 low years was successful. Published evidence suggests breeding success in peak years is usually high. Egg-laying dates vary widely between years and within populations. Occurrence of food items in 242 fresh and 710 old regurgitated pellets was, respectively, 90. 1 and 94. 0 per cent lemming remains. Occurrence of other vertebrate prey (mostly birds) was 18. 6 and 8. 0 per cent. Snow buntings were the most frequent bird (79. 5 and 72. 5 per cent), and shorebirds the next most frequent group (9. 1 and 21. 6 per cent). The percentage of juveniles among passerine birds was 83 and 79. 4 and among shorebirds was 75 and 91. Insects occurred in 30 per cent of new pellets. RÉSUMÉ.

50|$|Great skuas measure 50 - 58 cm {{long and}} have a 125 - 140 cm wingspan. One study found that 112 males weighed an average of 1.27 kg and that 125 females weighed an average of 1.41 kg. Adults are a {{streaked}} greyish brown, with a black cap, while juveniles are a warmer brown and unstreaked below. They have a short, blunt tail, and a powerful flight. The great skua's call is a harsh hah-hah-hah-hah; quacking and croaking noises have also been heard. Distinguishing this skua from the other North Atlantic skuas (parasitic jaeger, pomarine <b>jaeger</b> and <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger)</b> is relatively straightforward. The herring gull size, massive barrel chest and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. It is sometimes said {{to give the impression}} of a common buzzard. Identification of this skua is only complicated when it is necessary to distinguish it from the closely related large southern-hemisphere skuas. Despite its name, the great skua is marginally smaller on average than the other 3 large southern-hemisphere skuas, although not by enough to distinguish them by size in the field. Some authorities still regard the great skua as conspecific with some of these southern skuas, and as a group they have sometimes been separated in the genus Catharacta, although currently this taxonomy is not commonly followed.|$|R
40|$|On 5 October, 1997, {{we joined}} Joel G. Jorgensen and John Sullivan for a pelagic trip on Lake McConaughy. A similar trip in late September 1996 yielded a Sabine 2 ̆ 7 s Gull, {{but we were}} really hoping to see a jaeger. From 7 : 00 to 8 : 30 a. m. we {{gradually}} worked our way from the dam towards {{the western end of}} the lake. Besides moderate numbers of Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s and Ring-billed Gulls, there were few birds on the lake. At approximately 8 : 45 a. m. Dinsmore noticed that all of the gulls at the western end of the lake had suddenly taken flight. Less than a minute later, we simultaneously spotted a jaeger soaring directly overhead. The size, dark coloration, and prominent white flashes in the Wings identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird made a couple of attacks on Franklin Gulls and then flew east down the lake. We chased the jaeger for more than ten miles before losing it. We relocated the bird a short time later just above the dam. This time, the bird attacked a couple of Ring-billed Gulls before flying west up the lake. We again took chase, but lost the bird before reaching Lemoyne. The gull-like shape, generally brown coloration, and prominent white bases to the primaries identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird was smaller but longer-winged than a Ring-billed Gull and larger and slimmer than a Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull. The overall coloration was dark brown, except for some warmer rufous tones on the underparts. We saw no visible barring on the underparts. The bill was straight and slender, but the color pattern was not noted. The upperwing was dark brown except for white at the base of at least the outermost four primaries. The underwing was also dark except for a prominent white area on the undersides of the bases of the primaries. The rectrices were dark and the central feathers were slightly elongated with pointed tips. We all agreed on the identification as a juvenile Parasitic Jaeger. Careful size comparisons to Franklin and Ring-billed Gulls eliminated juvenile Pomarine Jaeger, which also generally shows more white color on both surfaces of the wing. Juvenile <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Jaeger</b> was eliminated {{on the basis of the}} pattern of white on the wing and size and wing proportions. We further concluded the bird was an intermediate or dark morph individual based on the dark plumage and lack of a contrasting paler head or rump. This represents the second accepted record of a Parasitic Jaeger for Nebraska. The only other record is of a juvenile picked up alive in Sheridan County on 23 Aug 1968 which died the next day (specimen number UNSM ZM 12309) (Gates, Doris. 1969. Parasitic Jaeger rather than Skua. Nebraska Bird Review 37 : 31.). There are also five records of Pomarine Jaegers and a single <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Jaeger</b> record for Nebraska. Another 16 reports are of jaegers that were not identified to species...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{variation}} in the strength of trophic cascades in arctic tundra has been related to flows of subsidies across ecosystem boundaries. Here, we ask whether the input of marine subsidies in tundra systems would cause spatial {{variation in}} the strength of rodent–plant interactions between coastal areas, where predators have access to marine-derived resources, and non-subsidized inland areas of northern Fennoscandia. We present a detailed evaluation of predator–rodent–vegetation interactions along a coast-inland gradient, during the 2011 rodent outbreak and the two following decline years, by using direct assessments of rodent impacts and tracing of marine-derived nutrients in the food web. Our results revealed that the main rodent predator during summer, the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger</b> Stercorarius longicaudus, did not benefit from marine resources while breeding (relative dietary proportion in chicks’ diet = 0 – 3 %). Contrary to this pattern, parasitic jaegers S. parasiticus, bred exclusively near the coast and preyed effectively on both marine resources (41 % of chicks’ diet) and rodents (12 %). Mammalian predators also showed a higher activity during winter near the coast. Despite overall higher predator numbers, no evidence was found for lower rodent population growth rates during the three monitoring summers and for weaker rodent grazing impacts in the coastal area. Instead, we documented pronounced damages caused by lemmings and voles on bryophytes and vascular plants, especially dwarf shrubs (e. g. Vaccinum myrtillus) all along the coast–inland gradient. Taken together, our results {{did not support the}} hypothesis that marine subsidies would trigger a trophic cascade in coastal tundra areas of northern Fennoscandia during a major rodent outbreak, probably due to a relatively low diversity of marine-subsidized predators in the region.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{summarize}} {{records of}} birds and mammals obtained at Coats Island, Northwest Territories during one visit by a National Museum of Natural Sciences expedition and fourteen visits by Canadian Wildlife Service field crews to {{the northeast corner of}} the island, as well as records obtained from the journals of the Hudson’s Bay Company post active on the island from 1920 to 1924. The terrestrial mammal fauna is very depauperate, lacking any small herbivores. Consequently, predators special-izing in small mammals—such as ermine, snowy owl, and <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger,</b> all common on nearby Southampton Island—are rare or absent from Coats Island, except in passage. In addition, there are no snow goose colonies on Coats Island, although good numbers of Canada geese breed there, and some brant may also do so. This means that grazing on the island is mainly confined to the resident caribou population. The absence of small mammals and the relatively low density of geese may have accounted for the poor results of fox trapping during the period when the Hudson’s Bay Company post was operating. Numbers of most marine mammals appear to have changed little since the 1920 s, although bowhead whales may have become rarer, with only two sightings since 1981, compared to several annually in the 1920 s. Winter records from the 1920 – 24 post journals suggest that waters off Coats Island are within the wintering range of beluga, walrus, and thick-billed murres. Eighty-four species of birds have been seen since 1975; this number includes many sightings of vagrant birds well outside their normal ranges. This may be accounted for by the comparative lushness of the vegetation surrounding the thick-billed murre colony, which attracts birds from long distances.

5000|$|Some 21 {{species of}} {{woodpecker}} {{have been reported}} from northern goshawk food studies around the world. With their relatively slow, undulating flight adult and fledged woodpeckers can easily be overtaken by hunting goshawks, not to mention their habitat preferences frequently put them within active goshawk ranges. Most of the widespread species from Europe and North America have been observed as prey, most commonly relatively large woodpeckers such as the 76 g greater spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) and the 176 g European green woodpecker (Picus viridis) in Europe and the 134 g northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) in North America. Indeed the flicker is the third most regularly reported prey species in America. In south-central Wyoming, the northern flicker was the second most numerous prey species {{and it was the}} main prey species in a study from New Mexico (here making up 26.4% of prey by number). All sizes of woodpeckers available are taken from the 19.8 g lesser spotted woodpecker (Dryobates minor) to the 321 g black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) in Europe and from the 25.6 g downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens) to the 287 g pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) in North America. In many areas, northern goshawks will pursue water birds of several varieties, although they rarely form {{a large portion of the}} diet. Perhaps the most often recorded water birds in the diet are ducks. All told, 32 waterfowl have been recorded in their diet. In the Ural mountains, the nearly cosmopolitan 1075 g mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) was third most numerous prey species. The ducks of the genus Aythya are somewhat frequently recorded as well, especially since their tree-nesting habits may frequently put them in the hunting range of nesting goshawks. Similarly, the wood duck (Aix sponsa) from America and the mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) from Asia may be more vulnerable than most waterfowl at their tree nests. Although etymologists feel that the goshawk is an abbreviation of “goose-hawk”, geese are seldomly taken considering their generally much larger size. Nonetheless, four species have been taken, including adults of species as large as the 2420 g greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons). Adult common eiders (Somateria mollissima), the largest northern duck at 2066 g, have also been captured by goshawks. Various other water birds reported as taken include red-throated loon (Gavia stellata) chicks, adult little grebes (Tachybaptus ruficollis), adult great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) (about the same size as a greater white-fronted goose), adult crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), black stork (Ciconia nigra) chicks and five species each of heron and rail. Among shorebirds (or small waders), goshawks have been reported preying on 22 sandpipers, 8 plovers, 10 species of gull and tern, 2 species of alcids and the Eurasian stone-curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus), the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) and the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>jaeger</b> (Stercorarius longicaudus).|$|R

Citrus is Israel’s number one fresh fruit export {{and must be}} free of pests and blemishes. Pest management in citrus groves in Israel is more-or-less satisfactory biological control of most aphids, scales, whiteflies, and mites [1]. Insecticides are used to control four primary pest species for which biological controls are insufficient: Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), citrus mealybug, citrus rust mite, and California red scale. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Israel’s citrus groves {{has been based on}} the judicious use of relatively selective insecticides, in combination with biological control. It has been estimated that 100 % of the citrus in Israel is managed with IPM [2]. Cottony-cushion scale had a devastating effect on citrus groves in Israel in the early 1900 s and has been kept under effective control by the predatory vedalia beetle introduced in 1912. When Green’s mealybug appeared as a serious pest of citrus in the 1930 ’s it was controlled by a parasite introduced in 1940 from Japan [3]. Another parasite introduced in 1952 from the <b>USA</b> controlled the <b>long-tailed</b> mealybug. The Florida red scale, considered the most important pest of Israel in the 1950 s, was brought under complete control in most areas by a parasite imported from Hong Kong [3]. Four species of very damaging whiteflies have been introduced into Israel in the last few decades. The introductio...|$|R
