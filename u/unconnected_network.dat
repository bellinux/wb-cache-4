Grandiose narcissists received a larger number of disliking nominations, indicating that they were actively disliked by their peers. In contrast, vulnerable narcissists were not actively disliked, but instead received fewer liking nominations. Both grandiose and vulnerable narcissists had a central position in terms of disliking, as they were disliked by otherwise <b>unconnected</b> <b>network</b> members.

Thus, the ME must visit each sensor node to gather the data separately due to no overlap coverage between sensors.

In our model, each group is characterized by its size (N_a and N_b) and preferred degree (κ_a and κ_b≪κ_a). The network dynamics is governed by the competing microscopic rules of each population that consist of the creation and destruction of links. Starting from an <b>unconnected</b> <b>network,</b> we give {{a detailed analysis of}} the mean field approach which is compared to Monte Carlo simulation data. The time evolution of the restricted degrees k_bb and k_ab presents three time regimes and a non monotonic behavior well captured by our theory. Surprisingly, when the population size are equal N_a=N_b, the ratio of the restricted degree θ_ 0 =k_ab/k_bb appears to be an integer in the asymptotic limits of the three time regimes. For early times (defined by t<t_ 1 =κ_b) the total number of links presents a linear evolution, where the two populations are indistinguishable and where θ_ 0 = 1. Interestingly, in the intermediate time regime (defined for t_ 1 <t<t_ 2 ∝κ_a and for which θ_ 0 = 5), the system reaches a transient stationary state, where the number of contacts among introverts remains constant while the number of connections is increasing linearly in the extrovert population.

40|$|Boards of {{directors}} are overwhelmingly dominated by men. Globally, only 5 - 20 % {{of directors}} of substantial corporations are women. Despite three decades of research and intervention this gender ratio has remained static except where affirmative action has forced change. Using Carlile and Christensen’s (2005) management theory building methodology, I develop a new theoretical approach {{to the study of}} women on corporate boards of directors called Glass Network Theory. Using concepts from small-world and scale-free network theory, I suggest that semi-permeable invisible barriers or glass nets, rather than glass ceilings, permit limited directors through to become connector directors with multiple board seats. Resistance to change in gendered director networks is framed as a structural and normative characteristic of dynamic networks. Like other natural and social scale-free networks, gendered director networks display an emergent and self-perpetuating order. Low levels of diversity are incorporated as adaptive features of stable self-similar director networks responding to environmental pressures and economic fluctuations. Nested director networks at global, national or local levels show self-similarity at all scales, particularly where ‘shoulder tapping’ or preferential attachment underpins the network formation. Probing gendered director networks with social network analysis tools shows that women directors in global and national networks {{are more likely to be}} found in the largest connected component than in the <b>unconnected</b> <b>network</b> components. Both male and female director networks show the characteristics of small-worlds, that is, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. Both male and female directors also show ‘positive assortativity’ where directors of high degree associate with other directors of high degree. As the distribution of multiple directorships follows a power law, the model of the expected seat spreads is a useful tool to track the effectiveness of governance or affirmative action interventions such as quotas.

40|$|Data mining – {{a search}} for {{interesting}} patterns in the data – typically creates {{a number of different}} models. These models need to be simple enough to be graspable by the human expert. A tree consisting of hundreds of nodes or a scatter plot projecting dozens of variables into a two-dimensional plane may offer great classification accuracy or class separation, yet they may be impossible to interpret. But simple models cannot describe the complex data which may contain many interesting relations. The solution is to create a large number of simple models, where each of them offers insight into {{a small part of the}} problem domain, but together they present a complete picture. The problem, however, is the presentation of the big picture. While a computer can infer thousands of models, the human expert is incapable of reviewing them without assistance. We argue that a set of partial views can represent complex data. Views may include linear projections, each involving at most a couple of variables and showing a single, particular, and simplified perspective or relation. Similarly, good predictive models can be build using ensembles of simple models, such as random forests of small trees, each covering a part of the problem domain. These approaches lack techniques for manual exploration. Is it possible to select a limited number of visualizations which will provide a complete picture? Can we navigate through the random forest and observe the common properties of models in each region? We propose a method for creating maps of classification models, which are presented to the user to interactively explore the model space. The proposed technique can, besides organizing predictive models, rank some types of visualizations. We extend existing methods – that rank projections based on quality – to consider projection diversity, and show that our method yields more information when viewing the same number of projections. We describe a model-map-based technique for the visualization and exploration of random forest, a prediction model that is assembled of random prediction trees. Those are normally small (up to 10 vertices), so each covers only a small part of the space of the decision problem. The random forest predicts remarkably well, however it is prohibitively difficult to explain or visualize–in comparison to a single prediction tree. Our method assists an expert with the random forest analysis, for example, in clustering similar trees together to emphasize the diverse ones. In addition to interactive exploration of a random forest, the model map can explain predictions of different classes. The final ingredient of the technique is a versatile interactive tool for exploration of maps and a new network layout technique, particularly suitable for handling the visualization of the model map networks. Most existing tools for network analysis are limited to drawing networks and computing their basic general characteristics. With this tools, it is impossible for the user to interactively and graphically manipulate the networks, select and explore sub-graphs using other statistical and data mining techniques, add and plot various other data within the graph, and so on. We developed tools that address these challenges, widgets and modules for exploration of networks and model maps within the general component-based environment Orange. We propose a network layout optimization algorithm which is designed to visualize fragmented networks: FragViz. Networks of prediction models are usually fragmented. They consist of unconnected components which popular network alignment algorithms place arbitrarily with respect to the rest of the network. This can lead to misinterpretations due to the proximity of otherwise unrelated elements. FragViz incorporates additional information on relations between <b>unconnected</b> <b>network</b> components. It uses a two-step approach by first arranging the nodes within each of the components and then placing the components so that their proximity in the network corresponds to their relatedness.

Arctic Indigenous peoples have been observing the environment for millennia, and CBM often incorporates traditional knowledge, which may be used independently from or in partnership with conventional scientific monitoring methods. Drawing on insights from the first Arctic Observing Summit, we provide an overview of the state of CBM in the Arctic. The CBM approach to monitoring is centered on community needs and interests. It offers fine-grained, local-scale data that are readily accessible to community and municipal decision makers. In spite of these advantages, CBM initiatives remain little documented and are often <b>unconnected</b> to wider <b>networks,</b> with the result that many practitioners lack a clear sense of the field and how best to support its growth and development. CBM initiatives are implemented within legal and governance frameworks that vary significantly both within and among different national contexts. Further documentation of differences and similarities among Arctic communities in relation to observing needs, interests, and legal and institutional capacities will help assess how CBM can contribute to Arctic observing networks. While CBM holds significant potential to meet observing needs of communities, more investment and experimentation are needed to determine how observations and data generated through CBM approaches might effectively inform decision making beyond the community level...|$|R
