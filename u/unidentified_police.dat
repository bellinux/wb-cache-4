5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an <b>unidentified</b> <b>police</b> officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unidentified</b> <b>police</b> sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E

2500|$|During this period, Alcala {{convinced}} {{hundreds of}} young men and women that he was a professional fashion photographer, and photographed them for his [...] "portfolio."

He returned home and through binoculars watched the lights until they disappeared south over the horizon.|$|R
50|$|Similar attacks {{targeting}} the Indonesian authorities, especially police officers, have also occurred in Papua, however {{these are not}} linked with Islamist terrorist cells, but rather with the Papuan separatist movement Organisasi Papua Merdeka.

5000|$|The Hong Kong {{government}} flatly rejected {{holding an}} independent {{inquiry into the}} civil unrest, and its official statement caused controversy. In referring to the Mong Kok incident as a [...] "riot" [...] and the 1967 leftist riots, lasting over six months and led to over 50 deaths, as [...] "disturbances", the government apparently sought to redefined the 1967 riots as legitimate political struggle.

50|$|When Jack Dragna died in 1956, the Los Angeles {{crime family}} cast {{a vote to}} see who would become the next boss. Momo was hoping that as a long time leader he would be elected. However, lawyer-turned-mobster Frank DeSimone was elected in what is {{believed}} to be a rigged election. He demoted Adamo and Adamo moved to San Diego shortly after. In the same year, Adamo attempted a murder-suicide by shooting his wife in the head before shooting himself. However, his wife ended up surviving. The reason for the killing isn't confirmed, but according to an <b>unidentified</b> <b>police</b> informant, Adamo's actions were out of shame from DeSimone raping Adamo's wife while being forced to watch. Adamo's wife was having an affair during their marriage and an alternative theory given is that Adamo committed these actions after finding out about it. His wife Marie, who never talked about the incident publicly, recovered and later married Frank Bompensiero.|$|E

50|$|An <b>unidentified</b> tipster {{informed}} <b>police</b> that Lee and Prugo {{were responsible}} for the Lohan burglary.
