Knowledge of what the end <b>user</b> <b>needs</b> from a weather forecast {{must be taken into account}} to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMeeting the <b>user's</b> <b>needs</b> is {{essential}} in housing delivery. Therefore, designers are required to consider personal motivations in the housing decision making process. The authors consider that Maslow's theory on hierarchy of needs is applicable in explaining user's motivations in housing. The theory indicates that different levels of <b>user's</b> <b>needs</b> imply different levels of housing expectations, hence different house attributes. This paper discusses a theoretical framework developed by the authors to summarize {{the relationship between the}} <b>user's</b> <b>needs</b> and the attributes of housing units. By systematically linking the <b>user's</b> <b>needs</b> to architectural attributes, person-environment congruence (PEC), hence suitability of living environment, will be improved...|$|R

This means that only the solutions that solve the problem are relevant. This logically means that the need defines the possible satisfying solutions - a set of solutions (many different products/services) that all can fulfill the <b>user</b> <b>need.</b> LUM {{is not limited to}} looking at one solution separately.|$|R

25|$|Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) is a {{software}} engineering methodology for describing systems as {{a hierarchy of}} functions, a diagrammatic notation for constructing a sketch for {{a software}} application. It offers building blocks to represent entities and activities, {{and a variety of}} arrows to relate boxes. These boxes and arrows have an associated informal semantics. SADT {{can be used as a}} functional analysis tool of a given process, using successive levels of details. The SADT method allows to define <b>user</b> <b>needs</b> for IT developments, which is used in industrial Information Systems, but also to explain and to present an activity’s manufacturing processes, procedures.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} are {{individual}} utilities that allow a user {{to take control}} of a remote computer over the network. In case of Remote Assistance, the remote <b>user</b> <b>needs</b> to receive an invitation and the control is cooperative. In case of RDC, however, the remote user opens a new session on the remote computer and has every power granted by its user account's rights and restrictions. Fast User Switching allows users to switch between user accounts on the local computer without quitting software and logging out. Fast User Switching is part of Winlogon and uses RDS to accomplish its switching feature. Third-party developers have also created client software for RDS. For example, rdesktop supports Unix platforms.|$|E
25|$|The visible {{graphical}} interface {{features of}} an application are {{sometimes referred to}} as chrome or GUI (pronounced gooey). Typically, users interact with information by manipulating visual widgets that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind of data they hold. The widgets of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of users. A model–view–controller allows a flexible structure in which the interface is independent from and indirectly linked to application functions, so the GUI can be customized easily. This allows users to select or design a different skin at will, and eases the designer's work to change the interface as <b>user</b> <b>needs</b> evolve. Good user interface design relates to users more, and to system architecture less.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{consideration}} of underlying analysis of <b>user's</b> information <b>need</b> {{is a key}} requirement in an intelligent filtering environment. However, the majority of current approaches to filtering are relevance-oriented, rather than user-oriented. This is partly because they are issued from fields that have somewhat different perspectives from that of information filtering, {{but also because of}} the difficulty of understanding and measuring user's motivations {{and the way in which}} the user expects the system to respond. This paper presents an original approach to information analysis and filtering inspired by the novelty detection theory. As well as being able to accurately learn <b>user's</b> information <b>need,</b> the approach has an analytical capacity for better understanding <b>user's</b> <b>need.</b> It provides a new way of looking at <b>user's</b> <b>need</b> in terms of precise, broad, and contradictory profile-contributing criteria. These criteria go on to estimate the relative importance the user might attach to precision and recall. The filtering threshold is then adjusted taking into account this knowledge about <b>user's</b> <b>need.</b> Experimental results on the standard Reuters- 21578 collection prove the effectiveness of the approach and confirm the potential usefulness of adapting the filtering results according to the knowledge acquired about <b>user's</b> <b>need...</b>|$|R

The aircraft is controlled {{by means of a}} centre stick (or control stick) and left hand throttles, designed on a Hand on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) principle to lower pilot workloads. Emergency escape is provided by a Martin-Baker Mk.16A ejection seat, with the canopy being jettisoned by two rocket motors. The HMSS was delayed by years but should have been operational by late 2011. Standard g-force protection is provided by the full-cover anti-g trousers (FCAGTs). a specially developed g suit providing sustained protection up to 9 g. German Air Force and Austrian Air Force pilots wear a hydrostatic g-suit called Libelle (dragonfly) Multi G Plus instead, which also provides protection to the arms, theoretically giving more complete g tolerance.|$|E
25|$|By 2009, 27 coffeeshops selling {{cannabis}} in Rotterdam, {{all within}} 200 metres from schools, must close down. This is {{nearly half of}} the coffeeshops that currently operate within its municipality. This is due to the new policy of city mayor Ivo Opstelten and the town council. The higher levels of the active ingredient in cannabis in Netherlands create a growing opposition to the traditional Dutch view of cannabis as a relatively innocent soft drug. Supporters of coffeeshops state that such claims are often exaggerated and ignore the fact that higher content means a <b>user</b> <b>needs</b> to use less of the plant to get the desired effects, making it in effect safer. Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content. Closing of coffeeshops is not unique for Rotterdam. Many other towns have done the same in the last 10 years.|$|E
