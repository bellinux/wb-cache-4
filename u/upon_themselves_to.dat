The Sci Fi Channel announced in 2002 that a TV miniseries would be produced based on Myst, to be produced by Mandalay Television Pictures in association with Columbia TriStar Domestic Television and Cyan, but never materialized. According to Rand Miller, none of the various proposals met Cyan's approval, or were too formulaic or silly. Independent filmmakers Patrick McIntire and Adrian Vanderbosch, themselves Myst fans, took it <b>upon</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> produce a motion picture based on the story revealed in the Myst novels. In 2006, the filmmakers sent a DVD proposal to Cyan. The developers gave the filmmakers permission to begin production. The film was set {{to be based on}} the novel Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, but no longer appears to be in production.|$|E
5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take it <b>upon</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars {{to make the case}} for emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the first decision to omit these books entirely from the Bible was made by Protestant laity rather than clergy. Bibles dating from shortly after the Reformation have been found whose tables of contents included the entire Roman Catholic canon, but which did not actually contain the disputed books, leading some historians to think that the workers at the printing presses took it <b>upon</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> omit them. However, Anglican and Lutheran Bibles usually still contained these books until the 20th century, while Calvinist Bibles did not. Several reasons are proposed for the omission of these books from the canon. One is the support for Catholic doctrines such as Purgatory and Prayer for the dead found in 2 Maccabees. Luther himself said he was following Jerome's teaching about the Veritas Hebraica.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Homotopy/continuation {{methods are}} {{attractive}} for finding dc operating points of circuits because they offer theo-retical guarantees of global convergence. Existing homotopy approaches for circuits are, however, often ineffective for large mixed-signal applications. In this paper, we describe a robust homotopy technique that is effective for solving large metal– oxide–semiconductor (MOS) -based mixed-signal circuits. We demonstrate how certain common circuit structures involving turning-point nesting {{can lead to}} extreme inefficiency, or failure, of conventional probability-one homotopy methods. We also find that such situations can lead to numerical ill-conditioning and homotopy paths that fold back <b>upon</b> <b>themselves,</b> leading <b>to</b> algo-rithm failure. Our new homotopy model for MOS devices, dubbed Arc-tangent Schichman-Hodges (ATANSH), features decoupled continuation parameters that are instrumental in avoiding these problems. ATANSH-based homotopy methods in production use {{have led to the}} routine solution of large previously hard-to-solve industrial circuits, several examples of which are presented.

Previously, the group had released their major-label debut, My Dinosaur Life (2010) on Columbia; the band parted ways with the label due to the record's lackluster commercial response. Following this, the band returned to their home of Minneapolis, Minnesota, with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson. The band entered a local studio and recorded their next effort on their own time and finances.

Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes.
