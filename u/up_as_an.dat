5|$|To {{suggest that}} the BBC, forming opinion {{in the minds of}} the people of England, has been an {{influence}} for good in any way, when you consider the criminality of large areas of London; when you consider the Mods and Rockers, and all those other things; when you consider the total moral underminings which have been taking place in England, much to all our distress, in the last fifteen to twenty years, the Hon.

5|$|Twelve {{days after}} the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese {{property}} consultant, became the first arguido. Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in {{the direction in which}} the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been asking {{a lot of questions about}} the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.|$|E
5|$|At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{agreed to}} {{establish}} a staff to plan operations in north west Europe in 1944. It was envisaged that the Supreme Allied Commander would be British, and the usual practice was for the commander and {{the chief of staff}} to be of the same nationality, so it was decided to appoint a British officer for the role of chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate) (COSSAC), with an American deputy. In March 1943 Morgan became COSSAC. Brigadier General Ray Barker became his American deputy. Initially, Morgan's staff consisted of an aide, two batmen and a driver with a car purloined from I Corps headquarters. Morgan established his headquarters in Norfolk House at 31 St James's Square. However, by October 1943, it was clearly too small for COSSAC needs, which called for accommodation for a staff of 320 officers and 600 other ranks. In November and December part of the staff moved to the South Rotunda, a bombproof structure that had originally been fitted <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anti-invasion base, which was connected to the various ministries by the Whitehall Tunnel. Other staff were accommodated at 80 Pall Mall.|$|E
5|$|Intended to be Galveston follow-up, Pizzolatto felt True Detective {{was more}} {{suitable}} on-screen once the project took definite form. Pizzolatto shopped the novel to two TV executives, and, once he secured {{a deal in}} May 2010, drafted six screenplays, including the pilot episode script for True Detective, which ran 90 pages. He devoted another script for the series shortly after his departure from The Killings writing staff in 2011, thanks to the support of Anonymous Content. The final copy, amounting to 500 pages, was written {{without the aid of}} a writing staff. By this time, Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO, and by April 2012, the network commissioned True Detective on an order of eight episodes. Set <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anthology series, each season will feature a different cast of characters and self-contained narratives in various time periods and locations.|$|E

5|$|No.114 MFCU {{was rapidly}} reduced in size {{following}} {{the end of}} the war. It departed Tarakan for Australia on 3December 1945 with No.78 Wing, arriving at RAAF Station Deniliquin, New South Wales, on the 14th. Still under the wing's control, it relocated to RAAF Station Schofields on 31May and then to RAAF Station Williamtown on 1August, disbanding on 1April 1948. No.114 MFCU was re-established under a newly organised No.78 Wing on 24January 1949—"in name only", however, as it remained non-operational. It began training in late 1955 prior to anticipated reactivation, and was renamed No.114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit (MCRU) on 12March 1956. It relocated to RAAF Dubbo and stood <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> independent unit on 14November.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} situation in England rapidly began to deteriorate. Longchamp refused to work with Puiset and became unpopular with the English nobility and clergy. John exploited this unpopularity to set himself <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alternative ruler with his own royal court, complete with his own justiciar, chancellor and other royal posts, and was happy to be portrayed as an alternative regent, and possibly the next king. Armed conflict broke out between John and Longchamp, and by October 1191 Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London with John {{in control of the}} city of London, thanks to promises John had made to the citizens in return for recognition as Richard's heir presumptive. At this point Walter of Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, returned to England, having been sent by Richard to restore order. John's position was undermined by Walter's relative popularity and by the news that Richard had married whilst in Cyprus, which presented the possibility that Richard would have legitimate children and heirs.|$|E

5|$|The story {{follows a}} nameless protagonist {{who lives in}} near-future Tokyo. When a portal {{to the realm of}} demons is opened, United States {{officials}} order a nuclear attack on Tokyo. Transported with two other supporting characters thirty years into the future, the protagonist finds the Earth ruined by a demon invasion, which is now the stage for an escalating conflict between the Order of Messiah and the Ring of Gaea, conflicting cults who wish to bring about kingdoms for their respective patron deities (YHVH and Lucifer). The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Order, the Ring of Gaea, or setting him <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> independent agent.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{campaign}}— The Chinese campaign focuses loosely on the 1421 hypothesis and {{is about}} a Chinese treasure ship discovering the New World before Christopher Columbus. The story mainly focuses on Jian Huang, a Ming captain who has long dreamed of seeing the outside world, and his partner and new friend, Lao Chen, a large, powerful, and crude sailor, who are given orders to help expand the Ming Empire. In the beginning, the treasure fleet is attacked by Wokou pirates while still under construction. On orders of the spoiled and selfish Admiral Jinhai, nephew of the unnamed emperor, Huang and Chen save the fleet and eliminate the pirates. The fleet then embarks westward and is next seen to land in a port {{on the coast of}} India. There many of the crew, including Huang and Chen, are attacked by soldiers of the Indian Zamorin and flee with part of the fleet to a nearby island where they set up a new base and mount a rescue mission to save Jinhai and the remaining crew who have been captured by the Zamorin's troops and (as they discover) some Chinese defectors. The fleet continues west at Jinhai's insistence, although many ships turn back, and eventually are cast ashore in the Yucatán by a storm. Chen and Huang go to rescue crews of the other ships from hostile Aztec soldiers. When they return, they find that Jinhai has disappeared. Huang suspects that he was captured along with many of the fleet's crewmembers and mounts a rescue mission. Huang and Chen cut through the jungle and rescue many of their comrades, but Jinhai is not among them. Huang's small army of sailors then enters a nearby Aztec city, where they learn that Jinhai has set himself <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> emperor or perhaps a god among the Aztecs and that it was Jinhai who plotted with the Zamorin in India. Huang and Chen escape an ambush by Jinhai's soldiers and flee back to the coast through a series of caves, rescuing more of their crew along the way. Once back at the coast they set up a base and counterattack, defeating and killing Jinhai. After the battle, Huang, Chen, and the surviving crew members scour the beaches for all evidence of their presence and then sail home to China, hoping that no one will ever know they were there.|$|E
5|$|Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State was set <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} British Dominion covering most of {{the island}} of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces {{and members of the}} Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.|$|E
