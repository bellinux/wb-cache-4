40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} social networks has encouraged {{a large number}} of significant research works on community detection and <b>user</b> <b>recommendation.</b> The idea behind this work is that taking into account peculiar users’ attitudes (i. e., sentiments, opinions or ways of thinking) toward their own interests can bring benefits in performing such tasks. In this paper we describe (i) a novel method to infer sentiment-based communities without the requirement of obtaining the whole social structure, and (ii) a community-based approach to <b>user</b> <b>recommendation.</b> We take advantage of the SVO (sentiment-volume-objectivity) user profiling and the Tanimoto similarity to evaluate user similarity for each topic. Afterwards we employ a clustering algorithm based on modularity optimization to find densely connected users and the Adamic-Adar tie strength to finally suggest the most relevant users to follow. Preliminary experimental results on Twitter reveal the benefits of our approach compared to some state-of-the-art <b>user</b> <b>recommendation</b> techniques...|$|R

We first profile users with social links and topical interests derived from "re-pin paths".

Different from other standard similarities, we consider the influence of each object node including popular degree, preference degree, and trust relationship. Substituting these new definitions of similarity for the standard cosine similarity, we propose a modified collaborative filtering algorithm based on multifactors (CF-M).

40|$|Nowadays, the {{emerging}} popularity of Social Web raises new application areas for recommender systems. The aim {{of a social}} <b>user</b> <b>recommendation</b> is to suggest new friends having similar interests. In order to identify such interests, current recommender algorithms exploit social network information or the similarity of user-generated content. The rationale of this work is that users may share similar interests but have different opinions on them. As a result, considering the contribution of user sentiments, can yield benefits in recommending possible friends to follow. In this {{paper we propose a}} <b>user</b> <b>recommendation</b> technique based on a novel weighting function, we named sentimentvolume-objectivity (SVO) function, which takes into account not only user interests, but also his sentiments. Such function allows us to build richer user profiles to employ in the recommendation process than other content-based approaches.

40|$|Abstract. Recommendation systems provide {{suggestions}} to users about {{a variety of}} items, such as movies and restaurants. The large majority of these systems are designed to make recommendations for individual users. However, there are {{cases in which the}} items to be suggested are intended for a group of users, e. g., a group of friends planning to watch a movie or visit a restaurant. Recent approaches try to satisfy the preferences of all group members either by creating a joint profile for the group and suggesting items w. r. t. this profile or by aggregating the single <b>user</b> <b>recommendations</b> into group recommendations [3]. We opt for the second approach, since it is more flexible and offers opportunities for efficiency improvements. We propose a framework for group recommendations following the collaborative filtering approach. The most prominent items for each user of the group are identified based on items that similar users liked in the past. We efficiently aggregate the single <b>user</b> <b>recommendations</b> into group recommendations by leveraging the power of a top-k algorithm. We employ three different aggregation designs: least misery, where strong user preferences act as a veto, most optimistic, where the most satisfie...|$|E

These <b>recommendation</b> system help <b>users</b> not only to find out related items, but also find new things that may interest <b>users.</b> <b>Recommendation</b> system has been widely studied and various models has been suggested such as, collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Though collaborative filtering shows good performance for predicting users preference, there are some conditions where collaborative filtering cannot be applied. Sparsity in user data causes problems in comparing users. Systems which are newly starting or companies having small number of users are also hard to apply collaborative filtering. Content-based filtering should be used to support this conditions, but content-based filtering has some drawbacks and weakness which are tendency of recommending similar items, and keeping history of a <b>user</b> makes <b>recommendation</b> simple and not able to follow up users preference changes. To overcome this drawbacks and limitations, we suggest weighted window assisted <b>user</b> history based <b>recommendation</b> system, which captures user’s purchase patterns and applies them to window weight adjustment.

In this dissertation, we examine {{to improve the}} user experience with recommender systems beyond prediction accuracy. We focus on the following aspects of the user experience. In chapter 3 we examine if a recommender system exposes users to less diverse contents over time. In chapter 4 {{we look at the}} relationships between user personality and <b>user</b> preferences for <b>recommendation</b> diversity, popularity, and serendipity. In chapter 5 we investigate the relations between the self-reported user satisfaction and the three recommendation properties with the inferred <b>user</b> <b>recommendation</b> consumption. In chapter 6 we look at four different rating inter- faces and evaluated how these interfaces affected the user rating experience. We find that over time a recommender system exposes users to less-diverse contents and that users rate less-diverse items. However, <b>users</b> who took <b>recommendations</b> were exposed to more diverse recommendations than those who did not. Furthermore, users with different personalities have different preferences for recommendation diversity, popularity, and serendipity (e. g. some users prefer more diverse recommendations, while others prefer similar ones). We also find that <b>user</b> satisfaction with <b>recommendation</b> popularity and serendipity measured with survey questions strongly relate to <b>user</b> <b>recommendation</b> consumption inferred with logged data. We then propose a way to get better signals about user preferences and help users rate items in the recommendation systems more consistently. That is providing exemplars to users at the time they rate the items improved the consistency of users’ ratings. Our results suggest several ways recommender system practitioners and re- searchers can enrich the user experience. For example, by integrating users’ personality into recommendation frameworks, we can help recommender systems deliver recommendations with the preferred levels of diversity, popularity, and serendipity to individual users. We can also facilitate the rating process by integrating a set of proven rating-support techniques into the systems’ interfaces...|$|R
