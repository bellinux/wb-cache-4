Her other roles were as diverse as the female lead in Edward Bond's controversial play Saved (1965) and a vicar's wife in the television comedy series All in Good Faith in the mid-1980s.|$|E

500|$|On 28 May 2011, {{immediately}} following the broadcast of [...] "The Almost People", the BBC released a prequel to [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". The prequel had Dorium talking to two Headless Monks. He gives them the brain of a Judoon, which contains a security protocol the monks need. Dorium tells them he knows what they are up to, as he has heard rumours around the area. He asks them, [...] "All this, to imprison one child? Oh, I know what you're up to, I hear everything in this place. I even hear rumours about whose child you've taken. Are you mad? You know the stories about the Doctor? The things that man has done? God help <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> make him angry!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On one occasion, Cao Pi asked Su Ze, [...] "Previously, {{when you}} pacified Jiuquan and Zhangye {{and opened up}} trade with the Western Regions, I {{remember}} that Dunhuang offered large pearls as tribute. Can we find such pearls in the market now?" [...] Su Ze replied, [...] "If Your Majesty can rule the Empire well, bring everything into harmony, spread our culture to the deserts (in the Western Regions), then such pearls will automatically come to <b>us.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> ask for them and get them, they won't be as valuable (as when they are willingly offered as tribute)." [...] Cao Pi fell silent.|$|E

2500|$|Ingres's own {{paintings}} {{vary considerably}} {{in their use}} of colour, and critics were apt to fault them as too grey or, contrarily, too jarring. Baudelaire—who said [...] "M. Ingres adores colour like a fashionable milliner"—wrote of the portraits of Louis-François Bertin and Madame d'Haussonville: [...] "Open your eyes, [...] nation of simpletons, and tell <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ever saw such dazzling, eye-catching painting, or even a greater elaboration of colour". Ingres's paintings are often characterized by strong local colours, such as the [...] "acid blues and bottle greens" [...] Kenneth Clark professed to [...] "perversely enjoy" [...] in La Grande Odalisque. In other works, especially in his less formal portraits such as the Mademoiselle Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin (1821), colour is restrained.|$|E
2500|$|Ferris gave {{a number}} of well-regarded performances, {{but she did not}} become a big star. Equally, {{although}} ostensibly she fitted the stereotypical image of a mid-1960s blonde, she was never really a [...] "starlet", a characteristic she shared with, among other actresses of a similar mould, Julie Christie and Carol White. For a while, after Catch <b>Us</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Can, she acquired a certain [...] "pin-up" [...] status [...] The New York Times review of A Nice Girl Like You by Roger Greenspun contained a vignette of Ferris in the late 1960s:"Barbara Ferris is a strong-featured girl with an odd facial resemblance to Noël Coward. Despite her winsome smile, flaxen hair and peaches-and-cream complexion, she plays innocence {{as if it were an}} allegory of experience and lines of calculation enmesh the cornflowers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ashcroft {{had been}} adamant that the Verve would not re-form, once remarking: [...] "You're {{more likely to}} get all four Beatles on stage". However, after Ashcroft learned that Salisbury was in contact with McCabe over a {{possible}} side project, Ashcroft contacted McCabe and Jones, making peace with them, and the band re-formed. Tong was not asked to rejoin, so as to keep the internal issues that split the band up a decade ago to an absolute minimum. Jones explained this decision by stating: [...] "It would have been too hard, it's hard enough for the four of <b>us.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> bring more people to it, it's harder to communicate and communication has always been our difficulty". On 26 June 2007, the band's reunion was announced by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1. The band, reuniting in their original line-up, announced they would tour in November 2007, and release an album in 2008. The band stated: [...] "We are getting back together for the joy of music", though they turned down a multi-album deal offer [...] "because the 'treadmill' of releasing albums and touring {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the band a decade ago".|$|E

2500|$|Ferris's films {{included}} the drama Term of Trial (1962) starring Laurence Olivier, A Pair of Briefs (1962), {{a romantic comedy}} set around the Inns of Court; Sparrers Can't Sing (1963) as Nellie Gooding; A Place to Go (1963) starring Rita Tushingham and Bernard Lee; Bitter Harvest (1963) with Janet Munro and John Stride; Children of the Damned (1964) starring Ian Hendry, in which {{a group of children}} brought to London by UNESCO turned out to be humans advanced by a million years; Michael Winner's The System (1964), with Oliver Reed and Julia Foster, an early [...] "Swinging London"-style sex comedy about young loafers at a seaside resort; Catch <b>Us</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Can (1965), which featured the rock band the Dave Clark Five and owed much to the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night the previous year; Interlude (1968), alongside Oskar Werner, John Cleese and Donald Sutherland, which film historian Leslie Halliwell described as [...] "Intermezzo remade for the swinging London set"; and Desmond Davis's A Nice Girl Like Me (1969), in which Ferris played a young woman named Candida who kept getting pregnant ("Candida isn't much for sex but she's big on babies" [...] as one critic put it [...] ).|$|E
