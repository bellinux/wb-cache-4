500|$|... "Marry the Night" [...] is a dance-pop and synthpop {{song with}} electro rock and house influences. The song starts out with {{electronic}} church bells and Gaga softly singing [...] "I'm gonna marry the night/I won't give <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> life/I'm a warrior queen/Live passionately tonight." [...] Soon the beat changes into a dance one, accompanied with techno beats, handclaps and funk music, {{and moves to}} the chorus, where Gaga stutters the line [...] "Ma-ma-ma-marry/Ma-ma-ma-marry/Ma-ma-ma-marry the night". It was compared by Tim Jonze from The Guardian to the Eurodance song, [...] "It's My Life" [...] by Dr Alban, while Nicola James from MTV compared the chorus with Jennifer Lopez's 1999 single [...] "Waiting for Tonight. In a pre-release review of certain album tracks, Peter Robinson from the NME blog wrote that Gaga channels [...] "Whitney Houston-esque pop euphoria" [...] into the song, notably that from the singer's musical peak.|$|E
500|$|Following their signing to Interscope, Brand New stopped touring to work {{on their}} third album and major label debut. In this time, little to no {{interviews}} or updates came from the band. In 2004, Jesse Lacey told Chart magazine that he had written a [...] "few songs" [...] for the next album, commenting that [...] "the other guys love it already". He made mention of the pressure he felt with the [...] "loads of anticipation building <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders," [...] saying that he suffered from depression because of this; [...] "I'm getting depressed with all of the anxiety about the album and they say I write my best stuff when I'm in that state. Great, I'll spend the next six months all depressed and the rest of band will be excited, so that some good (material) might come out. And then I have to contend with how it's received." [...] Lacey also said that the album would [...] "move into new territory for Brand New".|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of {{the website}} Digital Spy called the song an [...] "electro-thumping number with euphoric synths and {{uplifting}} melody" [...] {{which according to}} him further drew comparison to Gaga's own song [...] "Born This Way". Copsey further stated that [...] "This is no bad thing, as it's less in-yer-face, and it's 'M-m-m-marry the night' hook is equally as catchy." [...] Awarding the song with {{four out of five}} stars Lewis Corner of the same website wrote: [...] "'I'm gonna marry the night/ I won't give <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> life/ I'm a warrior queen, live passionately, tonight,' GaGa calls out over a suitably grand introduction of deistic bells and rumbling techno synths – the result not to dissimilar, we imagine, to Paul Van Dyk playing an organ at a wedding ceremony. Defiant and epic, the track feeds into Stef's cult-focused fan base like a prophet calling upon their disciples – and given it's the single they've been waiting for, we have no doubt they'll come in their droves." ...|$|E

500|$|Winslet {{received}} her preliminary {{education at the}} St Mary and All Saints' Church of England primary school. Living {{in a family of}} actors inspired her to pursue acting from a young age. She and her sisters participated in amateur stage shows at school and at a local youth theatre, named Foundations. At age five, Winslet made her first stage appearance as Mary in her school's production of the Nativity. She has described herself as [...] "quite stocky as a child"; she was nicknamed [...] "blubber" [...] by her schoolmates and was bullied for they way she looked. She said of the experience, [...] "I didn't lock myself away and give <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> dream. I fought back." [...] At age 11, Winslet was accepted into the Redroofs Theatre School in Maidenhead. The school also functioned as an agency and took students to London to audition for acting jobs. She appeared in a Sugar Puffs commercial and dubbed for foreign films. At school, she was made head girl and took part in productions of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and played the lead role of Wendy Darling in Peter Pan. She worked simultaneously with the Starmaker Theatre Company in Reading. She participated in over 20 of their stage productions, but has said that she was rarely selected as the lead due to her weight. Nonetheless, she played key roles as Miss Agatha Hannigan in Annie, the Mother Wolf in The Jungle Book, and Lena Marelli in Bugsy Malone.|$|E
500|$|... "Marry the Night" [...] {{was planned}} to be the lead single from Born This Way, but was {{cancelled}} {{in favor of the}} title track. [...] "Marry the Night" [...] was then supposed to be the third single, but was cancelled yet again, this time in favor of [...] "The Edge of Glory". Gaga first premiered [...] "Marry the Night" [...] on the HBO , which aired on May 7, 2011.

[...] During the promotional appearances for Born This Way, Gaga released [...] "Marry the Night" [...] to the online game Farmville on May 17, 2011. The song was released on Gagaville, a subdivision of Farmville that Gaga helped design with game promotion company Zynga. Four months since the release of Born This Way, [...] "Marry the Night" [...] was confirmed as the fifth single from the album by Gaga herself. In September 2011, Interscope Records, Gaga's label, stated that while [...] "Marry the Night" [...] is sure to be released as the fifth single internationally, they were undecided which song would serve in its place in the US. [...] "Marry the Night" [...] officially impacted Australian radio on October 17, 2011. Gaga confirmed the single's UK release for November 21,2011, which included remixes.

2500|$|According to Sîrbu, {{the scandal}} {{was also used}} by the Metropolitan's {{numerous}} adversaries, including Catholic missionaries, but also Orthodox priests investigated for corruption. The issue did grab attention in the Catholic world: according to columnist Jean-Marie of Échos d'Orient, the scandal broke Romanian Orthodoxy into two churches—a truly Orthodox one headed by Safirin; and a [...] "presbyterian" [...] one, under Atanasie. Although his own correspondence with Atanasie was a central piece of the trial, in 1937 Theodorian-Carada admitted that he supported Safirin, and that he and Chiricescu fought their battle with Haret [...] "through the Bishop of Roman". However, he denies that the local Roman Catholic Church had any involvement in the affair: [...] "More than once, Archbishop Netzhammer advised me to give <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> fight. Same for Vladimir Ghica." [...] As he notes, Haret took pains {{not to have to}} deal with the scandal himself, and was relieved when the Carp cabinet took over in December 1910. As the new Education Minister, Constantin C. Arion demanded a swift resolution.|$|E

Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy.

2500|$|By October 2008, Palin's {{usage of}} the bear metaphor to {{describe}} herself was reported in a New York Times article, [...] "Provoking Palin's Inner Bear," [...] which quotes her as saying that negative media coverage about her children makes, [...] "the mama grizzly bear in me [...] out, {{makes me want to}} rear <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hind legs and say, ‘Wait a minute.’" [...] Soon, other media outlets began picking up on Palin's self-description. In January 2009, Margery Eagan of the Boston Herald penned a column, [...] "Unbearable Mama Grizzly clawing way to Oval Office" [...] in which she noted that a YouTube interview of Palin had nearly three quarters of a million views, proving [...] "that mama 'grizzly,' as she called herself, remains irresistible." [...] The Vancouver, Washington newspaper, The Columbian, commented in January 2009 that, [...] "Sarah Palin is on the prowl, snorting that when the media poke fun at her family, it brings out the mama grizzly in her." [...] The connection between Palin and [...] "mamma grizzly" [...] was made internationally in July 2009 when the New Delhi, India-based Hindustan Times reported on a Palin tweet describing mama grizzly bears in Alaska. In August 2009, an opinion piece in The Columbian suggested that Sarah Palin could serve as a Mama Grizzly head of a third or a fourth U.S. political party.|$|E
2500|$|A {{final twist}} in Steven's story was his {{involvement}} in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield). In episodes that aired in May 2008, {{it was revealed that}} Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, [...] "It’s all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian’s love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She’s the one who gets most of Ian’s time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He’s been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and is willing {{to do whatever it takes}} to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous." [...] In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An EastEnders source told Digital Spy: [...] "Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face." [...] Sidwell added, [...] "Steven is deadly! He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants [...] including murder." [...] The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the Eurostar to Paris) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, [...] "Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to go home with Ian." [...] In Steven's final scenes, Ian rejects Steven as his son once again, telling him [...] "I never give <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> family. But you're not my family, are you? You're your mother's son and you're Simon's son, and that really used to hurt. Now I thank God I never produced anything as sick and twisted as you." [...] Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.|$|E
