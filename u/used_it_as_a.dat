Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source of information.

Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prison for his Welsh captives.
