The antiquarian Alexander Gordon, who described the stone in 1726 in his Itinerarium Septentrionale, records this panel as holding a crucifixion scene, with the figure of a man at the right hand side and the left side completely defaced.

5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The <b>uppermost</b> <b>section</b> of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
25|$|The only outflow from Lake Victoria is the Nile River, which {{exits the}} lake near Jinja, Uganda. In terms of contributed water, this makes Lake Victoria the {{principal}} {{source of the}} longest branch of the Nile. However, the most distal source of the Nile Basin, and therefore the ultimate source of the Nile, is more often considered {{to be one of}} the tributary rivers of the Kagera River (the exact tributary remains undetermined), and which originates in either Rwanda or Burundi. The <b>uppermost</b> <b>section</b> of the Nile is generally known as the Victoria Nile until it reaches Lake Albert. Although it is a part of the same river system known as the White Nile and is occasionally referred to as such, strictly speaking this name does not apply until after the river crosses the Uganda border into South Sudan to the north.|$|E

Lying in an open valley directly downstream from Glen Canyon and shortly above Marble Canyon (the <b>uppermost</b> <b>section</b> of the Grand Canyon), it is the only place in more than [...] where the Colorado is not hemmed in by sheer canyon walls. This made it an important crossing point before the construction of Navajo and Glen Canyon Bridges in the 20th century. Here, the Colorado River is also much smoother and calmer than the stretches that lie above and below. [...] In the past, another crossing was the former Glen Canyon reach, but it is now flooded under Lake Powell, formed by Glen Canyon Dam [...] upstream. Lees Ferry is designated within the southwesternmost extreme of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and is considered the northernmost end of Grand Canyon National Park.

2500|$|The {{architect}} who designed it, Adrian Smith, {{felt that the}} <b>uppermost</b> <b>section</b> of the building did not culminate elegantly {{with the rest of}} the structure, so he sought and received approval to increase it to the current height. It has been explicitly stated that this change did not include any added floors, which is fitting with Smith's attempts to make the crown more slender. Emaar properties announced on 9 June 2008 that construction of Burj Khalifa was delayed by upgraded finishes and would be completed only in September 2009. An Emaar spokesperson said that [...] "he luxury finishes that were decided on in 2004, when the tower was initially conceptualised, is now being replaced by upgraded finishes. The design of the apartments has also been enhanced to make them more aesthetically attractive and functionally superior." [...] A revised completion date of 2 December 2009 was then announced.

However, in deeper sections of the BCF, saturated carotenoid derivatives were not detected. To determine whether their absence from the deeper sections is a primary biological phenomenon or the result of degradation, we simulated the catagenesis of β-carotane in the laboratory by way of hydrous pyrolysis.

The elements Zn, Cu, P and Pb were enriched in the upper sections of the sediment cores corresponding to the last 200 years.

5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} St. Elmo's Fire was, and is, a common occurrence of corona discharge. The [...] "Fire" [...] was what sailors called the sparks and discharge that typically occurred on the <b>uppermost</b> <b>sections</b> of sail-powered ships. Caused by a buildup of static electricity, that once the potential energy grew great enough, would arc between masts and spars among the rigging. Sailors were commonly extremely superstitious, and many {{believed that it was}} caused by ghosts. Also, sailors learned that the discharge often signaled that a thunderstorm was likely imminent. [...] Ionized gases produced in a corona discharge are accelerated by the electric field, producing a movement of gas or [...] "electrical wind". The air movement associated with a discharge current of a few hundred microamperes can blow out a small candle flame within about 1 cm of a discharge point. A pinwheel, with radial metal spokes and pointed tips bent to point along the circumference of a circle, can be made to rotate if energized by a corona discharge; the rotation is due to differential electric attraction between the metal spokes and the space charge shield region that around the tips.|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the impacts of}} debris flows {{on the distribution of}} an amphipod with limited dispersal ability in the context of stream networks, we surveyed the presence of Gammarus nipponensis in 87 headwater streams with different legacies of debris flow occurrence within an 8. 5 -km 2 mountain catchment. The amphipod was present in only 7 % of the streams impacted by debris flows after 1977; in contrast, it was present in 69 % of the streams that had older or no debris flow occurrence. The absence of the amphipod in certain headwater streams {{did not appear to be}} related to water chemistry because pH and calcium concentrations differed little among streams within the catchment. In addition, survival rates of individuals incubated in streams with the amphipod present and absent did not differ significantly. Debris flows appeared to displace amphipod populations, and the absence of amphipods in streams for more than 30 years after debris flow occurrence suggests that considerable time is required for the recovery of populations. Because of geographic isolation from the source of colonists, headwater streams in the <b>uppermost</b> <b>sections</b> of the catchment and those indirectly connecting to the main stream via tributaries appear to be at greater disadvantage for receiving colonists from other areas and thus population recovery. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

In the brittle formations below a depth of approximately 1  km, natural fractures are developed over geological time, allowing circulation of hydrothermal fluids (permeability) and deposition of secondary minerals (sealing). The competition between the natural permeability and the mineral deposition characterizes the fractures located {{at the top of}} the convective cells.|$|R
