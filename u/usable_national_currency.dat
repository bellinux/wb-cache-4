40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze {{theoretical}} and practical aspects {{of the features of}} the IFI influence on transformation of <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> systems of such organizations’ member states. Defining features of interaction policy among national economies and IFI in the monetary sphere, considering countries’ socio-economic parameters of development, will allow monetary authorities to achieve the optimum level of development of its economy. Methodology. Theoretical base of the study are the provisions of general scientific theory of knowledge studied phenomena and processes, in particular: methods of induction and deduction (in determining classification criteria of IFIs impact on <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> system), analysis and synthesis (in determining the features and priorities of <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> system), comparisons, associations and analogies (the justification of characteristics of advantages and disadvantages of IFI). The information base for scientific research is scientific papers and publications of domestic and foreign scientists-economists, materials of scientific-practical conferences, legislative and normative documents, the IMF, World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank materials. Results. Theoretical approaches to the definition of the <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> system and international financial organizations, including its classification, are proposed. It is proved that the IMF makes active impact on <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> policy formation through regulation and supervision, while the World Bank and AIIB are related in a passive way. The IFI regulation trends are to implement floating exchange regime, liberal currency transactions, cancel currency restrictions in member countries. Although it refers to all countries, some of them with large population, trading, underdeveloped institutions of democracy could avoid some IFI pressure. Practical implications. The study accents attention on the specifics of the IFI activity in terms of changing the currency policy of member countries. Comparison of priorities among <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> policy and IFI recommendations could be applicable for national authorities in performing <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> policy. Value/originality. Despite the existing studies in the field of international monetary policy, there is a gap in theoretical definition of interaction between IFI and national monetary authorities in the field of <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> policy forming at present.
