OBJECTIVE: We tested the effects of mobile phone exposure on spatial memory performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (10 - 12 weeks old) were exposed to 50 missed calls/day for 4 weeks from a GSM (900 / 1800 MHz) mobile phone in vibratory mode (no ring tone). After the experimental period, the animals were tested for spatial memory performance using the Morris water maze test. RESULTS: Both phone exposed and control animals showed {{a significant decrease in}} escape time with training. Phone exposed animals had significantly (~ 3 times) higher mean latency to reach the target quadrant and spent significantly (~ 2 times) less time in the target quadrant than age- and sex-matched controls. CONCLUSION: Mobile phone exposure affected the acquisition of learned responses in Wistar rats. This in turn points to the poor spatial navigation and the object place configurations of the phone-exposed animals...|$|E

Twitter is a social networking service specialized on the phenomenon, with over 320 million monthly active <b>users</b> <b>world</b> <b>wide.</b> The vast amount of micro-blogs posted through the service {{on a daily basis}} makes it a great data source of opinionated texts. In the field of Sentiment Analysis or opinion mining, in which the aim is to automatically extract the sentimental orientation of a text, there has been a shift towards the opinionated Twitter data. This shift has led to an entire new field of study: Twitter Sentiment Analysis. In this Master's thesis the fields of lexicon based Sentiment Analysis and automatic creation of sentiment lexica have been explored. Based on our research within the fields, both an automatic lexicon creator and a lexicon based Sentiment Analysis system were developed. Our lexicon based Sentiment Analysis system, utilizing our best performing sentiment lexicon created by our automatic lexicon creator, produces good results almost keeping up with systems utilizing sophisticated machine learning approaches. Regarding run-time performance, our system significantly outperforms the other compared systems, proving its capability of real-time classification of large amounts of tweets. In a lexicon comparison experiment, our created lexicon beats a manually annotated lexicon, both proving the viability of automatically generated sentiment lexica and specifically the PMI approach. In addition, we have discovered the importance of tailoring the classifier to each individual sentiment lexica to utilize its full potential, and that the quality of the sentiment lexica produced through the PMI approach is highly dependent on the overall quality of a labeled dataset...|$|E

The Detector Control System (DCS) of ATLAS is responsible for the supervision of the detector equipment, the reading of operational parame- ters, the propagation of the alarms and the archiving of important operational data in a relational database. DCS Data Viewer (DDV) is an application that provides access to the ATLAS DCS historical data through a web interface. Its design is structured using a client-server architecture. The pythonic server connects to the DB and fetches the data by using optimized SQL requests. It communicates with the outside world, by accepting HTTP requests and it can be used stand alone. The client is an AJAX interactive web application devel- oped under the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) framework. Its web interface is user friendly, platform and browser independent. The selection of metadata is done via a column-tree view or with a powerful search engine. The final visualization of the data is done using java applets or java script applications as plugins. The default output is a value-over-time chart, but other types of outputs like tables, ascii or ROOT files are supported too. Excessive access or malicious use of the database is prevented by a dedicated protection mechanism, allowing the expo- sure of the tool to hundreds of inexperienced users. The current configuration of the client and of the outputs can be saved in an XML file. Protection against web security attacks is foreseen and authentication constrains have been taken into account, allowing the exposure of the tool to hundreds of <b>users</b> <b>world</b> <b>wide.</b> Due to its flexible interface and its generic and modular approach, DDV could be easily used for other experiment control systems...|$|E

In many cases, an institutional repository is included to enable and promote open access. Besides publications lists on the Web, the data is even more valuable to support internal procedures such as reuse in citation management software for new publications or grant applications and in particular to alleviate the burden of administrative reporting according to complex sorting or filtering criteria. In 2010 the libraries and documentation departments of DESY (Hamburg), GSI (Darmstadt), Forschungszentrum Jülich (Jülich), Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ) (Garching) and RWTH Aachen University (Aachen) founded join² to establish such an infrastructure based on Invenio. Main focuses were a solution, which is {{easy to use and}} accepted by scientists, to incorporate specific and precise data sources of an organization on for example, people and projects, as well as (inter-) nationally accepted authority records -e. g. on journals- and sources for data import. By merging bibliographic database and repository the addition of full texts is encouraged, furthering OpenAccess. Local protected working areas for publication exchange serve as an additional value to the scientists. The project addresses that each organizations has its specifics and thus the infrastructure must be suitable configured and tailored while still profiting from the shared development resources. As a result six independent repositories are currently in operation. As an open project, we recently also welcomed Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg) as a new partner. join² repositories today serve more than 20. 000 staff members and more than 5. 000 local visitors annually on campus.

Today, the most popular channel is Facebook with over 845 million <b>users</b> <b>world</b> <b>wide.</b> In Sweden, the number of users amount to approximately half of the population. We had two aims with this study. First, we investigate which areas of Facebook usage that Swedish Facebook users consider more important vis-a-vis less important. We were also interested in how users convey their persona through their status updates, including what they status update about, and the underlying reasons for updating one’s status. Second, we investigate what psychological effects Facebook may induce. More specifically, we look at the psychological constructs self-esteem and well-being in relation to Facebook usage. We surveyed 1011 Swedish Facebook users with our questionnaires, measuring respondents’ Facebook usage patterns, well-being and self-esteem. Our analyses revealed that on average Swedish women spend 81 minutes per day on Facebook, whereas Swedish men are logged on to the site about 64 minutes per day. Generally, Facebook is used for social network maintenance, such as maintaining contact with people one doesn’t meet so often. However, Facebook is seldom used for meeting new people. Another finding is that Facebook users generally tend to update their status about positive events, major events and when they are feeling well, rather than negative events and when they are feeling bad. Women seem to be more engaged and active on Facebook than men, agreeing that a vast number of uses is significantly more important. Furthermore, women tend to write more about their thoughts and feelings, whereas twice as many men state that they provoke others on Facebook. Pertaining to Facebook’s psychological effects, {{the amount of time spent}} on Facebook had no relationship with self-esteem when controlling for gender, age, education and income. $is result runs counter to previous findings. However, women who spend more time on Facebook report feeling less happy and feel less content with their lives. For men, this relationship was not evident. $e study teaches that Facebook is used as a tool for affiliating with friends and family, as well as a personal showcase, where users show their positive sides. Herein lies also a danger. When Facebook users compare their own lives with others’ seemingly more successful careers and happy relationships, they may feel that their own lives are less successful in comparison...|$|E
