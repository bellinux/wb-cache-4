500|$|When {{asked about}} the success of Frozen, {{director}} Chris Buck stated: [...] "We never expected anything like this. We just hoped {{to make a movie}} that did as well as Tangled! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. <b>Usually</b> <b>you</b> do a project and it has its moment. This just feels like it keeps going." ...|$|E
500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. <b>Usually</b> <b>you</b> have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} the album are noted for their {{changing}} dynamics – with [...] "middle sections [...] turn into this mass orchestrated swarm and ridiculous time signatures" [...] which include musical references to 1970s soft rock bands such as Wings, Eagles and Bread - summed by Hawkins by saying the band [...] "wanted {{to make sure that}} everything 'built' on this record, that each instrument started somewhere and went somewhere else {{in the course of a}} song". The drummer attributed this to the acoustic tour leading the band to [...] "shed some of the fear of incorporating mellower stuff with the heavy stuff", and Grohl added that [...] "we wanted the stops to be pin-drop silent before exploding. If we had a beautiful melody, we'd throw a fucking string quartet in there. So we did everything we could to really magnify all those elements and that was fun. <b>Usually</b> <b>you</b> have a few parameters you're afraid to pass but, this time, there was no fear of going too far."
