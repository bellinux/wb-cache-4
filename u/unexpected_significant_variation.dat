40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope's fine {{guidance}} sensors (FGS's) {{are unique}} in the performance levels being attempted; spacecraft control and astrometric research with accuracies better than 3 milli-arcseconds (mas) are the ultimate goals. This paper presents {{a review of the}} in-flight calibration of the sensors, describing both the algorithms used and the results achieved to date. The work was done primarily in support of engineering operations related to spacecraft pointing and control and secondarily in support of the astrometric science calibration effort led by the Space Telescope Astrometry Team. Calibration items of principal interest are distortion, sensor magnification, and relative alignment. An initial in-flight calibration of the FGS's was performed in December 1990; this calibration has been used operationally over the past few years. Followup work demonstrated that <b>significant,</b> <b>unexpected</b> temporal <b>variations</b> in the calibration parameters are occurring; provided good characterization of the variation; and {{set the stage for a}} distortion calibration designed to achieve the full design accuracy for one of the FGS's. This full distortion calibration, using data acquired in January 1993, resulted in a solution having single-axis residuals with a standard deviation of 2. 5 mas. Scale and alignment calibration results for all of the FGS's have been achieved commensurate with the best ground-based astrometric catalogs (root-mean-square error approximately 25 mas). A calibration monitoring program has been established to allow regular updates of the calibration parameters as needed...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the shrinkage, in the bottom-up and pith-bark direction, of the australian cedar wood from three Counties {{in the south of}} Minas Gerais state, and also to check the variation in chemical composition of wood due the location of planting. The australian cedar wood was obtained with four years of age and in three cities in the south of Minas Gerais state (Campo Belo, Cana Verde and Santo Antonio do Amparo). The chemical constituents of wood, shrinkage values (tangential, radial, longitudinal and volumetric) and the anisotropy coefficient. According to the results, there was no <b>significant</b> <b>variation</b> in the levels of holocellulose were determined, lignin, extractives and ashes between the three plantation sites evaluated. For the shrinkage of the wood in the bottom-up direction, there was no <b>significant</b> <b>variation</b> of the radial and longitudinal contractions for the three locations evaluated. However, <b>significant</b> <b>variation</b> was observed for the tangential and volumetric contractions for cities of Campo Belo and Cana Verde, and <b>significant</b> <b>variation</b> of Tangential contraction for the plantation of Santo Antonio do Amparo.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze perfectionism among Turkish {{secondary}} school students. Perfectionism was compared according to the some variables like academic achievement, type of school, field (Quantitative, Verbal and Equally Weighted) and gender. The study was performed with 271 female and 320 male students. In this study Frost Multidimentional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS) adapted into Turkish by Özbay and Mısırlı-Taşdemir (2003), was used. At the end of the study, in all subscales of perfectionism scale, there was <b>significant</b> <b>variation</b> according to student’s academic success levels. There was <b>significant</b> <b>variation</b> according to the school types in all subscales except Personal Standards subscale. While there was <b>significant</b> <b>variation</b> according to the field, in Parental Criticism and Concern over Mistakes subscales; according to gender, there was <b>significant</b> <b>variation</b> only in Doubt about Actions subscale. To not acceptnonperfect situations while trying to reach a goal may cause that students have procrastination behaviors and more anxiety. Therefore, their academic achievement may be affected negatively. With individual and group psychological counseling to perfectionist students can help them to notice their characteristics well and determine realistic goal. In this way, their academic achievement can be contributed positivel...|$|R
