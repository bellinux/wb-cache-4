Bismuth spread in the environment in these products is <b>unrecoverable</b> with present technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{replication}} of damaged DNA before cell division {{can lead to}} the incorporation of wrong bases opposite damaged ones. Daughter cells that inherit these wrong bases carry mutations from which the original DNA sequence is <b>unrecoverable</b> (except in the rare case of a back mutation, for example, through gene conversion).|$|E
5|$|The {{techniques}} and technologies to deliver supplies by air {{were in their}} infancy. There were few aircraft available, and these were {{of a variety of}} different types, complicating maintenance. Air operations in New Guinea were restricted by the weather. Transport aircraft were vulnerable in the air, and required fighter escorts. They were also subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda led to the adoption of air dropping. Due to a shortage of parachutes, supplies often had to be dropped without them, and loss due to breakages and <b>unrecoverable</b> goods was high.|$|E
5|$|Hansell's first duty {{assignment}} {{was with the}} 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, testing repaired aircraft. In June 1930, he spent three months temporary duty with the 6th Field Artillery at Fort Hoyle, Maryland. In September 1930, he returned to Langley Field and was detached to the Air Corps Tactical School as armament officer. While stationed at Langley, Hansell was involved in two minor accidents in aircraft he was piloting, and in early 1931 was forced to parachute to safety when his Boeing P-12 stalled during a test flight, going into an <b>unrecoverable</b> spin. He was found at fault for the accident and initially charged $10,000 by the Air Corps for {{the expense of the}} aircraft, but the cost was eventually written off.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an <b>unrecoverable</b> situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|Nairana had {{her final}} {{overhaul}} at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944. By mid-1947, airlines had captured {{a significant portion}} of the passenger trade across Bass Strait, and Nairanas schedule was reduced. On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease. Nairana made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, Nairana broke her moorings during a gale on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off Port Melbourne. <b>Unrecoverable,</b> she was broken up in place in 1953–54.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is <b>unrecoverable,</b> shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Anneka Di Lorenzo, {{who played}} Messalina, sued Guccione, {{claiming}} sexual harassment. In 1990, after a protracted litigation, a New York state court awarded her $60,000 in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} working pressures in depleted reservoirs, about 50 percent of the natural gas in the formation must be kept as cushion gas. However, since depleted reservoirs were previously filled with natural gas and hydrocarbons, they do not require the injection of gas that will become physically <b>unrecoverable</b> as this is already present in the formation. This provides a further economic boost {{for this type of}} facility, particularly when the cost of gas is high.|$|E
25|$|Survival for sponges farmed on ropes is {{generally}} lower as <b>unrecoverable</b> damage occurs to the explant when ‘threading’ onto the rope takes place. Furthermore, sponges cultured {{on the rope}} {{have the potential to}} be torn off the rope during storms as water flow increases significantly, or grow away from the rope and form an unmarketable, low value, characteristic doughnut shaped sponge. Differences in sponge growth and health do occur within species characterised by variations in regenerative ability, susceptibility to infection after cutting, hardiness and growth potential.|$|E
25|$|Despite an 11th {{fatality}} from {{a training}} crash in Wyoming on March 17, the Army resumed the program again on March 19, 1934, in better weather, using only nine routes, limited schedules, and hurried improvements in instrument flying. The O-38E, {{which had been}} involved in two fatal accidents at Cheyenne, Wyoming, was withdrawn completely from the operation despite its enclosed cockpit because of its propensity to go into an <b>unrecoverable</b> spin in the mountainous terrain. In early April the Air Corps removed all pilots with less than two years' experience from the operation.|$|E
25|$|Some spammers {{argue that}} most of these costs could {{potentially}} be alleviated by having spammers reimburse ISPs and persons for their material. There are three problems with this logic: first, the rate of reimbursement they could credibly budget is not nearly high enough to pay the direct costs , second, the human cost (lost mail, lost time, and lost opportunities) is basically <b>unrecoverable,</b> and third, spammers often use stolen bank accounts and credit cards to finance their operations, and would conceivably do so to pay off any fines imposed.|$|E
25|$|On 25 February 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, a Boeing 737-800 {{registered}} as TC-JGE carrying 128 passengers and {{a crew of}} 7, crashed during final approach to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands. It was determined that a faulty radar altimeter caused the aircraft to throttle the engines back to idle and that the crew subsequently failed to react properly which resulted in an <b>unrecoverable</b> stall and the subsequent crash. Of the 135 people on board, nine people, including the three pilots, were killed. Eighty-six more people were transported to local hospitals.|$|E
25|$|Celtic was {{the first}} of the Big Four, which entered service in 1901. This {{was the first}} ship to exceed the Great Eastern in tonnage. Her career was marked by several accidents. Transformed into an {{auxiliary}} cruiser during the First World War, she struck a mine in 1917, killing 17 people. In 1918, she was torpedoed by a German submarine, but was once again afloat. In 1925, she struck another vessel, but neither ship suffered consequences. The incident was repeated with another vessel in 1927. Finally, in 1928, she struck rocks off Cobh and was considered <b>unrecoverable.</b> It took five years for the ship to be completely dismantled.|$|E
25|$|All of the 80 F.30 {{fighters and}} FB.31 {{fighter-bomber}} Vampires that were subsequently built by de Havilland Australia were powered by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) {{versions of the}} Nene engine manufactured under licence at their facility in Melbourne. The Nene required a greater intake cross-section than the Goblin, and the initial solution was to mount auxiliary intakes {{on top of the}} fuselage behind the canopy. Unfortunately these intakes led to elevator blanking on formation of shock waves, and three aircraft and pilots were lost in <b>unrecoverable</b> dives. All Nene-engined aircraft were later modified to have the auxiliary intakes beneath the fuselage, thus avoiding the problem.|$|E
25|$|On November 10, 2013 a Metroliner {{operated}} by Bearskin Airlines under flight number JV311, crashed on final approach to its destination of Red Lake, Ontario, Canada {{en route from}} Sioux Lookout, Ontario. The aircraft experienced a near total failure of the left engine at 500ft AGL which, combined with the aircraft being in the landing configuration, caused a loss of airspeed resulting in an <b>unrecoverable</b> situation. Safety systems {{to assist in the}} handling with one engine out did not activate since the engine did not completely shut down; the scenario gave conflicting information to the pilots who did not have time to identify the nature of the failure. Two crew members and three passengers were killed in the crash. Two passengers sustained injuries but survived.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinand, educated by the Jesuits, was {{a staunch}} Catholic {{who wanted to}} impose {{religious}} uniformity on his lands. This made him highly unpopular in Protestant (primarily Hussite) Bohemia. The Bohemian nobility rejected Ferdinand, who had been elected Bohemian Crown Prince in 1617. Ferdinand's representatives were thrown out of a window in Prague and seriously injured, triggering the Thirty Years' War in 1618. This so-called Defenestration of Prague provoked open revolt in Bohemia, which had powerful foreign allies. Ferdinand was upset by the calculated insult, but his intolerant policies in his own lands had left him in a weak position. The Habsburg cause {{in the next few}} years would seem to suffer <b>unrecoverable</b> reverses. The Protestant cause seemed to wax toward a quick overall victory.|$|E
25|$|Kneale's {{adaptation}} {{was produced}} {{again by the}} BBC, with some modifications in 1965. Starring David Buck, Joseph O'Conor, Jane Merrow and Cyril Shaps, it was broadcast in BBC2's Theatre 625 anthology series {{as part of a}} season of Orwell adaptations sub-titled The World of George Orwell, on 28 November 1965. Long believed lost, on 12 September 2010 it was announced in various media outlets that a copy had been located at the American Library of Congress, although an approximately seven-minute segment in the middle was <b>unrecoverable</b> from the NTSC video tape recording. It was recovered amongst a horde of over 80 lost British television episodes dating from 1957 to 1970. In 1965, a radio adaptation was broadcast on the BBC Home Service with Patrick Troughton, soon to become the Second Doctor in Doctor Who.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, McDonnell renegotiated and {{extended}} {{a contract for}} outsourcing the state's computer operations to Northrop Grumman. At that time, McDonnell proposed legislation, which was passed, to have the Virginia Information Technologies Agency report directly to the governor instead of to an independent board. Subsequently, McDonnell was criticized when the Northrup computer systems experienced a week-long computer outage from August 25 through September 2, 2010. As a result, 45,000 people were unable to renew their driver's licenses. Computer systems for {{nearly a third of}} the state's agencies were affected. Over 4,000 people had to return to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get their photos retaken after an August 25 computer outage left their original photos <b>unrecoverable.</b> The system had also experienced a prior unrelated outage on August 9. Subsequently, Northrop Grumman agreed to pay $250,000 to fund a state investigation of the computer outage.|$|E
25|$|On 30 May 2011, a Chinook from C Squadron crashed while {{operating}} in Afghanistan. The aircraft was conducting a re-supply mission in {{company with a}} US Army Chinook in Zabul Province when it crashed, injuring six personnel on board. The most seriously wounded, passenger Lieutenant Marcus Case, was evacuated by the accompanying US Army helicopter but later died of his injuries. He was an Australian Army pilot deployed with No. 5 Flight RAAF at Kandahar. The other five injured survived the crash and were evacuated to Kandahar. The helicopter, a CH-47D (ADF serial A15-102) attached to the US Army 159th Combat Aviation Brigade at Kandahar, was assessed as being <b>unrecoverable</b> and was subsequently destroyed {{at the site of}} the crash. There was no insurgent activity at the time of the crash, and enemy fire was ruled out as a contributing cause. The eleventh, and final, deployment of Chinooks to Afghanistan was completed on 14 September 2013. In June 2014, all six of the regiment's Chinooks flew together for the first time in 19 years.|$|E
25|$|The Preface to {{the poem}} {{suggests}} that the poem {{was not supposed to}} be printed, that it was a fragmentary work that he was unable to complete, and that the work itself was provided to him through involuntary inspiration. When the Preface is dropped, the poem seems to compare the act of poetry with the might of Kubla Khan instead of the loss of inspiration causing the work to have a more complex depiction of the poetic power. Taken together, the Preface could connect with {{the first half of the}} poem to suggest that the poem is from the view of a dreaming narrator, or it could connect with the second half of the poem to show how a reader is to interpret the lines by connecting himself with the persona in a negative manner. The Preface and the poem are different in their locations, as the Preface discusses Coleridge's England while the poem discusses ancient China, but both discuss the role of the poem and his abilities. The poet of the Preface is a dreamer who must write and the poet of the poem is a vocal individual, but both are poets who lose inspiration. Only the poet of the poem feels that he can recover the vision, and the Preface, like a Coleridge poem that is quoted in it, The Picture, states that visions are <b>unrecoverable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the design, thanks {{in no small part}} to the passionate enthusiasm of Mignet himself, the original HM.14 revealed design flaws that could lead to an <b>unrecoverable</b> and often fatal dive under certain conditions; when the front wing was put in a high attack angle for climbing, the high-speed flow of air deflected by the front wing went to the rear wing upper surface, greatly increasing the rear wing's lift, and putting the nose down, the instinctive reaction of pilot being pulling even more the stick, this worsened the situation, as the way to go out of this 'vicious circle' was reducing the front wing incidence, as to command a nose down descent. Also some homebuilders attempted to simplify construction by modifying components such as the wings tips curving up, resulting in extremely dangerous airplanes and deadly accidents that forced the air authorities to ban building more of them. Studies in the UK and France revealed the problem (the HM.14 was small enough to fit in wind tunnels in both countries usually used for scale models of larger aircraft) and corrections were made to the design. Unfortunately, the wave of bad publicity created by the crashes dogged Mignet {{for the rest of his}} life and continues to be associated with the design today despite the fact that the basic Mignet configuration has proven to be safe in hundreds of successful homebuilt aircraft and factory built microlights.|$|E

500|$|The first {{prototype}} Victor B.2, {{serial number}} XH668 made its maiden flight on 20 February 1959. It had flown 100 hours by 20 August 1959, when, while high-altitude engine tests were {{being carried out}} by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A), it disappeared from radar screens, crashing into the sea off the coast of Pembrokeshire. An extensive search operation was initiated to locate and salvage the wreckage of XH668 to determine the cause of the crash. It took until November 1960 to recover most of the aircraft; the accident investigation concluded that the starboard pitot head had failed inflight, causing the flight control system to force the aircraft into an <b>unrecoverable</b> dive. [...] Only minor changes were needed to resolve this problem, allowing the Victor B.2 to enter service in February 1962.|$|E
500|$|Rock 'n' Roll is {{the sixth}} studio album by John Lennon. Released in 1975, {{it is an}} album of late 1950s and early 1960s songs as covered by Lennon. Recording the album was {{problematic}} and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song [...] "Come Together". As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on Rock 'n' Roll. Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album's tracks <b>unrecoverable</b> {{until the beginning of}} the Walls and Bridges sessions. With Walls and Bridges coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon expecting to see Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll album.|$|E

His jet in an <b>unrecoverable</b> spin, Weihs bailed out and came down near the Hamburg-Berlin railroad tracks. The airfield at Kaltenkirchen was immediately informed. Waldmann and Schrey were initially believed missing. Waldmann's body was recovered the next day near Schwarzenbek, roughly [...] away from the crash site of his Me 262. Apparently {{he had managed to}} bail out but failed to deploy his parachute in time, although the injuries sustained during the crash with Weihs' aircraft may have already been fatal as the recovery party found Waldmann with his upper forehead smashed. Schrey was also found dead. He had bailed out with his parachute, but his body was found riddled by machine-gun bullets.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of {{information}} in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded {{in a set of}} receipt rolls and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls was settled on. A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate Estreat rolls, and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls. In 1284 the Statutes of Rhuddlan were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls. At this time, a large number of <b>unrecoverable</b> debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a [...] "d" [...] and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.|$|E
