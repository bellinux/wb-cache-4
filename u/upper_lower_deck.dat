50|$|Traditional Chinese {{weighing}} units was a hexadecimal system. One jin (斤) equals sixteen liang (兩). Suanpans were {{commonly used}} in market places to perform calculations with these hexadecimal units. When all the beads in the suanpan are used, each column {{can be used to}} represent numbers between 0 and 15 (0 and F in modern hexadecimal notation). Computation in decimal and hexadecimal is quite similar except one extra bead from each the <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> is used.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} a decimal {{calculation}} on a suanpan, it {{is never}} the case that all five beads in the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> are moved up; in this case, the five beads are pushed back down and one carry bead in the top deck takes their place. Similarly, if two beads in the top deck are pushed down, they are pushed back up, and one carry bead in the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> of the next column to the left is moved up. In hexadecimal calculation, all seven beads on each column are used. The result of the computation is read off from the beads clustered near the separator beam between the <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The fighter's {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided, though with rounded <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>decking.</b> The original intention was fit a Liberty L-8 V-8 engine but {{problems with this}} model led to the installation of a [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb, also a V-8. A pair of fixed, synchronized 0.303 in Vickers machine guns fired through the propeller disc.

5000|$|The iron bridge has two decks, {{of differing}} heights and widths, between which develop a large 172.5 m diameter, central arch {{supporting}} these <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>decks.</b> Both decks are moored to the riverbanks {{by means of}} masonry piers. Those in the upper deck, are rectangular with a trimmed cornice finish, consisting of two staggered registers separated by cornice and interlacing struts. The <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> is based on large foundations supporting molded cornices and wedges linked together by a felled arch, and framed by interlacing beams.
