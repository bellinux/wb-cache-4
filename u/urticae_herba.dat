40|$|Acute, subchronic {{and chronic}} {{effects of the}} P- 9801091 plant mixture extract at a dose of 20 mg/kg body mass were {{assessed}} in serum of healthy CBA/HZg mice at 24 hours, 7 days, 3 months and 6 months of treatment (experimental group), and compared with the values obtained {{in the control group}} of untreated healthy CBA/HZg mice. The P- 9801091 plant mixture extract is an antihyperglycemic preparation containing Myrtilli folium (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), Taraxaci radix (Taraxacum officinale Web.), Cichorii radix (Cichorium intybus L.), Juniperi fructus (Juniperus communis L.), Centaurii herba (Centaurium umbellatum Gilib.), Phaseoli fructus sine semine (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), Millefolii herba (Achillea millefolium L.), Mori folium (Morus nigra L.), Valerianae radix (Valeriana officinalis L.) and <b>Urticae</b> <b>herba</b> et radix (Urtica dioica L). Toxic effect of the P- 9801091 plant mixture extract was assessed by the following biochemical parameters: urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and cholesterol. Also, histopathological examination of the kidneys, liver, spleen, pancreas, testes and lungs was performed. Results of biochemical testing performed at specified time points generally showed no statistically significant differences from control values, with the only exception of the catalytic concentration of AST in the experimental group measured on day 7, which was significantly increased as compared with the control group (p< 0. 05). Pathohistological examination including characteristic organ and tissue structure, and parenchyma relationship to the adjacent blood vessels and connective tissue in the examined organs revealed no major pathologic changes...|$|E
40|$|The {{gap between}} {{performance}} and feed intake in early lactating dairy cows {{often leads to}} metabolic imbalance which is connected to udder inflammation (UI). A study with 72 dairy cows calving from November 2010 to March 2011 on 10 Swiss and German farms was conducted to test {{the effect of a}} herbal feed additive (HFA) containing mainly <b>Urtica</b> dioica L. (<b>herba),</b> Silybum marianum (L.) Gaert. (fructus), Artemisia absinthium L. (herba) and Achillea millefolium L. (herba).

40|$|Metal {{content in}} {{medicinal}} herbs - empirical and chemometric approach Abstract The content of metals: Cr (0. 01 - 13. 9 ppm), Zn (25 - 96 ppm), Fe (84 - 2240 ppm), Mn (20 - 91 ppm), Ni (0. 2 - 5. 4 ppm), Cu (1. 5 - 10 ppm) and Mg (0. 3 - 1. 3 %) was determined in dried medicinal herbs, namely folium Melissae, flos Matricariae, <b>herba</b> <b>Urticae,</b> folium Menthae piperitae, fructus Foeniculi amari, flos Tilie, herba Hyperici and herba Filipendulae ulmariae originated from the Czech Republic, Poland and France.

Gaert. (fructus) and Achillea millefolium L. (herba). The herbal mixture was fed daily (50 g per cow) about 60 d from dry off to calving date. 63 dairy cows (32 in the herb-(h) - and 31 in the placebo-(p) -group) of one organic farm {{were included in}} the study. Cows were differentiated depending on their lactation number: 19 first lactating cows (L 1; h: n= 10, p: n= 9), 23 cows of second to fourth lactation (L 2 - 4; h: n= 11, p: n= 12) and 21 cows with more than four lactations (L> 4; h: n= 11, p: n= 10). The herbal group showed the following significant differences (p 4 were higher; abnormalities in at least one of 7 tested serum parameters in lactating group L 1 were less; in L> 4 less ovarian follicles and larger uteri could be found in early lactation; a longer intercalving period (h: 387 days; p: 344 days) but a lower overall culling rate (h: 17 %; p: 50 %) and culling rate for fertility reasons (h: 3 %; p: 23 %). The herbal mixture seemed 1. to improve the postpartal metabolic status of dairy cows, 2. to prolong the postnatal anoestrus but 3. to decrease the culling rate particularly for fertility reasons. Overall the prolonged intercalving period will have a lower economic effect than the decreased culling rate...|$|R
40|$|Fertility {{dysfunction}} is a main culling {{reason for}} dairy cows [1]. A randomized placebo controlled trial investigates a herbal mixture containing mainly <b>Urtica</b> dioica L. (<b>herba),</b> Trigonella foenum-greacum L. (semen), Silybum marianum (L.) Gaert. (fructus) and Achillea millefolium L. (herba). It was fed cows daily (50 g per cow and day) about 60 d from dry off to calving date. 63 dairy cows (32 in the herb-(h) - and 31 in the placebo-(p) -group) of one Swiss organic dairy farm {{were included in}} the study. Cows were differentiated depending on their lactation number (L); L 1 : first lactating cows (h: n= 10, p: n= 9), L 2 - 4 : cows of second to fourth lactation (h: n= 11, p: n= 12) and L> 4 : cows with more than four lactations (h: n= 11, p: n= 10). Blood samples were taken and a rectal palpation according to Rosenberger [2] of uterus and ovaries was done once between day 21 and 35 after calving. Furthermore all cows were observed until culling or next calving. Table 1 shows the significant differences (p< 0. 05) between the herb and placebo group. The fed herbal mixture seems {{to have an impact on}} the postpartal metabolic status of dairy cows which is a main factor influencing fertility [3]. The herbs seem to prolong the postnatal anoestrus but also to decrease the culling rate particularly for fertility reasons. Overall the prolonged intercalving period had a lower economic effect than the decreased culling rate...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{activity}} of sucrase, {{one of the}} intestinal alpha-glucosidase founded in diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of sucrase activity, {{plays a major role}} in preventing rise in postprandial glucose level in diabetics. On peer-reviewed literature could be found regarding investigation the effect of mixture plant proteins, Mw 3 – 15 kDa (MPP), isolated from Astragali radix – Astragalus membranaceus Fisch., Foenugraeci semen – Trigonella foenum graecum L., Cichorii radix – Cichorium Intybus L. and <b>Urticae</b> radix and <b>herba</b> – <b>Urtica</b> dioica L. on sucrase activity. This plants are used in traditional medicine of treatment of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to determine {{activity of}} sucrase in small intestinal homogenates of NOD diabetic mice on feeding with and without MPP in chow. In mice diabetes was induced by i. v. injection of aloxan- monohydrate (75 mg/kg b. m.) seven days before treatment with MPP. The proteins (Mw 3 – 15 kDa), were isolated from ethanol extract, each plants separately, by gel filtration method on Sephadex G- 25 column. Eluted fraction which highest absorbance on 280 nm were pooled, dialyzed, lyophilized and mixed (MPP) and before treatment in mice solvent in sterile PBS. After seven days of treatment diabetic NOD mice with MPP (1, 8 g/d), the small intestine was removed and divided into three segments, from pylorus to duodenum, and two equal lengths of the jejunum and ileum and homogenized in cold 0. 14 M KCl. Specific sucrase activity was determined using method of Dahlquist et. al., by sucrose as substrate. We confirmed the increased specific sucrase activity in the intestine of diabetic NOD mice. Our results also indicate that MPP have strongly inhibitory potential on intestinal sucrase activity (p< 0. 05) in diabetic mice. Conclusions drawn from this study should be further supported and our future experiments will be focused on determining the amino acid sequence of each protein from MPP...|$|R
