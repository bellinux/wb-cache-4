5|$|<b>Uzbekistan</b> remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country prefers not to pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with {{the country would be}} slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan it may persuade <b>Uzbekistan</b> to join in the future. <b>Uzbekistan</b> began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. <b>Uzbekistan</b> joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E
5|$|From Almaty in Kazakhstan, {{the railway}} extends to Tashkent and Samarkand, <b>Uzbekistan</b> {{and then to}} Tejen, Turkmenistan. From Tejen, another line {{continues}} to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan, a port on the Caspian Sea. (After a direct rail link between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan opened, it became possible for the freight to bypass <b>Uzbekistan,</b> which has poor relations with its neighbors).|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1985, the 10th Mountain Division's second brigade's {{elements}} saw numerous deployments to contingencies {{around the}} world in the 1990s. With the Global War on Terrorism the brigade has deployed six times: initially deployed to <b>Uzbekistan,</b> Kuwait and Qatar in 2001, elements of the brigade later deployed from <b>Uzbekistan</b> into Afghanistan; the brigade deployed again in early 2003, split across Iraq, Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa; the entire brigade returned to Iraq in 2004–2005, 2006–2007 and 2009–2010 before returning to Afghanistan in 2013 for its sixth deployment.|$|E
5|$|Because Kazakhstan {{was once}} {{a member of the}} USSR, its rail system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, {{as well as the other}} Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, <b>Uzbekistan,</b> Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.|$|E
5|$|P. m. dilutus, {{described}} by Charles Wallace Richmond in 1856, is resident {{in the extreme}} northeast of Iran, northern Pakistan and northwest India. It also occurs further north, from <b>Uzbekistan</b> and Tajikistan east to China. Compared to P. m. montanus, it is paler, with sandy-brown upperparts.|$|E

5|$|Carrots {{are one of}} the ten most {{economically}} important vegetable {{crops in}} the world. In 2014, world production of carrots (combined with turnips) was 38.8 million tonnes, with China producing 45% of the world total (17.3 million tonnes, table). Other major producers were <b>Uzbekistan</b> and Russia (5% and 4% of world total, respectively), the United States (4%) and Ukraine (2%).|$|E

5|$|It took Đurić three {{personal}} attempts {{before he}} received his Singaporean citizenship on 27 September 2007 as he {{was not on the}} Football Association of Singapore's Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. Despite obtaining his Singapore passport for non-footballing reasons, coach Radojko Avramović called him up to the Singapore national team on 1 November 2007. He made his international debut at the age of 37 years and 89 days against Tajikistan in the first leg of {{the second round of the}} 2010 World Cup qualifiers on 9 November, contributing with an immediate impact by scoring both goals in a 2–0 victory. Đurić started the match following injuries to attacking midfielder Shi Jiayi and striker Indra Shahdan Daud. The result coupled with a 1–1 draw in the second leg meant that Singapore progressed to the third round of the Asian Qualifying Tournament for the first time, where they were drawn against Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and <b>Uzbekistan.</b> He continued his fine form on the international stage, scoring against Lebanon and <b>Uzbekistan</b> as Singapore finished third in Group 4.|$|E
5|$|Mohammad Bahrooz was {{the only}} cyclist in the {{delegation}} of Afghanistan. He represented his nation in the men's 169.4km individual road race event held on October 3 at the Road Cycle Race Stadium.

5|$|The Mughal Empire, {{founded in}} 1526, was the {{dominant}} {{power in the}} Indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century. The dynasty was founded when Babur, hailing from Ferghana (in modern-day <b>Uzbekistan),</b> invaded parts of North India and defeated Ibrahim Shah Lodhi, the ruler of Delhi Sultanate, at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526. After Babur's death on 26 December 1530, his son Humayun (1530–40) ascended to the throne at Agra on 29 December 1530.|$|E
5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in <b>Uzbekistan),</b> in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} writing system and the debates {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes. Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin script is supported by {{those who wish to}} bring the country closer to <b>Uzbekistan,</b> which has adopted the Latin-based Uzbek alphabet. The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish to maintain the status quo, and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Bane lures Gotham's police {{underground}} and uses explosives to trap them {{and destroy the}} bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces Dr. Leonid Pavel, a Russian nuclear physicist he kidnapped from <b>Uzbekistan,</b> to convert the reactor core into an atomic bomb before killing him as well. Bane then uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes to the public, and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating anarchy. The wealthy and powerful are then taken captive and given show trials presided over by Jonathan Crane, where all are sentenced to death.|$|E
5|$|Centuries {{before the}} conquest of Sogdiana by the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, Sogdiana possessed a Bronze Age urban culture that was {{gradually}} displaced by the Indo-European migrations of the Iron Age. This large-scale migration included Eastern Iranian speaking peoples such as the Sogdians. The original Bronze Age towns appear in the archaeological record beginning with the settlement at Sarazm, Tajikistan, spanning {{as far back as}} the 4th millennium BC and then at Kök Tepe, near modern-day Bulungur, <b>Uzbekistan,</b> from at least the 15th century BC.|$|E
5|$|It {{was built}} by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan between 1644 and 1656 {{at a cost of}} 1 million rupees, and was inaugurated by an imam from Bukhara, present-day <b>Uzbekistan.</b> The mosque was {{completed}} in 1656 AD with three great gates, four towers and two 40 m high minarets constructed of strips of red sandstone and white marble. The courtyard can accommodate more than 25,000 persons. There are three domes on the terrace which are surrounded by the two minarets. On the floor, a total of 899 black borders are marked for worshippers. The architectural plan of Badshahi Masjid, built by Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb at Lahore, Pakistan, is similar to the Jama Masjid, Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The Belles {{originally}} {{failed to}} qualify for the 2016 Paralympics after finishing third at the IBSA Goalball Asia Pacific Championships in Hangzhou, China. They were displaced to allow for an African team, Algeria as it turned out, to compete in goalball for the first time. But following the re-allocation of Russia's spot, the Belles found themselves getting a last minute invite to Rio.They entered the tournament ranked ninth in the world. They performed better this time, fighting <b>Uzbekistan</b> to a draw, but they needed a win or draw in their final game against Canada to progress to the quarter finals, but lost 6-0, ending their second Paralympic campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} emblem of Belarus, which replaced the historic Pahonia {{arms in a}} 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colours of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the coat of arms of Belarus, although this is incorrect {{due to the lack of}} several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Belorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, Tajikistan, <b>Uzbekistan</b> and the region of Transnistria.|$|E
5|$|The tiger was {{historically}} widespread throughout eastern Eurasia, {{with the}} Pontic Caspian steppe, Eastern Turkey and Mesopotamia {{serving as the}} westernmost fringe of their range, and the coasts between eastern Siberia and the Indonesian islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra acting as the frontier to the Pacific Ocean. In between, tigers roamed what is today Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Georgia, southern Russia, Syria, Turkey and eastern Ukraine (as part of the Black Sea region), Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Nepal (comprising South Asia), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and <b>Uzbekistan</b> (composing Central Asia) China, Mongolia, North Korea, Siberia and South Korea (constituting East Asia) and South East Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam).|$|E
5|$|There are 11 {{recognised}} tiger subspecies. Two, the Trinil and Japanese tigers, became {{extinct in}} prehistoric times. The remaining subspecies all survived at least into the mid-20th century; {{three of these}} are also considered extinct. Their core historical range in South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan), Eastern Asia (China, Mongolia, North Korea, Siberia, South Korea) and South East Asia, including three Indonesian islands, is severely constricted today, notwithstanding key extinct populations in the Black Sea (Iran, Georgia, Southern Russia, Turkey) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, <b>Uzbekistan).</b>|$|E
5|$|URS, EUN. Soviet Union (URS) participated at the Games of 1956–1988. After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, nine of the fifteen ex-republics of the Soviet Union were represented at the 1992 Winter Olympics. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania participated as independent teams, and Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and <b>Uzbekistan</b> participated as a combined Unified Team (EUN). Since 1994 ex-republics of the Soviet Union are represented by fifteen successor NOCs, fourteen of which have participated in the Winter Games.|$|E

The third round was evenly contested with both fighters scoring on a couple of occasions, but Vijender had already lost the match.|$|E
5|$|With the {{partitions}} of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century, vast {{markets in}} Russia and Central Asia opened to Polish cochineal, which became an export product againthis time, to the East. In the 19th century, Bukhara, <b>Uzbekistan,</b> became the principal Polish cochineal trading center in Central Asia; from there the dye was shipped to Kashgar in Xinjiang, and Kabul and Herat in Afghanistan. It is possible that the Polish dye was used to manufacture some of the famous oriental rugs.|$|E
5|$|Athletes from 39 nations won {{at least}} one medal, and athletes from 27 of these nations secured {{at least one}} gold. Eight NOCs—Kazakhstan, <b>Uzbekistan,</b> India, Singapore, Vietnam, Qatar, Philippines and Kyrgyzstan—improved their {{position}} in the general medal table compared to the 1998 Asian Games. China topped the medal table for the sixth consecutive time in the Asian Games, with 150 gold medals. Athletes from China won the most silver medals (84) and the most medals overall (308).

5|$|Babur, was a {{descendant}} of Genghis Khan and Timur, from the Fergana Valley in modern-day <b>Uzbekistan.</b> In 1526, he invaded India, defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra. The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi {{for more than three}} centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556. In 1553, the Hindu king, Hemu acceded to the throne of Delhi by defeating forces of Mughal Emperor Humayun at Agra and Delhi. However, the Mughals re-established their rule after Akbar's army defeated Hemu during the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556. Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name Shahjahanabad, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the Old City or Old Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, {{elements}} of the division, including its special troops battalion and the 1-87th Infantry deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001. The division headquarters arrived at Karshi-Khanabad, under Major General Hagenbeck, on 12 December 2001 to function as the Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) (Forward). This command served as the representative for Lieutenant General Paul Mikolashek, the Third US Army/CFLCC commanding general (CG) in the theater of operations. As such, Hagenbeck's headquarters was responsible for commanding and controlling virtually all Coalition ground forces and ground force operations in the theater, to include security of Coalition airfields in Afghanistan, <b>Uzbekistan,</b> and Pakistan, {{as well as the}} logistics operations set up to support those forces.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{seventeen}} countries produced concentrated uranium oxides, with Canada (27.9% {{of world}} production) and Australia (22.8%) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan (10.5%), Russia (8.0%), Namibia (7.5%), Niger (7.4%), <b>Uzbekistan</b> (5.5%), the United States (2.5%), Argentina (2.1%), Ukraine (1.9%) and China (1.7%) also producing significant amounts. Kazakhstan {{continues to increase}} production and may have become the world's largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826tonnes, compared to Canada with 11,100t and Australia with 9,430t. In the late 1960s, UN geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia. The find was the largest of its kind, with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25% of the world's then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons.|$|E

5|$|Mostow, an {{immigrant}} from <b>Uzbekistan</b> {{with a history}} of involuntary commitment, is charged with killing seven men by mutilating their faces. Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) become involved in the investigation when Mostow insists that he was possessed during the killings; his claims are given credence when another murder occurs after his arrest. Mostow draws a gargoyle and claims it made him kill. The agents meet with Patterson who has spent three years on the case. Mulder knows Patterson from his time in the Investigative Support Unit at Quantico. Their relationship is tense, and Patterson is skeptical of Mulder's theories. Mulder and Scully go to Mostow's studio and discover a hidden room full of gargoyle sculptures, finding corpses within them.|$|E
5|$|Pakistani {{intelligence}} {{officials said they}} found letters from Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, after taking control of Lal Masjid. They were written to Abdul Rashid Ghazi and Abdul Aziz Ghazi, directing the brothers and militants to conduct an armed revolt. Government sources believe {{that as many as}} 18 foreign fighters from <b>Uzbekistan,</b> Egypt, and Afghanistan had arrived weeks before the final confrontation and established firing ranges to teach the students, including children, how to handle weapons properly. Diplomats were surprised by how quickly al-Zawahiri condemned the attack on the mosque and called on Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf's government. Officials blamed the presence of foreign fighters for the breakdown of negotiations, as they seemed about to reach a deal to end the standoff peacefully. According to government sources and western diplomats, the Al-Qaeda fighters in the mosque sought martyrdom instead.|$|E
5|$|The Marwari is {{descended from}} native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses. The ponies {{were small and}} hardy, but with poor conformation; the {{influence}} of the Arabian blood improved the appearance without compromising the hardiness. The Arabians possibly came ashore from a cargo ship wrecked off India's west coast. Legend in India states that the Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the Kachchh District. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as foundation bloodstock for the Marwari. There is also the possibility of some Mongolian influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in <b>Uzbekistan,</b> Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India.|$|E
5|$|The Sogdian states, {{although}} never politically united, were {{centred on}} the main city of Samarkand. Sogdiana lay north of Bactria, east of Khwarezm, and southeast of Kangju between the Oxus (Amu Darya) and the Jaxartes (Syr Darya), embracing the fertile valley of the Zeravshan (ancient Polytimetus). Sogdian territory corresponds to the modern provinces of Samarkand and Bokhara in modern <b>Uzbekistan</b> {{as well as the}} Sughd province of modern Tajikistan. During the High Middle Ages, Sogdian cities included sites stretching towards Issyk Kul such as that at the archeological site of Suyab. Sogdian, an Eastern Iranian language, is no longer a spoken language, but its direct descendant, Yaghnobi, is still spoken by the Yaghnobis of Tajikistan. It was widely spoken in Central Asia as a lingua franca and even served as one of the Turkic Khaganate's court languages for writing documents.|$|E
