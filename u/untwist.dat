25|$|Joseph Lister is {{credited}} {{for being the}} first to use a tourniquet device to create a bloodless surgical field in 1864. He also recommended exsanguinations prior to tourniquet application by limb elevation. In 1873, Friedrich von Esmarch developed a rubber bandage that would both control bleeding and exsanguinate. This device is known as Esmarch's bandage for surgical haemostasis or Eschmarch's Tourniquet. At the time this device was superior to Petit’s device because Petit’s cloth bandages tore, the screw could <b>untwist,</b> and pressures that were very high, unknown and uneven were applied to the underlying limb, resulting in hazards and injuries. In 1881, Richard von Volkmann showed that limb paralysis can occur from the use of the Esmarch tourniquet. Many cases of serious and permanent limb paralysis were reported from the use of non-pneumatic Esmarch tourniquets.|$|E

2500|$|A yarn's {{usefulness}} for a knitting {{project is}} judged by several factors, {{such as its}} loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or <b>untwist,</b> its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

[...] The resilience and propensity to (<b>un)twist</b> are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. [...] More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. [...] A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, [...] corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. [...] Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{establish}} the relationship between invasive measures of diastolic function and <b>untwisting</b> parameters measured with speckle tracking imaging. BackgroundLeft ventricular (LV) diastolic function is determined by early diastolic relaxation (which creates suction gradients for LV filling) and myocardial stiffness. Assessment of LV torsion has shown that <b>untwisting</b> begins before aortic valve closure and, in animals, might be {{an important component of}} normal diastolic filling. Studies in human subjects using indirect indexes derived from right heart catheterization have suggested a relationship between τ and measures of <b>untwisting,</b> but the relationship between directly measured diastolic function indexes with micromanometer catheters and <b>untwisting</b> parameters has not been established in human subjects. MethodsSimultaneous Millar micromanometer LV pressure and echocardiographic assessment was performed on 18 patients (10 male, mean age 66 years) with normal systolic function and a spectrum of diastolic function. Invasive rate of the rise of LV pressure, dp/dt minimum and τ were recorded as measures of active relaxation, and the LV minimum diastolic pressure was recorded as an index of diastolic suction. The LV stiffness constant and functional chamber stiffness were estimated from hybrid pressure-volume loops. Echocardiographic speckle tracking imaging was used to quantify torsion. ResultsAs relaxation was impaired, (prolonged τ) <b>untwisting</b> was delayed (r = 0. 35, p < 0. 01). There were nonsignificant associations between reduced <b>untwisting</b> and longer values of τ and lower dp/dt minimum. Reduction in the extent of <b>untwisting</b> before mitral valve opening was associated with increased LV minimum diastolic pressure (r = − 0. 30, p < 0. 034). No relation was observed between the LV stiffness constant (β: r = 0. 11, p = NS) or the functional LV chamber stiffness (b: r = 0. 11, p = NS) and <b>untwisting.</b> ConclusionsUntwisting parameters are related to invasive indexes of LV relaxation and suction but not to LV stiffness. These data suggest that <b>untwisting</b> is an important component of early diastolic LV filling but not later diastolic events...|$|R
