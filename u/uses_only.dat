5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, <b>uses</b> <b>only</b> the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed <b>uses</b> <b>only</b> natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} mallets {{used by the}} player could also vary as well. For most occasions, only one mallet is used but for other techniques, the player could use two mallets, one in each hand. An even more {{interesting}} technique <b>uses</b> <b>only</b> one balu but requires the player to play the agung in reverse order of pitches. Called patuy, this technique and the one with two mallets are normally reserved only for competition and exhibition instances.|$|E

This paper presents addition formulas for inverted Edwards coordinates <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 9 M¿+¿ 1 S. The formulas are not complete but still are strongly unified.

The study of von Neumann's model of an {{expanding}} economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics.

In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that <b>uses</b> <b>only</b> an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|The {{current crest}} of the club {{is based on the}} {{official}} emblem of the city of Maribor, which is in turn based on a 14th-century seal with minor differences. The badge is formed in a shape of a shield, and shows the former Piramida Castle that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished {{at the end of the}} 18th century. A violet blossom forms the backdrop. Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor, the current badge of the club does not represent a white dove facing downwards to the castle, but an athlete. At the top of the shield the name of the club and the year of its foundation is inscribed. The entire badge <b>uses</b> <b>only</b> two colours, purple and yellow. Previous versions of the crest included the colour white, one of the traditional colours of the club, in the form of a white castle in the centre and a white ball that was on top of the shield. Since May 2012 the official badge includes a yellow star above the crest, which indicates the first ten domestic titles won by the club.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus <b>uses</b> <b>only</b> one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E

50|$|If {{the puzzle}} is <b>only</b> {{scrambled}} <b>using</b> 180° twists, {{then it is}} obviously solvable <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 180° twists. However, if some jumbling moves were made, even if the puzzle was subsequently returned to cube shape, {{it may not be}} possible to solve it <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 180° twists. The {{reason for this is that}} <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 180° twists, each face center piece can only be permuted within a 6-member cycle, often referred to as its orbit. Face center pieces in different orbits cannot be interchanged <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 180° twists. However, jumbling moves are able to permute face center pieces between different orbits, thus leaving the puzzle in a state that cannot be solved by 180° twists alone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Edwards curves have {{attracted}} great interest for several rea-sons. When curve parameters are chosen properly, the addition formulas <b>use</b> <b>only</b> 10 M+ 1 S. The formulas are strongly unified, i. e., work without change for doublings; even better, they are complete, i. e., work without change for all inputs. Dedicated doubling formulas <b>use</b> <b>only</b> 3 M + 4 S, and dedicated tripling formulas <b>use</b> <b>only</b> 9 M + 4 S. This paper introduces inverted Edwards coordinates. Inverted Edwards coordinates (X 1 : Y 1 : Z 1) represent the affine point (Z 1 /X 1, Z 1 /Y 1) on an Edwards curve; for comparison, standard Edwards coordinates (X 1 : Y 1 : Z 1) represent the affine point (X 1 /Z 1, Y 1 /Z 1). This paper presents addition formulas for inverted Edwards coor-dinates <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 9 M + 1 S. The formulas are not complete but still are strongly unified. Dedicated doubling formulas <b>use</b> <b>only</b> 3 M + 4 S, and dedicated tripling formulas <b>use</b> <b>only</b> 9 M + 4 S.
