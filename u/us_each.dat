It is estimated to affect about 1.5 percent of young women yearly. In the United States PID is estimated to affect about one million people yearly. Rates are highest with teenagers and first time mothers. PID causes over 100,000 women to become infertile in the <b>US</b> <b>each</b> year.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the U.S. ice trade {{employed}} an estimated 90,000 people in an industry capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms), using ice houses capable of storing up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) each; Norway exported a million tons (910 million kg) of ice a year, drawing on a network of artificial lakes. Competition had slowly been growing, however, in the form of artificially produced plant ice and mechanically chilled facilities. Unreliable and expensive at first, plant ice began to successfully compete with natural ice in Australia and India during the 1850s and 1870s respectively, until, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, more plant ice was being produced in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>each</b> year than naturally harvested ice. Despite a temporary increase in production in the U.S. during the war, the inter-war years saw the total collapse of the ice trade around the world. Today, ice is occasionally harvested for ice carving and ice festivals, but little remains of the 19th-century industrial network of ice houses and transport facilities.|$|E

25|$|As the {{incidence}} of SCLC has declined somewhat in the U.S. in recent decades, {{it is likely that}} c-SCLC has also decreased in incidence.

With 220,000 cases of newly diagnosed lung cancer in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>each</b> year, it can be estimated that between 8,800 and 13,200 of these are c-SCLC.|$|E

While most vehicles sold in the US were manufactured by the Big Three, foreign corporations such as Japan's Toyota Motor Company have starting manufacturing in the US and are now an integrated part of the US automobile industry. According to many sources, the extended US operations of foreign based companies now rival those of American automobile manufacturers. For example, Toyota Motor Company now operates twelve manufacturing plants in the US, producing 1.55 million vehicles, 61.66% of the roughly 2.5 million vehicles the company sells in the <b>US</b> <b>each</b> year.|$|E

500|$|The natural ice {{trade was}} rapidly supplanted by {{refrigeration}} cooling systems and plant ice {{during the early}} years of the 20th century. Plant ice production in New York doubled between 1900 and 1910 and, by 1914, 26 million tons (23 billion kg) of plant ice was being produced in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>each</b> year in comparison to the 24 million tons (22 billion kg) of naturally harvested ice. There was a similar trend around the world– Britain had 103 ice plants by 1900, for example– and this made it increasingly unprofitable to import ice from the U.S.; annual imports of ice fell to less than 15,000 tons (13 million kg) by 1910. This was reflected in trade publications changing their names: the Ice Trade Journal, for example, retitled itself the Refrigerating World.|$|E
500|$|In the 18th century, as Blaydes continued, {{the word}} changed from possessed by god to {{inspired}} to falsely inspired.

The result would be obvious: his past work, previously lauded, would be ignored, and his future work would receive immediate condemnation. such was the history of Smart's contemporary reputation." [...] In determining if Smart was really mad or not, Blaydes concluded, [...] "in Smart's day, any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness [...] Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for <b>us.</b> <b>Each</b> permits some doubt that the poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age." ...|$|E

She also explains how flying in private jet with her team like [...] "one family" [...] is fun, but very rare. Scenes of Rihanna performing a show in Ischgl and having snowball fight with hear team at the town's streets are shown. During the interview Rihanna explains that she, her crew members and dancers were touring for a considerable amount of time and became very close so as a result of that, they hang out a lot. One of the crew explains: [...] "It is like a family. Rihanna comes in every day, says hi to every single one of <b>us.</b> <b>Each</b> of us come in every day, we all say hi to each other." [...] Rihanna further describes herself as a prankster, and a story of her and one of the crew members pranking is shown. Scenes are intercut to Rihanna and her team performing a show. Later, Rihanna jokingly explains that they put probably [...] "the worst show ever" [...] because of her dancers.|$|E
500|$|In the New Testament, all Christians are {{referred}} to as saints. However, the use of [...] "saint" [...] as a title for an individual who had led a good and exemplary life or who had been martyred began to develop in Christianity. By the time of the Reformation, the use of [...] "saint" [...] was almost exclusively the restrictive, titular sense. [...] One {{of the effects of the}} Reformation was to eliminate the abuses of the cult of saints, and as a result, it is a common misconception that Lutherans do not have (or rather, do not venerate) saints. However, the confessional documents of the Lutheran Church, particularly the Augsburg Confession, accept both the general and particular use of the word saints. [...] In regards to the titular sense, the Augsburg Confession commends that [...] "it should be taught among us that saints should be kept in remembrance so that our faith may be strengthened when we see what grace they received and how they were sustained in faith. Moreover, their good works are to be an example for <b>us,</b> <b>each</b> of us in his own calling." [...] Article XXI of The Apology to the Augsburg Confession goes further to describe three types of honor which are due to the saints and acknowledgment that the saints pray for the Church. However, the Augsburg Confession opposes prayer to saints, stating, [...] "Scripture does not teach calling on the saints or pleading for help from them. For it sets before us Christ alone as mediator, atoning sacrifice, high priest, and intercessor." ...|$|E
