5|$|Aphthous-like <b>ulceration</b> also {{occurs in}} {{conditions}} involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral <b>ulceration</b> occurs during periods of severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of <b>ulceration.</b> The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type <b>ulceration</b> in HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like <b>ulceration</b> {{may occur}} in {{association}} with several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type of oral <b>ulceration</b> is {{not considered to be}} true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause <b>ulceration</b> on other mucosal surfaces in addition to the mouth such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity of the oral <b>ulceration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral <b>ulceration,</b> recurrent oral <b>ulceration</b> has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, <b>ulceration</b> associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral <b>ulceration</b> with no prior history.|$|E

We describe a 64 years old female with recurrent painless perianal <b>ulcerations</b> evoluting from 14 months. She medicates herself daily, since 8 to 10 years, with ergotamine tartarate suppositories, {{for the treatment}} of migraine. The diagnosis of ulcerated cutaneous drug reaction induced by ergotamine tartarate was confirmed by the complete healing of the lesions after stopping this medication and by their recurrence after the reintroduction of the treatment. These <b>ulcerations</b> are probably due to vasospasm of regional arterioles. Perianal <b>ulcerations</b> caused by suppositories application is an exceptional situation.

40|$|Inherited {{fibrinogen}} {{disorders are}} {{a group of}} diseases for which decreased fibrinogen levels and/or decreased activity or abnormal functional activity are responsible. These diseases can be asymptomatic or manifesting as bleeding or thrombosis. Although hypercoagulopathic conditions are listed as causes of lower leg <b>ulcerations,</b> inherited fibrinogen disorders are rarely reported as causes of lower leg <b>ulcerations</b> in the literature. Here, we describe two siblings who had recurrent lower leg <b>ulcerations</b> due to inherited fibrinogen disorder. In cases of recurrent venous <b>ulcerations</b> which are not due to common etiologies and have familial history, it should be kept in mind that there may be an underlying inherited fibrinogen disorder as a rare reason for the hypercogulopathic condition...|$|R

5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral <b>ulceration.</b> These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral <b>ulceration.</b> Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral <b>ulceration,</b> which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral <b>ulceration.</b> Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of <b>ulceration).</b> Several drugs can cause oral <b>ulceration</b> (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E
5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform <b>ulceration</b> is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of <b>ulceration.</b> Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The <b>ulceration</b> may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform <b>ulceration</b> is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that <b>ulceration</b> is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of systemic conditions associated with aphthous-like <b>ulceration</b> include reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), and recurrent erythema multiforme.|$|E

40|$|The toxic {{effects of}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs {{for the lower}} gastrointestinal tract share certain features with inflammatory processes, suggesting that the release of inflammation cytokines such as TNF-α may damage the intestine. Rats received a s. c. injection of indomethacin. Then, jejunum-ileum was taken up for the quantification of <b>ulcerations,</b> production of TNF-α, nitrites and PGE 2 ex vivo and activity of calcium-independent NO synthase and myeloperoxydase. Activation of NO metabolism and myeloperoxydase were measured as potential effectors of TNF-α. Jejunum-ileum from rats having received indomethacin (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) produced TNF-α ex vivo. Cytokine production {{was associated with the}} onset of macroscopic <b>ulcerations</b> of the small intestine, and preceded nitrite production and tissue activity of myeloperoxidase. Similar intestinal <b>ulcerations</b> and upregulation of TNF-α were obtained with flurbiprofen (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), chemically unrelated to indomethacin. TNF-α production was proportional to the indomethacin dose (from 3 – 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and correlated with the surface area of <b>ulcerations</b> and nitrite production, 24 [*]h after indomethacin administration. Pretreatment of rats with RO 20 - 1724, a type-IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor which inhibits TNF-α synthesis, substantially reduced jejunum-ileum <b>ulcerations,</b> TNF-α and nitrite production and tissue enzyme activities. These findings provide evidence that TNF-α is increased in indomethacin-induced intestinal <b>ulcerations</b> and support suggestions that TNF-α is involved at an early stage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity for the small intestine...|$|R

5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous <b>ulceration</b> (MaAU) or major {{recurrent}} aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the <b>ulceration</b> is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of <b>ulceration</b> usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous <b>ulceration</b> usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the dorsum (top surface) of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The soft palate or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity. Compared to minor aphthous <b>ulceration,</b> major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ulceration</b> episodes usually occur about 3–6 {{times per}} year. However, severe disease is {{characterized}} by virtually constant <b>ulceration</b> (new lesions developing before old ones have healed) and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable eating. In severe cases, this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to malnutrition and weight loss.|$|E

5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the <b>ulceration.</b> The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like <b>ulceration.</b>|$|E
5|$|In cyclic neutropenia, {{there is}} a {{reduction}} in the level of circulating neutrophils in the blood that occurs about every 21 days. Opportunistic infections commonly occur and aphthous-like <b>ulceration</b> is worst during this time.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where <b>ulceration</b> is {{correlated}} to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral <b>ulceration</b> after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the <b>ulceration.</b> For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E

40|$|Complications of {{diabetes}} mellitus constitute {{the most common}} indications for hospitalization and non-traumatic amputations in the USA. The most important risk factors {{for the development of}} diabetic foot <b>ulcerations</b> include the presence of peripheral neuropathy, vasculopathy, limited joint mobility, and pre-existing foot deformities. In our study, 500 diabetic patients treated for plantar forefoot <b>ulcerations</b> were enrolled in a prospective study from 2000 to 2008 at the Federal University of S&#x 00 E 3;o Paulo, Brazil. Fifty-two patients in the study met the criteria and underwent surgical treatment consisting of percutaneous Achilles tendon lengthening to treat plantar forefoot <b>ulcerations.</b> The postoperative follow-up demonstrated prevention of recurrent foot <b>ulcerations</b> in 92 % of these diabetic patients that maintained an improved foot function. In conclusion, our study supports that identification and treatment of ankle equinus in the diabetic population may potentially lead to decreased patient morbidity, including reduced risk for both reulceration, and potential lower extremity amputation...|$|R
5|$|Sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS), a detergent {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral <b>ulceration</b> in some individuals. It {{has been shown}} that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in <b>ulceration</b> occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of people with aphthous stomatitis have minor symptoms and do not require any specific therapy. The pain is often tolerable with simple dietary modification during an episode of <b>ulceration</b> such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods and beverages. Many different topical and systemic medications have been proposed (see table), sometimes showing little or no evidence of usefulness when formally investigated. Some of the results of interventions for RAS may in truth represent a placebo effect. No therapy is curative, with treatment aiming to relieve pain, promote healing and reduce the frequency of episodes of <b>ulceration.</b>|$|E

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of aphthous stomatitis, {{accounting}} for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous <b>ulceration</b> (MiAU), or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10mm in diameter (usually about 2–3mm), and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and buccal mucosa, lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of <b>ulceration,</b> there is usually an ulcer-free period of variable length.|$|E
5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting {{that some people are}} genetically predisposed to suffering with oral <b>ulceration.</b> HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition, and at an earlier age than is typical.|$|E
