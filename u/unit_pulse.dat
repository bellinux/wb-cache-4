40|$|A {{method for}} speech {{processing}} is presented. The method {{does not require}} voiced/unvoiced or pitch determination. It models the sampled speech wave as a concatenation of initial segments of <b>unit</b> <b>pulse</b> responses of linear, time-invariant, recursive discrete time systems. The poles of the systems are calculated by Prony's method applied to blocks of speech samples. The zeroes are chosen to zero the error between the speech wave and the first output samples of each system. The analysis phase proceeds as follows. After an initial block of <b>unit</b> <b>pulse</b> response, the system output samples are compared with the speech samples and the system continues to function until the error between the two grows too large. At this time the next block of samples {{is used to calculate}} a new system and the process continues. The parameters describing the speech are thus the system parameters (poles and zeroes, for example) and the number of output samples taken from each system. This information is quantized to produce a bit rate for the process of 20 kilobits/second. The approximate speech is synthesized by implementing each system sequentially, applying a pulse to the input and concatenating the required number of output samples to the samples from previous systems. The speech obtained is very noisy, but it is intelligible and speakers can be recognized. A demonstration tape is available from Dr. T. W. Parks of the Electrical Engineering Department.

40|$|In this master thesis, an {{extension}} of the interaction matrix formulation to the discrete-time bilinear state-space model is derived. Several identication techniques are presented from this formulation to identify the bilinear state-space matrices using a superstate vector, derived from a single set of su-ciently rich input-output measurements. The initial state can be non-zero and unknown. Unlike other approaches, no specialized inputs are required, such as sinusoidal or white inputs, or duration-varying <b>unit</b> <b>pulses</b> involving multiple experiments. For that reason, the bilinear state-space identication problem is di-cult to solve, since it {{can be seen as a}} linear time-varying system with input-dependent system matrix or state-dependent input-influence matrix. The resultant input-output map from this state-space formulation can be used for output prediction. A relationship between the coe-cients of this input-output map and the bilinear state-space model matrices is obtained via two interaction matrices, corresponding to the linear and bilinear portions of the model, respectively. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate these bilinear state-space model identication techniques and the input-output model identication method. It is concluded that the proposed identication algorithms can correctly identify the original bilinear state-space model, and the identied input-output map correctly predict its system output response, despite the fact that the interaction matrices are only implicitly assumed to exist...|$|R

Since karsts which are near the ground surface undergo climate variations, measurements have been carried out on sedimentary rocks subjected to frost cracking and also on marble samples subjected to heat cracking.

40|$|Abstract During {{probabilistic}} {{analysis of}} flow and transport in porous media, the uncertainty due to spatial heterogeneity of governing parameters are often taken into account. The randomness in the source conditions {{also play a}} major role on the stochastic behavior in distribution of the dependent variable. The present pa-per is focused on studying the effect of both uncertainty in the governing system parameters as well as the input source conditions. Under such circumstances, a method is proposed which combines with stochastic finite ele-ment method (SFEM) and is illustrated for probabilistic analysis of concentration distribution in a 3 -D hetero-geneous porous media under the influence of random source condition. In the first step SFEM used for probabilistic solution due to spatial heterogeneity of governing parameters for a <b>unit</b> source <b>pulse.</b> Further, the results from the <b>unit</b> source <b>pulse</b> case have been used for the analysis of multiple pulse case using the numerical convolution when the source condition is a random process. The source condition is modeled as a discrete release of random amount of masses at fixed intervals of time. The mean and standard deviation of concentration is compared for the deterministic and the stochastic system scenarios as well as for different values of system parameters. The effect of uncertainty of source condition is also demonstrated in terms of mean and standard deviation of concentration at various locations in the domain...|$|R
