5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or <b>under</b> <b>vacuum.</b> After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E

Rubidium can form Rb6O and Rb9O2 (copper-coloured) upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO3 and several brightly coloured suboxides, such as Cs7O (bronze), Cs4O (red-violet), Cs11O3 (violet), Cs3O (dark green), CsO, Cs3O2, as well as Cs7O2. The last of these may be heated <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> to generate Cs2O.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} oxidizers like sodium nitrate {{are added to}} enhance the reaction.

Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium.|$|E

Testing <b>under</b> high <b>vacuum</b> conditions with common materials resulted in some interesting results. Many materials were able to charge to high levels which did not dissipate quickly even when grounded. Certain materials were able to charge up in contact with grounded metals while others were not. An interesting result was that like materials did not exchange electrostatic charge <b>under</b> high <b>vacuum</b> conditions.

High-power disk laser bead-on-plate welding was performed on Type 304 stainless steel or A 5052 aluminium alloy plate at the powers of 10, 16 and 26 kW at various welding speeds <b>under</b> low <b>vacuum.</b> The sound welds of more than 50 and 70 mm in penetration depth could be produced in Type 304 at the pressure of 0. 1 kPa, the speed of 0. 3 m/min {{and the power of}} 16 kW and 26 kW, respectively. Similar penetration was achieved in A 5052 aluminum alloy.

In addition, it shows the extraordinary ability to trap molecules and metallic clusters which have similar sizes to the nanomesh pores, forming a well-ordered array. These characteristics promise interesting applications of the nanomesh in areas like catalysis, surface functionalisation, spintronics, quantum computing and data storage media like hard drives.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans <b>under</b> <b>vacuum.</b> The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E

This similarity arises even though the measurement conditions (in aqueous and <b>under</b> ultra-high <b>vacuum</b> conditions) are very different.

25|$|The {{advantage}} of the flash distiller over the compound evaporator is its greater operating efficiency, in terms of heat supplied. This is due to working <b>under</b> <b>vacuum,</b> thus low temperature, and also the regenerative use of the condenser coils to pre-heat the seawater feed.|$|E

25|$|If the SEM is {{equipped}} with a cold stage for cryo microscopy, cryofixation may be used and low-temperature scanning electron microscopy performed on the cryogenically fixed specimens. Cryo-fixed specimens may be cryo-fractured <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> in a special apparatus to reveal internal structure, sputter-coated and transferred onto the SEM cryo-stage while still frozen.

25|$|Conventional SEM {{requires}} {{samples to}} be imaged <b>under</b> <b>vacuum,</b> because a gas atmosphere rapidly spreads and attenuates electron beams. As a consequence, samples that produce {{a significant amount}} of vapour, e.g. wet biological samples or oil-bearing rock, must be either dried or cryogenically frozen. Processes involving phase transitions, such as the drying of adhesives or melting of alloys, liquid transport, chemical reactions, and solid-air-gas systems, in general cannot be observed. Some observations of living insects have been possible however.|$|E

40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) study on morphological changes in gold nanostructures deposited on Si (100) upon annealing <b>under</b> different <b>vacuum</b> conditions has been reported.

25|$|Both {{the fresh}} water {{production}} and the waste brine from the evaporator are led through an output cooler. This acts as a heat exchanger with the inlet seawater, pre-heating it to improve efficiency. The plant may operate at either a low pressure or slight vacuum, according to design. As the evaporator works at pressure, not <b>under</b> <b>vacuum,</b> boiling may be violent. To avoid the risk of priming and a carry over of saltwater into the vapour, the evaporator is divided by a bubble cap separator.|$|E

40|$|The Constant Rate Thermal Analysis (CRTA) {{procedure}} {{has been}} employed {{for the first}} time to study the kinetics of MgH 2 dehydrogenation by thermogravimetry <b>under</b> high <b>vacuum.</b> CRTA implies controlling the temperature in such a way that the decomposition rate is maintained constant all over the process, employing the mass change as the experimental signal proportional to the reaction rate. The CRTA curves present a higher resolution power to discriminate the kinetic model obeyed by the reaction in comparison with conventional heating rate curves. The combined kinetic analysis has been applied to obtain the kinetic parameters, which show that MgH 2 decomposition <b>under</b> high <b>vacuum</b> obeys first-order kinetics (F 1).

25|$|Evaporators {{consume a}} great deal of steam, and thus fuel, in {{relation}} to the quantity of fresh water produced. Their efficiency is improved by working them at a partial vacuum, supplied by the main engine condensers. On modern diesel-powered ships, this vacuum can instead be produced by an ejector, usually worked by the output from the brine pump. Working <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> also reduces the temperature required to boil seawater and thus permits evaporators to be used with lower-temperature waste heat from the diesel cooling system.|$|E
25|$|In the {{processing}} of edible oils, the oil is heated <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> to near the smoke point, and water is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil.|$|E
