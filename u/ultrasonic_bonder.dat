He first set up a commercial ultrasonic wire bonder (capable of transmitting vibratory energy and pressure) in order to investigate the attachment of aluminum wires to tantalum thin films deposited on glass substrates which simulated bonding a lead wire to the fragile metallized silicon integrated circuit [...] "chip". He observed that the ultrasonic energy and pressures levels needed to sufficiently deform the wire and form the required contact areas significantly increased the incidences of cracks in the glass or silicon chip substrates. A means of heating the bond region was then added to the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bonder.</b> The bond region was then heated during the ultrasonic bonding cycle which virtually eliminated the glass failure mode since the wire dramatically deformed to form the required contact area while using significantly lower ultrasonic energy and pressure levels. The enhanced wire deformation during the ultrasonic bonding cycle was attributed to the transition from cold working (or strain hardening of the wire) to near hot working conditions where its softness was enhanced. As the bonding temperature was increased the onset of recrystallization (softening mechanism) occurs where the strain hardening is most extensive. Thus the dual mechanisms of thermal softening and ultrasonic softening which is caused by vibratory energy interacting at the atomic lattice level, facilitated the desired wire deformation. Christian Hagar and George Harman stated that in 1970 Alexander Coucoulas reported additional work in forming thermosonic-type bonds which he initially called hot work ultrasonic bonding. In this case, copper wires were bonded to palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide substrates. As a result of these earliest reported thermosonic wire bonds, G.Harman stated [...] "as such, Alexander Coucoulas is the Father of Thermosonic Bonding".At present, the majority of connections to silicon integrated circuits (the chip) are made using thermosonic bonding because it employs lower bonding temperatures, forces and dwell times than thermocompression bonding, as well as lower vibratory energy levels than ultrasonic bonding, to form the required bond area. As a result of using lower bonding parameters to form the required contact area, Thermosonic Bonding largely eliminates damaging the relatively fragile silicon integrated circuit micro-chip during the bonding cycle. The proven reliability of thermosonic bonding has made it the process of choice, since such potential failure modes could be costly whether they occur during the manufacturing stage or detected later, during an operational field-failure of a micro-chip which had been permanently connected inside a computer or a myriad of other electronic devices.|$|E
40|$|We report {{our work}} on {{fabricating}} lithographically aligned patterned backgates on thin (50 - 60 μm) roman 3 -roman 5 semiconductor samples using single sided mask aligners only. Along with this we also present {{a way to}} photograph {{both sides of a}} thin patterned chip using inexpensive infra-red light emitting diodes (LED) and an inexpensive (consumer) digital camera. A robust method of contacting both sides of a sample using an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bonder</b> is described. In addition we present a mathematical model to analyse the variation of the electrochemical potential through the doped layers and heterojunctions that are normally present in most GaAs based devices. We utilise the technique and the estimates from our model to fabricate an electron-hole bilayer device in which each layer is separately contacted and has tunable densities. The electron and hole layers are separated by barriers either 25 or 15 nm wide. In both cases, the densities can be matched by using appropriate bias voltages. Comment: 7 pages, 8 EPS figures.

40|$|Abstract: Currently <b>ultrasonic</b> wire <b>bonders</b> with {{precision}} capillary tips {{are widely used}} in the packaging industry for bonding wires to ICs and circuits. However, the quality and strength of a bond are affected significantly by the vibration of the bonding capillary. It is, therefore, necessary to study the vibration characteristics of the capillary for better understanding and for developing anon-perturbative and low-costmonitoring device for improving bonding quality control. In this paper, the vibration characteristics of the capillary are presented in terms of natural frequency and vibration modes using finite-element models. The predicted displacement profile along the capillary is comparedwith themeasurement using anon-contact laser interferometer. In general, a good agreement between the prediction and measurement is obtained, and {{it shows that the}} interferometer may be a good monitoring tool for characterization of capillary tip vibration, as well as providing a reference for other monitoring devices...|$|R
