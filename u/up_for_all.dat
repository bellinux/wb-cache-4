5|$|After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> {{the same}} classes he had. Smith would do all {{schoolwork}} twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors catching his sham. When {{he had a}} test, he would take it twice and then turn it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered Burdell membership.|$|E

25|$|DreamWorks began {{production}} in 2001, which was actually {{before the first}} film was even completed. DreamWorks made sure there was something new to see in Shrek 2 by putting more human characters in the film than there were in its predecessor and improving their appearance, {{with the use of}} a few systems that dealt with hair and fur to improve its appearance and movement. The set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the characters was done in the first three years of production. Puss in Boots required a whole new set of tools in the film to handle his fur, belt and feather plume in his hat. The character also required an upgrade in the fur shader for his introduction in the film.|$|E
25|$|Owned-and-operated {{stations}} used to {{be common}} {{in the days of}} network radio, however beginning in the 1980s, these radio networks began to be broken <b>up.</b> <b>For</b> <b>all</b> intents and purposes, NBC no longer exists as a radio network, beyond brand licensing and distribution agreements with Dial Global for NBC Sports Radio content. ABC was previously non-existent as well, until 2015 when it relaunched an in-house radio network after Cumulus Media Networks, the then-owners and distributors of the ABC News Radio brand, replaced the ABC News brand with Westwood One News (via CNN). CBS's radio stations are now a separate company (CBS Radio) from its broadcast service. In the late 1990s, the original CBS Radio Network was reassigned to then-corporate sibling Westwood One via a series of complicated transactions, absorbing the former Mutual and the original NBC Radio (which General Electric spun off in 1987 after its merger with RCA) in the process. Westwood One was spun off in 2007 and merged into Dial Global in 2011, with the new company taking on the Westwood One name. Today, CBS maintains separate distribution agreements between Westwood One (for CBS Radio News and its sports play-by-play packages, most notably the NFL and the NCAA) and Cumulus Media (for CBS Sports Radio).|$|E

500|$|Throughout 1974, {{progress}} on Dark Horse was compromised by Harrison's commitment to {{setting up a}} new record label, also called Dark Horse, and his dedication to projects by the label's first signings, Shankar and the English duo Splinter. With expectations high for his North American tour, the first by {{a former member of}} the Beatles, Harrison later referred to the pressure he had imposed on himself that year as [...] "ridiculous". As a further distraction, his return to less ascetic ways post-Vrinadavan was marked by what he termed [...] "a bit of a bender to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the years I'd been married", as Boyd left him in July.|$|E

Bagwell and Riggs walked to the ring shortly after Bischoff's statement, with Bagwell looking to join and Riggs trying {{to talk him out of}} it. Bagwell decided to join the nWo, turning on Riggs and dissolving the team in the process. In a scripted interview, Bagwell stated, [...] "Who needs Riggs anymore when I have the nWo?!" [...] He also later stated that the team's lack of success after their first title reign was the fault of Riggs' ineptitude, stating [...] "I couldn't make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> his weaknesses." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{the first two}} months of the season with the Browns, where he went 24 record in 11 games, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians on June 15, 1948, who added pitcher Bill Kennedy to go with their original offer of $100,000, a move which Bill Veeck called [...] "a case of begging for him on our knees." [...] For the Indians, he served both as a relief pitcher and a fifth starting pitcher as he did with the Browns. On August 18, he faced his former team, and threw a complete game shutout, defeating the Browns, 30. A month later, he won two back-to-back games against the Detroit Tigers, both in extra innings. During his time with the Indians, he went 9-6 with a 2.81 ERA in 23 games, 12 of them starts. He was on the Indians roster for the 1948 World Series and warmed <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> six games in the Indians' bullpen, but was never called upon to pitch; he was one of two on the roster who did not see any action in the World Series.|$|E

500|$|Beyond Han's sculptures which embrace organic forms, she {{has also}} {{designed}} geometric pieces. Four Dimensions (1993) {{was made up of}} ten geometrical structures, including single objects (such as Tetrahedron–Tetrahedron Interpenetration) and opened-up planes (Cubic Triangle) connected with each other through the use of angles, and light and shadow. Han said: [...] "My works are based on the concept of mathematical logic. The idea is to show how each step is based on the previous one so that the geometrical forms progress in logical sequence ... The fourth dimension is abstract. It cannot be seen or touched. It contains the feelings and talents of Mankind. We wish to possess this space and to open it <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> people to share." [...] Sabapathy was somewhat critical of these works, saying that they dealt only with techniques and fabrication and did not [...] "disclose fresh insights into space and its articulation". He expressed the hope that Han would stay the course and deepen her investigation beyond form into an exploration of light, colour and materials to [...] "create environments in which form, space and time can be seen to be related in ever-changing yet intelligent systems".|$|E

Stewie comes to collect, but Brian laughs him off and tells him he will have the money in 24 hours. After 24 hours, Stewie asks for the money owed, but Brian {{says he does not}} have it and to give him until next Friday. Stewie reveals that he is serious about {{settling}} the bet and, on two occasions, brutally beats up Brian (using such means as a golf club, shooting him in both knees with a pistol, and a flamethrower) to coerce him into paying up. Eventually, Brian agrees to pay off the bet. After Stewie's bet is satisfied, he offers Brian an opportunity to get one [...] "free revenge shot" [...] to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the torture he caused. Brian accepts the offer, but leaves Stewie in suspense as to when the free hit will be delivered, until Stewie is overcome with paranoia and starts beating himself up in an attempt to satisfy Brian. After biding his time and making Stewie worry about what could happen, Brian—while the Griffins are in London, leaving the Patriots-Silly Nannies game—nonchalantly shoves Stewie in front of a moving bus.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{posted a}} number of reviews on its website. Julia Reaside deemed the series a [...] "perfectly cast remake of Swedish-Danish crime hit", and stated that [...] "this {{confirms}} Dillane {{as one of our}} very finest. Such control. Poésy is beautifully chilly, and Joseph Mawle (another cracker) leads an asylum-seeker subplot. It's also really funny." [...] Writing about the finale, Reaside said of Dillane's performance: [...] "If this were on a terrestrial channel, he'd be <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the awards." [...] On the Karl–Elise partnership, she stated: [...] "I wasn't sure about them as a pairing but was immediately convinced by their uncomfortable chemistry." [...] Having not enjoyed The Bridge, Andrew Anthony called The Tunnel an [...] "attractive proposition", adding that [...] "there's an engaging confidence to the slow revelation of the story. All in all, this looks good." [...] Sam Wollaston was more critical of the series, stating that, while the tone was [...] "atmospheric, intriguing, gripping" [...] and there were strong performances from the lead cast members, The Tunnel was [...] "exactly the same as the (recent) original". [...] Wollaston felt that the only [...] "obvious" [...] difference was that, in the original series, there [...] "was a bridge, this is a tunnel. However magnificent an engineering feat the Channel tunnel is, it can't compete as a spectacular location with the Øresund Bridge." ...|$|E
