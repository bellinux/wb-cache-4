25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something going on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E
500|$|As a music critic, Cardus's romantic, instinctive {{approach}} {{was the opposite}} of Newman's objective school of musical criticism. Initially in awe of Newman's reputation, Cardus soon discovered his own independent, more subjective voice. A fellow critic wrote that Newman [...] "probed into Music's vitals, put her head under deep X-ray and analysed cell-tissue. Cardus laid his head against her bosom {{and listened to the}} beating of her heart." [...] Despite their different approaches, the two writers held each other in considerable regard; at times, Newman's own prose showed the influence of Cardus's style. Among leading musicians who have paid tribute to Cardus, Yehudi Menuhin wrote that he [...] "reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an understanding of the heart {{as well as of the}} mind... in Neville Cardus, the artist has an ally". Colin Davis highlighted [...] "the quality and verve of Cardus's writing", which had made him a household name.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{steadily}} improved {{during their}} time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time. McCartney recalled, [...] "We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us. The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would {{come in from the}} Top Ten (the big club where we aspired to go) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [...] would hang around to watch us. ‘What'd I Say’ was always the one that really got them." [...] The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, [...] "We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no group in Liverpool to touch us." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Solidarity {{had been}} {{transforming}} itself from a trade union into a social movement or more specifically, a revolutionary movement. Over the 500 {{days following the}} Gdańsk Agreement, 9–10 million workers, intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations, such as the Independent Student Union (Niezależne Zrzeszenie Studentów, created in September 1980), the Independent Farmers' Trade Union (NSZZ Rolników Indywidualnych [...] "Solidarność" [...] or Rural Solidarity, created in May 1981) and the Independent Craftsmen's Trade Union. It {{was the only time}} in recorded history that a quarter of a country's population (some 80% of the total Polish work force) had voluntarily joined a single organization. [...] "History has taught <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no bread without freedom," [...] the Solidarity program stated a year later. [...] "What we had in mind was not only bread, butter and sausages, but also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom of convictions, and the repair of the republic." [...] Tygodnik Solidarność, a Solidarity-published newspaper, was started in April 1981.|$|E
500|$|The song earned {{mixed reviews}} from critics. A staff of Tourdates.co.uk gave a {{favorable}} review commending Ribbons' vocal display. The reviewer added [...] " [...] often we are bombarded with wannabes [...] with weak vocals and insipid songs, [...] shows <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> life after pop idol and with 'a little bit' of cred." [...] Music Week also gave a positive review, noting {{the song was}} [...] "catchy". However, Ian Hyland, writing for the Sunday Mirror was critical of the song, giving it a grade of 6 out of 10. He remarked that Ribbons [...] "fails" [...] at doing [...] "sexy R'n'B". Similarly, Julie MacCaskill of the Daily Record dismissed it as [...] "a lacklustre affair with the wannabe star ditching her Mariah sound- a-like singing in favour of becoming a Kylie clone". The single debuted at number nineteen on the UK Singles Chart, the week dated January 25, 2003. The position became its peak position. The following week, the song dropped to number thirty-seven and the week after exited the top forty.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} hours of the event, [...] the Foreign Minister of Ivory Coast (the host country of ECOWAS) Daniel Kablan Duncan said that the [...] "information {{indicates}} to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a coup underway. ECOWAS formally and rigorously condemns such an attempted coup d'etat," [...] he added that [...] "it's sad that after the example of Senegal, where the elections finished so well, that we have, after Mali, a new forceful intervention in Guinea-Bissau. What I can say at this moment is that...the situation won't be accepted by ECOWAS." [...] ECOWAS Commission President Kadré Désiré Ouedraogo issued a statement that read: [...] "The commission firmly denounces this latest incursion by the military into politics and unreservedly condemns the irresponsible act, which has once more demonstrated their penchant to maintain Guinea-Bissau as a failed state." [...] ECOWAS later decided to send a contingent of military personnel in order to provide security. The delegation, which would also include civilians, would be led by Guinean President Alpha Condé. ECOWAS also said the election runoff should go ahead. ECOWAS constitutes a contact group, chaired by Nigeria and comprising delegations from Benin, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal and Togo, to coordinate its efforts at resolving the crisis. ECOWAS also had a stanby force to fill a vacuum that could be left by the departing MISSANG force, as well as considering International Criminal Court recommendations.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "The Message", {{featuring}} a male lead vocalist, parodies {{the words of}} the traditional song [...] "Dem Bones" [...] to link Google to [...] "the government". Kitty Empire wrote in The Observer that these conspiratorial government connections to Google and the thoughts of Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova, the Russian teenager who bombed Moscow's tube system in revenge for the death of her husband, were inner-world issues pondered in [...] "Lovalot" [...] with [...] "a mixture of nonsense rhyme, militant posturing and pop-cultural free-flow; her London glottal stop mischievously turns 'I love a lot' into 'I love Allah'". Ann Powers in the Los Angeles Times said that [...] "M.I.A. turns a call to action into a scared girl's nervous tic. Synths click out a jittery, jagged background. The song doesn't justify anything, but it reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a person behind every lit fuse". Powers also commented on how [...] "Born Free" [...] mixed the boasting style often found in hip hop music with lines depicting the lives of those enduring poverty and persecution. [...] "Illygirl", a track found only on the deluxe edition of the album, is written {{from the point of view}} of an abused but tough teenager, whom critic Robert Christgau said could be the [...] "kid-sister-in-metaphor" [...] of the swaggering persona adopted by M.I.A. on the track [...] "Steppin Up".|$|E
500|$|In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I thought I had {{the idea}} broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out". Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people, because a movie like that would be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} August 15 CIA analysts, despite their overall skeptical {{conclusions}} had noted, “Sightings of UFO's reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, {{at a time}} when the background radiation count had risen inexplicably.

At this time, the reports of incidents convince <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something going on that must have immediate attention. The details of some of these incidents have been discussed by AD/SI with DDCI.

2500|$|On {{the subject}} of suicide, Hauerwas {{challenges}} the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does {{not agree with the}} notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term [...] "rational suicide" [...] {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose. Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are not ours, and as such, reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may be times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that should be enough to sustain our commitment to living.|$|E
2500|$|The CIA {{started their}} own {{internal}} scientific review the following day. Some CIA scientists were also seriously considering the ETH. An early memo from August was very skeptical, but also added, [...] "...as {{long as a}} series of reports remains 'unexplainable' (interplanetary aspects and alien origin not being thoroughly excluded from consideration) caution requires that intelligence continue coverage of the subject." [...] A report from later that month was similarly skeptical but nevertheless concluded [...] "...sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, {{at a time when the}} background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even 'blue yonder' explanations that might be tenable, and we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers." [...] A December 1952 memo from the Assistant CIA Director of Scientific Intelligence (O/SI) was much more urgent: [...] "...the reports of incidents convince <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something going on that must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of U.S. defense installation are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles."

[...] Flew stated that [...] "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" [...] and that [...] "the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, which ever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, [...] "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with [...] "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created [...] "a lot of" [...] evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.|$|E
