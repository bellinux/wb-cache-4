5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the <b>United</b> <b>States)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E

5|$|Menominee Tribe v. <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{landmark}} case in Native American law, {{primarily in}} the area of reserved tribal rights.

5|$|The American Dream, or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, {{plays a key role}} in attracting immigrants.
