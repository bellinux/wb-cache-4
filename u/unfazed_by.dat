5|$|In September 2009, Vancouver re-signed Luongo to a 12-year extension. As such, it {{was widely}} speculated that Schneider would inevitably be traded. Despite his success in the AHL, his chances of {{competing}} for a starting position with the Canucks were seen as unlikely by the media due to Luongo's prominence on the team. Regardless, he publicly maintained he was <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> {{his position on the}} Canucks' depth chart and that he was focused on competing with the newly acquired Andrew Raycroft for the Canucks' backup position in 2009–10. Schneider was, however, sent back to the Moose out of training camp.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} and years after the typhoon, natives in Ulithi were {{examined}} for increased levels of stress. Unexpectedly, {{only a handful of}} people reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, with the majority seemingly <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> Ophelia. There was some talk among residents of leaving Ulithi and moving to nearby islands such as Yap, Palau, Saipan, or even the Philippines; however, mentions of this diminished relatively quickly. The devastation to the island's infrastructure hastened a previously gradual change in buildings. Reconstruction efforts had entirely abandoned traditional Ulithi building styles in favor of more modern ones. The survival of concrete buildings prompted an overall desire among people to construct all buildings with concrete. Alongside the infrastructural overhaul, a shift in dietary changes to a more western style occurred.|$|E

Pecos comes searching for him again, and finds him sitting on a chair wearing a knight's helmet and holding a book and a lit cigar. Tom dumps some cigar ash onto Pecos's head, but an <b>unfazed</b> Pecos responds <b>by</b> flipping the chair over and removing another whisker. Adamant not to lose the two leftover whiskers, Tom dashes into a nearby closet and slams the door shut. Pecos then invites Jerry {{to listen to the}} song he's going to play for his encore, which he plays at first with no problems. This causes Tom to calm down a little and he steps out of his hiding place. But just as he is liking the music that Pecos is generating, the snap of yet another string is heard, causing Tom to instantaneously gasp and retreat back into the closet.|$|R
50|$|Unruly Practices: Power, Discourse, and Gender in Contemporary Social Theory is a {{collection}} of essays written between 1980 and 1989. The book examines the theories of power and source in Foucault, the politics of French deconstruction and Richard Rorty, the politics of gender in Habermas, and the politics of need interpretation in two concluding essays which delineate her own position within contemporary socialist-feminist critical theory. Contemporaries such as Douglas Kellner have praised Fraser’s writings as “seasoned with social hope” and effectively synthesizing feminist commitment to political agency and social progress with several forms of modern and postmodern social skepticism. However, others have criticized her goal of providing “the sort of big diagnostic picture necessary to orient current political practice” of socialist feminism for being both too ambitious and ultimately too narrow. Patricia S. Mann, for example, summarizes the pitfalls of the text as follows:I wish Fraser had made more of an effort to call upon the resources of analytic philosophy. It is true that analytic philosophers look {{all the way back to}} Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham for their paradigms of analytic philosophy. <b>Unfazed</b> because untouched <b>by</b> these notions of social constitution of individuals, or by the irrationalities of individual thought, philosophy offers an outmoded yet still seaworthy vessel for any seeking to ride out the storms of postmodern disillusionment with notions of agency and process. Had Fraser utilized the works of analytic political thinkers when she finally came to formulate her socialist-feminist theory of the welfare state she could have exploited the admittedly “thin” theories of political agency and political rights within political philosophy today.|$|R
5|$|Burnet {{continued}} {{to travel and}} speak, {{but in the early}} 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for colorectal cancer. He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at Port Fairy after two months of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at Tower Hill cemetery, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the House of Representatives; Prime Minister Bob Hawke took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, Fenix and Raynor remain {{behind as}} a rear guard when the Protoss {{evacuate}} the now Zerg-overrun Aiur through a warp gate. They hold it until attacked by United Earth Directorate forces pursuing Arcturus Mengsk, upon which they escape through the gate, disabling {{it as they}} depart. With Raynor and Mengsk, Fenix enters into an alliance with Sarah Kerrigan against the UED, even leading the Zerg forces on a raiding mission for resources on Moria. However, after the UED is routed from their position on the Dominion capital world of Korhal, Kerrigan turns on her allies. Though <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> Kerrigan's betrayal, Fenix is slain when Kerrigan's Zerg launch a surprise attack against his base camp on Korhal. In StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, Raynor shows that he still harbors a grudge against Kerrigan for Fenix's death after seeing her willingly become infested again after all his hard work in returning her to human form.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese had defended {{strongly}} {{in order to}} allow an orderly evacuation of personnel and stores, and with the Australians unable to concentrate sufficient combat power rapidly enough to ensure a decisive result, they were largely able to achieve this objective. <b>Unfazed</b> <b>by</b> the loss of their base-camps, the bulk of the communist force remained intact and later carried out a highly successful ambush by 274 VC Main Force Regiment on 12 June. Seven Australians were killed and three wounded from the HQ 1 ATF Defence and Employment Platoon in this subsequent action, with the bulk of the casualties occurring when an RPG-7 exploded on a box of M18A1 Claymores sitting atop an M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier, igniting them with catastrophic consequences. Operations in Long Khanh continued however, and the Australians established a number of ambushes on possible withdrawal routes, although little contact subsequently occurred.|$|E
5000|$|Though Yuki {{was created}} three years ago, by the {{calendar}} in Kyon's time-space plane, {{she is in}} fact about 1,319 years old, {{taking into account the}} time she has spent outside of Haruhi's universe. [...] As an artificial human, she has numerous paranormal abilities. She is capable of manipulating the properties of the environment and any materials within it at any scale to her desire, referred to as [...] "bogus magic" [...] by Kyon. For instance, she can modify the [...] "elemental boost information" [...] of a baseball bat to hit only home runs, nullify data links (removing other artificial interface connections from their bodies), plus she is able to make a cover-up story (since Ryoko was gone, she made a cover-up story that she moved to Canada), and reconstruct a classroom, down to the last detail, after everything in it was completely destroyed. As a result, she is capable of feats of superhuman strength, agility, and stamina. In one instance, she was <b>unfazed</b> while impaled <b>by</b> multiple metal spikes, and effortlessly reconstructed her body afterwards. Her state also affords her an extreme level of intelligence. She can comprehend the rules and concepts of a game instantaneously, as well as create flawless strategies based on her observations, and was able to learn how to play a guitar mere moments after picking one up. She has also been able to [...] "borrow" [...] Haruhi's powers, as reported in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. However, she has been seen to be fallible, such as when she reconstructed the devastated classroom but forgot to reconstruct her broken glasses. Yuki also has a lack of understanding towards social norms and earth technology, as demonstrated by her bluntly literal future predictions and her clumsy attempts at using a computer mouse. However, it can be construed that the mouse incident came from her watching Kyon hold the mouse away from Mikuru. This is likely due to her self-imposed state of near-total isolation in order to interfere with as little of the environment around Haruhi as possible.|$|R
5|$|In the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again {{employed}} Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon {{to catch}} balls fended {{off by the}} batsman, {{in an attempt to}} curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. McCabe came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence if he was hit, McCabe took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. McCabe hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, McCabe and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. McCabe reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive hooking of short-pitched deliveries in front of his face, <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.|$|E

While Liang Mao passed by Liaodong en route to Lelang, Gongsun Du detained him in Liaodong and refused {{to let him go}} to Lelang.

25|$|For {{over two}} decades, Jessie Wallace Hughan was a {{candidate}} for public office on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America. Her first foray into politics came in a 1915 bid for Alderman in 1915. It was perhaps the only race in which she ran {{in which she had}} a measurable chance of winning. Hughan ran for office not so much intending to win, but rather as a means of advancing socialist ideas to a broader public and to put pressure on elected officials to co-opt and implement ideas from the Socialist Party's political platform. Hughan therefore was <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> electoral defeat, instead running for a steadily escalating series of political offices.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common breeds used in Russia is the German Shepherd. This is mainly because these dogs are adapted to the climate of the country. Attack dogs have been used for a long time, off and on for foot patrolling. These dogs are kept on a leash at all times and are {{required}} to wear a muzzle unless the dog is needed to pursue and detain a suspect. These dogs must remain calm, docile, and <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> crowds or noise. Russian Police Dogs may react to any and all stimuli only if they are ordered to do so by their handler. They are a common sight in the public and are often unnerving to the public. German shepherds are also used for tasks such as seeking dangerous fugitives, tracking, and were ultimately chosen as the all-purpose police and army breed. This has remained common in most Soviet Union Successor States.|$|E
25|$|Time is {{a natural}} force from which {{none of us is}} immune. This theme pervades the sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume {{everyone}} in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home on the day of his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths {{in the context of the}} play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you regardless of your ambitions or future plans; it does not take you into consideration. Obviously, Caesar would not have gone to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.|$|E
25|$|Kentucky {{opened the}} SEC {{portion of their}} {{schedule}} on January 6 at home against Ole Miss. After looking dominant in November and December, the Cats {{were taken to the}} wire by the Rebels. UK needed overtime to outlast Ole Miss 89 to 86. <b>Unfazed</b> <b>by</b> trailing Kentucky 12 to 0 and 18 to 5, Ole Miss' Emmanuel Moody helped the Rebels regroup to mount runs of 10 to 0 and 7 to 0 to get within 23 to 22 before eventually taking a 30 to 26 lead with 7:01 left in the half. The Rebels led 38 to 36 at the break behind 50 percent shooting before Kentucky opened the second half with a spurt that put them by as many as six before Mississippi battled back. Wildcats guard Aaron Harrison thwarted the Rebels' quest by scoring 26 points, including two big free throws with 1:29 remaining in overtime to put Kentucky ahead to stay. After the scare Ole Miss put into Kentucky, they rebounded on January 10 at Texas A behind Booker's 18 points to a 70 to 64 victory in double-overtime. The Aggies rallied in the final minutes to tie it in regulation. Lyles made two foul shots with six seconds left in the first overtime for Kentucky, and Texas A took its time before missing a long 3 at the buzzer. Down 66 to 63, Texas A's Kourtney Roberson made one of two free throws before a turnover by Lyles gave the Aggies the ball back with 26.9 seconds left. A's Danuel House missed a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left and Kentucky's Johnson made two free throws to seal the game. Kentucky returned home on January 13 to defeat Missouri 86 to 37. Aaron Harrison scored 16 points including five 3-pointers to lift Kentucky to their first SEC win in regulation. Cauley-Stein added 13 points and Towns 12 points with 10 rebounds as Kentucky shot 48 percent from the field. The Wildcats also held Missouri to a season-low 27 percent and outrebounded the Tigers 46 to 27 including 30 defensive boards.|$|E

Lawyers in the United States then told Salah that even if a small portion of Israeli territory was associated with a QIZ, the proposal might materialize.

500|$|Tim McInnerny, who had {{starred in}} The Black Adder and Blackadder II as Lord Percy Percy, {{was afraid to}} be typecast in comedic roles and decided not {{to appear in the}} third {{instalment}} of Blackadder, though he did appear in the episode [...] "Nob and Nobility", as Lord Topper, a snobby aristocrat who claims to be The Scarlet Pimpernel, and returned in the fourth series playing Captain Kevin Darling. The Prince George character was created as a new [...] "incompetent sidekick" [...] for the title character. He was modelled after George IV of the United Kingdom, who served as Prince Regent between 1811 and 1820. Laurie had previously guest starred in the final two episodes of Blackadder II, and the producers decided to cast him in the role of Prince George. Laurie's physical appearance differed significantly from George IV's appearance, who was obese during the time of his regency. Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis were <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> this, referring to George as [...] "a fat, flatulent [...] ", an appropriate description for the real Prince rather than Laurie.|$|E
500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. <b>Unfazed</b> <b>by</b> detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band.

500|$|In late December 1964, Thảo {{was summoned}} back to Saigon by Khánh, who {{correctly}} suspected him and Khiêm of plotting together in Washington. Thảo believed Khánh {{was attempting to}} have him killed, so he went underground upon returning to Saigon, and began plotting in earnest, <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> {{the prospect of being}} charged for desertion. The ruling junta appealed to Thảo in newspaper advertisements and broadcasts to follow orders to report, but he ignored them. Due to his Catholicism, Thảo was able to recruit Diệm loyalists such as Phát. In mid-January 1965, the regime called for him to report to his superiors in the ARVN, warning that he would be [...] "considered guilty of abandoning his post with all the consequences of such a situation" [...] if he failed to do so. At this time, it was still not known that Thảo was a communist agent who was deliberately trying to cause infighting within South Vietnam at every opportunity. With Khánh's hold on power shaky, an anonymous source said Thảo was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: [...] "Thảo acted first, out of fear that if he did not, the other generals would overthrow Khánh and get rid of him as well. He knew that if the others overthrew Khánh his fate would be worse than Khánh's." [...] During this time, Thảo kept in touch with elements of the CIA in an attempt to get American backing.|$|E
500|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} intended for Kakashi to {{debut in the}} second chapter of the Naruto manga, appearing prior to {{the other members of}} Team 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite [...] "de gozaru" [...] in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7. Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified. Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not sure what the character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Gosling {{appeared}} as a disturbed young art student in Stay, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that Gosling [...] "like his fans, deserves better." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "capable" [...] McGregor and Gosling [...] "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before". The film grossed $8 million worldwide. Gosling was <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> the negative reaction: [...] "I had a kid {{come up to me}} on the street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if someone says, 'Hey, you made me sick in that movie,' as if they say I made them cry.” Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage." [...] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and declared that [...] "nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance". Roger Ebert felt the performance [...] "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award.

500|$|Later in the tournament, on 18 June 2012, Mario Balotelli scored {{his first}} goal {{in a major}} {{international}} tournament in a 2–0 victory against the Republic of Ireland. When he attempted to celebrate this goal, he was immediately halted by teammate Leonardo Bonucci, who covered Balotelli's mouth with his hand for fear that the striker would say something to [...] "get in trouble." [...] Balotelli had been dropped to the bench by Cesare Prandelli prior to the game due to his lack of ability shown in his previous group games, so when he was subbed on against Ireland fans didn't expect him to {{have much of an}} impact, and his celebration of his goal may have originally been directed towards the naysayers who believe he is bad for the team. Balotelli went on to start against England in the quarter-finals, his performance was described as wasteful but his effort was rated highly in a game where he missed multiple chances. He scored the first penalty taken in the shootout against his Manchester City teammate Joe Hart. On 28 June, Balotelli scored twice within the first 40 minutes in Italy's semi-final clash with Germany, as the Azzurri won 2–1 and progressed to the Euro 2012 final against European and World champions Spain. After scoring the second goal in that semi-final, he ripped off his shirt and stood motionless as he flexed his muscles, developing a famous celebration. Going into the final Balotelli said that, Manchester City's title success meant that failure in the Euros would not signal a personal failure this season.

500|$|Many critics {{praised the}} game's {{colourful}} visuals and special effects. Chris Scullion from the Official Nintendo Magazine thought the game design {{had all the}} speed and charm of the original, and enjoyed its [...] "lush" [...] atmosphere and landscapes. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot also appreciated the game's artistic design, visual [...] "dreaminess" [...] and elegance, and Gerald Villoria of GameSpy liked the game's colourful and vibrant levels. Nintendo Life's Anthony Dickens praised the general visual style of the game, noting that its boss battles in particular [...] "ooze" [...] with bright and exotic colours. Despite the general praise of the game's colourful palette, some critics viewed the aesthetics unfavourably. GameZone's Louis Bedigan felt that Nights: Journey of Dreams lacked the [...] "eye-popping effects" [...] of other contemporaries such as Super Mario Galaxy (2007) and Twilight Princess (2006), and Dickens opined that the game's cutscenes were more akin to PlayStation 2 titles. Tom Bramwell from Eurogamer felt that the environments {{looked like they were}} from 1996, despite the attempts made to distract the player from the game's simple premise. Paul Govan of GamesTM found that the game engine struggled to match the cutscene's visual fluidity with its actual gameplay, and expressed disappointment that Wii owners would be <b>unfazed</b> <b>by</b> its graphical prowess, unlike Sega Saturn owners {{at the time of the}} original Nights into Dreams release. Dickens thought the game was graphically rushed by Sega, and speculated that it was [...] "cobbled together quickly" [...] by artists who had focused too much on designing the game's introduction sequence. Adam Rosenberg from UGO Networks found the graphics to be a disappointment, saying that its environments were [...] "drab" [...] considering it was based on the dreams of twelve-year-old children, and also noticed frame rate issues. Likewise, two reviewers from Electronic Gaming Monthly, Shane Bettenhausen and Sam Kennedy, thought the 3D was [...] "amateurish" [...] and suffered from basic issues including uneven graphics and unskippable cutscenes.|$|E
