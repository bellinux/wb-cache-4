If ye {{had asked me}} {{the way to the}} door of James Stewart on any other day but this, I would have set ye right and bidden ye God speed. But to-day--eh, Mungo?" [...] And he turned again to look at the lawyer.|$|E

6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said he, [...] "if {{these gentlemen}} be <b>unfriends</b> <b>to</b> Sir Daniel, it is a pity, indeed, {{we should have}} been at blows with them; but it were tenfold greater that either they or we should linger here. The watchers in the house--unless they be all dead or deaf--have heard our {{hammering}} this quarter-hour agone; instantly they will have signalled to the town; and unless we be the livelier in our departure, we are like to be taken, both of us, by a fresh foe." ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps the Earl's younger brother--who {{was himself}} {{somewhat}} a soldier of fortune, having fought in Spain, France, and Germany--felt a certain kinship in spirit with the adventurous youngster {{who had his}} <b>unfriended</b> way <b>to</b> make in the world. However that might have been, Lord George was very kind and friendly to the lad, and the willing service that Myles rendered him reconciled him not {{a little to the}} Earl's obvious neglect.|$|R
60|$|The {{condition}} of her orphan children was peculiarly desolate. Her own {{father had been}} an emigrant from {{another part of the}} country, and had died long since: they had no one relation to take them by the hand; they were outcasts, paupers, <b>unfriended</b> beings, <b>to</b> whom the most scanty pittance was a matter of favour, and who were treated merely as children of peasants, yet poorer than the poorest, who, dying, had left them, a thankless bequest, to the close-handed charity of the land.|$|R
60|$|His wife made {{no attempt}} to renew their talk before March went to his {{business}} in the morning, and they parted in dry offence. Their experience was that these things always came right of themselves at last, and they usually let them. He knew that she had really tried to consent to a thing that was repugnant to her, and in his heart he gave her more credit for the effort than he had allowed her openly. She knew that she had made it with the reservation he accused her of, and that he had a right to feel sore at what she could not help. But he left her to brood over his ingratitude, and she suffered him to go heavy and <b>unfriended</b> <b>to</b> meet the chances of the day. He said to himself that if she had assented cordially to the conditions of Fulkerson's offer, he would have had the courage to take all the other risks himself, and would have had the satisfaction of resigning his place. As it was, he must wait till he was removed; and he figured with bitter pleasure the pain she would feel when he came home some day and told her he had been supplanted, after {{it was too late to}} close with Fulkerson.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{professor}} of psychology Susan Krauss Whitbourne, although Facebook has an upside of friending people, {{there is also the}} downside of having someone unfriend or reject another person. Whitbourne refers <b>to</b> <b>unfriended</b> persons on Facebook as victims of [...] Unfriending someone is seldom a mutual decision and the person often does not know he has been unfriended.|$|R
50|$|Unfriended {{initially}} had {{its world}} premiere on July 20, 2014 at the Fantasia Festival and screened {{on the film}} festival circuit under the title of Cybernatural. A generally positive film festival reception and test screenings for the film prompted Universal Pictures {{to pick up the}} film rights with the intent to give it a wide theatrical release the following year. The film's title was changed from Cybernatural <b>to</b> <b>Unfriended</b> and the film was theatrically released on April 17, 2015. The film was screened at Playlist Live on February 6, 2015 and premiered at SXSW on March 13, 2015.|$|R
40|$|Privacy and {{security}} are major concerns for many users of social media. When users share information (e. g., data and photos) with friends, {{they can make}} their friends vulnerable to security and privacy breach with dire consequences. In our recent work, we show that it is feasible to measure user vulnerability and reduce one’s vulnerability without changing {{the structure of a}} social networking site. The approach is <b>to</b> <b>unfriend</b> one’s most vulnerable friends. However, when such a vulnerable friend is also socially important, unfriending him would significantly reduce one’s own social status. In this work, we address the problem of vulnerability minimization with social utility constraints. We formally formulate the optimization problem, propose an approximation algorithm with a proven bound, and conduct empirical experiments with different forms of social utility on a large-scale Facebook dataset for performance evaluation and comparison...|$|R
60|$|The poor {{helpless}} chickens {{had gone}} {{one by one}} to their doom, so it was meet that their destroyer should come to a violent end; yet Octavian felt some qualms when {{his share of the}} violence was ended. The little cat, headed off from its wonted tracks of safety, had raced <b>unfriended</b> from shelter <b>to</b> shelter, and its end had been rather piteous. Octavian walked through the long grass of the meadow with a step less jaunty than usual. And as he passed beneath the shadow of the high blank wall he glanced up and became aware that his hunting had had undesired witnesses. Three white set faces were looking down at him, and if ever an artist wanted a threefold study of cold human hate, impotent yet unyielding, raging yet masked in stillness, he would have found it in the triple gaze that met Octavian’s eye.|$|R
40|$|With over 750 million active users, Facebook is {{the most}} famous social {{networking}} website. One particular aspect of Facebook widely discussed in the news and heavily researched in academic circles is the privacy of its users. In this paper we introduce a zero day privacy loophole in Facebook. We call this the deactivated friend attack. The concept of the attack {{is very similar to}} cloaking in Star Trek while its seriousness could be estimated from the fact that once the attacker is a friend of the victim, it is highly probable the attacker has indefinite access to the victims private information in a cloaked way. We demonstrate the impact of the attack by showing the ease of gaining trust of Facebook users and being befriended online. With targeted friend requests we were able to add over 4300 users and maintain access to their Facebook profile information for at least 261 days. No user was able <b>to</b> <b>unfriend</b> us during this time due to cloaking and short de-cloaking sessions. The short de-cloaking sessions were enough to get updates about the victims. We also provide several solutions for the loophole, which range from mitigation to a permanent solutionComment: Full paper is presented at IEEE International Workshop on Security and Social Networking SESOC 2012, Lugano, Switzerlan...|$|R
