The present study hypothesized that 'substance <b>use</b> capital', i. e. resources favourable to substance <b>use,</b> is a risk factor for substance <b>use</b> and misuse. We <b>used</b> baseline data from the ongoing Cohort Study on Substance <b>Use</b> Risk Factors (C-SURF) that included a representative sample of young Swiss men (n= 5623). Substance <b>use</b> (alcohol, cannabis, 15  illicit drugs, lifetime <b>use,</b> hazardous <b>use</b> and dependence), substance <b>use</b> capital (parental and peer attitudes towards substance <b>use,</b> parental and peer drug <b>use,</b> perceived norms of substance <b>use)</b> and aspects of social capital (relationships with parents and peers) were assessed. Logistic regressions were <b>used</b> to examine the associations between substance-related resources and social resources, and substance <b>use.</b> Results showed that substance-related resources were associated with an increased risk of substance <b>use</b> (OR between 1. 25 and 4. 67), whereas social resources' associations with substance <b>use</b> were commonly protective but weaker than substance-related resources. Thus, a drug-friendly environment facilitated substance <b>use</b> and misuse. Moreover, the results showed that peer environments were more drug-friendly than familial environments. In conclusion, this study highlighted a concept of 'substance <b>use</b> capital', which may be useful for advancing both theoretical and applied knowledge of substance <b>use.</b> Indeed, substance <b>use</b> is not only associated with a lack of social resources, but also with specific drug-friendly social resources coming from environment and background...|$|R
