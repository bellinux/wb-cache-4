RPGamer's Mike Moehnke felt the additional dialogue unnecessary, as the story's complexity had not noticeably increased over the original version. He also positively noted how the Avatar was incorporated into the story, with the added chapters revolving around them making them [...] "far more than a throwaway". 4Gamer.net's Kojiro Nishioka likewise praised {{the inclusion of the}} BS Fire Emblem chapters and the new prologue and side chapters, but felt that those who had not played Shadow Dragon would be unable to <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the characters.|$|E

Though platooning survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.|$|E

He argues that because of technological advances, most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits which he calls [...] "surrogate activities", wherein people strive towards artificial goals. Examples he gives of surrogate activities include scientific work, consumption of entertainment and following sports teams. He predicts that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted {{to meet the needs}} of the social systems, rather than vice versa.

[...] While pondering the generally negative reactions to the book Joyce said: I can't <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> my critics, like Pound or Miss Weaver, for instance.

In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain."

2500|$|Blizzard {{provides}} regular bug fixes, updates, and expansions for Hearthstone. Hamilton Chu, {{the executive}} producer for Hearthstone, stated that Blizzard intends to support the game for ten to twenty years, similar to Blizzard's other titles, though they have no long-term plan of how they would continue to introduce cards. The principle means that additional cards have been introduced to the game are through either themed Expansions or Adventures. Expansions are new card sets, containing between 100-200 new cards, that become available to buy or win, as well introducing new mechanics to the gameplay. Adventures feature smaller number of cards, between 20-45, {{which can only be}} earned by completing multiple tiers of story-based challenges and boss fights in single player mode. Blizzard had originally envisioned to release Expansions in a staged approach as to not drastically jar the player community, creating the Adventure concept for the first post-release addition with Curse of Naxxramas. By the meta-game remained unpredictable both during and for several months, helping to keep the playing community interested in the game and validating their approaches. The solo challenges on Adventure mode also served as a means to help players <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the stronger archetypes of card decks and learn strategies to defeat them, helping them become better players against human opponents. Going forward in 2017 in the [...] "Year of the Mammoth", future expansions will principally be around the new cards sets, forgoing Adventures. Blizzard recognized that players do enjoy the single-player narrative events and will work in quests and missions around the new card sets for those players.|$|E
