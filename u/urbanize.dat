5|$|NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) was {{established}} in the area in 1963. That and the explosive growth of neighboring Houston in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s, caused the remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore to <b>urbanize.</b> The Clear Lake City community was created by the Friendswood Development Company, a venture of Humble Oil and Dell E. Webb Corporation, to support residential growth near the new NASA facility. The communities around Clear Lake rapidly reoriented toward aerospace related industries, and the region's economy diversified further. Urban development spread solidly between Houston and the Bay Area communities. Houston formally annexed most of Clear Lake City in 1977 with Pasadena annexing most of the rest. Most of the other communities around the bay, however, had already incorporated, or incorporated soon afterward, and thus were independent of the metropolis. Texas State Historical Association.|$|E

40|$|Aim Despite the {{increasing}} pace of urbanization, {{little is known}} about how this process affects biodiversity globally. We investigate macroecological patterns of bird assemblages in <b>urbanized</b> areas relative to semi-natural ecosystems. Location World-wide. Methods We use a database of quantitative bird surveys to compare key assemblage structure parameters for plots in <b>urbanized</b> and semi-natural ecosystems controlling for spatial autocorrelation and survey methodology. We use the term 2 ̆ 7 <b>urbanized</b> 2 ̆ 7 instead of 2 ̆ 7 urban 2 ̆ 7 ecosystems as many of the plots were not located in the centre of towns but in remnant habitat patches within conurbations. Results Some macroecological relationships were conserved in <b>urbanized</b> landscapes. Species-area, species-abundance and species-biomass relationships did not differ significantly between <b>urbanized</b> and non-urbanized environments. However, there were differences in the relationships between productivity and assemblage structure. In forests, species richness increased with productivity; in both forests and open habitats, the evenness of species abundances declined as productivity increased. Among <b>urbanized</b> plots, instead, both species richness and the evenness of species abundances were independent of variation in productivity. Main conclusions Remnant habitats within <b>urbanized</b> areas are subject to many ecological alterations, yet key macroecological patterns differ remarkably little in <b>urbanized</b> versus non-urbanized plots. Our results support the need for increased conservation activities in <b>urbanized</b> landscapes, particularly given the additional benefits of local experiences of biodiversity for the human population. With increasing urbanization world-wide, broad-scale efforts are needed to understand and manage the effects of this driver of change on biodiversity...|$|R

Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including use of new fertilizers and new tools. The knowledge and tools gained from the intensive farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914. Even so, farms were small in size, and women did much of the field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on migratory, especially foreign, labor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The World is {{undergoing}} rapid urbanization, with 70 % of the World population expected {{to live in}} urban areas by 2050. Nevertheless, nationally representative analysis of the health differences in the leading causes of avoidable mortality disaggregated by urbanization level is lacking. We undertake a study of temporal trends in mortality rates for deaths considered avoidable by the Concerted Action of the European Community on Avoidable Mortality for four different levels of urbanization in Taiwan between 1971 and 2008. We find that for virtually all causes of death, age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) were lower in more <b>urbanized</b> than less <b>urbanized</b> areas, either throughout the study period, or {{by the end of}} the period despite higher rates in <b>urbanized</b> areas initially.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{assessed}} {{the structure of}} periphyton, benthic macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages and their associations with environmental variables at 17 sites on streams of the highly <b>urbanized</b> Santa Ana River basin in Southern California. All assemblages exhibited strong differences between highly <b>urbanized</b> sites in the valley and the least-impacted sites at the transition between the valley and undeveloped mountains. Results within the <b>urbanized</b> area differed among taxa. Periphyton assemblages were dominated by diatoms (> 75 % of total taxa). Periphyton assemblages within the <b>urbanized</b> area were not associated {{with any of the}} measured environmental variables, suggesting that structure of urban periphyton assemblages might be highly dependent on colonization dynam-ics. The number of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera (EPT) taxa included in macroinvertebrate assemblages ranged from 0 to 6 at <b>urbanized</b> sites. Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages had significant correlations with several environmental variables within the urban area, suggesting that stream size and permanence were important determinants of distribution among the species able to survive conditions in urban streams. Only 4 of 16 fish species collected were native to the drainage. Fish assemblages of <b>urbanized</b> sites included two native species, arroyo chub Gila orcuttii and Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae, at sites that were intermediate in coefficient of variation of bank-full width, depth, bed substrate, and water temperature. Alien species dominated <b>urbanized</b> sites with lesser or greater values for these variables. These results suggest that urban streams can be structured to enhance populations of native fishes. Continued study of urban streams in the Santa Ana River basin and elsewhere will contribute to the basic understanding of ecological principles and help preserve the maximum ecological value of streams in highly <b>urbanized</b> areas...|$|R
