A member of the National Trust, the current owner of Beaumont House, explains how Davenport's travels influenced his styles:Samuel Davenport was a great world traveller. He was very much involved in the world exposition movement. Every two years there were big world expos happening in different cities around the world. And he would travel to every one of these expos...I'm sure that the influences that he picked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> of his travels are reflected here in Beaumont House.|$|E

25|$|The memorial, {{situated}} in Brenchley Gardens, {{was built by}} local construction firm GE Wallis and Sons. It was unveiled by Major General Sir Edmund Leach, colonel of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment at a ceremony on 30 July 1921. The dedication was performed by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lieutenant General Sir Edwin Alderson gave {{an address to the}} crowds.

25|$|Even after Christianity {{had been}} set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, there was {{friction}} between the followers of the Roman rites and the Irish rites, particularly over the date on which Easter fell and the way monks cut their hair. In 664 a conference was held at Whitby Abbey (known as the Whitby Synod) to decide the matter; Saint Wilfrid was an advocate for the Roman rites and Bishop Colmán for the Irish rites. Wilfrid's argument won the day and Colmán and his party returned to Ireland in their bitter disappointment. The Roman rites were adopted by the English church, although they were not universally accepted by the Irish Church.|$|E
25|$|Travel diminished after 1860, as the Civil War caused {{considerable}} disruptions on the trail. Many of {{the people}} on the trail in 1861–1863 were fleeing the war and its attendant drafts in both the south and the north. Trail historian Merrill J. Mattes has estimated the number of emigrants for 1861–1867 given in the total column of the above table. But these estimates may well be low since they only amount to an extra 125,000 people, and the 1870 census shows that over 200,000 additional people (ignoring most of the population increase in California, which had excellent sea and rail connections across Panama by then) showed <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> the states served by the Bozeman, California, Mormon, and Oregon Trail(s) and their offshoots.|$|E

Some areas may put a huge Narakasura dummy made with fireworks. This will be burst by a person dressed as Lord Krishna or, more accurately, a costume of Satyabhama, the consort of Lord Krishna, who actually killed the demon Narakasura; an event that is celebrated as Diwali for generations.

500|$|Carnivàle {{relies on}} other {{religious}} symbols and parallels for its mythology. The National Shrine of the Little Flower, funded by Father Coughlin in the 1930s, was {{an inspiration for}} the temple in Brother Justin's vision in the episode [...] "Los Moscos". This vision foreshadows the world that Justin will potentially build as he comes to power as a radio preacher. The producers planned to use radio towers instead of regular steeples for the temple; the design also incorporated Eastern European domes and Western European cathedrals. In the same vision, the Tattooed Man appears near a tree that resembles the iconic Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and implies that Justin is the Usher. According to Knauf, the Usher represents a [...] "timeless character who shows <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> different cultures", and who is [...] "there to usher in the Armageddon" [...] as [...] "the harbinger of End times".|$|E

500|$|Later in the battle, {{shortly after}} 21:00, München {{and the rest}} of the IV Scouting Group {{encountered}} the British 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron (3rd LCS). Reuter's ships were leading the High Seas Fleet south, away from the deployed Grand Fleet. Due to the long range and poor visibility, only München and [...] were able to engage the British cruisers; München fired 63shells before she had to cease fire, without scoring any hits. She was hit twice in return, however; the first hit caused minimal damage, but the second struck her third funnel. The resulting explosion damaged four of her boilers, making it difficult for her to keep steam <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> of her boilers. Reuter turned his ships hard to starboard, in order to draw the British closer to the capital ships of the German fleet, but the 3rd LCS refused to take the bait and disengaged.|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Adorn yourself, beloved soul). is an orchestral concerto {{with the}} vocal parts embedded, the soprano singing the cantus firmus of the tune by Johann Crüger. The {{movement}} shares the “gentle" [...] key of F major {{with three other}} works from the cycle of chorale cantatas: the first, O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 20, a French overture on the themes such as eternity and confusion; Herr Christ, der einge Gottessohn, BWV 96, a pastorale composed two weeks earlier; and later the last one, Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1, a tone poem using {{the image of the}} morning star. The four movements contrast in character, but have in common that they express [...] "an elusive personal connection". John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, sees the [...] "relaxed 12/8 processional movement" [...] as [...] "perfectly tailored to the idea of the soul dressing itself <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> its wedding finery". Mincham observes subtle aspects of conveying the message, {{such as the use of}} minor mode indicating, the development of the ritornello motif from notes of the first line of the chorale tune, and the significance for not only an individual soul but “for all humanity" [...] by entries of the lower voices in ever-changing sequence.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Paul Bettany was {{the first}} actor to portray two main {{characters}} within the universe, voicing Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Iron Man and Avengers films, and portraying Vision in Avengers films and Captain America: Civil War. Stan Lee, creator or co-creator {{of many of the}} characters seen in the MCU, has cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush. His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War. This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with writer and director James Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU." [...] Feige added that Lee [...] "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films.
