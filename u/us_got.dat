The video shoot had attracted several hundred people, according to a representative for the city's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information. New York City's film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street. Moore had permission to use the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial but did not have a permit to shoot on the sidewalk or the street, nor did he have a loud-noise permit or the proper parking permits. [...] "Michael basically gave us one directorial instruction, [...] "No matter what happens, don't stop playing", Tom Morello recalls.

[...] "About two hundred of <b>us</b> <b>got</b> through the first set of doors, but our charge was stopped when the Stock Exchange's titanium riot doors came crashing down." [...] "For a few minutes, Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism", Moore said. [...] "An act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer".|$|E

I {{encouraged the}}m [...] to do their own research, which they wanted to do anyway, and then ultimately the three of <b>us</b> <b>got</b> together and just started talking...talking about anything, not necessarily about the film or the script, about anything that came up". Cage researched by binge drinking in Dublin for two weeks and had a friend videotape him so he could study his speech. He also visited hospitalized career alcoholics. He said [...] "it was one of the most enjoyable pieces of research I've ever had to do for a part." [...] Shue spent time interviewing several Las Vegas prostitutes.|$|E

2500|$|The symbol {{was adopted}} by Charles V and {{was part of his}} coat of arms {{representing}} Spain's American possessions. The symbol was later stamped on coins minted in gold and silver. The coin, also known as Spanish dollar, was the first global currency used in the entire world since the Spanish Empire was the first global Empire. These coins, depicting the pillars over two hemispheres and a small [...] "S"-shaped ribbon around each, were spread throughout America, Europe and Asia. According to this, traders wrote signs that, instead of saying Spanish dollar (piece of eight, real de a ocho in Spanish or peso duro), had this symbol made by hand, and this in turn evolved into a simple S with two vertical bars. When the <b>US</b> <b>got</b> independence from the UK, they created the American dollar, but in the first decades they still used the Spanish dollar because they were more popular in all markets.|$|E

All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of <b>us</b> <b>got</b> representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke.
