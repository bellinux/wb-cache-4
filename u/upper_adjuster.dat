40|$|Reliable {{performances}} of high temperature and high pressure operating steam {{pressure relief valves}} (HTHP PRVs) are extremely important {{for the safety of}} nuclear power plants. It is still a challenge to accurately describe the dynamic performance of HTHP PRVs. In this study, the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based modelling of the transient processes is examined. For one of the HTHP PRVs named DWPRV, the effects of different parameters on the dynamic performance were investigated by combining CFD simulation and experiments. In the simulation, the domain decomposition method (DDM) and the Grid Pre-deformation Method (GPM) were adopted to handle the moving disk geometry and the large mesh deformation. The effect of damping was also studied. It is confirmed that the use of CFD simulation can improve the design and settings of a HTHP PRV in a highly energetic service that is difficult to test due to safety reasons. For the DWPRV, {{it was found that the}} maximum flow rate occurs when the curtain area is 1. 18 times the throat area. The degree of superheat ranging from 0 C to 100 C has a negligible effect on the performance of DWPRV regardless of the changes in the material mechanical properties with operating temperatures. The reseating pressure increases linearly with the rise in the distance between the <b>upper</b> <b>adjusting</b> ring and the sealing face. The lower adjusting ring exhibits a weak effect on the reseating pressure.

40|$|A {{two-level}} adaptive {{load shedding}} scheme against voltage instability is proposed, adjusting its actions to {{the severity of}} the situation. The lower level includes a set of distributed controllers which curtail loads once the voltages at monitored transmission buses fall and stay for some time below threshold values. The adaptive nature of the proposed scheme comes from the <b>upper</b> level <b>adjusting</b> those thresholds in real-time. At the time instant the upper level detects that the system enters an emergency condition, it sends a signal to the lower-level controllers requesting them to take their currently measured voltages as threshold values. The upper-level emergency detection can be based on various criteria, the key-point being that it takes advantage of a wide-area monitoring of the system. In particular, the paper illustrates the use of a voltage instability detection scheme based on sensitivity computation. In case the upper level fails sending its signal, the lower-level controllers act in purely distributed mode, each using its preset threshold voltage. The capabilities of the proposed scheme are illustrated on a small but realistic test system. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Hard and soft tissues, angular and linear measures were calculated by Viewbox 4. 0 software. The changes of the values were analyzed using paired t-test. The accuracy of predictions of soft tissue changes were compared with two methods: (1) Use of ratios of the means of soft tissue to hard tissue changes (Viewbox 4. 0 Software), (2) use of stepwise multivariable regression analysis to create prediction equations for soft tissue changes at superior labial sulcus, labrale superius, stomion superius, inferior labial sulcus, labrale inferius, stomion inferius (all on a horizontal plane).

Firstly, to assess the reproducibility of a computer tomography (CT) -based technique for measurement of aortic thrombus volume. Secondly, to examine the determinants of infrarenal aortic thrombus volume in a cohort of patients with aortic dilatation. A consecutive series of 75 patients assessed by CT angiography with maximum aortic diameter â‰¥ 25 mm were recruited. Intra-luminal thrombus volume was measured by a semi-automated workstation protocol based on a previously defined technique to quantitate aortic calcification. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility were assessed using correlation coefficients, coefficient of variation and Bland-Altman plots. Infrarenal aortic thrombus volume percentage was related to clinical, anatomical and blood characteristics of the patients using univariate and multivariate tests. Infrarenal aortic thrombus volume was related to the severity of aortic dilatation assessed by total aortic volume (r[*]=[*] 0. 87, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) or maximum aortic diameter (r[*]=[*] 0. 74, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). We therefore examined the clinical determinates of aortic thrombus expressed as a percentage of total aortic volume. Aortic thrombus percentage was negatively correlated with serum high density lipoprotein (HDL, r[*]=[*]- 0. 31). By ordinal multiple logistic regression analysis serum HDL below median (â‰¤ 1. 2 mM) was associated with aortic thrombus percentage in the <b>upper</b> quartile <b>adjusting</b> for other risk factors (odds ratio 5. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 â€“ 25. 0).

The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and personal factors associated with CTS in female VDU workers in Italy. Material and Methods: Participants in this study were female adult subjects, working â‰¥ 20 h/week (N = 631, mean age 38. 14 Â± 7. 81 years, mean working age 12. 9 Â± 7. 24 years). Signs and symptoms were collected during compulsory occupational medical surveillance. The binary logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios for the factors of interest. Results: Diagnosis of CTS was reported in 48 cases (7. 6 %, 11 of them or 1. 7 % after a surgical correction) for the incidence of 5. 94 / 1000 person-years. In general, signs and symptoms of CTS were associated with the following demographic factors: previous trauma of <b>upper</b> limb (<b>adjusted</b> odds ratio (ORa) = 8. 093, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 347 â€“ 27. 904), history (> 5 years) of oral contraceptives therapy/hormone replacement therapy (ORa = 3. 77, 95 % CI: 1. 701 â€“ 8. 354) and cervical spine signs/symptoms (ORa = 4. 565, 95 % CI: 2. 281 â€“ 9. 136). Conclusions: The prevalence of CTS was similar to the estimates for the general population of Italy. Among personal risk factors, hormone therapy, previous trauma of the upper limb and signs/symptoms of the cervical spine appeared to be associated with a higher risk of CTS syndrome.

This risk may be reduced by a good aerobic fitness (AF) that can be improved by physical activity but is also influenced by genetic factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} test for familial aggregation of AF measured by maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) and to estimate its heritability. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis of the association between overweight/obesity and AF was performed. In contrast to previous studies, all analyses were adjusted for additional environmental and behavioral factors, in particular for objectively measured physical activity (PA) in addition to body mass index (BMI). Methods: 79 families (157 parents, 132 children) performed a maximum exercise test (spiroergometry) to assess maximum oxygen uptake. PA was measured by accelerometry. Familial aggregation of AF was determined using a two-step design: AF was adjusted for age, sex and age*sex using linear regression. Afterwards, the residuals were used to determine the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) by ANOVA. Heritability and associations were estimated by generalized linear mixed models. Results: Familial aggregation of AF (ICC = 0. 22, p < 0. 001) was significant but decreased when adjusted for PA or BMI. Its heritability was estimated as 40 % (adjusted for PA) using the mid-parent-offspring design.

40|$|Background: Geohelminth {{infections are}} common in rural western Kenya, but risk factors and effects among {{pregnant}} women are not clear. Methodology: During a community-based cross-sectional survey, pregnant women were interviewed and asked to provide a blood sample and a single fecal sample. Hemoglobin was measured and a blood slide examined for malaria. Geohelminth infections were identified using the concentration and Kato-Katz method. Results: Among 390 participants who provided a stool sample, 76. 2 % were infected {{with at least one}} geohelminth: 52. 3 % with Ascaris lumbricoides, 39. 5 % with hookworm, and 29. 0 % with Trichuris trichiura. Infection with at least one geohelminth species was {{associated with the use of}} an unprotected water source (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1. 8, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 1 â€“ 3. 0) and the lack of treatment of drinking water (AOR 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 1 â€“ 3. 1). Geohelminth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms, or low body mass index. A hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid <b>upper</b> arm circumference (<b>adjusted</b> mean decrease 0. 7 cm, 95 % CI 0. 3 â€“ 1. 2 cm). Hookworm infections with an egg count $ 1000 / gram feces (11 women) were associated with lower hemoglobin (adjusted mean decrease 1. 5 g/dl, 95 % CI 0. 3 â€“ 2. 7). Among gravidae 2 and 3, women with A. lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia (OR 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 2 â€“ 0. 8) compared to women without A. lumbricoides, unlike other gravidity groups...|$|R

It can be found at: [URL] understanding of the interactions among local environmental factors (e. g., physical habitat and water quality) and aquatic assemblages is essential to conserve biodiversity in tropical and subtropical headwater streams. We evaluated the relative importance of multiple physical and chemical habitat variables that influence the richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) assemblages in wadeable Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) streams. We sampled macroinvertebrate assemblages and quantified physical and chemical habitat in 79 randomly selected sites in 2 Cerrado basins in southeastern Brazil. The environmental variables selected by multiple regression models (MLRs) via corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) contributed significantly to variation in EPT taxon richness. The variance explained by physical-habitat variables was slightly greater in the Upper SÃ£o Francisco Basin (adjusted RÂ² = 0. 53) than in the <b>Upper</b> Araguari Basin (<b>adjusted</b> RÂ² = 0. 46), and both were greater than the variance explained by a combined basin model (adjusted RÂ² = 0. 39). Physical-habitat variables were more important than water-quality variables in structuring EPT genera in streams with catchments dominated by agriculture or pasture land uses. Regional models can be improved by incorporating basin-specific information to refine biological assessments and to provide better understanding of the interactions that maintain biodiversity in stream networks...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether lower lean mass and higher fat mass have independent {{effects on the}} loss of strength and muscle quality in older adults and might explain part {{of the effect of}} age. DESIGN: Single-episode, cross-sectional analyses of a cohort of subjects in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study. SETTING: Ambulatory clinic and research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand six hundred twenty-three men and women aged 70 to 79 from the Health ABC Study. MEASUREMENTS: Upper and lower extremity strength was measured using isokinetic (knee extension) and isometric (grip strength) dynamometers. Body composition (lean mass and fat mass) was determined by measuring lean mass of upper and lower extremities and the total body by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Muscle quality was ascertained by taking the ratio of strength to muscle mass for both upper and lower extremities. RESULTS: Upper and lower extremity strength and muscle quality decreased as age increased. Most of the explained variance in strength was due to differences in muscle mass, but, in those at the extremes of body fat and lower leg muscle quality, the association with body fat was independent of the effect of age. Although blacks had greater muscle strength and mass than whites, leg muscle quality tended to be lower in blacks than in whites. <b>Upper</b> extremity strength <b>adjusted</b> for lean mass and muscle quality were also associated inversely and independently with age, body fat, and black race. CONCLUSION: In this older cohort, lower strength with older age was predominantly due to a lower muscle mass. Age and body fat also had significant inverse associations with strength and muscle quality. Both preservation of lean mass and prevention of gain in fat may be important in maintaining strength and muscle quality in old age...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the proportion of patients with skatepark-related musculoskeletal injuries who were administered analgesics in the emergency department (ED) or at discharge, and to determine if differences in use of pain medication varied by injury type, anatomic location, or patient age. Methods: This is a retrospective review of a cohort of consecutive patients with musculoskeletal injuries presenting to a large urban ED from a local skatepark over a 1 -year period (1999 - 2000). Patients with non-musculoskeletal injuries were excluded. The outcome measure was analgesic use either in the ED or at discharge. Data included demographics, activity during injury, disposition, injury type (fracture or non-fracture), and injury location (upper or lower body). Analgesic data was abstracted from the medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of receipt of analgesic medications. Results: 85 injured patients were enrolled. No differences in age, sex, activity, or disposition were found comparing those who received analgesics (n= 68) to those who did not (n= 17). Overall, analgesia was administered to 80 % (95 % CI = 70 to 88 %) of patients; 67 % (95 % CI = 56 to 77 %) in the ED and 64 % (95 % CI = 52 to 74 %) at discharge. Fractures were more likely to receive analgesia (adjusted OR = 18. 5; 95 % CI = 4. 0 to 86. 1) than non-fracture injuries. Lower body injuries were more likely to receive analgesics compared to <b>upper</b> body injuries (<b>adjusted</b> OR = 9. 2; 95 % CI = 1. 5 to 55. 8). Age was not independently associated with analgesic use. Conclusions: A high proportion of skatepark-related musculoskeletal injuries were treated with pain medications either in the ED or at discharge. In this study analgesic medication use was influenced by injury type and location of the injury, but not age...|$|R
