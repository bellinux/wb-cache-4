50|$|When other {{researchers}} repeated the sequencing, some striking discrepancies were noted. The original published sequence included eleven errors, including one extra base pair in position 3107, and incorrect assignments of single base pairs.

50|$|Capnocytophaga strains can be {{resistant}} to third generation cephalosporins, but remain susceptible to imipenem, cefoxitin, and amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid (Jolivet-Gougeon et al., 2004). Although resistant strains {{are most frequently}} isolated in oral carriers, their prevalence is worrying (Jolivet-Gougeon et al., 2008; Sixou et al., 2006).The CfxA broad spectrum beta- lactamases (CfxA, CfxA2 and CfxA3) belong to the group 2e of Bush classification. This class includes beta-lactamase enzymes with significant activity against cephalosporins and monobactams, rather than penicillins.Following the characterization of CfxA beta- lactamase in B.vulgatus and CfxA2 beta-lactamase in P.intermedia (nucleotide Genbank <b>under</b> <b>accession</b> number AF118110), a new group 2e of Bush classification named CfxA3 (nucleotide GenBank <b>under</b> <b>accession</b> number AF472622) has been characterized in C. ochracea E201 (Jolivet-Gougeon et al. 2004). The cfxA3 gene has 99% identity with cfxA of B. vulgatus and cfxA2 of P. intermedia. The analysis of the 966 bp nucleotide sequence showed that the gene encoding beta-lactamase CfxA3 in C. ochracea E201 differs from cfxA gene of B. vulgatus by substitution of two amino acids (K272E and Y239D) and from cfxA2 gene of P. intermedia by a substitution of one amino acid (Y239D). CfxA3 was different from CfxA2 because of an aspartic acid in place of tyrosine (at position 239) and from CfxA because of a glutamic acid instead of a lysine (at position 272).|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Handal et al. (2005b) {{identified}} a novel Ambler class A beta-lactamase called CSP-1 from a NOR C. sputigena strain, resistant to amoxicillin and {{first and second}} generation cephalosporins. The new beta- lactamase had 32% homology with CfxA, 41% with CblA and 38% with CepA. CSP-1 is encoded by the blaCSP -1 gene (GenBank nucleotide sequence <b>under</b> <b>accession</b> number GQ217533). The GC content (38%) of this gene, its genetic environment, the lack of conjugal transfer and its detection in two reference strains {{suggest that it is}} an intrinsic resistance gene located on chromosome (Guillon et al., 2010).|$|E
50|$|The type species, Eshanosaurus deguchiianus, was {{described}} by Xu Xing, Zhao, and James M. Clark in 2001. The generic name is derived from Eshan.
