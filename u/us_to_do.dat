5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|One of Snedden's first actions was to readdress the paper's {{stance on}} Alaska statehood. Lathrop and the News-Miner had been {{strongly}} opposed to statehood, but after Snedden took control, he analyzed {{the issue and}} came out strongly in favor of Alaska statehood. The News-Miner continually published editorials in favor of statehood, and encouraged other newspapers across the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same. In 1955 and 1956, when the Alaska Constitutional Convention {{took place at the}} University of Alaska Fairbanks, the News-Miner set up special telephone lines from the convention chambers to the newspaper's office. Daily reports were printed, recording the delegates' progress.|$|E

25|$|Nationalists deplore {{the fact}} that so many people are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates of the society of states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> much more than most now do.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} neutron sources at ORNL; the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA) and the Spallation Neutron Source. HFIR {{provides}} neutrons {{in a stable}} beam resulting from a constant nuclear reaction whereas ORELA and SNS produce pulses of neutrons as they are particle accelerators. HFIR went critical in 1965 and {{has been used for}} materials research and as a major source of medical radioisotopes since. As of 2013, HFIR provides the world's highest constant neutron flux as a result of various upgrades. As part of a US non-proliferation effort the HFIR is scheduled to switch from highly enriched uranium (>90%, weapons grade) to low-enriched (3–4%) in 2020; the last reactor in the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Berkelium used to produce the world's first sample of tennessine was produced in the High Flux Isotope Reactor as part of an international effort. HFIR is likely to operate until approximately 2060 before the reactor vessel is considered unsafe for continued use.|$|E

The three were raised and home-schooled in Feilding, Manawatu. The brothers were introduced to music {{at a young age}} by their parents, and frequently listened to their record collection. The name [...] "Evermore" [...] was taken from the Led Zeppelin song [...] "The Battle of Evermore" [...] in 1999.

Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, [...] "Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Glen Morgan {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Duchovny {{challenged}} <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] for him.

500|$|The filmmakers {{reported}} receiving [...] "lots {{of cards}} and letters" [...] from the church, though {{in their case}} it had limited its response to [...] "loads of legal paperwork". HBO had earlier said that it had put [...] "probably 160 lawyers" [...] onto the task of reviewing the film in anticipation of challenges from the notoriously litigious church. Sheila Nevins of HBO commented {{that she could not}} believe how aggressive the church had been. Not only did it effectively provide free advertising for the film, but its hostility had made HBO Documentary Films even more determined to produce the film: [...] "I thought, 'They really don't want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. All the reason more to do it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} {{it took me a}} little while {{to get used to the}} new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. [...] But I think the album was necessary for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
500|$|Mustaine {{revealed}} the album's North American release date as November 1, 2011. Mustaine previously said the label was [...] "looking at November 1st.

500|$|Each of the {{characters}} were totally redesigned for the game, taking cues from previous iterations from the Transformers lore. [...] "What they've allowed <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is take a licensed property and treat it like a brand new IP" [...] stated Tieger. The vehicle modes for car-based characters initially consisted of wheels, however the developers found that it crippled gameplay by removing the player's ability to strafe while in vehicle mode. [...] Taking the dilemma to Hasbro, the two companies agreed that characters would turn their wheels down and hover while in vehicle mode, allowing for more movement. [...] The vehicles would then revert to the traditional wheeled mode while using a character's boost, maintaining what the Transformers license had established with previous canon.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E

Hansa was dissatisfied with the group's demos and did not wish to release [...] "Killing an Arab". [...] The label suggested that the band attempt [...] cover versions instead.
