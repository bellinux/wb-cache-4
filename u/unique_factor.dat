40|$|In a multifactor model, {{individual}} stock returns are either determined by common risk {{factors that influence}} almost all stocks, or idiosyncratic risks that only affect severl stocks at most. With the deteriating explanatory power of the popular Fama and French three factor model, we focus on factors that may have impact only on certain groups of stocks in this paper. We call these <b>factors</b> <b>Unique</b> <b>Factors.</b> In particular, we present a simple approach both to extract <b>unique</b> <b>factors</b> from stock returns and to group stocks simultaneously. This allows {{us to have a}} parsimonious structure for {{individual stock}} returns with a very few number of groups. As a result, we find that a multifactor model with two common <b>factors</b> and two <b>unique</b> <b>factors</b> has superior explanatory power both in- and out-of-sample than models with only common factors including the Fama and French’s (1992) factors and momentum factors. Moreover, in contrast to the declining explanatory power of common factors, the explanatory power of <b>unique</b> <b>factors</b> has increased over the past forty years...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen we {{work with}} two three-mode {{three-way}} data sets, such as panel data, we often investigate two types of factors: common factors, which represent relationships between the two data sets, and <b>unique</b> <b>factors,</b> which show the uniqueness of each data set relative to the other. We propose a method for investigating common and <b>unique</b> <b>factors</b> simultaneously. Canonical covariance analysis is an existing method that allows the estimation of common and <b>unique</b> <b>factors</b> simultaneously; however, this method was proposed for use with two-mode two-way data, and it is limited to quantitative data. Thus, applying canonical covariance analysis to three-mode three-way data sets or to categorical data sets is not suitable. To overcome this problem, we build {{on the concept of}} the Tucker model and the concept of non-metric principal component analysis to develop and propose a method suitable the analysis of categorical three-mode three-way data sets. Moreover, we introduce connector matrices, making it easy to determine which factors are common and allowing the selection of different numbers of dimensions for the factors...|$|R
