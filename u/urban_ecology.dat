25|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>ecology</b> can be {{included}} {{under the umbrella}} of reconciliation ecology and it tackles biodiversity in cities, the most extreme of human-dominated landscapes. Cities occupy less than 3% of global surface area, but are responsible for a majority of carbon emissions, residential water use, and wood use. Cities also have unique climatic conditions such as the urban heat island effect, which can greatly affect biodiversity. There is a growing trend among city managers to take biodiversity into account when planning city development, especially in rapidly growing cities. Cities often have surprisingly high plant biodiversity due to their normally high degree of habitat heterogeneity and high numbers of gardens and green spaces cultivated to include a large variety of species. However, these species are often not native, and {{a large part of the}} total urban biodiversity is usually made up of exotic species.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some central {{theoretical and}} methodological constructs {{in the field}} of <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies,</b> identifies research gaps in the field, and uses the Victoria Laboratory of <b>Urban</b> <b>Ecologies</b> (VALUE) as a case study illustrating possible directions of future <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> research. It begins by tracing the theoretical roots of <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> before reviewing contemporary <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> studies throughout the world.

500|$|There {{are many}} {{practical}} applications of ecology in conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management (agroecology, agriculture, forestry, agroforestry, fisheries), city planning (<b>urban</b> <b>ecology),</b> community health, economics, basic and applied science, and human social interaction (human ecology). For example, the Circles of Sustainability approach treats ecology {{as more than}} the environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms (including humans) and resources compose ecosystems which, in turn, maintain biophysical feedback mechanisms that moderate processes [...] acting on living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and produce natural capital like [...] biomass production (food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of climate, global biogeochemical cycles, water filtration, soil formation, erosion control, flood protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{potential}} of <b>Urban</b> Political <b>Ecology</b> analyses to reveal the nuanced relationships produced by nature and social relations in urban forests. A critique of the <b>Urban</b> Political <b>Ecology</b> forest literature, it focuses on the assumption {{in much of the}} literature that people in urban spaces perceive themselves to be advantaged by the presence of trees and disadvantaged by their absence. This critique leads to a call for an increased emphasis on the importance of different urban forest contexts and on the differential insights produced. The article constructs a narrative of the complex relationships, both historic and current, between communities, forest and the regulatory authorities in the governance of the urban forest of the valleys of south Wales. It then draws on recent research to reveal tensions in capitalist production and consumption relations, and identifies specific issues. Analysing these relationships and comparing the south Wales valleys case with other examples in <b>Urban</b> Political <b>Ecology</b> literature, the article seeks to promote the utility of <b>Urban</b> Political <b>Ecology</b> as a concept and to advance theoretically both <b>Urban</b> Political <b>Ecology</b> and, by extension, environmental justice...|$|R

Published studies of bee communities in {{urban and suburban}} habitats are fewer than those documenting bees in agricultural and wildland settings. As land lost to urbanization is predicted to increase in coming years the necessity of studying urban bee populations is growing. We reviewed 59 publications on <b>urban</b> bee <b>ecology</b> with the following goals, to assess current knowledge, to highlight areas in need of further research, and to suggest applications of study findings to bee conservation. Identified trends in urban areas included the following, negative correlation between bee species richness and urban development, increase in abundance of cavity-nesters in urban habitats, and scarcity of floral specialists. Future directions for studying <b>urban</b> bee <b>ecology</b> include incorporation of landscape-scale assessments, conducting manipulative experiments and actively designing urban bee habitats...|$|R

40|$|Spatial lock-ins may {{hinder the}} {{physical}} environment from adapting to new conditions and thereby risk to inhibit necessary change in society and reproduce current structures. This process reinforces uneven geographic development and urban interpretive prerogative. The study aims to strengthen the ability of planning practice to open spatial lock-ins caused by urbanisation and to confront challenges generated by uneven geographic development. Focus is set on how planning practice can establish and activate relevant local-regional contexts for specific planning situations, and clarify and enable combinations of resources that are made invisible when economic growth dominates planning objectives. The research is conducted through a design-based research process where participation in planning practices has enabled an active interplay between practice and theory. Through architectural thinking, spatial alternatives have been modelled to test theoretical argumentation, and has made visible and problematized spatial situations and their structural conditions. The research has been developed and made operative through the work in two empirical contexts: In-depth comprehensive plan Mariestad – Tidanpromenaden and Structural image Skaraborg as research tools. The study develops a theoretical and methodological framework constituted by three interacting conceptual tools. The first conceptual tool, fragile urban landscapes clarifies how spatial lock-ins cause fragile social, political, economic and ecological processes. It makes visible how the interplay between spatial conditions and structural transformations create lock-ins as combinations of scarcity of resources, competence, decision mandate and rigidity in current spatial structures and planning organisation. The second conceptual tool, <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies,</b> makes visible the urban landscape as layered complex productive material and discursive configurations. <b>Urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> can thereby {{be used as a}} tool to reveal how topographies, infrastructures and resources both enable and constrain transformation and change in society. The third conceptual tool, urban key projects, relates to situation-oriented interventions that combine resources from different <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> in order to trigger local-regional transformation. The research demonstrates how the three conceptual tools together can support planning practice to implement material and discursive changes in order to break reproduction of spatial lock-ins and support re-negotiations of the urban landscape. This implies a process of reading and mapping material and discursive compositions, re-valuing and combining resources and potential related to the planning situation, problematizing ongoing transformation processes, formulating alternative directions of development and an incremental, coupled and long-term implementation. Hereby the developed theoretical and methodological framework can be used to open spatial lockins and expand local-regional acting space for planning practice...|$|R

40|$|Although {{developing}} world cities are increasingly {{the focus of}} <b>urban</b> political <b>ecology</b> perspectives, waste remains an underexplored aspect. This paper helps to fill this thematic gap by using <b>urban</b> political <b>ecology</b> as a lens for analyzing flows of food waste in the Brazilian city of Diadema. The marginal urban poor in Diadema, as in most other cities in Brazil, lack access to affordable {{fresh fruit and vegetables}} yet must cope with a disproportionate accumulation of uncollected waste. Integrated organic waste management, consisting of decentralized household-waste collection by organized recycling groups, waste processing, and the utilization of food waste for composting and urban food production, is presented as way of reclaiming and recirculating urban natures for potentially positive socioecological change. However, it is a process characterized by conflict and potential exploitation, while broader structural conditions constrain the ability of the system to offer an alternative to existing waste-management models. The paper concludes with a call for further action-oriented research within <b>urban</b> political <b>ecology</b> to reveal opportunities for new socioecological futures which should occur at multiple scales and emerge from the lived realities of marginalized actors such as catadores (recyclers) and urban gardeners. ...|$|R
