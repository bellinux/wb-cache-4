500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
