5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s {{has been linked to}} the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> transfer of affairs with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{overwhelming}} British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian Edward Ingram noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue {{the war in the}} Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to change the course of history is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Auguste de Marmont, Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, Louis Desaix, Jean Reynier, Antoine-François Andréossy, Jean-Andoche Junot, Louis-Nicolas Davout and Dumas were all passengers on the cramped Mediterranean crossing.|$|E
25|$|Complete loss of {{an entire}} X {{chromosome}} accounts for about half the cases of Turner syndrome.

50|$|The child dances {{part of a}} gagaku {{dance for}} her, the Manzairaku. Inspired, she starts to dance herself, and {{continues}} to do so until dawn. In the dawn light she ponders the transience of life, and her irrational shame at what she has become, which Zeami tragically <b>underscores</b> <b>by</b> setting <b>the</b> action during the Tanabata festival, which celebrates two young lovers.|$|R

25|$|Their {{presence}} severely {{exacerbated the}} differences among American Quakers, differences that had been <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1819 split between the Unitarians and Congregationalists. The influence of Anna Braithwaite was especially strong. She visited the United States between 1823 and 1827 and published her Letters and observations relating to the controversy respecting the doctrines of Elias Hicks in 1824 in which she depicted Hicks as a radical eccentric. Hicks felt obliged to respond {{and in the same}} year published a letter to his ally in Philadelphia Meeting, Dr. Edwin Atlee, in The Misrepresentations of Anna Braithwaite. This in turn was replied to by Braithwaite in A Letter from Anna Braithwaite to Elias Hicks, On the Nature of his Doctrines in 1825. Neither party was persuaded by this exchange.|$|E
25|$|The lyrics for the band's {{songs were}} often pleas for peace, love, and {{understanding}} among people. These calls against prejudice and self-hate were <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> band's on-stage appearance. Caucasians Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini {{were members of}} the band at a time when integrated performance bands were virtually unknown; integration had only recently become enforced by law. Females Cynthia Robinson and Rosie Stone played instruments onstage, rather than just providing vocals or serving as visual accompaniment for the male members. The band's gospel-styled singing endeared them to black audiences; their rock music elements and wild costuming—including Sly's large Afro and tight leather outfits, Rose's blond wig, and the other members' loud psychedelic clothing—caught the attention of mainstream audiences, and helped the group enjoy success as a pop act.|$|E
25|$|In {{economic}} terms {{the division of}} the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even during the Northern Song dynasty, 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and Sichuan). These geographical divisions are <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the Grand Canal linking north and south, the hauling-way through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River linking southern China with Sichuan and the gallery roads joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of Zhuge Liang (see Longzhong Plan).|$|E

25|$|Many Lakes (Sinixt) {{feel that}} to live {{ethically}} one must follow a moral code which maintains a reciprocal relationship between humans, the land, and {{the realm of}} spirits in which the ancestors dwell. (Ancestor) Eva Orr called this 'keeping the Lakes' way.' The ideal of keeping the Lakes' way requires that people not take for their own gain but instead give back by following a cultural ethic of egalitarianism, reciprocity and peaceful living. Orr was acknowledged as spiritual leader – a klakwilt. Marilyn James states that Orr got her authority as a klakwilt by being culturally whole, linguistically connected to Sinixt culture, and bringing people to spirit. The Sinixt connection to their traditional territory is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wbuplak'n, the highest territorial and cultural legal doctrine of the Sinixt, which sets out their territorial responsibility to all land, water, plant, animal and cultural resources within the Sinixt territory.|$|E
500|$|A second Goffin–King composition, [...] "Wasn't Born to Follow", also {{displays}} {{country and}} western influences, albeit filtered through the band's psychedelic and garage rock tendencies. The song's country leanings are <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> criss-crossing musical dialogue between the electric guitar and pedal steel. The rural ambiance is further heightened by the striking imagery of the lyrics which outline the need for escape and independence: a subject perfectly {{in keeping with the}} hippie ethos of the day.|$|E
500|$|The {{impression}} of a life lived without consequence, or what art historian Hans Belting describes as [...] "unspoilt and pre-moral existence", is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> absence of children and old people. According to {{the second and third}} chapters of Genesis, Adam and Eve's children were born after they were expelled from Eden. This has led some commentators, in particular Belting, to theorise that the panel represents the world if the two had not been driven out [...] "among the thorns and thistles of the world". In Fraenger's view, the scene illustrates [...] "a utopia, a garden of divine delight before the Fall, or — since Bosch could not deny the existence of the dogma of original sin — a millennial condition that would arise if, after expiation of Original Sin, humanity were permitted to return to Paradise and to a state of tranquil harmony embracing all Creation." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{many stories}} with evil {{stepmother}}s, the hostility between the stepmother and <b>the</b> stepchild is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> having <b>the</b> child succeed through {{aid from the}} dead mother. This motif occurs from Norse mythology, where Svipdagr rouses his mother Gróa from the grave so as to learn from her how to accomplish a task his stepmother set, to fairy tales such as the Brothers Grimm version of Cinderella, where Aschenputtel receives her clothing from a tree growing on her mother's grave, the Russian Vasilissa the Beautiful, where Vasilissa is aided by a doll her mother gave, and her mother's blessing, and the Malay Bawang Putih Bawang Merah, where the heroine's mother comes back as fish to protect her.|$|R
500|$|After {{divorce from}} his first wife Bellea [...] "disastrous" [...] {{relationship}} <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of their infant daughterJoplin married his 19-year-old second wife Freddie in June 1904. He had dedicated to her his rag The Chrysanthemum {{which was published in}} that year. She died on 10 September 1904 of pneumonia ten weeks after their wedding. Joplin's whereabouts are unknown from that point until early 1905, when he returned to St. Louis, Missouri where some of Joplin's known associates, such as pianist Louis Chauvin and musician Joe Jordan, still lived. On 6 March, Joplin registered the copyright of Bethena, A Concert Waltz, and dedicated the work to the otherwise little-known [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Dan E. Davenport of St. Louis Mo". The copyright date is significant because not all Joplin works were registered for copyright purposes and {{there is a lack of}} detail about many aspects of Joplin's life, including when many of the pieces were composed.|$|E
500|$|Much of Imogen's {{choral music}} {{was written for}} amateur performance. Critics have {{observed}} a clear distinction in quality between these pieces and the choral works written for professional choirs, particularly those for women's voices. These latter pieces, says Tinker, incorporate her best work as an original composer. Record companies were slow in recognising Imogen's commercial potential, and not until 2009 was a [...] CD issued devoted entirely to her music—a selection of her works for strings. [...] The Guardians reviewer welcomed the recording: [...] "here {{is a great deal}} of English music of far less worth that is frequently praised to the skies". In 2012 a selection of her choral music, sung by the Clare College Choir, was recorded by Harmonia Mundi. One review of this recording picks out Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow, written for female voices with harp accompaniment, as [...] " [...] an insight into her own, softly nuanced, pioneering voice". Another mentions the [...] "Three Psalms" [...] setting, where [...] "inner rhythms are <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> subtle string ostinatos pulsing beneath".|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} the common belief of Europe as {{reasonably}} homogeneous at genetic level, advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have resolved several gradients which define different geographical areas with good precision. When Northern and Southern European groups were considered separately, there were clear genetic distinctions. Intra-country genetic differences were also evident, especially in Finland and, to a lesser extent, within other European populations. Here, we present the first analysis using the 125, 799 genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) data of 1, 014 Italians with wide geographical coverage. We showed by using Principal Component analysis and model-based individual ancestry analysis, that the current population of Sardinia can be clearly differentiated genetically from mainland Italy and Sicily, and that {{a certain degree of}} genetic differentiation is detectable within the current Italian peninsula population. Pair-wise F ST statistics Northern and Southern Italy amounts approximately to 0. 001 between, and around 0. 002 between Northern Italy and Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU). The Italian population also revealed a fine genetic substructure <b>underscoring</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> genomic inflation (Sardinia vs. Northern Italy = 3. 040 and Northern Italy vs. CEU = 1. 427), warning against confounding effects of hidden relatedness and population substructure in association studies...|$|R

2500|$|The WW domain {{is known}} to mediate {{regulatory}} protein complexes in various signaling networks, including the Hippo signaling pathway. The importance of WW domain-mediated complexes in signaling was <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> characterization of genetic syndromes that are caused by loss-of-function point mutations in the WW domain or its cognate ligand.

2500|$|Blackmun and his clerks then {{sought an}} {{appropriate}} case {{to serve as}} a [...] "vehicle for [...] dissent," [...] and settled on Callins. That the case found the dissent, rather than the more traditional relationship of the dissent relating to the case, is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> opinion's almost total omission of reference to the case it ostensibly addressed: Callins is relegated to a supernumerary in his own appeal, being mentioned but five times in a 42-paragraph opinion– three times within the first two paragraphs, and twice in footnote 2.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] during Joseph's first dream {{the angel}} instructs Joseph: [...] "you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his {{people from their}} sins". It {{is the only place}} in the New Testament where [...] "saves his people" [...] appears with [...] "sins". The {{significance}} is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Matthew pays more attention to the name of the child and its theological implications than the actual birth event itself. Matthew 1:21 provides the beginnings of the Christology of the name Jesus. At once it achieves the two goals of affirming Jesus as the saviour and emphasizing that the name was not selected at random, but based on a Heavenly command.|$|E
2500|$|Proof {{that the}} Church is {{persistently}} striving {{to strengthen its}} political influence in socialist countries is witnessed {{by the fact that}} Pope John Paul II gives his support to the emigre hierarchy of the so-called Ukrainian Catholic Church [...] [...] [...]. The current tactic of Pope John Paul II and the Roman Curia lies in the attempts to strengthen the position of the Church in all socialist countries as they have done in Poland, where the Vatican tried to raise the status of the Catholic Church to a state within a state. In the last few years, the Vatican has paid particular attention to the question of Catholicism of the Slavonic nations. This is poignantly <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pope when he states that he is not only a Pope of Polish origin, but the first Slavic Pope, and he will pay particular attention to the Christianization of all Slavic nations.|$|E
