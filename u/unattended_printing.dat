5000|$|Offline {{devices are}} {{typically}} Friden Flexowriters {{that have been}} specially built to operate with the FIO-DEC character coding used by the PDP-1. Like the console typewriter, these are built around a typing mechanism that is mechanically the same as an IBM Electric typewriter. However, Flexowriters are highly reliable and were often used for long <b>unattended</b> <b>printing</b> sessions. Flexowriters have electromechanical paper tape punches and readers which operate synchronously with the typewriter mechanism. Typing rates are about ten characters per second. A typical PDP-1 operating procedure is to output text to punched paper tape using the PDP-1's [...] "high speed" [...] (60-character-per-second) Teletype model BRPE punch, then to hand carry the tape to a Flexowriter for offline printing.|$|E
5000|$|Although the daisy wheel {{principle}} is basically inappropriate for printing bitmap graphics, there were attempts {{to enable them}} to do so. Most daisy wheel printers supported a relatively coarse and extremely slow graphics mode by printing the image entirely out of dots (formed by the [...] "period" [...] character). This required a mechanism capable of pixel by pixel movement, both horizontally and vertically, and low-end printers were incapable of it. Given the slow speed and the coarse resolution this was not a feasible technique for printing large images, but could usefully print a small logo onto a letterhead and then the following letter, all in a single <b>unattended</b> <b>print</b> run without changing the print element.|$|R
