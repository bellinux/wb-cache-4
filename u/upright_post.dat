25|$|Haas {{had also}} {{identified}} a scratch {{on the inner}} surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist. He deduced from {{the form of the}} scratch, {{as well as from the}} intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position. However, much of Haas' findings have been challenged. For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic—and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion — while reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> of the cross.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evidence}} at present {{is that the}} earliest type of European windmill was the post mill, so named {{because of the large}} <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> on which the mill's main structure (the [...] "body" [...] or [...] "buck") is balanced. By mounting the body this way, the mill is able to rotate to face the wind direction; an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in north-western Europe, where wind directions are variable. The body contains all the milling machinery. The first post mills were of the sunken type, where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it. Later, a wooden support was developed called the trestle. This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the nineteenth century, when more powerful tower and smock mills replaced them.|$|E

50|$|The {{boathouse}} is {{a single}} storey masonry building. The slate roof overhangs both sides by a considerable extent and is supported on <b>upright</b> <b>posts.</b> When it was refurbished for its 1991 reopening a fund-raising gift shop was installed under the eastern overhang.|$|R
2500|$|The standard, four-pointed Latin {{crucifix}} {{consists of}} an <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> or stipes and a single crosspiece to which the sufferer's arms were nailed. There {{may also be a}} short projecting nameplate, showing the letters INRI (Greek: INBI). [...] The Russian Orthodox crucifix usually has an additional third crossbar, to which the feet are nailed, and which is angled upward toward the penitent thief Saint Dismas (to the viewer's left) and downward toward the impenitent thief Gestas (to the viewer's right). [...] The corpus of Eastern crucifixes is normally a two-dimensional or low relief icon that shows Jesus as already dead, his face peaceful and somber. [...] They are rarely three-dimensional figures as in the Western tradition, although these may be found where Western influences are strong, but are more typically icons painted on a piece of wood shaped to include the double-barred cross and perhaps the edge of Christ's hips and halo, and no background. [...] More sculptural small crucifixes in metal relief are also used in Orthodoxy (see gallery examples), including as pectoral crosses and blessing crosses.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{afterward}} I {{resolved to}} visit my town of Taal; nothing was left of it except {{the walls of the}} church and convento. All the rest, the government house, the walks of the rope factory, the warehouse, everything was buried beneath a layer of stones, mud, and ashes more than 10 spans [...] thick; only here and there could be seen an <b>upright</b> <b>post,</b> the only remnant of a comfortable dwelling. I went down to the river and found it completely filled up, with a boat belonging to the alcalde and many of private persons buried in the mud. After incredible efforts I finally succeeded in unearthing in what had once been the church and sacristy, the chests which contained the sacred vestments and vessels. Nearly all of them were demolished by the rocks and beams which had fallen upon them, and filled with foul-smelling mud that had ruined or disfigured their contents. With the aid of some natives of Bauang, I likewise recovered some property from among the ruins of the convento.|$|E

500|$|Goals {{consist of}} two <b>upright</b> <b>posts</b> placed {{equidistant}} from {{the centre of}} the backline, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The inner edges of the posts must be [...] apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be [...] above the ground.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{that time}} the fire had burned itself out, and a few <b>upright</b> <b>posts</b> still {{flickering}} with tongues of fire, and a heap of glowing embers marked where the pretty bungalow, replete with every luxury and comfort, had stood an hour before.|$|R
60|$|Passing {{from the}} {{interior}} of the prison into the space within its outward wall, Adam pauses beneath a structure of the simplest contrivance, yet altogether unaccountable to him. It consists merely of two <b>upright</b> <b>posts,</b> supporting a transverse beam, from which dangles a cord.|$|R
6000|$|Early {{the next}} spring there emerged from that cottage {{by the wayside}} the {{unstable}} framework of a man dragging through seas of melting snow a tottering female of dejected aspect. Forlorn, crippled, famishing, and discouraged, these melancholy relics held on their way until {{they came to a}} cross-roads (all leading to Lagerhaus), where they saw clinging to an <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> the tatter of an old placard. It read as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|It was, as I have said, a pit, with sharply-sloping {{walls and}} a level bottom about twenty feet across. This bottom was {{littered}} with great gobbets of flesh, most of {{which was in the}} last state of putridity. The atmosphere was poisonous and horrible. After tripping and stumbling over these lumps of decay, I came suddenly against something hard, and I found that an <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> was firmly fixed {{in the center of the}} hollow. It was so high that I could not reach the top of it with my hand, and it appeared to be covered with grease.|$|E
6000|$|Had the boy or {{his father}} looked attentively at the giant just then, {{they would have}} seen that his colour deepened, his eyes glittered, and his great chest heaved {{a little more than}} was its wont, as he looked over his {{shoulder}} while labouring at the oars. Perhaps we should have said played with the oars, for they were mere toys in his grasp. Chingatok's little mother also was evidently affected by the sight of home. But the Captain and his son saw it not--they were too much occupied with their own thoughts and feelings. To the Englishmen the sight of land roused only one great all-engrossing thought--the North Pole! which, despite the absurdity of the idea, would present itself {{in the form of an}} <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> of terrific magnitude--a worthy axle-tree, as it were, for the world to revolve upon. To the big Eskimo land presented itself in the form of a palatial stone edifice measuring fifteen feet by twelve, with a dear pretty little wife choking herself in the smoke of a cooking-lamp, and a darling little boy choking himself with a mass of walrus blubber. Thus the same object, when presented to different minds, suggested ideas that were: ...|$|E

50|$|Goals {{are placed}} at the centre of each goal-line.These consist of two <b>upright</b> <b>posts</b> placed {{equidistant}} from the corner flagposts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The inner edges of the posts must be 7.32 m apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be 2.44 m above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, though are not required by the Laws.|$|R

50|$|The scriber block has pins {{that can}} be pushed to {{protrude}} through the base; these can then be used as limit pins to allow the block to press {{against the edge of}} the table, controlling its movement in that plane. The <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> can be adjusted to tilt back or forward, effectively moving the scriber point up or down in a controlled fashion; coarse adjustments are made by sliding the scriber along its clamping block.|$|E
50|$|They {{may take}} various forms from a plain cross formed from two beams, a wayside shrine, a complex cross (Gliederkreuz) or a niche cross (Nischenkreuz) - {{but may also}} have {{elements}} of the variations, for example a niche in the <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> of the cross. It is thus a more elaborate and usually higher form of the simple stone cross. Shaft crosses are mostly found as wayside crosses or occasionally by churches or on cemeteries in predominantly Roman Catholic regions such as the Rhineland of Germany.|$|E

50|$|The use of netting for {{the goal}} was {{demonstrated}} with a model produced by Frank Stocking, goaltender of the Quebec club at the annual meeting. After an exhibition game between the Shamrocks and Victorias, the use of goal nets was approved for league play, and used for the season. The netting connected the two <b>upright</b> <b>posts,</b> {{but there was no}} crossbar across the top.|$|R
5000|$|Piece en piece or piece sur piece. Similar to post-and-plank above: Uses short logs (e.g. 8' long) lying {{horizontally}} between <b>upright</b> <b>posts,</b> resembling post-and-beam construction (but usually {{lacking the}} complex notching seen with post-and-beam). Piece en piece typically uses a large (8"x 8") vertical corner post. It {{is important that}} a vertical component (often 3"x 6") be placed {{on both sides of}} each window and door.|$|R
5000|$|Te Uenuku (literally [...] "The rainbow") {{represents}} the tribal god Uenuku. It is 2.7 metres in height {{and consists of}} a simple <b>upright</b> <b>post,</b> the top {{of which has been}} carved into a spiral form. From the top of this spiral emerge four waving verticals, reminiscent of the teeth of a comb. The form, though seemingly simple, often causes a powerful reaction in viewers of the artifact. In appearance the carving is very striking and different from the style of carving seen in the later Classic period.|$|E
5000|$|A newel, {{also called}} a central pole or support column, {{is the central}} {{supporting}} pillar of a staircase. It can also (usually as [...] "newel post") refer to an <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> that supports the handrail of a stair banister. In stairs having straight flights it is the principal post {{at the foot of}} the staircase, but it can also be used for the intermediate posts on landings and at the top of a staircase. Although its primary purpose is structural, newels have long been adorned with decorative trim and designed with different architectural styles.|$|E
5000|$|A queen-post bridge has two uprights, placed {{about one-third}} of the way from each end of the truss. They are {{connected}} across the top by a beam and use a diagonal brace between the outer edges. The central square between the two verticals is either unbraced (on shorter spans), or has one or two diagonal braces for rigidity. A single diagonal reaches between opposite corners; two diagonal braces may either reach from the bottom of each <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> {{to the center of the}} upper beam, or form a corner-to-corner [...] "X" [...] inside the square.|$|E

Soon he saw where a board of the side wall had been pried loose and then shoved back into place. He pulled {{on the board and}} it came out, revealing a small compartment between two <b>upright</b> <b>posts.</b> In the compartment was something wrapped in a bandanna handkerchief. He pulled it out and crawled from under the berth.|$|R
50|$|Gaelic {{football}} (Irish: Peil Ghaelach; {{short name}} Peil or Caid), {{commonly referred to}} as football or Gaelic, is an Irish team sport. It is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. The objective of the sport is to score by kicking or punching the ball into the other team's goals (3 points) or between two <b>upright</b> <b>posts</b> above the goals and over a crossbar 2.5 m above the ground (1 point).|$|R
5000|$|The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society {{used the}} Cross and Crown symbol on tombstones, {{and on its}} {{publications}} until 1931. Since 1936, Jehovah's Witnesses have rejected the idea that Jesus died on a cross, and instead teach that he died on a single wooden stake (...) , asserting that the Koiné Greek word σταυρος (stauros) refers to a single <b>upright</b> <b>post.</b> They consider the cross to be of pagan origins and an object of idol worship. Some Jehovah's Witnesses have been persecuted or killed for not bowing down to or kissing a cross.|$|E

5000|$|The speaker {{uses the}} imagery of a leopard to mean {{stealthy}} and dangerous, he goes further {{to suggest that they}} are of the same womb, from which we can infer that he speaks of a brother; older, and with more status than he. The persona's lambs are born with speckles, suggesting that the lecherous elder brother has already spawned children with the persona's wives; and, the persona has not had conjugal relations with them, as his elder visits upon his home frequently. This is suggested by the lines: [...] "The <b>upright</b> <b>post</b> at the gate has fallen / My women are frisky / The leopard arches over my homestead".|$|E
60|$|So soon {{as their}} visitor had passed, the observant warriors fell {{back from the}} entrance, and {{arranging}} themselves about him, they seemed patiently to await the moment when it might comport with {{the dignity of the}} stranger to speak. By far the greater number stood leaning, in lazy, lounging attitudes, against the <b>upright</b> <b>posts</b> that supported the crazy building, while three or four of the oldest and most distinguished of the chiefs placed themselves on the earth a little more in advance.|$|R
50|$|The Carmila cane lift is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Tracey lift. Cane lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two <b>upright</b> <b>posts.</b> The Tracey lift took the latter form and was powered by a truck backed under the lift so its back wheels engaged with rollers set into the ground. The lift at Carmila is an intact example of this type and includes the roller mechanism, pulley with cable and a hook.|$|R

The lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two <b>upright</b> <b>posts.</b> The lift at Mount Martin is a highly intact example of the derrick type and includes pulley wheels, cable, hook and access ladder. The ladder is a typical feature {{of this type of}} lift and was fitted to permit access {{to the top of the}} derrick for maintenance purposes.|$|R
