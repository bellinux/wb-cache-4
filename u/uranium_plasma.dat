50|$|Uranium {{tetrachloride}} {{is produced}} commercially by {{the reaction of}} carbon tetrachloride with pure uranium dioxide UO2 at 370 Â°C. It {{has been used as}} feed in the electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS) process of uranium enrichment. Beginning in 1944, the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant converted UO3 to UCl4 feed for the Ernest O. Lawrence's Alpha Calutrons. Its major benefit being the uranium tetrachloride used in the calutrons is not as corrosive as the uranium hexafluoride used in most other enrichment technologies This process was abandoned in the 1950s. In the 1980s, however, Iraq unexpectedly revived this option as part of its nuclear weapons program. In the enrichment process, uranium tetrachloride is ionized into a <b>uranium</b> <b>plasma.</b>|$|E

A 15 -g rod of 93 % enriched U- 235 is placed in the end of the center electrode where an intense electron beam impinges during the plasma-focus formation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted using 80 kW and 1. 2 MW RF induction heater facilities {{to aid in}} developing the technology necessary for designing a self-critical fissioning <b>uranium</b> <b>plasma</b> core reactor. Pure uranium hexafluoride (UF 6) was injected into argon-confined, steady-state, RF-heated plasmas in different <b>uranium</b> <b>plasma</b> confinement tests to investigate the characteristics of plamas core nuclear reactors.

Tests were conducted to measure the density of uranium in an rf-heated argon plasma with UF 6 infection and with the power to maintain the discharge supplied by a 1. 2 MW rf induction heater facility. The uranium density was measured as the flow rate through the test chamber was varied. A maximum uranium density of 3. 85 times 10 to the 17 th power atoms/cu cm was measured...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} <b>uranium</b> <b>plasma</b> {{emission}} produced by two methods are reported.

The absolute intensity of the emitted radiation, covering the range from 300 to 7000 A was measured. For the second method, the <b>uranium</b> <b>plasma</b> was produced in a 20 kilovolt, 25 kilojoule plasma-focus device. The 2. 5 MeV neutrons from the D-D reaction in the plasma focus are moderated by polyethylene and induce fissions in the U- 235.

40|$|Discussion of {{numerous}} approaches to exploitation of fission energy for special applications in more beneficial ways {{than can be}} achieved by conventional reactor technology. It is *hown that, for space propulsion, the high temperature plasma core reactor is most desirable. But fissioning plasmas may find applications beyond this.

The plasma core systems can be coupled to MHD generators to obtain high efficiency electrical power generation. A 1074 MWt UF 6 breeder reactor was designed with a breeding ratio of 1. 002 to guard against diversion of fuel. Using molten salt technology and a superheated steam cycle, an efficiency of 39. 2 % was obtained for the plant and the U 233 inventory in the core and heat exchangers was limited to 105 Kg. It {{was found that the}} UF 6 reactor can produce high fluxes (10 to the 14 th power n/sq cm-sec) necessary for efficient burnup of actinide. However, the buildup of fissile isotopes posed severe heat transfer problems. Therefore, the flux in the actinide region must be decreased with time. Consequently, only beginning-of-life conditions were considered for the power plant design.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} approaches to advanced propulsion that could meet the objectives of the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) is the open cycle gas core nuclear rocket (GCR). The energy in this device is generated by a fissioning <b>uranium</b> <b>plasma</b> which heats, through radiation, a propellant that flows around the core and exits through a nozzle, thereby converting thermal energy into thrust. Although such a scheme can produce very attractive propulsion parameters in the form of high specific impulse and high thrust, it does suffer from serious physics and engineering problems that must be addressed if it is to become a viable propulsion system. Among the major problems that must be solved are the confinement of the <b>uranium</b> <b>plasma,</b> potential instabilities and control problems associated with the dynamics of the uranium core, and the question of startup and fueling of such a reactor. In this paper, the authors focus their attention on the problems of equilibria and stability of the uranium care, and examine the potential use of an externally applied magnetic field for these purposes.

A maximum cavity specific impulse of 5800 sec was obtained under such operating conditions. The fact that the wall heat flux was much lower for reactor powers below this level is linked to the presence of a relatively cool, opaque insulating layer of seeded propellant between the hot plasma and the solid wall.
