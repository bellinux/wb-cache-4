40|$|This study {{evaluated}} radiographs {{taken at}} the Clinic for Small Animals at the Free University of Berlin between 1994 & 1999. Abdominal radiographs of 368 guinea pigs, 233 (63. 3 %) female and 132 (35. 9 %) male are included. Subject preparation and positioning techniques are discussed. In view of the clinical signs, the application and diagnostic value of plain radiographs in guinea pigs with abdominal diseases are examined. Another primary goal {{of this study is}} to describe the normal radiographical anatomy, including the exact positioning of the abdominal organs, in guinea pigs. Within the gastrointestinal tract of guinea pigs older than six months, under normal physiologic conditions, it is possible to distinguish the stomach, liver, cecum, descending colon, kidneys and bladder. Large amounts of gas inside the gastrointestinal tract are seen in guinea pigs with gastrointestinal, urogenital or general disorders. The occurrence of tympania of the stomach, cecum or both combined could be seen very often, of which tympania of the stomach predominates. Whereas tympania of the stomach could be seen mostly in females, cecal tympania predominated in males. These gastrointestinal disorders were rarely caused by improper feeding, but instead were secondary to diseases of the oral cavity that lead to anorexia. Overloading, bezoars and calcification of the stomach are also described. The radiographic portrait of the liver, pancreas and spleen in guinea pigs are described. Disorders of the liver can be seen as an enlargement with steatosis, congestion and abscesses. Radiological signs of liver enlargement include extension of its caudal margin beyond the first lumbar vertebra, a distance between cranial and caudal border greater than 4 cm and dislocation of the cranial stomach border above thoracic vertebra 11 to 13 on the ventral dorsal view. Specific detection of the normal pancreas is limited, but diffuse calcification of the pancreas secondary to malignant tumors enhances its visibility. Splenomegaly was correlated with serious infections of the gastrointestinal tract and tumours. The normal length of the kidneys varied between 2. 1 and 2. 9 times the length of the first lumbar vertebral body. Besides tympania and space occupying processes in the abdominal cavity, radiography is very important for the diagnosis of urolithiasis. These can be seen as early as nine months of age, and are one of the most common diseases in guinea pigs. <b>Urinary</b> <b>gravel</b> and calculi could be found in each part of the urinary tract. Urolithiasis is more frequent in females. A painful abdomen and urinary disorders should always prompt a radiographic examination in this species. This study found and describes abdominal radiographs as valuable in examination of disorders of the female guinea pigs genital tract and pregnancy. Abnormal findings of the skeleton are considered and included in the description...|$|E
