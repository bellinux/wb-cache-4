5|$|The actual {{process of}} {{analysis}} can vary between investigations, but common methodologies include conducting keyword searches across the digital media (within files {{as well as}} <b>unallocated</b> and slack space), recovering deleted files and extraction of registry information (for example to list user accounts, or attached USB devices).|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the <b>unallocated</b> land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in <b>unallocated</b> space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|The National Assembly for Wales {{announced}} on 6 November 2007 {{that it was}} {{to pay off the}} outstanding loan of £13.5million from HSBC and also increase the annual funding. From April 2008, the National Assembly for Wales have given a grant to the Wales Millennium Centre with £3.5million per annum for 3 years. This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the Centre remains profitable. The money used to pay the debt came from <b>unallocated</b> funds from the Assembly's previous budget and it was said by the Minister for Heritage, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, that the new money allocation would not {{come at the expense of}} other art projects from other parts of Wales.|$|E
5|$|During the Article 32 hearing, the prosecution, led by Captain Ashden Fein, {{presented}} 300,000 {{pages of}} documents in evidence, including chat logs and classified material. The court heard from two Army investigators, Special Agent David Shaver, head of the digital forensics and research branch of the Army's Computer Crime Investigative Unit (CCIU); and Mark Johnson, a digital forensics contractor from ManTech International, {{who works for the}} CCIU. They testified that they had found 100,000 State Department cables on a workplace computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010; 400,000 military reports from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan on an SD card found in her basement room in her aunt's home in Potomac, Maryland; and 10,000 cables on her personal MacBook Pro and storage devices that they said had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted. They also recovered 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in <b>unallocated</b> space on Manning's MacBook hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club's domain (ccc.de), were associated with the names Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{may issue}} gold {{certificates}} for gold that is allocated (fully reserved) or <b>unallocated</b> (pooled). <b>Unallocated</b> gold certificates are {{a form of}} fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of}} a run on the issuing bank's gold on deposit. Allocated gold certificates should be correlated with specific numbered bars, although it is difficult to determine whether a bank is improperly allocating a single bar to more than one party.|$|E
25|$|Very little on-ground {{management}} of feral animals {{is done on}} the <b>unallocated</b> crown land. There is some {{management of}} feral animals on reserves and pastoral leases, which includes baiting, trapping, shooting and fencing.|$|E
25|$|Typically, bullion banks only deal in {{quantities}} of 1000 ounces {{or more in}} either allocated or <b>unallocated</b> accounts. For private investors, vaulted gold offers private individuals to obtain ownership in professionally vaulted gold starting from minimum investment requirements of several thousand U.S.-dollars or denominations as low as one gram.|$|E
25|$|Delegate Soft Count: This only {{included}} delegates allocated at {{the primaries}} and <b>unallocated</b> delegates that were elected at their local conventions or committees. It {{did not include}} any projections on future local conventions or the 117 unbound RNC delegates that were {{not a part of}} the primary election process. A breakdown of this historical count is found in the Primary Schedule below.|$|E
25|$|The 1/4th Battalion and 1/5th Battalion {{landed at}} Suvla Bay {{as part of}} the 159th Brigade in the 53rd (Welsh) Division in August 1915; after being {{evacuated}} from Gallipoli in December 1915 the battalion moved to Egypt. The 1/6th (Glamorgan) Battalion landed at Le Havre {{as part of the}} South Wales Brigade, which was <b>unallocated</b> to a division, in October 1914 for service on the Western Front.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the current}} lack of formal, {{integrated}} planning for the Great Western Woodlands {{as a whole and}} the existing categorisation of most of the woodlands as <b>unallocated</b> crown land, development proposals that could have severe impacts – both directly and cumulatively – are considered in isolation. Effects such as the multiplication and replication of infrastructure corridors (roads; powerlines; pipelines etc.) across the woodlands can result in large scale fragmentation and consequent invasion by weeds and feral animals.|$|E
25|$|Dates: The {{first date}} column is {{the date of}} primary or caucuses where the {{election}} process for the delegation starts. This event can allocated delegate or let them stay <b>unallocated.</b> But two more dates are important in the process, the date when congressional district delegates are (s)elected and the date when state delegates are (s)elected. Some event stretches {{for more than one}} day, if so the date stated in the table is the end day of the event. This is done for technical reasons.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March, the Sun-Herald {{reported}} {{that the government had}} brokered a secret deal with publicans {{to increase the number of}} poker machines in the state's pubs. The large number of poker machines in New South Wales is controversial, and the alleged deal was condemned by the Greens and ClubsNSW. Pubs and clubs contributed $2 million to Labor's election campaign, and sales of currently <b>unallocated</b> poker machine licenses could net the treasury up to $200 million. The government and the Australian Hoteliers Association, representing publicans, denied a deal had been done.|$|E
25|$|Many banks offer gold {{accounts}} where gold can be instantly bought or sold {{just like}} any foreign currency on a fractional reserve basis. Swiss banks offer similar service on a fully allocated basis. Pool accounts, such as those offered by some providers, facilitate highly liquid but <b>unallocated</b> claims on gold owned by the company. Digital gold currency systems operate like pool accounts and additionally allow the direct transfer of fungible gold between members of the service. Other operators, by contrast, allows clients to create a bailment on allocated (non-fungible) gold, which becomes the legal property of the buyer.|$|E
25|$|Santorum {{had also}} failed to submit full or any {{delegate}} slates in nine of Ohio's congressional districts making him unable to win all delegates in those districts. The state became the big battleground of Super Tuesday and its delegates were split between Romney and Santorum, who won three congressional districts where he didn't have a full slate. This created four <b>unallocated</b> delegates, whose status was to be determined later. But Santorum suspended his campaign before the meeting in the Ohio GOP central committee deciding on the delegates took place and Romney dropped the dispute on May 4 {{in the interest of}} party unity.|$|E
25|$|Secured delegates: These columns do not {{list the}} 117 unbound RNC delegates {{that are not}} a part of the primary {{election}} process. Five candidates secured delegates, they are listed in a candidates' column when they are allocated to him or when they after or at their election have pledge to him. Huntsman's (the fifth candidate) two New Hampshire delegates are listed as uncommitted. These are numbers that the candidates have actually secured for themselves, not projected counts or counts after a candidate has suspended his campaign and released his candidates. The uncommitted column (last) lists both elected delegates that are still uncommitted and <b>unallocated</b> delegates.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} land tenure in the Great Western Woodlands is <b>Unallocated</b> Crown Land (UCL), which makes up 60% of the area. UCL {{is the lowest}} category of land classification under Western Australian state law – sometimes called ‘orphan country’. Pastoral leases cover 20% of the area. Conservation reserves of various types represent about 15% of the region, with Class A conservation protection over 3.6% of the land, Class B on 4.5% and Class C on 4.5%. Class B and C reserves have relatively little security of tenure, while Class A reserves require parliamentary approval for any tenure changes. The remaining land in the Great Western Woodlands is divided between shire reserves, Crown reserves and freehold land.|$|E
25|$|However, with a Militant-dominated Labour {{council in}} Liverpool having been elected in 1983, Heffer found {{increasing}} trouble in his constituency. The Liverpool Labour Party adopted Militant's policy of a 'deficit budget'. This included no cuts to jobs and services, and no rent and rates increases higher than inflation, {{and a promise}} to increase services and confront central government with the £270 million stolen, it claimed, in grants from the city since the Conservatives {{came to power in}} 1979. It was voted into office by a landslide. The administration produced a financial crisis, since the budget, set in April by the outgoing Tory-Liberal coalition, included <b>unallocated</b> cuts of £6 million, including 1000 job losses, which the administration cancelled, and an extra 1000 jobs had been promised instead. When the council met on 29 March 1984 it was told clearly that the Militant proposed 'deficit budget' contained an illegal £30 million deficit, but no alternative could get a majority and it went through. All but seven Labour councillors stood by the budget, and Heffer supported the council in its demands of government and after a series of meetings with the Secretary of State for the Environment Patrick Jenkin, the government eventually gave way and allowed practically all of the budget.|$|E
500|$|Johnson said {{he found}} SSH logs on the MacBook that showed an SFTP connection, from an IP address that {{resolved}} to Manning's aunt's home, to a Swedish IP address with links to WikiLeaks. Also found was a text file named [...] "Readme", attached to the logs and apparently written by Manning to Assange, which called the Iraq and Afghan War logs [...] "possibly {{one of the most}} significant documents of our time, removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetric warfare". The investigators testified they had also recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric Schmiedl, a Boston mathematician, in which Manning said she was the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack ("Collateral Murder") video. Johnson said there had been two attempts to delete material from the MacBook. The operating system had been re-installed in January 2010, and on or around January 31, 2010, an attempt had been made to erase the hard drive by doing a [...] "zero-fill", which involves overwriting material with zeroes. The material was recovered after the overwrite attempts from <b>unallocated</b> space.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{types of}} gold [...] "{{accounts}}" [...] are available. Different accounts impose varying types of intermediation between {{the client and}} their gold. One {{of the most important}} differences between accounts is whether the gold is held on an allocated (fully reserved) or <b>unallocated</b> (pooled) basis. <b>Unallocated</b> gold accounts are a form of fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of a}} run on the issuer's gold on deposit. Another major difference is the strength of the account holder's claim on the gold, in the event that the account administrator faces gold-denominated liabilities (due to a short or naked short position in gold for example), asset forfeiture, or bankruptcy.|$|E

2500|$|In 1834, all of {{the lands}} {{acquired}} in the Louisiana Purchase that were as yet <b>unallocated</b> and lay east of the Missouri River (generally, the Dakotas, Iowa and the western half of Minnesota) were attached to the Michigan Territory, an area that was officially characterized as [...] "north of Missouri and east of the Missouri and White Earth Rivers." [...] At this point, Michigan Territory included {{what is now the}} states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and {{a large portion of the}} Dakotas.|$|E
2500|$|Interest in a {{four-year}} school immediately arose. [...] In 1963, the original MU campuses in Columbia and Rolla were {{merged with the}} privately owned University of Kansas City to form the present day University of Missouri System. [...] The newly formed system immediately won permission to upgrade the Normandy center to a full-fledged four-year institution. [...] The transfer from the Normandy school district to the University of Missouri System was delayed when the Missouri Supreme Court in 4–3 decision ruled that the school could not transfer the property without a formal open bid process. [...] The Missouri General Assembly enacted legislation signed by Governor John Dalton on October 13, 1963, enabling the transfer and the university bought the property for $60,000 from <b>unallocated</b> funds at the university's disposal.|$|E

50|$|The total {{quantity}} of <b>unallocated</b> gold {{is estimated to}} be 15,000 tonnes at the end of 2008 which supports the 2,134 tonnes on average of spot gold trade through London every day representing 14.2% of the pool. This compares to average daily turnover in UK equities of between 0.34% and 0.63% for the 12 months ending September 2009. While members of the LBMA provide no information on the backing for <b>unallocated</b> gold the improbably high turnover is suggestive they are operating a fractional reserve system where <b>unallocated</b> accounts are only partially backed by physical gold. Similarly to a bank run this makes LBMA <b>unallocated</b> gold accounts susceptible to loss if a sufficient number of market participants request delivery of physical bullion.|$|E
