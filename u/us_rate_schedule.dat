The Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (MLGW), a distribution system in Memphis, Tennessee, purchased gas from Texas Gas under a contract in which MLGW was required to reimburse Texas Gas for any increases {{in the cost of}} gas provided by United Gas. Each of these contracts had a clause which specified that the rate for the gas was that on the United Gas <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> on file with the FPC or any effective <b>rate</b> <b>schedule.</b> On September 30, 1955, United Gas filed a new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> with the FPC which proposed to increase the contract rates. The FPC suspended the rates as provided in the NGA and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the lawfulness of the new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule.</b> The distribution companies and MLG&W intervened in the proceeding. After the Supreme Court issued its Mobile Gas decision which held that the unilateral filing of a new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> could not abrogate a gas contract with a specified rate on February 27, 1956, the distribution companies and MLGW moved to dismiss the new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule.</b> The FPC upheld the new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> on the basis that the distribution companies had contracted to essentially pay the [...] "going" [...] rate on the effective United Gas <b>rate</b> <b>schedule,</b> and distinguished Mobile Gas as applying to gas contracts with a fixed rate.|$|R

We construct {{a framework for}} connection access control and <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> that supports this class of applications by maximizing long term average utility. We present a decomposition of the problem into connection access control and <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> layers. The connection access control layer considers current commitments and decides whether to admit new sessions.

40|$|Federal {{military}} installations often receive electric utility service under ``special`` <b>rate</b> <b>schedules</b> designed for large government and institutional facilities. These schedules {{are intended to}} be financially beneficial to the government when compared with rates offered to large non-federal customers. Past experience, however, indicates that this {{may not always be}} the case. Determining the applicability and cost-effectiveness of alternative <b>rate</b> <b>schedules</b> is a complicated process requiring the analysis of utility bills and computer simulation of diurnal load data and utility rate structures. A layer of complexity is added if the federal installation receives service from more than one electric utility and is considering consolidated billing. In 1993, under a project with the Air Force, Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) examined the possibility of developing a methodology to facilitate the evaluation of alternative <b>rate</b> <b>schedules.</b> To meet the objectives of this project, PNL performed two tasks as follows: Task 1, PNL developed a proof-of-concept prototype computer program (RateSET) that compares the costs under a government <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> to those back-calculated under an alternative <b>rate</b> <b>schedule.</b> The program was used to recreate the structure of both <b>rate</b> <b>schedules</b> and then to process 24 monthly billing statements and the associated 30 -minute demand data for the two year period. For the initial test case, actual data were used from a large US Army Forces Command installation located in Georgia. Task 2, PNL then reviewed the tariff packages for each of the major electric utilities providing service to Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina. The primary objective of this alternative <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> screening and evaluation process was to characterize the process itself, identify problem areas, and develop a workable approach to use in future similar evaluations...|$|R

50|$|The opinion also {{explained}} that the NGA {{was different from the}} Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) then in effect, which required transportation companies to use the same <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> for all customers and did not authorize special rates to be set by contract with individual customers as the large number of customers engaged in interstate commerce did not permit an administrative agency to review contracts with special rates. In comparison, there were relatively few gas companies and customers, and the NGA’s authorization to set rates using contracts recognized that dedicated infrastructure and capacity with individualized costs might be required for a gas company to serve a customer. Based on this difference, the Court then distinguished the prior case of Armour Packing Co. v. United States (1908), where a contract between a shipper and a railroad used the same rate as in a <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The railroad later filed a new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> with the ICC.

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{throughput}} maximization problem in the downlink of CDMA data networks. Proper transmission <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> of data service in downlink can reduce the intra-cell interference; hence maximize the throughput of the downlink. Various works have been done for the transmission <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> to maximize total throughput in a CDMA network. Among these works, only the best effort method can be applied as a practical scheduling scheme. However, in this method some users may have no chance to receive their data at all during the whole scheduling time horizon since this method considers only throughput maximization. In this paper, we consider the fairness among users while maximizing total throughput of the system. Since the interference from neighboring cells of a certain cell to each user in the cell is stochastic, this problem becomes a stochastic optimization problem. The fairness among users is modeled in two different ways, a hard minimum requirement constraint and a soft minimum requirement constraint for each user. Transmission <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> methods for the two models have been suggested and tested through numerical simulation. Our simulation test showed that the method for the model with soft constraint has excellent performance in both throughput and fairness.

40|$|Residential {{natural gas}} {{customers}} in the United States face volumetric charges for natural gas that average about 30 % more than marginal cost. The large markup on natural gas – {{which is used to}} cover the fixed infrastructure and operating costs of the local distribution companies – is widely recognized to be inefficient. Nonetheless, attempts to reduce volumetric charges, and cover the revenue shortfall through increased fixed monthly fees, have faced opposition {{based on the belief that}} current <b>rate</b> <b>schedules</b> have desirable distributional consequences. We evaluate this claim empirically using nationally-representative household-level data. We find that natural gas consumption is weakly correlated with household income, so current <b>rate</b> <b>schedules</b> are only mildly progressive. Under current <b>rate</b> <b>schedules,</b> high-volume customers pay a disproportionately large share of fixed costs, but these exhibit a weak correlation with high-income households. The correlation is somewhat weaker still when we consider alternative indicators of household financial stress, such as poverty status or number of children in the household. We show, for example, that poor households with multiple children would receive lower bills on average under marginal cost pricing.

50|$|The {{number of}} pages in the federal tax law grew from 400 in 1913 to over 72,000 in 2011. The {{increase}} in complexity {{can be attributed to}} {{an increase in the number}} and range of activities being taxed, an increase in the number of exemptions, credits, and deductions available, an increase in the subtlety of the rules governing taxation and the edge cases explicitly spelled out based on historical experience, and an increase in the base of taxpayers making it necessary to offer longer, more explicit instructions for less sophisticated taxpayers.
