40|$|A tab placed {{suitably}} on {{a nozzle}} {{that produces a}} jet in a cross-flow can reduce the penetration of the jet. This effect, achieved when <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> {{is placed on the}} windward side of the nozzle relative to the cross flow, may be of interest in film cooling applications. Wind tunnel experiments are carried out, in the momentum ratio (J) range of 10 - 90, to investigate <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> geometry that would maximize this effect. The preliminary results show that a 'delta tab' having a base width approximately fifty percent of the nozzle diameter may be considered optimum. With a given <b>tab</b> size, <b>the</b> effect is more pronounced at higher J. Reduction in jet penetration by as much as 40 % is observed. Comparable reduction in jet penetration is also obtained when a triangular shaped tab is placed flush with the tunnel wall or with its apex tilted down into the jet nozzle (the 'delta tab' being the configuration in which the apex is tilted <b>up).</b> However, <b>the</b> delta <b>tab</b> involves <b>the</b> least flow blockage and pressure loss. Relative to the baseline case, the lateral spreading of the jet is found to be more with <b>the</b> delta <b>tab</b> but less with other orientations of <b>the</b> <b>tab...</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary. [...] It {{has been}} {{suggested}} in some American investigations that differential gearing, combined with adjustment of the aileron floating angle {{by means of a}} tab, may be a powerful method of balancing ailerons. This report sets out the theory of this method of balance and analysesit in relation to the most pressing problem of aileron design, which is to obtain close balance at high speed without overbalance in any part of the range, or uncomfortable lightness at slow speed. It is shown that this result can be achieved more directly by differential balance than by any other method if the differential and <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> setting are nicely adjusted to the natural floating properties of the aileron. Thus if the aileron tends to float up as incidence increases, a differential giving more downward than upward movement must be used, and this must be combined with an upward-set tab; while if the aileron tends to float down as the incidence increases, a differential giving more upward than downward movement must be used, combined with a downset <b>tab.</b> After examining <b>the</b> possible disadvantages of the downward differential, and <b>the</b> loads set <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>tab,</b> it is concluded that there is a strong case for exploration in flight of differential gearing as a major means of aileron bMance. Some notes on the geometry of differential gearing are given in an Appendix. 1. Introduction. [...] In the past,. when ailerons have been moved differentially, it has always been with the object rather of improving the rolling moments than of lightening the stick force. -The potentiality of differential gearing as a major means of aileion balance has been broache...|$|R
50|$|Carolyn R. Mobley is an {{inventor}} who patented a tab construction for a sanitary napkin.

5000|$|In 1970 Mecki Mark Men were {{heralded as}} the first Swedish rock band {{to embark on a}} tour the U.S. For three months they made the city of Chicago their home base, from which they {{travelled}} to various other cities to play festivals with Sly and the Family Stone, Jethro Tull, Pentangle, Mountain, Grand Funk Railroad, Paul Butterfield, and The Byrds. The tour ended in disarray, as the band had overstayed their visas and racked up a considerable debt.

Their manager also convinced Finnair to fly the band home on credit. The group had hoped that their U.S. tour would help bolster sales and maintain their record deals with Limelight and Phillips, but it didn't, and both labels dropped the group. Marathon was released by the Swedish label Sonet, which had also issued the soundtrack to Hår, and the royalties from this third Mecki Mark Men album were used to reimburse the Mecki Mark Men's manager.
