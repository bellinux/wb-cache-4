40|$|FABRICATION OF MICROENGINEERED POLYMERIC FILMS AND INVESITGATION OF BIORESPONSES TO THE SUBSTRATA Biofouling is the {{undesired}} attachment, accumulation and {{proliferation of}} biomass (biopolymers and organisms) on various surfaces. This process imparts adverse influences on {{many aspects of}} human life. Without introducing any biocidal agents into the materials, a biomimetic micro-topographical structure replicated onto poly(dimethysiloxane) elastomer (PDMSe) has shown antifouling characteristics against marine and medical microorganisms. The purpose of this work {{was to investigate the}} efficacy of this pattern on antifouling when it was replicated onto various polymeric substrata {{with a wide range of}} mechanical and energetic properties. A method was developed to covalently graft a demolding/antisticking layer, short-chain poly(dimethylsiloxane), onto a silicon wafer. A series of polymeric materials were chosen with varied mechanical properties (Young s modulus ranging from 1. 4 to 3, 300 MPa) and surface free energies (ranging from 21. 5 to 42. 4 mJ/m 2). Polymer films with the micro-engineered patterns were then readily fabricated from the treated wafer using solution casting method. The treated silicon wafer was versatile and robust in replication of topographical features onto those polymeric materials with high fidelity (> 99 %). The resulting films were tested against one marine microorganism, Ulva linza zoospore. The Sharklet textured surfaces with feature heights of 2. 1 and 3. 0 microns were tested and corresponding smooth surfaces served as controls. The polymeric films were attached to glass slides with an epoxy glue, which was found to be strongly attractive to the spores. Assuming the influence of the epoxy glue was the same among all the samples, data were analyzed and statistical analyses were performed. Two groups of the surface properties were important for establishing predictive attachment models. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the unknown magnitude of the epoxy glue problem. One bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, was used to test the antifouling capability for the topographical surfaces. The bioactivity measured by the metabolic rate (BioTimer assay) showed that there were more bioactive cells on the Sharklet textured surface than on the smooth one, regardless of the chemical nature of the substrate. SEM imaging showed the opposite: mature biofilms were formed on the smooth surfaces, while disrupted microcolonies were prevailing on the Sharklet textured surfaces. High-dose antibiotic treatments suggested that the bacterial cells on the Sharklet surface were more easily killed after a 12 -hr culturing. A new strategy of treating bacteria-associated infections for implanted medical devices was proposed. New <b>undercut</b> <b>surface</b> topographical structures were proposed and fabricated.

500|$|Other die {{components}} include cores and slides. Cores are {{components that}} usually produce holes or opening, {{but they can}} be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form <b>undercut</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called pick-outs, are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes. These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part {{at the end of the}} cycle. The core then must be removed by hand. Loose cores are the most expensive type of core, because of the extra labor and increased cycle time. Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines. These vents are usually wide and thin (approximately [...] ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap.

Undercut streambanks and associated reach characteristics were surveyed along 46 sample reaches (each 152 m in length) in 8 streams; all sample reaches occurred in unmanaged forested riparian areas. Drainage areas ranged from 0. 3 to 16. 6 km^ 2. At each <b>undercut</b> location length, <b>surface</b> area, volume, low-flow (summertime) volume, and maximum horizontal depth were measured. Individual <b>undercuts</b> had <b>surface</b> areas ranging from 0. 3 to 27. 7 m^ 2 with a mean value of 2. 6 m^ 2, and lengths ranging from 1. 2 to 15. 2 m with a mean value of 5. 0 m. The area undercut streambanks ranged from 0. 0 to 27. 4 m^ 2 / 100 m of stream, with an average value of 6. 5 m^ 2 / 100 m. The proportion of bankfull channel area undercut ranged from 0. 0 to 4. 5 %, with an average value of 1. 1 %. Reach length undercut ranged from 0. 0 to 23. 6 %, with an average value of 6. 2 %. The values reported {{in this study are}} approximately mid-range in comparison to characteristics of undercut banks reported in studies from Alaska, Montana, and Wisconsin. The % of reach area covered by undercut streambanks in this study is approximately half of that provided by large woody debris. Outside channel bends had approximately 6 times more undercut streambanks than inside bends or straight sections. Streams having a sinuosity index greater than 1. 15 averaged approximately twice as much % <b>surface</b> area <b>undercut</b> than streams having a sinuosity index less than 1. 15. Number of undercuts and undercut characteristics were inversely correlated with channel gradient; significant differences occurring among 1 %, 2 - 4 %, and 5 +% channel gradient classes. Streambanks ranging in height from 1 - 2 m had a higher occurrence of undercut streambanks than either lower or higher streambanks. Undercut streambanks were 4 times more common in "composite" than "non-composite" streambanks. Undercut characteristics appear to be correlated with valley segment type. Channel widths were, on average, significantly narrower at undercut sites when compared to reach average channel widths. However, it does not appear than width characteristics are a cause of undercutting. Based on field observations it appears that flow obstructions (gravel bars, boulders, large woody debris) have little impact on undercut characteristics. Both at-a-site and reach-level comparisons of undercut bank characteristics showed relatively strong correlations with streamside tree densities. Red alder (Alnus rubra) is the most prevalent species found in Coast Range riparian areas, and the most significant species in explaining reach-level differences in undercut characteristics.

The metastable pit current, I, followed a power law relationship I tn during initial growth prior to repassivation. The exponent n increased with temperature, from 0. 5 to 1. 5.

Pristine streams were measured to develop a data base for the streams of the region. Watersheds that had experienced harvests from 12 to 60 years ago which had from 22 to 93 percent of the basal area removed were then measured {{to determine the effects}} of selective harvesting. CWD volumes were computed for all pieces greater than 10 centimeters in diameter at the small end, and at least 1 meter in length. Each piece was classified according to source, association with other debris, age, species, and overall characteristics. No statistical difference could be found in the total volume of CWD when comparing the managed to the pristine streams. Debris volume was found to be directly related to riparian stand basal area, with species composition of the stand being a strong indicator of stand basal area and stream debris volumes. With the exception of large multi-tier jams, which were not present in the six managed streams, the number and distribution of debris associations were found not to be affected by harvesting. Channel morphology measurements were taken along the same 300 meter reaches and included average active channel width and depth, bank slopes, gradient, spherical canopy density, and angular canopy density.

The erosion was {{initiated by the}} alongshore and onshore migration of a supratidal oyster shell ridge that exposed a marsh scarp that is susceptible to lateral retreat in response to both wind-generated and vessel-generated waves <b>undercutting</b> the upper-marsh <b>surface.</b> An instrumented field study was completed between October 2007 and February 2008 to examine {{the relative importance of}} wind-generated and vessel-generated waves to the retreat of the scarp by 0. 21 m along the instrumented transect. On average, there were 14 sailings by container ships per day and up to twice as many sailings by pilot boats ferrying the harbor pilots to container ships offshore, but only those vessels that sailed within 1 m of the high-tide water level had waves capable of reaching the scarp. The vessel-generated waves accounted for ∼ 5 of the cumulative wave energy over the study, but because of their larger height and longer period, they accounted for almost 25 % of the cumulative wave force. It is the locally generated wind waves that account for most of the wave force acting on the exposed scarp and which are largely responsible for the observed retreat. Waves generated during both frontal and tropical storms tend to be associated with storm tides that maintain water levels at or near the elevation of the scarp for several days. Now that the shell ridge has largely migrated past the site and the areas of greater retreat historically are protected by a wedge of sand, it is argued that an increase in vessel traffic and/or the use of larger, post-Panamax ships will not significantly accelerate the retreat of the marsh. © 2010 Coastal Education and Research Foundation...|$|R

Therefore, for allergy sufferers, knee replacements {{in form of}} cemented high-strength oxide ceramic prostheses which reveal excellent tribological behavior are suitable. In addition, the rate of particle induced aseptic loosening may be reduced. For adhesion of bone cement, the smooth ceramic surface, however, exposes inefficient mechanical retention spots as compared with a textured metal <b>surface.</b> <b>Undercuts</b> generated by corundum blasting, which in the short and intermediate term are highly efficient on a CoCrMo surface, are not appropriate on a ceramic surface due to the brittleness of ceramics. The corresponding textures may initiate cracks which will weaken {{the strength of a}} ceramic prosthesis. Due to the lack of textures, mechanical retention is poor or even not existent. Micromotions are facilitated and early aseptic loosening is predictable. Instead silicoating of the ceramic surface will allow specific adhesion and result in better hydrolytic stability of bonding, thereby preventing early aseptic loosening. Silicoating, however, presupposes a clean and chemically active surface which may be achieved by atmospheric plasma or thermal surface treatment. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} silicoating, the bond strengths of atmospheric plasma versus thermal surface treated and silicoated ZPTA (zirconia platelets toughened alumina) surfaces were compared with “as-fired” surfaces by utilizing TiAlV probes (diameter: 6 mm) for traction–adhesive strength test. After preparing samples for traction–adhesive strength test (sequence: ceramic substrate, silicate layer and penetrated silane, protective lacquer (PolyMA), bone cement, TiAlV probe), they were aged up to 150 days at 37 °C in Ringer’s solution. The bond strengths observed for all aging intervals were well above 20 MPa and much higher and more hydrolytic stable for silicoated compared with with “as-fired” ZPTA samples. Silicoating may be effective for achieving high initial bond strength of bone cement on surfaces of oxide ceramics and is also suitable to stabilize bond strengths in the long term under hydrolytic conditions as present in the human body. Activation by atmospheric plasma or thermal surface treatment seems to be effective prior to silicoating. Due to the proposed silicate layer migration, micromotions and debonding should be widely reduced or even eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Trapped ions in Paul traps (radio {{frequency}} ion traps) are {{a promising}} {{candidate for the}} realization of a quantum computer. To date, experimental demonstrations of quantum computing and information processing with trapped ions have been limited to small numbers of quantum bits (qubits). The most prominent challenge to realise ion-trap quantum computation is to scale the system and control {{a large number of}} trapped ions coherently. Surface-electrode ion trap designs which are amenable to various microfabrication techniques offer a path to achieve this. In this work, design, fabrication and key operations of two types of surface-electrode ion traps, i. e. a Y-junction trap and a two-dimensional (2 D) hexagonal lattice trap developed towards scaling ion-trap architectures, are presented. The steps involved in the fabrication of the ion-trap devices included photolithography, wet etch (hydrofluoric acid etch) and dry etch (deep reactive ion and inductively coupled plasma etching), and metal evaporation. The devices were fabricated on SOI substrates with different buried oxide thicknesses (i. e. 5 um and 10 um) and different metals for the trap electrodes (i. e. gold and aluminium). An extremely high-breakdown voltage up to 1 kV was measured in vacuum for the SOI-built test devices with a 10 um-thick buried oxide formed by oxide film-to-oxide film bonding process. This is attributed to the deep V-shaped undercut profile of the buried oxide layer which resulted in a large breakdown path length, and so mitigating surface breakdown effects. Owing to the V-shaped <b>undercut</b> profile, the <b>surface</b> breakdown voltage was improved by 15 % for the devices fabricated on SOI substrates with a 10 um-thick buried oxide. In the first experiment, the demonstration of ytterbium (174 Yb+) ion trapping in the 2 D hexagonal lattice trap is achieved with a relatively long lifetime of a laser-cooled ion up to 90 minutes and ? 5 minutes without cooling in ultra-high vacuum system. The 2 D lattice trap design allows for reliable trapping of 2 D ion lattices, rudimentary shuttling between lattice sites and deterministic introducing of defects into the ion lattice. Based on all these abilities, such a 2 D lattice trap with the predicted reduction of lattice spacing down to 32 um can be configured as a versatile architecture for 2 D quantum simulations with trapped ions. In the second experiment, microparticle trapping in the 2 D lattice trap, performed in air, is achieved with the longest trapping lifetime of 60 minutes. Both gold and aluminium-coated electrodes also lead to comparable trapping performances. Furthermore, the in situ levitation of microparticles is successfully demonstrated at the maximum levitation height of 30 um. This ability provides additional control on the trapping height which increases the overall functionality of the 2 D lattice trap...|$|R
