50|$|A single Miwok feather skirt or cape {{was made}} with {{approximately}} 100 feet <b>of</b> <b>cordage,</b> requiring about 500 plant stalks. A 40-foot-long deer net contained about 7,000 feet <b>of</b> <b>cordage,</b> requiring the harvesting of approximately 35,000 plant stalks. The milkweed stalks were burned in the fall to eliminate dead stalks and stimulate the next year's growth, and to stimulate flower and seed production. Cordage was typically two-ply, though there are some examples at the Field Museum of three- and four-ply Miwok cordage.|$|R

50|$|As Connecticut's {{maritime}} industry grew from trade and fisheries, demand grew for good quality hemp for the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>cordage.</b> In 1740, families {{were ordered to}} sow at least a handful of hempseed {{in an effort to}} boost stocks over coming years.|$|R

40|$|William Smith, CWU {{professor}} of anthropology, excavated Rosa Rockshelter in 1971 and recovered a unique assemblage of preserved plant remains {{from a single}} storage feature. These materials include over 30 fragments <b>of</b> <b>cordage</b> and basketry that date to the Cayuse Phase (ca. 2000 years ago). Fragments of two-ply S twist <b>cordage</b> <b>of</b> Dogbane (Indian Hemp) dominate the assemblage and several of these items are found stitched in tule mat. Several fragments of two-ply Z twist cedar cordage, found woven with cedar plats, probably formed the rims {{of one or more}} open-weave basket. Examples of grass, sage bark, and hair cordage are also represented. The type and frequency <b>of</b> <b>cordage</b> fragments are compared to other larger assemblages from dry caves in the Columbia River Basin to contribute information on the material culture and technological abilities of prehistoric inhabitants from a unique time and place on the Columbia Plateau...|$|R

40|$|The term “cordage” {{refers to}} rope and string, {{and to the}} {{products}} made from these, such as netting. Its presence {{among some of the}} oldest artifacts found on archaeological sites testifies to its usefulness through the ages. In ancient Egypt, the production <b>of</b> <b>cordage</b> was relatively simple, for it could be made by hand without special implements. However, the manufacture of thick rope required the efforts of more than one person and/or the use of special tools. Various materials were used to make cordage, depending on the availability of the necessary plants and also on the intended function <b>of</b> the <b>cordage...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thermal <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> DNA is {{suppressed}} {{in vitro}} in nucleosomes formed with chicken or monkey histones. In contrast, results {{obtained for the}} 2 micron plasmid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are consistent with only 30 % of the DNA being constrained from thermal untwisting in vivo. In this paper, we examine thermal <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> several plasmids in yeast cells, nuclei, and nuclear extracts. All show the same quantitative degree <b>of</b> thermal <b>untwisting,</b> indicating that this phenomenon is independent of DNA sequence. Highly purified yeast plasmid chromatin also shows a large degree <b>of</b> thermal <b>untwisting,</b> whereas circular chromatin reconstituted using chicken histones is restrained from thermal untwisting in yeast nuclear extracts. Thus, the difference in thermal untwisting between yeast chromatin and that assembled with chicken histones is most likely {{due to differences in}} the constituent histone proteins...|$|R

50|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} stabilizing DNA at such high temperatures are proteins {{such as a}} type I topoisomerase that supertwists the DNA making spontaneously <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> the DNA more difficult.

Nothing was furled; but as every thing was hauled up, or lowered, the squall had little to waste its fury on.
