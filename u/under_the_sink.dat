If he crawled <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and drank the same {{poisonous}} concoction of heavy metals, formaldehyde, foreign proteins, multiple viruses {{and a host of}} other toxins, the emergency room would have called it poisoning. Because it was injected into his body, itâ€™s called 'a coincidence'!" ...|$|E

60|$|The next {{applicant}} {{offered to}} come for three pounds--thought six pounds too much. She expressed her willingness {{to sleep in the}} back kitchen: a shakedown <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> was all she wanted. She likewise had yearnings towards Unitarianism.|$|E

60|$|But Mr. Baynes {{had kept}} his most {{sinister}} exhibit to the last. From <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood. Then from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of charred bone.|$|E
6000|$|Against {{her usual}} habit, Alvina joined the plumber {{and her father}} in the scullery. Arthur Witham saluted her with some respect. She liked his blue eyes and tight figure. He was keen and sly in business, very watchful, and slow to commit himself. Now he poked and peered and crept <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> Alvina watched him half disappear--she handed him a candle--and she laughed to herself seeing his tight, well-shaped hind-quarters {{protruding}} from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> like {{the wrong end of}} a dog from a kennel. He was keen after money, was Arthur--and bossy, creeping slyly after his own self-importance and power. He wanted power--and he would creep quietly after it till he got it: as much as he was capable of. His [...] "h's" [...] were a barbed-wire fence and entanglement, preventing his unlimited progress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, a plumber. Used {{to drink}} heavily--couldn't keep a job {{more than a}} week. Now, you can't drag him from his work. Came to my house to fix a pipe under the kitchen sink--wouldn't quit at six o'clock. Got in <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and begged {{to be allowed to}} stay--said he hated to go home. We had to drag him out with a rope. But here we are at your hotel." ...|$|E
50|$|At home Buddy {{tried to}} fix a {{blockage}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>sink</b> and Terry came round to deliver news. Arctic Records talked to Terry and the Video King about working with him. Terry fixed <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and Buddy invited him to come along for a meal to celebrate his seventeenth birthday. Buddy's parents agreed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{also began}} to deteriorate; due to leaks, mold formed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> bathroom <b>sinks.</b> Windows, pipes and doors were also in need of repair but the school didn't have enough money for a full renovation.|$|R

60|$|Well, it's {{not worth}} recounting my jewvenile follies (what trix {{we used to}} play the applewoman! and how we put snuff in the old clark's Prayer-book--my eye!); but one day, a genlmn entered the school-room--it was on the very day when I went to subtraxion--and asked the master for a young lad for a servant. They pitched upon me glad enough; and nex day found me {{sleeping}} in the sculry, close <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> at Mr. Bago's country-house at Pentonwille.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the thought}} of Billy, next morning, that led Saxon to go <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> unscrew the cap to the catchtrap, and rescue the five-dollar piece. Prisoners were not well fed, she had been told; and {{the thought of}} placing clams and dry bread before Billy, after thirty days of prison fare, was too appalling for her to contemplate. She knew how he liked to spread his butter on thick, how he liked thick, rare steak fried on a dry hot pan, and how he liked coffee that was coffee and plenty of it.|$|E
60|$|So the new {{convert to}} {{joie de vivre}} emerged upon the passage, his decorations a little scattered, but that respectable hatful of fungi still under his arm. He hesitated at the three ways, and decided on the kitchen. Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling with the key, gave up the attempt to imprison his host, and fled into the scullery, only to be {{captured}} before he could open {{the door into the}} yard. Mr. Clarence is singularly reticent of the details of what occurred. It seems that Mr. Coombes' transitory irritation had vanished again, and he was once more a genial playfellow. And as there were knives and meat choppers about, Clarence very generously resolved to humour him and so avoid anything tragic. It is beyond dispute that Mr. Coombes played with Mr. Clarence to his heart's content; they {{could not have been more}} playful and familiar if they had known each other for years. He insisted gaily on Clarence trying the fungi, and, after a friendly tussle, was smitten with remorse at the mess he was making of his guest's face. It also appears that Clarence was dragged <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and his face scrubbed with the blacking brush--he being still resolved to humour the lunatic at any cost--and that finally, in a somewhat dishevelled, chipped, and discoloured condition, he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the back door, the shopway being barred by Jennie. Mr. Coombes' wandering thoughts then turned to Jennie. Jennie had been unable to unfasten the shop door, but she shot the bolts against Mr. Coombes' latch-key, and remained in possession of the shop for the rest of the evening.|$|E
50|$|Twelve years later, Death Rattle was revived for volume 2, {{publishing}} 18 issues between October 1985-October 1988 <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Kitchen <b>Sink</b> Comix imprint. <b>The</b> {{first five}} issues were in full color, but for issue #6 onwards the title reverted to black-and-white.|$|R
6000|$|And {{he waved}} his hand round and round, over and <b>under</b> <b>the</b> slowly <b>sinking</b> glass. Finally he took it by the bottom, pulled it down and placed it very {{carefully}} on the table. [...] "Eh?" [...] he said to me, and laughed.|$|R
50|$|The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck {{tells the}} story of the {{breakout}} of the German battleship Bismarck into the Atlantic as a major threat to the convoys that sustained Britain in the early days of World War II and the Royal Navy's desperate pursuit and destruction of the Bismarck. A movie based on Forester's book, <b>Sink</b> <b>the</b> Bismarck! was released by Twentieth Century-Fox in 1960, with the book reprinted in paperback <b>under</b> <b>the</b> title <b>Sink</b> <b>the</b> Bismarck!

50|$|The {{second album}} was Songs From <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sink,</b> a {{collection}} of songs written between 1997 and 2002 which stresses his anarchist beliefs and is complemented by his clever guitar melodies. Yantz left the band shortly after Songs from <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sink</b> was released, and was replaced for a few shows by Kevin Holland and later by Shawn St. Clair (of Endless Nightmare, Lost Cause, Stations, the Bad Dudes and Wrought With Sickness), who currently plays bass.|$|E

500|$|U-21 {{arrived in}} her {{operational}} area off Gallipoli on 25 May; that day, she encountered the British pre-dreadnought battleship [...] Hersing brought his U-boat to within [...] of his target and fired a single torpedo, which hit Triumph. U-21 then dived <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> battleship {{to escape the}} destroyers hunting her. Hersing then took his boat to the sea floor {{to wait for the}} Allied forces to abandon the chase. After twenty-eight hours on the sea floor, U-21 surfaced to recharge her batteries and bring in fresh air. On 27 May, Hersing attacked and sank his second battleship, [...] This time, the British had attempted to protect her with torpedo nets and several small ships, but Hersing was able to aim a torpedo through <b>the</b> defenses. Majestic <b>sank</b> in <b>the</b> span of four minutes. These two successes brought significant dividends: all Allied capital ships were withdrawn to protected anchorages and were thus unable to bombard Ottoman positions on the peninsula. For these two successes, the crew of U-21 was awarded the Iron Cross by Kaiser Wilhelm II, while Hersing himself received the Pour le MÃ©rite, Germany's highest award for valor.|$|R
60|$|But outside all was beautiful, very beautiful. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> sun {{could be}} seen hanging just above the purple-green hills to the northwest. Robins clucked, orioles whistled, a ring-dove uttered its never changing, sorrowful, sweet love-note. A thrush, high on a poplar, sang to the setting sun a {{wonderful}} hymn, and the vivid green valley, with its white houses and red barns, was flooded with orange light, heaped and brimming full of radiance and fragrance.|$|R

50|$|Sgt. Mike McHugh of the Lincoln {{police arrived}} at the house within five minutes. After briefly talking with Barbara Barker, {{he went into the}} Risch house. In the kitchen, he found the bloody smears on the walls, an {{overturned}} table, and the handset of the wall-mounted telephone ripped loose and thrown in the wastebasket, which had been taken from its usual place <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and left {{in the middle of the}} floor.|$|E
50|$|At the Halpert residence, Dwight embarks on {{a search}} for the iPod only to find mold <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and moves in for several days while he reconstructs the cabinets. Dwight and Angela make the final {{revisions}} to the parenting contract, but Dwight begins to have second thoughts after an encounter with Pam's friend Isabel (Kelen Coleman), with whom he had a one night stand at Jim and Pam's wedding. He signs the contract, but decides to hold it off.|$|E
60|$|What had {{happened}} was simple. The cook, endeavoring {{to take a}} turn of the line too late, had failed, and the hemp ran through his half-frozen fingers, chafing the skin from them. Seeing Thurston floundering in his direction over the boulders, he valiantly strove to check it, regardless of the pain until it was whipped clear of his slackening grasp and the trolley rushed downwards towards the torrent. Thurston was abreast of it before it splashed in, and had just time to see its occupant, still clutching <b>the</b> rope, drawn <b>under</b> by <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> wire, before he plunged recklessly into the foam.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mobile home}} {{should have a}} small metal tag {{on the outside of}} each section. If you cannot locate a tag, {{you should be able to}} find details about the home in the {{electrical}} panel box. This tag should also reveal a manufacturing date. [...] Modular homes do not have metal tags on the outside but will have a dataplate installed inside <b>the</b> home, usually <b>under</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>sink</b> or in a closet. The dataplate will provide information such as the manufacturer, third party inspection agency, appliance information, and manufacture date.|$|R
6000|$|... "Roughly speaking," [...] said Gibberne, [...] "an {{object in}} these latitudes falls 16 {{feet in the}} first second. This glass is falling 16 feet in a second now. Only, you see, it hasn't been falling yet for the {{hundredth}} part of a second. That gives you {{some idea of the}} pace of my Accelerator." [...] And he waved his hand round and round, over and <b>under</b> <b>the</b> slowly <b>sinking</b> glass. Finally, he took it by the bottom, pulled it down, and placed it very carefully on the table. [...] "Eh?" [...] he said to me, and laughed.|$|R
5000|$|The next day, he is {{fixing the}} garbage {{disposal}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> when his ex-wife {{comes to the}} house for a visit. She is under the impression that Webber is living in their old home until the phone rings and the answering machine plays the Gates' message. Webber attacks his ex-wife and shoves her head into the exposed blades of the garbage disposal. He wraps her body in plastic wrap and stores it in the crawlspace with his other victims.|$|E
50|$|Max {{maintains}} an affable, loquacious facade. Once inside the bathroom, {{he starts to}} chip away at the tile <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> When Jill rushes {{to the bathroom to}} see what he is doing, Max impishly encourages her to leave him to his work. He closes the door and then takes a very loud shower. Meanwhile, Brian has been informed that a team from the World Health Organization is coming to interview him about his work. He calls Jill to share the news, and in his glee, he dismisses her concerns about Max.|$|E
5000|$|A key {{narrative}} {{element in}} the film is the central character literally [...] "losing her head" [...] on the train tripâ€”again inspired by a true-life anecdote involving his ill grandmother, who had once asked Dion's mother to fetch her head from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> believing that it had rolled under there. Dion decided to set the film on a train, with the film's title a reference to Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s The Lady Vanishes. Before making the film, he watched and researched films about trains as well as films set on trains.|$|E
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of corporate bonds contain a <b>sinking</b> fund provision. <b>The</b> wide use of sinking funds has prompted both theoretical and empirical investigations. However, none has provided a satisfactory explanation {{for the existence of}} a <b>sinking</b> fund provision. <b>The</b> signalling implications of sinking funds is examined, and it is shown that, <b>under</b> information asymmetry, <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> fund amortization rate provides a credible signal for the quality of the firm. In a separating equilibrium, better quality firms choose higher sinking fund amortization rates in their bond issues. A latent index model is proposed for testing <b>the</b> hypothesis of <b>sinking</b> fund signalling. <b>The</b> empirical evidence indicates that <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> fund amortization rate signals the credit quality of the firm...|$|R
50|$|A {{repair ship}} was {{attacked}} on 28 April with two electrical torpedoes. The first blew the bow off and <b>the</b> second hit <b>under</b> <b>the</b> mainmast.

At {{the end of}} this patrol, the submarine sailed to Pearl Harbor for upkeep and leave.|$|R
50|$|Under Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I Parties can {{recognise}} the biosequestration, {{the removal}} of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by Carbon sinks, created by direct human-induced afforestation, reforestation and deforestation since 1990, in determining whether they have met their emission reduction commitments <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Protocol. When <b>sinks</b> {{have resulted in the}} net removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, Annex I Parties can issue removal units (RMUs).|$|R
