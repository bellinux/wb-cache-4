500|$|Many {{critics were}} {{extremely}} {{pleased with the}} call back to the teapot and Jim's note from [...] "Christmas Party". Adams felt that the scene, before the reveal of the note, was properly executed, and that the note made it even better. Sepinwall called it [...] "a fabulous payoff for longtime fans". Cornet called the sequence [...] "effective". Rick Porter of Zap2it wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "nice move" [...] {{on the part of the}} writers for [...] "not letting <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> Jim wrote on the card from 'Christmas Party' [...] it has to be pretty epic." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Simon Price of The Independent, [...] "It Ain't Easy" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of [...] "Rock Is Dead" [...] by Marilyn Manson. Alex Roginski of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song [...] "utilises electro clash for a grinding foray into R" [...] K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic noted that the song [...] "pits a menacingly swung, twangy guitar riff", which according to him is [...] "lifted so blatantly" [...] from Depeche Mode's song, [...] "Personal Jesus". Buchanan spoke of the song's lyrical content and meaning, saying: [...] "It's basically about us as people. It's not easy being where we are now, {{trying to keep a}} balance between normality and doing this. When you're content within yourself, you should know how you are, and people around <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we're like." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, dash it all, this {{is clear}} madness," [...] cried Lord John. [...] "Each of <b>us</b> seems to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{the others did}} and none of <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> he did himself. Let's put it all {{together}} from the first. We got into a first-class smoker, that's clear, ain't it? Then we began to quarrel over friend Challenger's letter in the Times." ...|$|R
60|$|Beat after beat falls sombre and dull. The wind is unchanging, {{not one of}} <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> <b>What</b> will be in {{the final}} lull When we find the place where this dead road goes.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} hearing Gregson's view of the matter," [...] Holmes observed. [...] "Would you mind letting <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you have seen and done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought they {{would have tried to}} find us first, so as to let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they were going to do," [...] said Ralph.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you would}} but let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> your {{business}} is," [...] said Mrs. Jennings, [...] "we might {{see whether it}} could be put off or not." ...|$|E
60|$|Then we parted {{without more}} words, for neither of <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to say, and about midnight he sailed {{on with the}} wind, taking his chance of {{grounding}} on the sandbanks in the darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she remarked thoughtfully, [...] "none of <b>us</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> {{there is}} in the future, and there are signs that you have {{intelligence}} and grit in you." [...] Then she dismissed the subject. [...] "I think you might take me for a row," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|None of <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the African flag was, {{although}} Corny {{suggested that}} it was probably black. But I told her that if we raised a black flag before the queen's palace, we should bring down the authorities on us, sure. They'd think we had started a retail piratical establishment.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{friend the}} Baron de Grost," [...] he explained, {{indicating}} Peter. [...] "I am the Marquis de Sogrange. Let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{we can do}} to serve you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Four {{hundred and}} sixteen, {{ordinary}} communication," [...] observed the vice-admiral, with his eye {{still at the}} glass. [...] "Look up that, Bunting, and let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are men {{who would}} call the whole thing crazy, and they'd have some reason for doing so," [...] he said. [...] "Most of <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> Merril is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I {{could not}} help it. I am only so sorry we kept him away from you when you wanted him so much; {{but we did not}} know, and he was Sir Stephen's right hand, and we none of <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to do without him; but if he had only told--" ...|$|R
6000|$|L. Yes, Lily, {{it would}} be well if she only <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> a time it takes; and I wish any of <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> a time {{crystallisation}} takes, for that is consummately fine packing. The particles of the rock are thrown down, just as Isabel brings her things--in a heap; and innumerable Lilies, not of the valley, but of the rock, come to pack them. But it takes such a time! ...|$|R
50|$|We pray to {{the time}} travellers. May they let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> of <b>what</b> is to come {{and how to make}} it even better.|$|R

6000|$|... "And that paleness," [...] said Ham Sandwich. [...] "Comes from thought--that's what {{it comes}} from. Hell! duffers like <b>us</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> real thought is." ...|$|R
5000|$|Former classmate Caitie Parker remembered Loughner as a [...] "pot head". Loughner has {{a history}} of drug use, having been arrested in September 2007 for {{possession}} of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. [...] "I haven't seen him in person since '07," [...] Parker recalled in early 2011. [...] "I'm looking back at this as a 14-19 year old...who knows if any of <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> for sure we were yet." ...|$|R
5000|$|Streisand {{had already}} {{starred in the}} Broadway musical of Funny Girl, with seven hundred performances. And {{although}} she knew the part well, Wyler still had to mold her stage role for the screen. She naturally wanted {{to be involved in}} the film's production, often asking Wyler questions, but they got along well. [...] "Things were ironed out when she discovered some of <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> we were doing," [...] kidded Wyler.|$|R
6000|$|... "'No, no. This is {{only where}} we {{compress}} it. But never mind that. All {{we wish you}} to do is to examine the machine and to let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is wrong with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd better let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> your offer is, and lave my sisther alone. It doesn't do {{to bring}} every old woman's story in, when we're talking business; so, if you plaze, we won't {{calculate}} on Feemy's marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unless I am entirely mistaken, madam, {{the end of}} the {{proceedings}} in your house is at hand. You will damage your own interests by interfering. Let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we are about at last. Let the end come." ...|$|E
60|$|But I merely {{shook my}} head, my {{excitement}} was as dead as ditch-water, and my distaste for the prolongation of my mortal span {{had come back}} upon me more strongly than ever. Besides, we neither of <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> {{the effects of the}} fire might be. The result upon She had not been of an encouraging nature, and of the exact causes that produced that result we were, of course, ignorant.|$|R
60|$|We {{had been}} in prison for about a fortnight, when one day--oh! shall I ever forget it?--we heard in the {{distance}} a noise like the rumbling of thunder; nearer and nearer it came, and soon the sound became less confused, cries and shrieks could be heard above that rumbling din; but so weird and menacing did those cries seem that instinctively--though none of <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they meant--we all felt a nameless terror grip our hearts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd do {{something}} more, something personal, if I could. Perhaps I shall be able to, next winter. Why {{is it so}} difficult for all of <b>us</b> to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, 'tis their {{advantage}} over the pampered and idle. Look at the heavens, man, and let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> thou thinkest of their appearance. Is there the stuff in thy Winkelried to ride out a storm like this {{we may have to}} encounter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{wonderful}} {{how close}} poor Peter was," [...] she said, {{in the same}} undertones. [...] "We none of <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{he might have had}} on his mind. I only hope and trust he wasn't a worse liver than we think of, Martha." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay," [...] said she, [...] "and let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the {{business}} is that seems so urgent. You can speak freely. There is no one here beside ourselves except the minister of the king, {{and there is nothing}} to be concealed from him." ...|$|E

5000|$|Prudence, {{which enables}} <b>us</b> to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to desire or to avoid, attains heroicity when it {{coincides with the}} [...] "gift of counsel", i.e. a clear, Divinely aided insight into right and wrong conduct.|$|R
