40|$|Dentists {{are often}} taught that 'overcure' {{is better than}} ' undercure'. <b>Undercure</b> is said to cause serious problem with resin {{composite}} fillings. Actually it does not always happen this way. Overcure also has several bad impacts {{that have never been}} thought before by practitioners. Researchers claim that curing time informed by resin composite manufacturers is not always correct. Filling material is not the only factor that determines the correct curing time for each filling. Light cure unit performance also plays a major role. </span...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} curing a {{pneumatic}} tire {{as one of}} the most important working procedures, directly identify the quality of tire, because the physical and mechanical properties of rubber in the state of overcure or <b>undercure</b> are significantly decreased. The finite element analysis (FEA) method was introduced to evaluate the tire's state of cure (SOC) in this paper, and the optimization of cure conditions of giant radial tire was also referred to ensure that tire constituents achieved the proper SOC and improved the quality of tire. Results indicated that when the cure time was cut down 35 minutes by optimization process, most part of tire compound is appropriate cured. So that the energy cost was remarkable cut down and the productivity was rising in evidence...|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} {{is a general}} numerical tool for solving the field equations of engineering practice, and this paper demonstrates its use in modeling the nonisothermal cure of pultruded composite material. A very simple grid is used in this case to model a narrow strip of material, and this grid is then solved using a time-stepping transient algorithm to simulate {{the passage of the}} strip along the pultruder die. As time proceeds, heat is conducted into the strip from the heated boundaries at the die walls, and cure proceeds at a rate dependent on the local temperature. The computer model can be used to minimize the time needed for sufficient cure, and helps avoid such processing errors as <b>undercure</b> or thermal degradation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{postcure}} high energy (gamma), ultraviolet (UV) and thermal treatment on {{the properties of}} polyester-melamine clearcoats {{of a range of}} compositions has been investigated. Two initial cure conditions were used, of which one was 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 optimally 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 cured and the other <b>undercured.</b> It was found that postcure treatments, particularly gamma and UV, led to coatings of similar mechanical and thermal properties irrespective of initial cure, although the change in properties on postcure treatment was greater for the under-cured samples. The results were interpreted in terms of the effect of the treatments on the structure of the crosslinked matrices. The study suggests the possibility of the development of a dual-cure process for polyester-melamines, whereby cure optimization and property improvement can be achieved. This could also be used to 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 correct 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 for small variations in thermal cure levels brought about by adventitious online fluctuations in cure oven conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of microorganisms with glass-reinforced polyester resins(GRP), both under laboratory and simulated operating conditions, has been examined following reports of severl! fungal biodeterioration. Although GRP was not previously associated with substantial microbial growth, {{small amounts of}} microbial activity would pose problems for products associated with comestible materials. The microbiology of the raw materials was investigated, two ingredients were supportive to microbial populations whilst five materials were biostatic or inhibitory in their action. Production laminate was not susceptible to microbial deterioration or inhibitory to microbes. Incorporation of zinc stearate, one of the supportive ingredients, at 300 % manufacturing level or drastic <b>undercuring</b> produced laminate capable of supporting microbial growth but only after a non-biotic stage of degradation. Study of the long-term population dynamics of cisterns of GRP and competitive materials under conditions simulating in-service conditions, monitoring microbial numbers within the experimental vessels and comparing with the populations of the supply water, suggests that the performance of GRP cisterns is slightly superior to conventional competitive materials. An investigation of the biological performance of GRP cisterns in an isolated area of known microbiological hazard was conducted. Severe biodeterioration had been experienced with Preform GRP articles moulded using different production techniques, but substitution of current GRP articles resulted in no recurrence of the problem. All attempts to establish the fungal isolate responsible for the phenomena in cisterns under controlled conditions failed. Scanning Electron Microscopy of GRP surfaces showed that although differences exist between current and Preform laminates, these could not satisfactorily explain the differences in service behaviour. These results {{and the results of}} the British Plastics Federation Expert Working Group interlaboratory study are discussed in relation to the original report of gross fungal biodeterioration and, to the design of future testing programmes for the products of industrial concerns...|$|R
40|$|Polymer matrix composites, {{especially}} those with carbon fiber reinforcement, are becoming increasingly common in aerospace applications due to their high stiffness to weight ratio, resulting in significant weight and fuel savings on commercial and military aircraft. Despite their excellent properties, carbon fiber composites are often susceptible to damage {{in the form of}} delaminations or interlaminar cracking caused by low energy impact or manufacturing defects. Often not easily detectable, delaminations are detrimental to the strength of the composite and can ultimately result in failure of the component. Therefore methods must be developed to repair damaged composites. Injection repair is a procedure that involves injecting a low viscosity resin into the damaged area and subjecting the composite to heat to cure the resin. Currently, injection repairs are rarely used in high temperature applications {{because of the lack of}} resins with both low viscosity and high thermal stability. Therefore demonstrating the use of a resin with satisfactory viscosity and Tg requirements would expand the application of injection repairs to more vigorous environments. In the present study, the injection repair method was developed to repair damaged bismaleimide carbon fiber composites that are similar to composites used on several high temperature weapon platforms. Bisphenol E cyanate ester (BECy) was chosen as the injection resin due to having the unique combination of low viscosity and a high glass transition temperature. Cure kinetic studies found an optimum <b>undercure</b> schedule to achieve the maximum Tg while avoiding the high temperature postcure. Mechanical and adhesive tests revealed that partially cured BECy had properties superior to that of the fully cured resin. Following the evaluation of the resin, the injection repair procedure and set up were developed. Successful and reproducible repairs were performed on panels pre-damaged through static loading and drop tower impact, as well as on panels of various thicknesses. Ultrasonic C-scans and flash thermography showed successful resin infiltration, and repair efficiencies were calculated by quantifying the stiffness of the pristine, delaminated and repair panels. Higher repair efficiencies were achieved for the static loading method over the drop tower method, as well as for thinner panels over thicker panels...|$|E
40|$|In this work, hyperbranched {{aromatic}} polyesters-polyphenols {{based on}} 4, 4 -bis(4 ’ hydroxy¬phenyl) pentanoic acid (BHPPA) were prepared and, {{according to the}} authors knowledge, {{for the first time}} tested as precursors for polyurethane bulk resins and coatings. Comparison of poly-BHPPA with competing products The materials prepared in this work show better properties than their aliphatic polyester-polyol analoga based on 2, 2 -bis-(hydroxymethyl) propanoic acid (BHMPA). Especially, the solubility of poly-BHPPA in organic solvents is better and poly-BHPPAs also do not tend to microphase separation during their reaction with isocyanates, in contrast to poly-BHMPAs. The poly-BHPPA and the polyurethane networks made from them display higher Tg values than analogous poly- BHMPA compounds. Because of the high Tg of the reacting and final systems, curing must occur at elevated temperatures (90 °C) in order to avoid <b>undercure.</b> The lower reactivity of phenolic OH groups prevents the reaction from being too fast at that temperature. A drawback of the polyurethanes based on the aromatic polyesters-polyols prepared is the lower thermal stability of their urethane bonds, if compared to aliphatic urethanes. An interesting possibility for future investigations would be the modification of the BHPPA monomer in order to change the OH functionality from phenolic to aliphatic OH, e. g. by replacement of the phenolic OH by hydroxymethyl or hydroxyethyl groups (requires a strong modification of the monomer synthesis) or simpler by reacting the phenolic OH of BHPPA with a suitable reagent like oxirane, which would lead to groups like O-CH 2 -CH 2 -OH in the place of the phenolic OH. Such a BHPPA modification should in turn yield modified “poly-BHPPA” polycondensates, which would combine the advantages of poly-BHPPA with those of aliphatic OH precursors of polyurethanes. Poly-BHPPA synthesis Hyperbranched polymers of the 4, 4 -bis-(4 ’-hydroxyphenyl) pentanoic acid (BHPPA) were synthesized successfully by the catalyzed (by dibutyltin diacetate) polycondensation of BHPPA. The products obtained were oligomers with number average molecular weight ranging from 1800 to 3400 g/mol (polymerization degree of ca. 6 to 12), displaying a first moment of functionality in the range 7 to 14. Such products were good OH precursors for the preparation of polyurethane coatings, because higher functional polymers would gel at low conversions. The analysis of the functional groups (determination of acid and hydroxyl numbers) and the 1 H-NMR and the 13 C-NMR spectroscopy were found to be good methods for the determination of molecular weights. The polydispersity of the poly-BHPPA products was in the range 3. 5 to 6. Their degree of branching was found to be in the range 0. 36 to 0. 47. Poly-BHPPA containing aliphatic polyols as core monomers were also prepared successfully. Difunctional and trifunctional core monomers usually reached a full conversion of their OH groups, while the tetra- and hexafunctional core monomers were converted only to 89 %. In all these products however, a considerable amount, usually even a majority, of the polymer molecules were core free. The poly-BHPPA products prepared displayed relatively high glass transition temperatures, in the range of 84 °C to 114 °C, obviously due to interactions between the phenol groups and to hydrogen bridging. The thermal stability of these products was also high, with decomposition occurring near 350 °C (at a heating rate of 10 °C / min) Kinetics investigations of the poly-BHPPA reactivity towards isocyanates The poly-BHPPA are polyphenols and were expectedly found to react significantly slower with isocyanates than aliphatic alcohols. The reactivity of poly BHPPA was also found to be somewhat lower than that of the monofunctional, low molar-mass 4 ethylphenol. Hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer, Desmodur N 3300, was found to be more reactive than hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or butyl isocyanate in all experiments, possibly due to a substitution effect. The substitution effect can be explained by a change of microenvironment caused by conversion of isocyanate group and OH group into urethane groups. The reactions of low-molecular-mass alcohols or phenols with low molecular weight isocyanates followed well the 2 nd order kinetics, while the reactions of poly-BHPPA with isocyanates show deviations from ideal 2 nd order kinetics at higher conversions. All the kinetics experiments were carried out under catalysis by dibutyltin dilaurate. This catalyst inhibits the undesired reaction of isocyanate groups with moisture. It was also found that the catalysis was necessary to reach reasonable curing times for poly-BHPPA based polyurethane networks. The uncatalyzed systems reacted extremely slowly. Preparation of polyurethane networks from poly-BHPPA The poly BHPPA products prepared were used successfully as OH functional precursors of polyurethane networks. The networks prepared contained only very low sol fractions. Acetone and also ethylene diglycol dimethylether (diglyme) were found to be good swelling solvents for the networks prepared, while methyl propyl ketone was a much poorer solvent and aromatic compounds like toluene or xylene practically did not swell the poly BHPPA based polyurethanes. The networks prepared contain a relatively high amount of cyclic bonds, 40 to 50 % in the finally cured state, which is an expected result for systems with precursors of high functionality and with small distances between the functional groups. The temperature of glass transition (Tg) of the networks prepared (ranging from 68 °C to 126 °C) depends of the poly BHPPA precursor used: it increases with increasing molecular mass and with increasing core functionality. The choice of the isocyanate crosslinker also influences Tg: the networks made from HDI show higher Tg values, than networks made from the same poly BHPPA but crosslinked with Desmodur N 3300 (Tri HDI). The urethane bonds in the networks prepared start to decompose near 140 °C. The easier degradation of PU with aromatic urethane bonds is a disadvantage in comparison with aliphatic polyurethanes, whose decomposition starts at 200 °C. The surfaces of polyurethane coatings prepared are smooth, displaying a roughness of ca. 20 - 25 nm, and relatively hydrophilic: the contact angle with water was found to be near 80 °. The prepared networks are also relatively hard, possessing the Shore D hardness of 70...|$|E
