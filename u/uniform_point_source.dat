40|$|Extracellular ATP {{represents}} an important autocrine/paracrine signaling molecule within the liver. The mechanisms responsible for ATP release are unknown, and alternative pathways have been proposed, including either conductive ATP movement through channels or exocytosis of ATP-enriched vesicles, although direct evidence from liver cells has been lacking. Utilizing dynamic imaging modalities (confocal and {{total internal reflection}} fluorescence microscopy and luminescence detection utilizing a high sensitivity CCD camera) at different scales, including confluent cell populations, single cells, and the intracellular submembrane space, we have demonstrated in a model liver cell line that (i) ATP release is not <b>uniform</b> but reflects <b>point</b> <b>source</b> release by a defined subset of cells; (ii) ATP within cells is localized to discrete zones of high intensity that are ∼ 1 μm in diameter, suggesting a vesicular localization; (iii) these vesicles originate from a bafilomycin A 1 -sensitive pool, are depleted by hypotonic exposure, and are not rapidly replenished from recycling of endocytic vesicles; and (iv) exocytosis of vesicles in response to cell volume changes depends upon a complex series of signaling events that requires intact microtubules as well as phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and protein kinase C. Collectively, these findings are most consistent with an essential role for exocytosis in regulated release of ATP and initiation of purinergic signaling in liver cells...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the performance of}} three commercial small-animal mu SPECT scanners equipped with multipinhole general purpose (GP) and multipinhole high-resolution (HR) collimators designed for imaging mice. Spatial resolution, image uniformity, <b>point</b> <b>source</b> sensitivity and contrast recovery were determined for the U-SPECT-II (MILabs), the NanoSPECT-NSO (BioScan) and the X-SPECT (GE) scanners. The pinhole diameters of the HR collimator were 0. 35 mm, 0. 6 mm and 0. 5 mm for these three systems respectively. A pinhole diameter of 1 mm {{was used for the}} GP collimator. To cover a broad field of imaging applications three isotopes were used with various photon energies: Tc- 99 m (140 keV), In- 111 (171 and 245 keV) and I- 125 (27 keV). Spatial resolution and reconstructed image uniformity were evaluated in both HR and a GP mode with hot rod phantoms, line sources and a <b>uniform</b> phantom. <b>Point</b> <b>source</b> sensitivity and contrast recovery measures were additionally obtained in the GP mode with a novel contrast recovery phantom developed in-house containing hot and cold submillimetre capillaries on a warm background. In hot rod phantom images, capillaries as small as 0. 4 mm with the U-SPECT-II, 0. 75 mm with the X-SPECT and 0. 6 mm with the NanoSPECT-NSO could be resolved with the HR collimators for Tc- 99 m. The NanoSPECT-NSO achieved this resolution in a smaller field-of-view (FOV) and line source measurements showed that this device had a lower axial than transaxial resolution. For all systems, the degradation in image resolution was only minor when acquiring the more challenging isotopes In- 111 and I- 125. The <b>point</b> <b>source</b> sensitivity with Tc- 99 m and GP collimators was 3, 984 cps/MBq for the U-SPECT-II, 620 cps/MBq for the X-SPECT and 751 cps/MBq for the NanoSPECT-NSO. The effects of volume sensitivity over a larger object were evaluated by measuring the contrast recovery phantom in a realistic FOV and acquisition time. For 1. 5 -mm rods at a noise level of 8 %, the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) was 42 %, 37 % and 34 % for the U-SPECT-II, X-SPECT and NanoSPECT-NSO, respectively. At maximal noise levels of 10 %, a CRCcold of 70 %, 52 % and 42 % were obtained for the U-SPECT-II, X-SPECT and NanoSPECT-NSO, respectively. When acquiring Tc- 99 m with the GP collimators, the integral/differential uniformity values were 30 %/ 14 % for the U-SPECT-II, 50 %/ 30 % for the X-SPECT and 38 %/ 25 % for the NanoSPECT-NSO. When using the HR collimators, these uniformity values remained similar for U-SPECT-II and X-SPECT, but not for the NanoSPECT-NSO for which the uniformity deteriorated with larger volumes. We compared three mu SPECT systems by acquiring and analysing mouse-sized phantoms including a contrast recovery phantom built in-house offering the ability to measure the hot contrast on a warm background in the submillimetre resolution range. We believe our evaluation addressed the differences in imaging potential for each system to realistically image tracer distributions in mouse-sized objects...|$|R

40|$|COMPET is a {{preclinical}} PET scanner aiming {{towards a}} high sensitivity, a high resolution and MRI compatibility by implementing a novel detector geometry. In this approach, long scintillating LYSO crystals {{are used to}} absorb the gamma-rays. To determine the point of interaction (P 01) between gamma-ray and crystal, the light exiting the crystals {{on one of the}} long sides is collected with wavelength shifters (WLS) perpendicularly arranged to the crystals. This concept has two main advantages: (1) The parallax error is reduced to a minimum and is equal for the whole field of view (FOV). (2) The P 01 and its energy deposit is known in all three dimension with a high resolution, allowing for the reconstruction of Compton scattered gamma-rays. Point (1) leads to a <b>uniform</b> <b>point</b> <b>source</b> resolution (PSR) distribution over the whole FOV, and also allows to place the detector close to the object being imaged. Both points (1) and (2) lead to an increased sensitivity and allow for both high resolution and sensitivity at the same time, while keeping a low number of readout channels. In total, COMPET incorporates 1080 readout channels (600 crystals, 480 WLS). It has an axial FOV of 80 mm and adjustable bore opening between 30 mm and 80 mm. It consists of four modules with five layers each. Simulations show a PSR of below I mm in the transaxial plane and a sensitivity of up to 16 % {{in the center of the}} FOV. The readout is based on time over threshold signals, sampled with an FPGA, which allows for the measurement of high event rates at the order of mega-counts per seconds. Its compact design and compatibility to high magnetic fields will allow to use it as an insert for an already existing MRI scanner. A first semi-layer with 12 WLS and 10 LYSO crystal was built and connected to the COMPET readout system. Coincidence data between this module and a tagger crystal using a small Ge- 68 and a 60 MBq F- 18 source was taken. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Non-linear matched filtering of input images can be performed optionally to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and improve detection of faint <b>point</b> <b>sources.</b> <b>Point</b> Response Function (PRF) fitting of <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> produces the final <b>point</b> <b>source</b> list which includes the fluxes and improved positions of the <b>point</b> <b>sources,</b> along with other parameters characterizing the fit.

40|$|The <b>point</b> <b>source</b> {{approximation}} {{is widely}} used for earthquake representation because it is computationally efficient for certain kinds of synthetic calculations. It {{is based on the}} assumption that the seismic wave-field generated by a realistic source will match up with that generated by the corresponding centroid <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> as long as the waves investigated have sufficiently long wavelengths and periods. It is important to know whether this approximation is valid, otherwise unknown errors can be introduced into results based using the this approximation. In order to get an idea of the validity of the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> approximation, we compare the wave-field generated by various distributions of <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> to that generated by the corresponding centroid <b>point</b> <b>source.</b> While the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> distributions used do not represent the full complexity of seismic sources, these tests are still useful to explore some of the effects of combining multiple <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> into a single centroid <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> which is what the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> approximation is based on. In the case of an event consisting of two <b>point</b> <b>sources,</b> the time difference between the two <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> before the misfit with the centroid becomes significant, is approximately 7 seconds. In reality, this may represent events with durations over half the length of the shortest period investigated, since it is unlikely that all energy is released at the two ends of an event. For the spatial dimensions, the misfit may become significant for an offset close to 40 kilometres, while at 50 kilometres, around one third of the shortest wavelength, the misfit is already very large. Realistic rupture times indicate that for sources with spatial offset closer to 20 kilometres, the misfit should be very small.
