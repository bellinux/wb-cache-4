40|$|The {{behaviour}} of prismatic {{reinforced concrete}} columns under increasing eccentric compression load was experimentally investigated and analytically modelled. Columns with distributed longitudinal reinforcement and closely spaced transverse reinforcement were tested up to failure, considering different values and directions of eccentricity.

In the paper, closed form expressions able to approximate the experimental results in the case of <b>uniaxial</b> <b>bending</b> are presented. Finally, a fibre numerical model is utilized for the cases of biaxial bending.

40|$|The NESC-IV project (2000 - 2005) {{addressed}} the transferability of fracture toughness data from laboratory specimens to applications that assess {{the integrity of}} reactor pressure vessels. This project included a series of <b>uniaxial</b> <b>bend</b> tests on large beams with a simulated shallow, sub-surface flaw. The results of these experiments pointed towards a significant constraint-loss effect in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature range of the used steel, but {{in view of the}} inherent scatter in fracture toughness of low alloy steels in the given regime, further testing was recommended. Therefore the scope of present project was to perform a set of six additional tests with nominally identical test piece geometry, material and loading arrangements, so as to obtain a statistically more relevant data set. The Institute for Energy contracted the Nuclear Research Institute in Rez to perform these experiments. Following the successful execution of the tests, a preliminary fracture mechanics analysis was made to compare estimates of the stress intensity values at failure with the material's Master Curve. The results confirmed the constraint-loss effect, which had been observed in the previous NESC-IV test series. Moreover it was found that some aspects needed further attention, such as detailed finite element modelling of the experimental arrangements and accurate characterization of the test material's fracture toughness. The latter should also consider material inhomogeneity issues. JRC. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R

30|$|The {{practical}} {{result is}} that our present-day knowledge of the inelastic behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) columns under biaxial cyclic moments is much behind than our understanding of their behaviour under <b>uniaxial</b> cyclic <b>bending</b> with axial load. In fact, besides the fibre-based models, the existing simplified analytical models are not mature enough to be incorporated into code standards, by contrast with uniaxial simplified global models which are already accepted in international codes Rodrigues et al.

This paper aims at providing {{a brief review of}} past experimental studies in the field of biaxial behaviour of reinforced concrete RC columns and to identify the existing open problems.|$|R
30|$|Due {{to testing}} {{difficulties}} {{and because there}} are still open questions regarding the cyclic behaviour both in biaxial bending with constant axial force and in <b>uniaxial</b> <b>bending</b> with simultaneously varying axial load, very few experimental studies have, as yet, tackled the more general problem of biaxial bending with varying axial force (CEB 1996; Coelho 1992), {{as can be seen}} in Figure[*] 5. From the literature review, only the tests performed by Low and Moehle (1987; two columns) and by Chang (2010 a; two columns) refer to rectangular cross-sections with different dimensions and amount of longitudinal reinforcement in the two principal directions, leading to different characteristics in terms of stiffness and strength.|$|E

40|$|Available {{capacity}} {{models for}} the assessment of seismic capacity of reinforced concrete columns are mainly based on experimental tests under axial load and <b>uniaxial</b> <b>bending.</b> Furthermore, experimental tests have been mainly performed on columns representative of new constructions. In order to analyze the effects of biaxial bending on the seismic performances of existing r. c. columns with design characteristics non-conforming to present day seismic codes and practices, the paper presents the results of a first stage of tests on r. c columns under both axial load and biaxial bending, which effectively simulate the seismic actions. In particular, the paper presents results of four tests on full scale square columns reinforced with plain bars, subjected to constant axial load and biaxial cyclic actions. Two different cyclic displacement paths were investigated: horizontal displacements with an inclination angle of 45 or 30 with respect to the cross section principal axes. The influence of biaxial bending actions on the global behavior of existing r. c. columns in terms of stiffness, strength, and deformation capacity as well as the effects of different horizontal displacements orientation on their performances are herein investigated and discussed; the comparison with experimental outcomes provided by <b>uniaxial</b> <b>bending</b> tests on companion specimens are also presented. Experimental findings showed that biaxial bending actions affect columns rotational capacity more than strength. The rotational capacity reduction owing to biaxial bending actions, even if more significant than the flexural capacity reduction, is not currently taken into account in the available seismic guidelines related to existing r. c. buildings...|$|E

30|$|The {{experimental}} study of RC elements under earthquake loads is very important since it permits the observation and measurement of the particular performance of the element. Regarding the behaviour of RC elements under lateral loads, {{a large number of}} various types of studies have been carried out in past years which, apart from the specific subject of each study, have generally covered elements with or without axial loads, as well as <b>uniaxial</b> and biaxial <b>bending.</b> In the case of zero axial force, these studies are typically associated with beams; therefore, most of them focus only on the uniaxial behaviour of these elements. Columns are studied with non-zero axial load, constant or variable, under <b>uniaxial</b> or biaxial <b>bending.</b> In the case of slender elements, the behaviour is governed by flexure, but depending on the cross-section geometry and the shear span ratio, the shear force can also represent an important subject for the study. Studies of RC elements can, therefore, also be divided into elements where the global behaviour is governed essentially by flexure or by shear, or by both mechanisms.|$|R

30|$|As stated before, the {{available}} test results for biaxial bending under constant axial load {{are not so}} extensive when compared to those for <b>uniaxial</b> <b>bending,</b> although they have been delivered {{over a period of}} almost 30 years. Contributions are summarised in Table[*] 1. In general, most research findings agree that, additionally to the expected significant influence of axial loads on the hysteretic response of columns, the biaxial transversal load cycles are responsible for increasing the strength and stiffness degradation when compared to the uniaxial response. In addition, the failure mechanism of RC columns is found to be very dependent on the loading path/history and strongly affects both the ductile and energy dissipation capacity of the columns. On the other hand, there is some experimental evidence that plastic hinge zone lengths tend to be stable at around theoretical values and are not strongly affected by biaxial loading.|$|E

It should not be employed (i) when the material is confined (triaxial compression) because the damage loading function relies on extension of the material only, (ii) when the loading path is severely nonradial (not yet tested), and (iii) when the material is subjected to alternated loading. In this last case, an enhancement of the relation which takes into account the effect of crack closure is possible. It will be considered in the anisotropic damage model presented in Section 3. Finally, the model provides a mathematically consistent prediction of the response of structures up to the inception of failure due to strain localization.

The calculated threshold-voltage shift is in agreement with <b>uniaxial</b> wafer <b>bending</b> and published biaxial strained-Si on relaxed-Si 1 Ge experimental data [1], [2] and explains the technologically important observation of a significantly larger (4) threshold-voltage shift for biaxial relative to uniaxial stressed MOSFETs.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis, failure modes and fatigue {{behavior}} of laser welds in lap-shear specimens of HSLA steel sheets are investigated based on experimental observations and finite element analyses. The optical micrographs of failed specimens show that laser welds failed in the base metal due to the necking/shear of the load carrying sheets towards weld face under quasi-static loading conditions and in the HAZ due to the kinked fatigue crack propagating through the load carrying sheets towards the weld root under cyclic loading conditions. Elastic-plastic finite element analyses are conducted to explain the ductile failure and effects of the sheet thickness on the failure modes under quasi-static loading conditions. A kinked fatigue crack growth model based on the computational global and local stress intensity factor solutions for finite kinked cracks and a structural stress model based on the closed-form structural stress solutions of the beam bending theory are adopted to estimate the fatigue lives of the laser welds. Approximate stress intensity factor solutions as functions of the normalized weld width are 2 proposed for the right pre-existing crack tip of the load carrying thinner sheet. The effect of weld gap is also investigated based on the computational stress intensity factor solutions and an analytical structural stress model.
