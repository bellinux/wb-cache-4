5|$|In 1874–75, {{after labor}} unrest {{disrupted}} coal production, the Union Pacific Coal Department hired Chinese laborers {{to work in}} their coal mines throughout southern Wyoming. Even so, the Chinese population rose slowly at first; however, where there were Chinese immigrants, they were generally concentrated in one area. At Red Desert, a remote section camp in Sweetwater County, there were 20 inhabitants, of whom 12 were Chinese. All 12 were laborers who worked under an American foreman. To the east of Red Desert was another remote section camp, Washakie. An American section foreman lived there amongst 23 others, including 13 Chinese laborers and an Irish crew foreman. In the various section camps along the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, Chinese workers far outnumbered any other nationality. Though the 79 Chinese in Sweetwater County in 1870 represented only 4% of the total population, they were, again, concentrated. In Rock Springs and Green River, the largest towns along the <b>UP</b> <b>line,</b> there were no Chinese residents reported in 1870.|$|E

25|$|Hungerford station {{consists}} of two platforms {{either side of the}} mainline tracks. There is a level crossing at the western end of the station. One mile East of the station there is a passing loop on the <b>up</b> <b>line</b> which is mainly used by freight trains but can also be used by passenger trains. The current timetable does not call for passenger trains to use the loop but it is common for special charter trains to do so.|$|E
25|$|Two Class I railroads, BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad (UP), have lines which {{pass through}} Lawrence. The BNSF line enters {{the city from}} the east and exits to the north, roughly {{following}} {{the course of the}} Kansas River. The <b>UP</b> <b>line</b> does the same {{on the north side of}} the river, running through the city's northeast corner. Using the BNSF trackage, Amtrak provides passenger rail service on its Southwest Chief line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Amtrak's Lawrence station is a few blocks east of downtown.|$|E
25|$|Pendleton lies {{along the}} Union Pacific Railroad (UP), {{constructed}} originally {{through the area}} in the 1880s by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR). In 1880, the OR began construction of a rail line from Portland through the Columbia Gorge to eastern Oregon. It reached Umatilla and Wallula in 1881, Pendleton in 1882, and then La Grande, Baker City, and Huntington, where by 1884 it met the <b>UP</b> <b>line</b> from Utah. Since Pendleton was also connected by rail to the Northern Pacific line at Wallula and Walla Walla, by 1885 it was a stop on two transcontinental lines. The UP absorbed the OR line in 1889.|$|E

50|$|If, for example, {{eight men}} <b>line</b> <b>up</b> on the <b>line</b> of scrimmage, the team loses an {{eligible}} receiver. This can often happen when a flanker or slot receiver, {{who is supposed}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> behind the <b>line</b> of scrimmage, instead <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> on the <b>line</b> of scrimmage between the offensive line and a split end. In most cases where a pass is caught by an ineligible receiver, it is usually because the quarterback was under pressure and threw it to an offensive lineman out of desperation.|$|R

25|$|At Morlaix {{the line}} was shared with the CF de l'Ouest's {{standard}} gauge dual gauge line between Paris and Brest. A dual gauge section of track was laid on the <b>up</b> <b>line</b> on the viaduct across the harbour. This was built by the CF de l'Ouest {{as part of their}} Paris - Brest line. The viaduct crossed the Chemins de Fer Armoricains (CFA) Morlaix - Plestin-les-Grèves line. A platform at Morlaix was shared with the standard gauge. A branch was opened on 12 February 1906 to serve the port at Morlaix. Freight traffic beyond Plougonver ceased from 25 September 1962. The line between Carhaix and Morlaix closed completely on 9 April 1967.|$|E
25|$|The {{disasters}} of the VVS {{were largely}} {{down to two}} reasons; the better tactics used by the Luftwaffe {{and the lack of}} communications between Soviet pilots. The Luftwaffe used Rotte (or pairs) which relied on wingman-leader tactics. The two flew 200 metres apart, each covering the others blind spot. In combat the leader engaged while the wingman protected his tail. Two Rotte made up a Schwarm (section) and three Schwarme made up a Staffel in stepped <b>up</b> <b>line</b> astern formation. It allowed the formation to focus in looking for the enemy rather than keeping formation. Soviet aircraft fought with little regard for formation tactics, usually along or in pairs without tactical coordination. The lack of radios in aircraft made coordination worse. When the Soviets did use formation methods, the German Finger-four was much better than the Soviet V formation.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, 18 April 1967 {{at about}} 2.31pm, a wagon on a goods train of 69 empty mineral wagons, {{travelling}} on the down line to Northampton, derailed {{just south of}} the village. The train travelled a further 1½ miles before more wagons derailed, a little distance north of the village playing field. Some of the wagons went towards the <b>up</b> <b>line</b> from Northampton to London and were hit by a four-coach passenger train at about 70mph. Although the brakes of the passenger train had been fully applied, two coaches were derailed with one falling onto its side. All 45 passengers and train crew were evacuated fairly promptly. Of these, 21 were injured but only two were detained at Northampton General Hospital. The driver of the passenger train was seriously injured but both he and the passenger detained overnight made a good recovery.|$|E

25|$|Yasuda joined Toei Doga in April 1958, {{immediately}} after her graduation from high school. Yasuda {{has said that}} she applied not knowing what the job entailed but that she had submitted her application {{because she did not}} fancy employment in any of the other jobs available for most women at the time, such as bank teller or store clerk. Instead she took the opportunity to work in a creative field. She started out in the Toei finishing department, in the ink and paint section, where she worked on TV series and commercials as a tracer. In traditional animation a tracer is a person whose job involves transferring cleaned <b>up</b> <b>line</b> drawings onto the cels. Through her work and union activities at the company she made the acquaintance of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki whose careers also began at Toei, joining in 1959 and 1963 respectively.|$|E
25|$|A {{signal box}} which {{contained}} 25 levers was {{situated on the}} north side of the level crossing and controlled the crossing gates as well as access to the small goods yard with a siding on each side of the line. The siding on the down side ran into a loading dock behind the down platform. Unlike Ludborough, the station had no goods shed. The goods yard closed on 30 December 1963, but the station remained open to passengers until 5 October 1970. In 1956-57, around a dozen passenger trains bound for Grimsby called at the station on weekdays, with the first two being local workings from Louth, save for a Mondays only service which called only to set down passengers. In the other direction, fewer services ran through to , but the up/down passenger workings balanced once services to Louth were taken into account. North Thoresby was the only intermediate station between Grimsby and Louth to remain open until October 1970.After 1970 the down line was removed and only the <b>up</b> <b>line</b> through the station remained. The line finally closed in December 1980.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, High Court {{terminus}} {{closed for}} reconstruction of Strand Road. Rails and wires {{were removed from}} there and from Strand Road, Hare Street and Shahid Khudiram Basu Road. The site is now occupied by the newest building of the Kolkata High Court. In 2004, Garhiahat Depot – Garhiahat Junction link on Gariahat Road closed for construction of the Gariahat overpass. In 2006, Mominpur – Behala stretch on Diamond Harbour Road closed for construction of an overpass at Taratala. Initially, there was a plan to route tracks on that overpass after its completion, but the road was later converted to a National Highway and the plan dismissed. Until 2012, the Behala – Joka stretch was still in existence, along with the Behala terminus. In 2007, Wattgunge Junction – Mominpur Diamond Harbour Road, Mominpur – Jatin Das Park Judges Court Road, Jatin Das Park – Kalighat Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road routes closed for reconstruction. In 2008, Galiff Street terminus was realigned. Irregular service from Bagbazar to Galiff Street was converted to regular by Route 7/12. Rails and wires were removed from part of Bidhan Sarani route (restored by end of year). In 2009: Tracks on R. G. Kar Road from Shyambazar five-point crossing to Belgachia tram depot closed down for reconstruction. In 2011, Joka-Behala stretch and Behala depot closed down for construction of the Joka-BBD Bag metro project;Ballygunge-Kalighat stretch closed for reconstruction.Lalbazar-Mirjapur down line was closed but <b>up</b> <b>line</b> still opened. In 2015, Park Circus depot closed down for construction of the Park Circus Flyover & Nonapukur Depot was reopened. But Garhiahat Depot was still now opened. In 2016, Gariahat section has been reopened after 12 years. The tram depot next to the Gariahat Mall became operational. On 30 September 2014, a tram functioning as a museum {{opened to the public}} and displays the history of the tram system.|$|E

500|$|The weather cleared on {{the morning}} of 1 June, and both fleets were drawn <b>up</b> <b>line</b> ahead, sailing in the same direction, Gibraltar in the centre, {{immediately}} before Hood's flagship, the first-rate [...] and behind the 74-gun [...] At around 08:15 the order was given for each ship to bear down upon and engage her opposite number. Gibraltar was one of three ships Howe signalled to put on more sail. The tardiness of Gibraltar and the 74-gun , {{on the other side of}} Queen Charlotte, meant that Howe found himself battling one 120-gun and two 80-gun ships simultaneously. Gibraltar was, however, able to stop a fourth enemy ship, the first-rate Républicain, from joining in, by bringing down her main and mizzen masts from a distance. By the end of the action, six French ships had been captured and another sunk. The remainder escaped. In the three engagements, it was estimated that French casualties were between 3,000 and 7,000 dead and wounded, while British losses were recorded as 290 dead and 858 wounded. Having been kept to windward for most of the battle, casualties aboard Gibraltar were light: two killed and 12 wounded. After spending two days making repairs, the British fleet sailed for home with its prizes, having failed to stop the grain convoy that arrived in Brest on 12June.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 March 1849, despite the {{presence}} of police from Bury and Pendleton, the L placed a large baulk of timber across the ELR's line at Clifton Junction, effectively blocking it. [...] Employees from both companies arrived at the scene, and a large crowd gathered to watch events unfold. [...] The L also pulled a train past the junction, blocking the <b>up</b> <b>line</b> to the city. [...] Its engine was pointed south-east toward Manchester, available to any ELR passengers who wished to continue their journey. [...] An ELR train arrived from Bury, and stopped. [...] L employees attempted to take tickets from the ELR's passengers, but were refused, as the ELR had already taken tickets at their Ringley Road station. [...] ELR employees then removed the baulk of timber, and in an effort to push the L train out of the way, drove their train forward. [...] The L had anticipated this, and moved another engine (taken from a L train from Manchester) to the front of their Manchester-bound train. [...] The ELR then blocked the L down line with another of their trains, laden with stone, moving it to a position directly abreast of the L train. [...] The line remained completely blocked until about mid-day, with a queue of trains from both companies, and from the Blackburn and Darwen Railway, building up {{on each side of the}} blockage. [...] The situation was eventually defused when the L withdrew their train.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} local train had been shunted onto the Up (southbound) main line, two {{failures}} in correct signalling procedure occurred. Firstly, Kirkpatrick signal box was not sent the [...] "blocking back" [...] signal, which {{ought to have}} been sent immediately after the [...] "train out of section" [...] bell for the coal train (sent at 6.34 am) [...] This would have informed the Kirkpatrick signalman that the <b>Up</b> <b>line</b> was occupied, preventing him from offering any more trains to Quintinshill.
