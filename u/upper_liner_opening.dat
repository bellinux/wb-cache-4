40|$|Cappings {{of waste}} piles {{conventionally}} contain a drain layer over a low-permeable clay liner composed of smectite minerals. The rate of percolation of the clay liner, {{once it has}} been largely water saturated, determines the downward migration of water into and through the underlying waste. In desert climate, cyclic variation {{in the degree of}} hydration of the clay takes place, from desiccated to largely water saturated conditions. Clays of smectite type effectively seal off the underlying waste but the content must be low for preventing contraction and expansion causing a reduced isolation potential of the liner. Penetration of the liner, implying wetting of the waste, starts when the top liner is largely water saturated but the hydration followed by dehydration is confined to take place only to a limited depth according to the assumed wetting mechanism. The rate of wetting usually follows a log time law. For an ideal composition and density of the <b>upper</b> clay <b>liner</b> there will be no percolation and wetting of the underlying waste. The paper is focused on the mechanisms involved in hydration/dehydration of top clay liner prepared by mixing clay and ballast material for providing a basis for design, construction and maintenance of well performing cappings.

40|$|A physics based, lumped thermal {{capacity}} {{model of a}} 1 litre, 3 cylinder, turbocharged, directly injected spark ignition engine has been developed to investigate the effects of cylinder deactivation on the thermal behaviour and fuel economy of small capacity, 3 cylinder engines. When one is deactivated, {{the output of the}} two firing cylinders is increased by 50 %. The largest temperature differences resulting from this are between exhaust ports and between the <b>upper</b> parts of <b>liners</b> of the deactivated cylinder and the adjacent firing cylinder. These differences increase with load. The deactivated cylinder liner cools to near-coolant temperature. Temperatures in the lower engine structure show little response to deactivation. Temperature response times following deactivation or reactivation events are similar. Motoring work for the deactivated cylinder is a minor loss; the net benefit of deactivation diminishes with increasing load. For the NEDC and FTP- 75 cycle, the predicted fuel savings are ∼ 3 ½ %; the benefit is lower for more transient or highly loaded cycles...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} overcomes {{the drawbacks}} {{inherent in the}} prior art and solves the problems inherent in conventional Joule-heated vitrification melters, where the melter preferably comprises a vessel having a refractory <b>liner</b> and an <b>opening</b> for receiving material which is converted into molten vitreous material in the vessel. The vessel has an outlet port for removing molten vitreous material from the vessel. A plurality of electrodes is disposed in the vessel and electrical energy is passed between electrode pairs through feed material and molten vitreous material in the vessel. Typically, the electrodes erode and wear in time, and this invention seeks to monitor and evaluate the length and condition of the electrodes. The present invention uses time domain reflectometry (TDR) methods to accurately measure the length of an electrode that is subject to wear and electrolytic decomposition due to the extreme conditions in which the electrode is required to operate. Specifically, TDR would be used to measure the length and effects of erosion of molybdenum electrodes used in Joule-heated vitrification melter. Of course, the inventive concept should not be limited to this preferred environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research presented in this thesis was to investigate and quantify the impact of biofuel ethanol and the associated water contamination into a commercially available automotive gasoline engine lubricant on the frictional response of piston ring/cylinder liner contacts and the resulting implications for fuel economy under problematic cold-start/warm-up/short-journey driving conditions. Whilst road transport is a major driver of global economic growth, {{it is also a}} primary user of fossil fuel based energy and a major emitter of Carbon Dioxide (C 02). Therefore, increasingly stringent legislation demanding the use of biofuels in conjunction with conventional fossil fuels has been put in place. Even though biofuels are being blended into conventional gasoline and diesel at varying concentrations, information relating to the impact of these fuels on automotive engine lubrication, friction and fuel economy is scarce. A comprehensive and rigorous laboratory bench-top screening test programme using a reciprocating tribometer and Statistical Experimental Design was developed for the first stage of this investigation. Bespoke engine test programmes were also conducted to identify areas susceptible to ethanol and water dilution on the piston assembly and cylinder liner and to quantify fuel and water dilution into the lubricant present along the cylinder liner wall and in the sump. Tribometer investigations showed that significant reductions m friction resulted when the piston ring/cylinder liner contacts were lubricated with the lubricant-ethanolwater mixtures and the separated phases of these mixtures compared to the formulated lubricant. Temperature measurements on a single cylinder gasoline engine highlighted that lubricant present on the piston skirt, the connecting rod and on the intake side of the cylinder liner was highly susceptible to ethanol and water contamination under cold-start/warm-up conditions. Fuel dilution measurements on the same engine revealed that lubricant present on the <b>upper</b> cylinder <b>liner,</b> at top dead centre, was highly contaminated with ethanol, gasoline and water compared to that present lower down the cylinder, mid-stroke and bottom dead centre, and in the sump. again under cold-start/warm-up conditions.

40|$|Concept, {{design and}} results of {{hydrological}} experiments in two tilt-gutters (10 m and 1 m long) {{to test the}} performance of capillary barriers on landfill slopes are presented. Test variables were texture, vertical and lateral infiltration rate as well as inclination. Capillary barriers are formed by a capillary layer with a relatively high unsaturated water conductivity above a capillary block with a very low unsaturated conductivity. Capillary barriers perform very well {{as long as the}} total vertical and lateral infiltration rate does not exceed the lateral drainage capacity (LDC) of the system. Infiltration rates above LDC however generate vertical percolation into the capillary block while the lateral flow rate within the capillary layer remains more or less constant. Material properties exert a strong influence on the performance of capillary barriers. Well sorted sand and gravel are suitable for capillary layers and blocks respectively. Only very small amounts of silt and clay are tolerable. Both materials of a capillary barrier should meet the criteria for filter stability. The highest LDC (450 l/m/d on 1 m wide slope segment with an inclination of 1 : 5 or 11. 3) was measured with a combination of coarse sand as capillary layer and medium gravel as capillary block. Inclination influences the LDC of a capillary barrier, the following data were measured (medium sand above fine gravel) : 50, 75 and 115 l/m/d on a 1 m wide slope segment with inclinations of 1 : 25, 1 : 10 and 1 : 5 respectively. The experimental data were used to test the applicability of the finite element model SWMS_ 2 D to describe water transport in capillary barriers. The attempt to validate the model for this application was not successful, probably due to an inappropriate approach in estimating the unsaturated conductivity functions of the very well sorted and highly permeable materials. Capillary barriers can also be used in composite liners, e. g. beneath geomembranes, as a secondary liner as well as a control drainage layer for the <b>upper,</b> primary <b>liner.</b> (orig.)

40|$|Friesian-type {{dairy cows}} were milked with {{different}} machine settings {{to determine the}} effect of these settings on teat tissue reaction and on milking characteristics. Three teat-cup liner designs were used with varying upper barrel dimensions (wide-bore WB = 31. 6 mm; narrow-bore NB = 21. 0 mm; narrow-bore NB 1 = 25. 0 mm). These liners were tested with alternate and simultaneous pulsation patterns, pulsator ratios (60 : 40 and 67 : 33) and three system vacuum levels (40, 44 and 50 kPa). Teat tissue was measured using ultrasonography, before milking and directly after milking. The measurements recorded were teat canal length (TCL), teat diameter (TD), cistern diameter (CD) and teat wall thickness (TWT). Teat tissue changes were similar with a system vacuum level of either 50 kPa (mid-level) or 40 kPa (low-level). Widening the <b>liner</b> <b>upper</b> barrel bore dimension from 21. 0 mm (P < 0. 01) or 25. 0 mm (P < 0. 001) to 31. 6 mm increased the magnitude of changes in TD and TWT after machine milking. Milk yield per cow was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher and cluster-on time was reduced (P < 0. 01) with the WB cluster as compared to the NB 1 cluster. Minimum changes in teat tissue parameters were achieved with system vacuum level of 40 kPa and 50 kPa using NB and WB clusters, respectively. Similar changes in teat tissue and milk yield per cow were observed with alternate and simultaneous pulsation patterns. Widening pulsator ratio from 60 : 40 to 67 : 33 did not have negative effects on changes in teat tissue and had a positive effect on milk yield and milking time. Milk liner design had a bigger effect on teat tissue changes and milking characteristics than pulsation settings. </p...|$|R
