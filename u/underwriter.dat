40|$|While {{there is}} {{considerable}} scholarship on the due diligence defense of lead <b>underwriters</b> in defective corporate securities offerings, there is surprisingly little analysis of the due diligence defense of non-managing <b>underwriters.</b> This article challenges the common perception that lead and non-managing <b>underwriters</b> necessarily “sink or swim” together for purposes of due diligence. An analysis of the statutory structure of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 reveals that non-managing <b>underwriters</b> are not inextricably tethered to the lead. Rather, non-managing <b>underwriters</b> who actively question the lead’s due diligence investigation {{should be able to}} meet their own affirmative defense even when the lead ultimately fails to meet its burden. Moreover, despite protestations from some in the investment banking community, {{it is also clear that}} to succeed in their separate affirmative defense, non-managing <b>underwriters</b> cannot simply be passive participants. To meet their separate defense, they must actively supervise the lead’s investigation of the financial health of the corporate issuer. Finally, this article addresses some of the practical issues involved in non-managing <b>underwriters</b> monitoring the lead <b>underwriter’s</b> investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} grandstanding comes from Gompers (1996), in his article, he defined “to grandstand” as “to act or conduct oneself {{with a view}} to impressing onlookers”. The idea of grandstanding does not only apply solely to venture capital but also could apply to <b>underwriters</b> of IPOs {{industry}} as well. IPOs activities provide huge revenues for <b>underwriters,</b> so <b>underwriters</b> compete with each other for IPO business. China’s stock market grows explosively after 2006, and it has the highest underpricing, as well as more and more <b>underwriters</b> have emerged recently, so our paper is constrained under Chinese stock market environment. We empirically examine whether inexperienced <b>underwriters</b> grandstand when they conduct IPOs in order to achieve more market shares, for example by deliberate underpricing or charging lower fee rates. This study is conducted from the <b>underwriter’s</b> perspective. We use two kinds of reputation measurement methods to define “inexperienced” and “prestigious underwriters” and employ a quantitative approach to analyze the data. Evidence from a sample of 392 IPOs from June 19, 2006 to March 24, 2010 suggests that inexperienced <b>underwriters</b> do not have incentives to grandstand. The number of IPOs that <b>underwriters</b> have conducted and recent IPO performance do not always contribute to a gain of market share directly. Therefore, inexperienced <b>underwriters</b> do not provide more underpriced IPOs nor do they charge lower fee rates. Evidence also marginally supports that <b>underwriters</b> do not intend to conduct small offer sized IPOs...|$|R

We also show that IPO <b>underwriters</b> use their superior information to earn annualized market adjusted returns 7. 6 % above non-underwriters, benefiting their institutional investors. <b>Underwriters</b> {{have the ability to}} make superior trades only when they have a lasting relationship with the firm they take public...|$|R

When <b>underwriters</b> charge less than expected, they do not trade-off IPO compensation with underpricing. However, our evidence suggests a trade-off between IPO compensation and future SEO business among <b>underwriters</b> that charge something other than 7 % and less than expected. <b>Underwriters</b> that overcharge may provide a signal to investors about future underperformance.

40|$|International audienceWe empirically {{test the}} {{certification}} hypothesis {{by studying the}} roles of reputable auditors and bank <b>underwriters</b> {{in the design of}} bond contracts. The certification hypothesis suggests that reputable capital market intermediaries can credibly communicate inside information to outside investors, thereby helping improve financing terms for firms that raise external funding. Consistent with this hypothesis, we provide evidence that reputable auditors and <b>underwriters</b> help corporate bond issuers obtain lower bond yields. The effect of reputable auditors on the yields is greater than that of reputable <b>underwriters</b> in terms of economic magnitude and significance, consistent with auditors' multiple roles as information intermediaries, monitors and insurance providers. We also find that the presence of reputable auditors and <b>underwriters</b> affects bonds' non-pricing terms. Firms that hire reputable auditors obtain longer-term bonds, while those that engage reputable <b>underwriters</b> can issue larger bonds. Taken together, our results suggest that reputable auditors and <b>underwriters</b> have integral, but different, roles in the bond issuing process...|$|R

40|$|Valuing {{initial public}} offerings (IPOs) using {{multiples}} allows <b>underwriters</b> discretion when selecting comparable firms.

40|$|This paper investigates how French <b>underwriters</b> {{value the}} stocks of {{companies}} they bring public. <b>Underwriters</b> often use several valuation methods to determine their fair value estimate of the initial public offering (IPO) firm's equity. We investigate five of these valuation methods: peer group multiples valuation, the dividend discount model, the discounted cash flow model, the economic value-added method, and underwriter-specific methods. We document that <b>underwriters</b> base their choice for a particular valuation method on firm characteristics, aggregate stock market returns, and aggregate stock market volatility in the period before the IPO. In addition, we examine how <b>underwriters</b> combine the value estimates of the valuation methods they use into a fair value estimate by assigning weights to these value estimates. We demonstrate that these weights also depend on firm-specific factors, aggregate stock market returns, and aggregate stock market volatility. Finally, we show that <b>underwriters</b> discount their fair value estimate to set the preliminary offer price of the shares. This discount is higher for IPO firms with greater valuation uncertainty and lower for companies that are brought to the market by more reputable <b>underwriters</b> and that are forecasted to be more profitable...|$|R
