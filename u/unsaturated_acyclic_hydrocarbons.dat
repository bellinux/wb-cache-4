Over the past decades, significant progress has been made with iridium, rhodium and ruthenium complexes to asymmetric hydrogenate a selection of olefins, such as, α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatives, ketones, imines and phosphonates. Although these metals have been applied successfully in the hydrogenation of olefins, they differ in their substrate tolerance.   Ruthenium and rhodium based catalysts require a coordinating group in the vicinity of the C=C bond. However, iridium based catalysts do not require this coordinating group, hence, asymmetric hydrogenation with iridium catalysts has been widely used for both functionalized and unfunctionalized olefin substrates. This thesis focuses on expanding the substrate scope for asymmetric hydrogenation using chiral N,P-ligated iridium catalysts. Papers I and II investigate the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral N-heterocyclic compounds prepared by ring-closing metathesis using the iridium catalysts developed in our group.   These substrates are interesting as they bear resemblance to pharmaceutically active compounds and therefore have tremendous value in medicinal chemistry.   Excellent enantioselectivities, up to > 99 % ee and conversions were obtained.

A large variety of <b>unsaturated</b> sulfones (cyclic, <b>acyclic,</b> vinylic, allylic and homoallylic) were prepared and screened in the iridium catalysed hydrogenation reaction using a series of previously developed N,P-ligated Ir-catalysts. The outcome was a highly enantioselective (> 90 % ee) protocol to prepare sulfones bearing chiral carbon scaffolds, sometimes having purely aliphatic substituents at the stereogenic centre. Furthermore, performing the Ramberg-Bäcklund reaction on the chiral products, under optimised conditions, produced cyclic and <b>acyclic</b> <b>unsaturated</b> derivatives without erosion of enantiomeric excess. This hydrogenation protocol was also successful in the hydrogenation {{of a number of}} cyclohexene-containing compounds. Minimally functionalised, functionalised and heterocycle-containing cyclohexenes were hydrogenated in up to 99 % ee. Hitherto, both chiral sulfones and chiral cyclohexanes have been challenging targets for most catalytic asymmetric methodologies. Although the preparation of aldehydes and ketones by isomerisation of the corresponding allylic alcohol is well established, there has been limited success in the development of good enantioselective protocols. For the isomerisation of a number γ,γ-allylic alcohols to the corresponding chiral aldehydes, high enantioselectivities (up to > 99 % ee) and modest yields were achieved using an N,P-iridium catalyst. Noteworthy is the high selectivity obtained for isomerisation of Z and dialkyl γ,γ-allylic alcohols, which prior to this study had been difficult to isomerise in high enantioselectivity. Preparation of a key intermediate used in the synthesis of Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor drug was also accomplished.

40|$|A chiral bidentate phosphoramidite (5 a) was {{synthesized}} from Shibasaki’s linked-(R) -BINOL and P(NMe 2) 3 {{as a new}} ligand for rhodium(I) -catalyzed asymmetric 1, 4 -addition of arylboronic acids to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The {{effects of}} 5 a and Feringa’s monodentate phosphoramidite (4, R 1, R 2 = Et) on the yields and enantioselectivities were fully investigated. The reaction was significantly accelerated {{in the presence of}} a base such as KOH and Et 3 N, allowing the reaction to be completed at the lower temperatures than 50 °C. The addition to cyclic enones such as 2 -cyclopentenone, 2 -cyclohexenone and 2 -cycloheptenone at 50 °C {{in the presence of a}}n [Rh(coe) 2 Cl] 2 - 4 (R 1, R 2 = Et) complex resulted in enantioselectivities up to 98 %, though it was less effective for acyclic enones (0 – 70 % ee). On the other hand, a complex between [Rh(nbd) 2]BF 4 and 5 a completed the addition to cyclic enones within 2 h at room temperature in the presence of Et 3 N with 86 – 99 % yields and 96 – 99. 8 % ee. This catalyst was also effective for acyclic enones, resulting in 62 – 98 % yields and 66 – 94 % ee. The 1, 4 -additions of arylboronic acids to <b>unsaturated</b> lactones and <b>acyclic</b> esters with rhodium(I) -phosphoramidites complexes were also investigated...|$|R
40|$|Motivation. Unique {{representation}} of adjacency matrix of a labeled chemical structure, a graph, {{is of great}} importance {{in the formation of}} various characteristic matrices based on the vertex connectivities. It finds application in places where two or more structures or parts thereof are to be compared and evaluated for any given purpose. Method. An algorithm, based on the vertex connectivity values, atomic weights, subgraph lengths, loops, heteroatom content, etc. has been developed to uniquely sequence and represent connectivity matrix of chemical structure of cyclic / <b>acyclic</b> fictionalized non-chiral <b>hydrocarbons.</b> In this the terminal vertices are considered separately after completing the sequencing of the core vertices. Results. The proposed algorithm uniquely sequences a given chemical structure according to the vertex priority. Also, this sequencing procedure generates traditional connection table of the chemical graph. This approach provides a kind of multilayered connectivity graphs which can be put to use in comparing two or more structures or parts thereof for any given purpose. Conclusions. The present algorithm may serve multipurpose utilities such as examination of the terminal and core vertices of given chemical graphs, in the formation of connectional tables, computation of characteristic matrices / topological indices and in storing, sorting and retrieving of chemical structures and databases...|$|R
