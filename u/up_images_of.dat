5|$|As {{with the}} new keeps {{constructed}} in France, these Anglo-Norman designs were informed both by military thinking and by political drivers. The keep at Orford has been particularly extensively analysed in this regard, and although traditional explanations suggested that its unusual plan {{was the result of}} an experimental military design, more recent analysis concludes that the design was instead probably driven by political symbolism and the need for Henry to dominate the contested lands of East Anglia. The architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned <b>up</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> King Arthur or Constantinople, then the idealised versions of royal and imperial power. Even formidable military designs such as that at Château Gaillard were built with political effect in mind. Gaillard was designed to reaffirm Angevin authority in a fiercely disputed conflict zone and the keep, although militarily impressive, contained only an anteroom and a royal audience chamber, and was built on soft chalk and without an internal well, both serious defects from a defensive perspective.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring <b>up</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> Jack L. Warner {{every time he}} was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he {{found it easier to}} rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure <b>up</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the keep has {{attracted}} much historical interest. Traditional explanations for its unusual plan argued that the castle was a transitional military design, combining both the circular features of later castles with the square angled buttresses of earlier Norman fortifications. More recent scholarship has critiqued this explanation. The {{design of the}} Orford keep is hard to justify in military terms, as the buttresses created additional blind spots for the defenders, whilst the chambers and staircase in the corners weakened the walls against attack. Square Norman keeps continued to be built after Orford, whilst Henry II was aware of fully circular castle designs before building the keep. A round keep was constructed at New Buckenham, Norfolk, in 1146, for example. Historians have therefore questioned {{to what extent the}} design can be seen as legitimately transitional. Instead, historians now believe that the design of Orford Castle was instead probably driven by political symbolism. Heslop argues that the plain, simple elegance of the architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned <b>up</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> King Arthur, who was then widely believed to have had Roman or Greek links. The banded, angular features of the keep resembled the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power, and the keep as a whole, including the roof, may have been based on a hall that had been recently built in Constantinople by John II Komnenos.|$|E
25|$|The media enables {{concerned}} citizens to pick <b>up</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> criminal events— the perpetrators, the victims, motives, and sensational details of violent crimes; interpersonal communication and internet based social networks {{add to the}} dissemination of information. Fear may be generated if the individual identifies with the described victim, or feels that their own neighbourhood bears resemblance to the one described; then the image of risk may be taken up, personalised and translated into personal safety concerns. The media sometimes reports fear of crime through broader concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of moral authority, and the crumbling of civility and social capital.|$|E

And we shall do {{so if we}} {{establish}} similitudes as striking as possible; if we set up images that are not many or vague but active; if we assign to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we ornament some of them, as with crowns or purple cloaks, so that the similitude may be more distinct to us; or if we somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud and smeared with red paint, so that its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily.|$|E

500|$|The prelude's central idea takes {{after its}} title – {{a girl with}} golden hair in a {{pastoral}} setting in Scotland.

[...] His utilization of pentatonic scales throughout the piece achieves this, and by blending this in with harmonizing diatonic chords and modal cadences, he creates a folk-like tune. [...] This prelude uses more plagal leading tones than any other piece composed by Debussy, and the prelude's melody alternates between conjunct and disjunct movement throughout.|$|E

500|$|While Shonen Knife's usual {{sound is}} Ramones-inspired pop punk, the band {{branched}} out musically {{and listened to}} harder rock bands for Overdrive, such as such as Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Bad Company, Deep Purple, Judas Priest, Boston, ZZ Top, and The Doobie Brothers—for inspiration. IAmTunedUp.com described the album's sound as a combination of [...] "edgy guitar riffs with psychedelic 70s-esque enchanting nostalgia". Naoko Yamano reasoned that because Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive represented {{an opportunity for the}} band to explore harder rock. Because of the band's exploration, the album's name references the overdrive pedal, which, in Yamano's mind, conjured <b>up</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> 1970s rock music.|$|E

Nevertheless, Mwng was ranked number 24 in the magazine's [...] "Albums of the year 2000" [...] feature. Website SonicNet described the record as a slightly retro album that sees the Super Furry Animals [...] "refashion the past into the present". Art Sperl, writing for Rock's Backpages in December 2000, stated that {{although the}} album [...] " [...] from the past", the band's influences are channelled [...] "into a truly organic maverick pop". [...] NME described Mwng as an antidote to the [...] "preservative pumped-junk" [...] music that they felt was prevalent {{at the time of the}} album's release, and placed it at number nine in their album of the year list for 2000, calling it the group's best record. The magazine also described the album as the most accessible Super Furry Animals release, despite its Welsh-language lyrics. Rhys has stated that he considers Mwng to be a [...] "really pure record".|$|E

The fish was mentioned in a National Review article discussing a legislation {{which would make it}} illegal to import, possess or release alive into California any live transgenic fish: [...] "Sounds like someone watched one too many episodes of The Simpsons with Blinky, the three-eyed fish that swims by the nuclear-power plant." [...] Matt Smith of SF Weekly compared Blinky to a type of fish found in San Francisco Bay, which, {{according to a study by}} the University of California, Davis, had a shrunken brain and misshapen body that had been caused by the dumping of toxic chemicals into the bay. In an article about the now closed nuclear weapons production facility Rocky Flats Plant, Brian Park of The Rocky Mountain Collegian joked that after its closure, [...] "years of clean up ensued and now the area is a wildlife refuge; no word yet if Blinky has been spotted." [...] Barbara Taormina of the North Shore Sunday wrote in her article about the new liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline in Massachusetts Bay: [...] "Will Blinky, the mutant three-eyed fish from The Simpsons be showing up in Massachusetts Bay? Probably not, but local environmentalists are worried that digging for the new LNG pipeline may stir up radioactive waste dumped decades ago." [...] In his article about the nuclear power plant operator Exelon, Thomas M.
