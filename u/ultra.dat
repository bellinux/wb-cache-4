ULTRA's contribution to the preparations for 15 September is also disputed. The intelligence from <b>ULTRA</b> at this stage in the war tended to be fragmented. With the Germans launching attacks whenever there was clear weather, {{it would not have been}} difficult for RAF Fighter Command to have predicted an attack on 15 September, which was to be a clear day.|$|E

5000|$|One country closely {{associated}} with the <b>ultras</b> movement is Italy. The first Italian <b>ultras</b> groups were formed in 1951, including the Fedelissimi Granata of Torino. The 1960s saw the continuing spread and development of the culture with the formation of the Fossa dei Leoni and Boys San groups, the former often regarded in Italy as the first full-fledged <b>ultras</b> group. The term <b>Ultras</b> was used as a name {{for the first time in}} 1969 when supporters of Sampdoria formed the <b>Ultras</b> Tito Cucchiaroni and fans of Torino formed the <b>Ultras</b> Granata. The style of support that would become synonymous with Italian football developed most during the 1970s as more groups formed including the radical S.S. Lazio <b>Ultras</b> in 1974 with a strong predominance of fascist slogans and chants amongst other groups such as Hellas Verona supporters. The active support of the <b>ultras</b> became more apparent, in contrast with the [...] "traditional" [...] culture, choreographic displays, signature banners and symbols, giant flags, drums and fireworks became the norm as groups aimed to take their support to higher levels. The decade also saw the violence and unrest of Italian society at the time overlap with the <b>ultras</b> movement, adding a dimension that has plagued it ever since.|$|R
50|$|The {{image for}} both clubs was further {{affected}} by the creation of <b>Ultras</b> groups, some of which became hooligans. In 1980, <b>Ultras</b> Sur was founded as a far-right-leaning Real Madrid <b>ultras</b> group, followed in 1981 by {{the foundation of the}} initially left-leaning and later on far-right, Barcelona <b>ultras</b> group Boixos Nois. Both groups became known for their violent acts, {{and one of the most}} conflictive factions of Barcelona supporters, the Casuals, became a full-fledged criminal organisation.|$|R

5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be <b>ultra</b> vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition <b>ultra</b> vires.|$|E

40|$|This ethnographic article {{explores the}} {{politics}} of Egypt’s <b>Ultras</b> football supporters. The <b>Ultras</b> have frequently been heralded {{as some of the}} Egyptian Revolution’s most prominent rebels, in particular, after the Port Said stadium massacre in February 2012, when 72 <b>Ultras</b> members were killed. However, this essay focuses on the earlier phase of violent clashes in central Cairo when the <b>Ultras</b> were highly ambivalent about the ongoing protests. As the article shows, the fan groups were hesitant to join the demonstrations, which at the time were heavily associated with “thuggery” (balṭaga). Only after the death of one of its members did the <b>Ultras</b> whole-heartedly take on their rebellious subjectivity...|$|R
