Some constants in that expression do not contribute significantly to the uncertainty; only the significant factors are noted. The value of the relative uncertainty by the data of CODATA of 2014 is given, and is expressed in the relative uncertainty of the significant factors, noted with ur(constant). An approximately equals sign (≈) is used if an <b>uncertainty</b> <b>is</b> only approximated by the expression. This is due to unsignificant factors or rounding errors.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{class of}} {{interconnected}} systems with structured and unstructured <b>uncertainties</b> <b>is</b> considered where the known interconnections and uncertain interconnections are nonlinear. The bounds on the <b>uncertainties</b> <b>are</b> employed in the observer design to enhance the robustness when {{the structure of the}} <b>uncertainties</b> <b>is</b> available for design. Under the condition that the structure distribution matrices of the <b>uncertainties</b> <b>are</b> known, a robust sliding mode observer is designed and a set of sufficient conditions is developed to guarantee that the error dynamics are asymptotically stable. In the case that the structure of <b>uncertainties</b> <b>is</b> unknown, an ultimately bounded approximate observer is developed to estimate the system states using sliding mode techniques. The results obtained are applied to a multimachine power system, and simulation for a two machine power system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed methods...|$|R

5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where <b>uncertainty</b> <b>is</b> greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential <b>uncertainty</b> <b>is</b> where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E

40|$|Environmental Assessment (EA) is a {{tool that}} informs {{decision}} making of the potential adverse impacts of proposed development projects. Since EAs deal with future events, <b>uncertainties</b> <b>are</b> unavoidable. It {{has been found that}} there are different types and sources of uncertainties in EA and decision making, however; <b>uncertainties</b> <b>are</b> not always being communicated or considered. It is understood {{that there is a need}} for more explicit disclosure of <b>uncertainties,</b> yet there <b>is</b> no consensus regarding how <b>uncertainties</b> <b>are</b> perceived, communicated, and considered by those involved in, or affected by, EA, and much less is known about the contextual dynamics of uncertainty disclosure and consideration. This study attempts to better understand the relationship between context and uncertainty practice by exploring uncertainties in a Canadian transport mega project EA, the 407 East Extension in southern Ontario. Transport mega projects are driven by a number of contextual factors, are characterized by high <b>uncertainty,</b> <b>are</b> spatially situated, inherently displacing, and highly visible. This study investigated how elements of the context hindered, supported, or influenced the way <b>uncertainty</b> <b>was</b> communicated and considered by those involved in the EA. In particular, twenty-two (22) semi-structured interviews were performed with key project informants such as project proponents, practitioners, regulators, First Nation representatives, and affected interests. Results demonstrate that uncertainties in the EA are the result of both process and context. In the process, <b>uncertainties</b> <b>were</b> significant in the preliminary and detailed assessment stages. Elements of the environmental and socio-political context were found to contribute to uncertainty as well. In particular, results indicate that location, lack of baseline data, perception, and broader politics, organizational, and regulatory factors worked to influence the way <b>uncertainties</b> <b>were</b> either communicated or considered during the EA. In our study, information about <b>uncertainty</b> <b>was</b> not disclosed in the EA. <b>Uncertainties</b> <b>were</b> minimized or strategically avoided. In order to address these limitations and better inform decision making in EA, we offer a number of recommendations. These are: the development of an uncertainty typology; guidance for uncertainty reporting; stakeholder identification and transparency in trade-offs; uncertainty management commitments; and, more attention on the context within which EA is embedded within and attempting to interact with...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the problem}} of {{stability}} analysis for homogeneous large-scale time-delay bilinear systems subjected to <b>uncertainties</b> <b>is</b> considered. Two classes of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>are</b> treated: nonlinear <b>uncertainties</b> and parametric uncertainties. By making use of the Lyapunov stability approach associated with solution bounds of the Lyapunov equation, two delay-independent criteria are presented to guarantee the robust stability of the overall systems. The stability condition for the mentioned system with nonlinear <b>uncertainties</b> <b>is</b> sharper {{than that of a}} previous work. The main feature of the schemes presented is that they do not involve any Lyapunov equation which may be unsolvable although the Lyapunov stability theorem is used...|$|R

The bounds on the <b>uncertainties</b> <b>are</b> nonlinear and are employed in the observer design to reject the effect of the uncertainties.

If the structure of the <b>uncertainties</b> <b>is</b> unknown, an ultimately bounded observer is developed using sliding mode techniques.

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{strategy}} {{that is based on}} risk is portfolio theory.

In the case of climate change, mitigation can be viewed as an effort to reduce the chance of climate change impacts (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.24). Adaptation acts as insurance against the chance that unfavourable impacts occur. The risk associated with these impacts can also be spread. As part of a policy portfolio, climate research can help when making future decisions. Technology research can help to lower future costs.|$|E
