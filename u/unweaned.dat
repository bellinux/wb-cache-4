60|$|Near {{the upper}} end of Eskdale, in the tiny village of Westerkirk, a young shepherd's wife gave birth to a son on the 9th of August, 1757. Her husband, John Telford, was {{employed}} in tending sheep on a neighbouring farm, and he and his Janet occupied a small cottage close by, with mud walls and rudely thatched roof, such as in southern England even the humblest agricultural labourer would scarcely consent willingly to inhabit. Before the child was three months old, his father died; and Janet Telford was left alone in the world with her <b>unweaned</b> baby. But in remote country districts, neighbours are often more neighbourly than in great towns; and a poor widow can manage to eke out a livelihood for herself with an occasional lift from the helping hands of friendly fellow-villagers. Janet Telford had nothing to live upon save her own ten fingers; but they were handy enough, after the sturdy Scotch fashion, and they earned some sort of livelihood in a humble way for herself and her fatherless boy. The farmers about found her work on their farms at haymaking or milking, and their wives took the child home with them while its mother was busy labouring in the harvest fields. Amid such small beginnings did the greatest of English engineers before the railway era receive his first hard lessons in the art of life.|$|E
60|$|The first body in {{the march}} was {{composed}} {{of the council of}} the abbaye, attended by the shepherds and gardeners. One in an antique costume, and bearing a halberd, acted as marshal. He was succeeded by the two crowned vine-dressers, after whom came the abbé with his counsellors, and large groups of shepherds and shepherdesses, {{as well as a number}} of both sexes who toiled in gardens, all attired in costumes suited to the traditions of their respective pursuits. The marshal and the officers of the abbaye moved slowly past, with the gravity and decorum that became their stations, occasionally halting to give time for the evolutions of those who followed; but the other actors now began in earnest to play their several parts. A group of young shepherdesses, clad in closely fitting vests of sky-blue with skirts of white, each holding her crook, came forward dancing, and singing songs that imitated the bleatings of their flocks and all the other sounds familiar to the elevated pasturages of that region. These were soon joined by an equal number of young shepherds also singing their pastorals, the whole exhibiting an active and merry group of dancers, accustomed to exercise their art on the sward of the Alps; for, in this festival, although we have spoken of the performers as actors, it is not in the literal meaning of the term, since, with few exceptions none appeared to represent any other calling than that which, in truth, formed his or her daily occupation. We shall not detain the narrative to say more of this party, than that they formed a less striking exception to the conventional picture of the appearance of those engaged in tending flocks, than the truth ordinarily betrays; and that their buoyant gaiety, blooming faces, and <b>unweaned</b> action, formed a good introductory preparation for the saltation that was to follow.|$|E

50|$|Eastern woodrats are {{a common}} prey item for many predators. Most common predators are the great horned owl, spotted skunk, long-tailed weasel, red fox, raccoon, and the timber rattlesnake, along with other various snakes.

50|$|The Spanish term lechazo {{refers to}} a young sheep that is still {{suckling}} (<b>unweaned).</b> Per the I.G.P., lechazo de Castilla y León must be of the Churra, Castellana or Ojalada breeds, and the lambs must have been fed only their mothers' milk.

Discussion of television is frequently interspersed in the essays with lengthy asides about Ellison's personal life, experiences and opinions in general.|$|E
50|$|Members of {{the species}} are not a uniform colour; <b>unweaned</b> juveniles are a light brown, turning to black after weaning. Adult males remain black, but adult females are brown. The name {{of the species}} is taken from the male's facial markings, a large patch of white fur {{around the edge of}} the mouth - this distinguishes it from a male of N. leucogenys, which has the white in a streak along the cheeks. Females have a thin edging of white around the face.|$|E

5000|$|Distinctions {{were usually}} made {{between men and}} women during the Old Testament period.

50|$|The Robigalia {{was held}} at the {{boundary}} of the Ager Romanus. Verrius Flaccus sites it in a grove (lucus) at the fifth milestone from Rome along the Via Claudia. The celebration included games (ludi) and a sacrificial offering of the blood and entrails of an <b>unweaned</b> puppy (catulus). Most animal sacrifice in the public religion of ancient Rome resulted in a communal meal and thus involved domestic animals whose flesh was a normal part of the Roman diet; the dog occurs as a victim most often in magic and private rites for Hecate and other chthonic deities, but was offered publicly at the Lupercalia and two other sacrifices pertaining to grain crops.|$|E
5000|$|Lechazo is a Spanish dish {{made from}} [...] "cordero lechal".

There are also seven stallion depots scattered throughout Spain. Vicos has 1042 hectares of land and Garrapilos has 630 hectares. [...] Mares live at Vicos, with unbred fillies kept separate from the mares with <b>unweaned</b> foals, and weanling colts go to Garrapilo {{until the age of}} five, at which point some mature stallions remain at Jerez de la Frontera, and others are placed at various centers across Spain.

5000|$|Milk-fed lamb — {{meat from}} an <b>unweaned</b> lamb, {{typically}} 4-6 weeks old and weighing 5.5 to 8 kg; {{this is almost}} unavailable {{in countries such as}} the United States and the United Kingdom, while it is popular in Iran and Persian Gulf countries.The flavour and texture of milk-fed lamb when grilled (such as the tiny lamb chops known as chuletillas in Spain) or roasted (lechazo asado or cordero lechal asado) is generally thought to be finer than that of older lamb, and fetches higher prices. [...] The areas in northern Spain where this can be found include Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, and La Rioja. Milk-fed lambs are especially prized for Easter in Greece, when they are roasted on a spit.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} an animal unit (AU) has {{traditionally}} been used in North America to facilitate planning, analysis and administration of forage use by grazing livestock, but the term has also had other applications (in relation to odor control regulation, feedlot size, manure management, etc.). The term has been variously defined by regulation in different jurisdictions, and by livestock management specialists, rangeland resource managers and others. Consequently, when using or interpreting the term, care is needed {{to ensure that a}} definition appropriate for the purpose is being used. Most (but not all) definitions are based on the concept that a 1000-pound (454 kg) cow, with or without an <b>unweaned</b> calf, is one animal unit, with such a cow being assumed to consume 26 pounds (about 12 kg) of forage dry matter per day.|$|E
50|$|The {{striped skunk}} may dig its own dens, {{though it will}} {{appropriate}} those abandoned by other animals should the opportunity present itself. These dens are normally used only in late fall, winter, and early spring, while females with <b>unweaned</b> kits make use of them in late spring and summer. In cultivated areas, striped skunks will dig their dens in fencerows, likely because {{they are less likely}} to be disturbed by machinery or livestock. In winter it is common for a single den to be occupied by multiple females and a single male. During this period, the striped skunk saves its energy by lowering its body temperature from 38 °C to 32 °C. Although it will forage for short periods in winter, it primarily depends on its fat reserves in cold weather, and can lose as much as 50% of its body weight.|$|E
