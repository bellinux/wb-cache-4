5|$|A few {{species are}} able to use {{chemical}} defences against predators; some Procellariiformes can eject an <b>unpleasant</b> stomach oil against an aggressor, and some species of pitohuis from New Guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathers.|$|E
5|$|Ants prey on P. fimbriata while P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk ants, {{regarding}} them as poisonous or very <b>unpleasant.</b> P. fimbriata is also preyed upon by birds, frogs, and mantises.|$|E
5|$|In {{rare cases}} where {{none of the}} oral {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has <b>unpleasant</b> side effects such as pain.|$|E
5|$|Sensory– darkening, smoke, foaming, thickening, rancid {{taste and}} <b>unpleasant</b> smell when heating. This {{is the most}} {{unreliable}} way to decide when to change oil because those are very individual factors and can depend on different causes.|$|E
5|$|Some caterpillars, {{especially}} {{members of}} Papilionidae, contain an osmeterium, a Y-shaped protrusible gland {{found in the}} prothoracic segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits <b>unpleasant</b> smells from the organ {{to ward off the}} predators.|$|E
5|$|The odor of this {{mushroom}} is indistinct {{but with}} age can become <b>unpleasant,</b> {{like that of}} decay or cheese. The fungus is said to taste oily bitter or bitter metallic.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an <b>unpleasant</b> soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Battarrea phalloides (as well as Battarrea stevenii) is {{typically}} described as unknown edibility, or inedible. In Cyprus, the immature egg-form {{of the fruit}} body is eaten. Older specimens may smell <b>unpleasant.</b> The spores of B.stevenii are used as a cicatrizant—a product that promotes healing through the formation of scar tissue–by the Criollo herdsmen of Gran Chaco in northern Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Beach Thomas {{was the son}} of a rural clergyman. He {{attended}} Shrewsbury School and the University of Oxford before {{embarking on}} a short-lived career as a schoolmaster. Finding that work <b>unpleasant,</b> he turned his attention to writing articles for newspapers and periodicals, and began to write books.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} <b>unpleasant</b> truth about himself, Barris begins to spiral out of control. After almost having a nervous {{breakdown}} {{on one of his}} shows, Barris shuts himself away in a New York City hotel. Penny manages to find him and tries in vain to convince him to return to California to get married.|$|E
5|$|In a flashforward to the prison, {{the ending}} is {{determined}} based on Reza's actions to Hossein throughout the game: if Reza was <b>unpleasant</b> to Hossein, Hajj frees the latter, who begins to choke Reza and demands Bibi's location; if Reza was favorable to Hossein, Hajj shoots and kills the latter, before pointing {{the gun to}} Reza's head and demanding Bibi's location.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} {{white noise}} machines became commercially available. These are used alone {{to provide a}} pleasant background noise and to mask <b>unpleasant</b> noise, a similar role to conventional background music. This usage can have health applications {{in the case of}} individuals struggling with over-stimulation or sensory processing disorder. Also, white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of The Age of Reason: An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ. Fearing <b>unpleasant</b> and even violent reprisals, Thomas Jefferson {{convinced}} {{him not to}} publish it in 1802; five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.|$|E
5|$|James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, the Secretary of Defense and, {{as former}} CIA Director, {{one of the}} few aware of the aliens' {{existence}} due to the ship recovered at Roswell. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North. The character's eventual firing lampoons Joe Nimziki, MGM's head of advertising, who made life <b>unpleasant</b> for Devlin and Emmerich when studio executives forced recuts of Stargate.|$|E
5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{flavor of}} cabbage {{is caused by}} glucosinolates, a class of sulfur-containing glucosides. Although found throughout the plant, these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue, and they decrease as the tissue ages. Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent, <b>unpleasant</b> odor and taste. These develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} a clapper for a film named The Devil of Christmas. In December 1977, Julian, his {{pregnant}} wife Kathy, his mother Celia and his son Toby are shown into an Austrian Alpine chalet by Klaus. The party discuss their plans until Toby is struck by an <b>unpleasant</b> painting of the Krampus on the wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} can {{be repeated}} if necessary, {{but this is}} generally taken as a clue that additional treatments {{may be required to}} control the symptoms and preserve vision. Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as <b>unpleasant</b> by patients, and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often. Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient's vision deteriorates rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Cleopatra notwithstanding, Etty {{remained}} {{a student at}} the RA and continued with a rigorous programme of study. Now in his mid 30s, he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired, despite his <b>unpleasant</b> experiences the last time he left England.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth and}} gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are {{generally}} sharp, lasting {{as long as}} the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an <b>unpleasant</b> sensation caused by intense or damaging events. In a toothache, nerves are stimulated by either exogenous sources (for instance, bacterial toxins, metabolic byproducts, chemicals, or trauma) or endogenous factors (such as inflammatory mediators).|$|E
5|$|When under attack, some {{octopuses}} {{can perform}} arm autotomy, {{in a manner}} similar to the way skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The crawling arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from <b>unpleasant</b> sensations. Octopuses can replace lost limbs.|$|E
5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to <b>unpleasant</b> radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront <b>unpleasant</b> truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had <b>unpleasant</b> side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 15 he was an {{offered a}} trial at Leeds United, where his uncle Jim was left back, but turned it down and instead joined his father in the mines. He worked in the mines {{for a short time}} but handed in his notice after finding out just how {{difficult}} and <b>unpleasant</b> it was to work deep underground. He applied to join the police and reconsidered the offer from Leeds United. His trial game for Leeds clashed with his police interview, and Charlton chose to play in the game; the trial was a success and he joined the ground staff at Elland Road.|$|E
5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also <b>unpleasant</b> for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
5|$|Implementing {{the diet}} can present {{difficulties}} for caregivers {{and the patient}} due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and <b>unpleasant.</b> Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet (MAD) or the low-glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) diet, because they find the difficulties too great.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd in {{association}} with Octopus Books published The Complete Novels, this edition was latter republished by Penguin Books in 1983, and reprinted in Penguin Classics 2000 and 2009. Since the publication of Davison's corrected critical edition, John Carey's thorough Essays was released on 15 October 2002, {{as a part of}} the Everyman's Library and George Packer edited two collections for Houghton Mifflin, released on 13 October 2008—All Art Is Propaganda: Critical Essays and Facing <b>Unpleasant</b> Facts: Narrative Essays.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, Mr. Bean was revived to {{form part}} of an {{animated}} cartoon series, with Rowan Atkinson reprising {{his role as the}} title character providing references for all of Bean's animated actions. Much like the live-action series, the animated series features little dialogue; although some words are spoken, most is either little soundbites or mumbling. The spin-off introduced a list of new characters, alongside regulars in the live-action (such as Teddy, and Irma Gobb), including an <b>unpleasant</b> landlady of Mr. Bean, Mrs. Wicket, and her evil one-eyed cat, Scrapper. Other characters' voices are provided by Jon Glover, Rupert Degas, Gary Martin and Lorelei King.|$|E
5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its <b>unpleasant</b> taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E
5|$|Marie-Thérèse {{married her}} cousin Louis Antoine on 9 June 1799 at Jelgava Palace. Louis XVIII ordered {{his wife to}} attend the {{marriage}} ceremony in Courland without her long-time friend (and rumoured lover) Marguerite de Gourbillon. Queen Marie Joséphine lived apart from her husband in Schleswig Holstein. Louis XVIII was trying desperately to display to the world a united family front. The queen refused to leave her friend behind with <b>unpleasant</b> consequences that rivalled the wedding in notoriety. Louis XVIII knew that his nephew Louis Antoine was not compatible with Marie-Thérèse. Despite this, he still pressed for the marriage, which proved to be quite unhappy and produced no children.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or <b>unpleasant.</b> Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become <b>unpleasant</b> company.|$|E
5|$|The Army Service Forces was {{abolished}} on 14 May 1946, on {{the recommendation}} of War Department's Simpson Board, but the Army Ground Forces remained. Devers' November 1945 testimony before the board had urged that the Army Service Forces be retained. Army Ground Forces was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization gathered pace, the strength of the army shrank dramatically. Devers was faced with the <b>unpleasant</b> task of informing many officers that they were being demoted. One reform that he did achieve was {{to reduce the number of}} combat branches to just three: infantry, armor and artillery.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{character}} being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall {{is not unique to}} Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar's feast episode of the Bible. The term 'ghost at the feast' has entered popular culture, and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering, or (considering the general plot of Macbeth) a reminder of a person's <b>unpleasant</b> past or likely future.|$|E
5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some argue that a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an <b>unpleasant</b> rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E
5|$|The minor inmates at the Castellania {{were the}} ones who took care of the general maintenance, {{cleaning}} and repair works of the building, while guards were responsible for the allocation of tasks and observing their performance. Some historical graffiti made by prisoners {{can be found at the}} courtyard of the prison. At the underground are the dungeons, which are described as an <b>unpleasant</b> place to stay. By the early 19th century, arrested females awaiting a court decision started to be sent to the women prison at Corradino (now a police station) rather than accommodated at the Castellania.|$|E
