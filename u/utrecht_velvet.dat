'Micah, {{you shall}} take this worthy man to my room, {{and see that}} he hath dry linen, and my second-best suit of <b>Utrecht</b> <b>velvet.</b> It may serve until his own are dried. My boots, too, may perchance be useful--my riding ones of untanned leather. A hat with silver {{braiding}} hangs above them in the cupboard. See that he lacks for nothing which the house can furnish. Supper will be ready when he hath changed his attire. I beg that you will go at once, good Master Saxon, lest you take a chill.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Master Decimus Saxon in my father's black <b>Utrecht</b> <b>velvet</b> and untanned riding boots {{looked a}} very {{different}} man to the bedraggled castaway who had crawled like a conger eel into our fishing-boat. It seemed {{as if he had}} cast off his manner with his raiment, for he behaved to my mother during supper with an air of demure gallantry which sat upon him better than the pert and flippant carriage which he had shown towards us in the boat. Truth to say, if he was now more reserved, there was a very good reason for it, for he played such havoc amongst the eatables that there was little time for talk. At last, after passing from the round of cold beef to a capon pasty, and topping up with a two-pound perch, washed down by a great jug of ale, he smiled upon us all and told us that his fleshly necessities were satisfied for the nonce. 'It is my rule,' he remarked, 'to obey the wise precept which advises a man to rise from table feeling that he could yet eat as much as he has partaken of.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Mockado was {{introduced}} to England from Flanders in the mid-sixteenth century. Dutch and Walloon weavers fleeing Spanish rule in the Low Countries were creating mockadoes and other fabrics combining silk and linen with combed woollens in the weaving center of Norwich by 1571. Varieties included plain, with an even pile, and [...] "tuft" [...] or voided mockado. Mockadoes were woven in solid or changeable colours, and were sometimes stamped with patterns in imitation of more expensive <b>Utrecht</b> <b>velvets</b> [...] Mockado was always a rough fabric, and by the 1580s, the term [...] "mockado" [...] was synonymous with [...] "inferior" [...] or [...] "tawdry". In discussing the old English tradition of new clothes at Easter, folklorist Peter Opie cites Thomas Lodge's 1596 pamphlet Wits Miserie : [...] "The farmer that was contented in times past with his Russet Frocke & Mockado sleeues, now sels a Cow against Easter to buy him silken geere for his Credit".|$|R
6000|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders. He had {{a volume of}} Verlaine in his hands, and he wandered off. He tried to read, but his passion was too strong. He thought of the stray amours {{to which he had}} been {{introduced}} by Flanagan, the sly visits to houses in a cul-de-sac, with the drawing-room in <b>Utrecht</b> <b>velvet,</b> and the mercenary graces of painted women. He shuddered. He threw himself on the grass, stretching his limbs like a young animal freshly awaked from sleep; and the rippling water, the poplars gently tremulous in the faint breeze, the blue sky, were almost more than he could bear. He was in love with love. In his fancy he felt the kiss of warm lips on his, and around his neck the touch of soft hands. He imagined himself in the arms of Ruth Chalice, he thought of her dark eyes and the wonderful texture of her skin; he was mad to have let such a wonderful adventure slip through his fingers. And if Lawson had done it why should not he? But this was only when he did not see her, when he lay awake at night or dreamed idly {{by the side of the}} canal; when he saw her he felt suddenly quite different; he had no desire to take her in his arms, and he could not imagine himself kissing her. It was very curious. Away from her he thought her beautiful, remembering only her magnificent eyes and the creamy pallor of her face; but when he was with her he saw only that she was flat-chested and that her teeth were slightly decayed; he could not forget the corns on her toes. He could not understand himself. Would he always love only in absence and be prevented from enjoying anything when he had the chance by that deformity of vision which seemed to exaggerate the revolting? ...|$|E

[...] An' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand; [...] But I never talked 'em secrets. I paid 'em out o' hand. [...] Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies! Now what's five thousand to me, [...] For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be? [...] I believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain, [...] But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again. [...] For the heart it shall go with the treasure--go down to the sea in [...] ships. [...] I'm sick of the hired women--I'll kiss my girl on her lips! [...] I'll be content with my fountain, I'll drink from my own well, [...] And the wife of my youth shall charm me--an' the rest can go to Hell! [...] (Dickie, he will, that's certain.) I'll lie in our standin'-bed, [...] An' Mac'll take her in ballast--and she trims best by the head.... Down by the head an' sinkin'. Her fires are drawn and cold, [...] And the water's splashin' hollow on the skin of the empty hold-- [...] Churning an' choking and chuckling, quiet and scummy and dark-- [...] Full to her lower hatches and risin' steady.
