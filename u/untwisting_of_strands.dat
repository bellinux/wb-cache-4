60|$|Tent-poles.--When a tent is pitched for an encampment of some duration, {{it is well}} to lay {{aside the}} jointed tent-pole, and to cut a stout young tree to replace it: this will be found far more {{trustworthy}} in stormy weather. If {{the shape of the}} tent admits of the change, it is still better {{to do away with the}} centre pole altogether; and, in the place of it, to erect a substantial framework of poles, which are to be planted just within the rim of the tent, and to converge to a point, under its peak. A tent-pole can be lengthened temporarily, by lashing it to a log, with the help of a Toggle and strop (which see). A broken tent-pole can be mended permanently by placing a splint of wood on either side of the fracture, and by whipping the whole together, with soft cord or with the <b>untwisted</b> <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> a piece of rope.|$|R

In contrast, results {{obtained for the}} 2 micron plasmid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are consistent with only 30 % of the DNA being constrained from thermal untwisting in vivo. In this paper, we examine thermal <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> several plasmids in yeast cells, nuclei, and nuclear extracts. All show the same quantitative degree <b>of</b> thermal <b>untwisting,</b> indicating that this phenomenon is independent of DNA sequence. Highly purified yeast plasmid chromatin also shows a large degree <b>of</b> thermal <b>untwisting,</b> whereas circular chromatin reconstituted using chicken histones is restrained from thermal untwisting in yeast nuclear extracts. Thus, the difference in thermal untwisting between yeast chromatin and that assembled with chicken histones is most likely {{due to differences in}} the constituent histone proteins...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDetails of the {{reaction}} coordinate for DNA melting are fundamental to much of biology and biotechnology. Recently, {{it has been shown}} experimentally that {{there are at least three}} states involved. To clarify {{the reaction}} mechanism of the melting transition of DNA, we perform 100 -ns molecular dynamics simulations of a homo-oligomeric, 12 -basepair DNA duplex, d(A 12) ·d(T 12), with explicit salt water at 400 K. Analysis of the trajectory reveals the various biochemically important processes that occur on different timescales. Peeling (including fraying from the ends), searching for Watson-Crick complements, and dissociation are recognizable processes. However, we find that basepair searching for Watson-Crick complements along a strand is not mechanistically tied to or directly accessible from the dissociation steps <b>of</b> <b>strand</b> melting. A three-step melting mechanism is proposed where the <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> the duplex is determined to be the major component {{of the reaction}} coordinate at the barrier. Though the observations are limited to the characteristics of the system being studied, they provide important insight into the mechanism of melting of other more biologically relevant forms of DNA, which will certainly differ in details from those here...|$|R

40|$|Free DNA in {{solution}} exhibits an <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> {{the double}} helix with increasing temperature. We have shown previously that when DNA is reconstituted with histones to form nucleosome core particles, both the core DNA and the adjacent linker DNA are constrained from thermal <b>untwisting.</b> The origin <b>of</b> this constraint is unknown. Here {{we examine the}} effect of two modifications of nucleosome structure on the constraint against thermal untwisting, and also on DNA topology. In one experiment, we removed the highly positively charged histone amino and carboxy termini by trypsinization. Alternatively, we added histone H 5, a histone H 1 variant from chick erythrocytes. Neither of these modifications had any major effect on DNA topology or twist in the nucleosome...|$|R
40|$|Homologous recombination, {{which is}} {{critical}} to genetic diversity, depends on homologous pairing (HP). HP is the switch from parental to recombinant base pairs, which requires expansion of inter-base pair spaces. This expansion unavoidably causes <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> the parental double-stranded DNA. RecA/Rad 51 -catalyzed ATP-dependent HP is extensively stimulated in vitro by negative supercoils, which compensates for untwisting. However, in vivo, double-stranded DNA is relaxed by bound proteins and thus is an unfavorable substrate for RecA/Rad 51. In contrast, Mhr 1, an ATP-independent HP protein required for yeast mitochondrial homologous recombination, catalyzes HP without the net <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> double-stranded DNA. Therefore, we questioned whether Mhr 1 uses a novel strategy to promote HP. Here, we found that, like RecA, Mhr 1 induced the extension of bound single-stranded DNA. In addition, this structure was induced by all evolutionarily and structurally distinct HP proteins so far tested, including bacterial RecO, viral RecT, and human Rad 51. Thus, HP includes the common non-canonical DNA structure and uses a common core mechanism, independent of the species of HP proteins. We discuss the significance of multiple types of HP proteins...|$|R

40|$|The {{technique}} of image analysis {{has been used}} to assess the quality <b>of</b> model oriented <b>strand</b> board panels by investigating the relationships between shape and size <b>of</b> <b>strands,</b> the distribution <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> and bending properties. A batch <b>of</b> commercial <b>strands</b> was analysed by image analysis and the distribution of the shape and size <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> was quantified. The strands were categorised into five strand types as a function of size and aspect ratio. In general, strand shapes were observed to be mostly rectangular and there was also a wide variation in strand dimensions in commercial material. Bigger area strands had low aspect ratios and small strands had high aspect ratios. Half <b>of</b> the commercial <b>strands</b> were longer than 100 mm. Model OSB panels were manufactured in the laboratory by hot pressing strand mats formed from each <b>of</b> the five <b>strand</b> types. Strands were laid up by hand into the forming mat and following pressing the orientation and shape <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> was evaluated by image analysis and the panels were tested in a three point bending. Large area (type 3) strands with high aspect ratios produced model panels with optimum strand orientation and mechanical properties. Type 3 panels were also fabricated from strands dropped through a slotted forming device in order to simulate the delivery <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> to the forming line under factory conditions. As the height <b>of</b> <b>strand</b> delivery increased from 0 to 100 to 200 mm the disorientation <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> in the pressed panels progressively increased and as a result mechanical properties in bending were reduced. Image analysis is therefore a powerful tool for evaluating the distribution <b>of</b> commercial <b>strand</b> shapes and the relationship between strand geometry, strand orientation and the mechanical properties <b>of</b> oriented <b>strand</b> board...|$|R

40|$|Benign cystic tumors, {{specifically}} dermoid or mucinous cysts, are {{the most}} frequent causes of ovarian torsion. In clinical practice, adnexal torsion is usually subjected to adnexectomy to prevent embolism of thrombosed ovarian veins and its sequelae. However, this intervention is unsatisfactory for young {{women who want to}} preserve their fertility. In such situations, conservative management with <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> the adnexa, followed by cystectomy to preserve part of the ovary, would be a better option. In this report, we present a case of adnexal torsion due to cystic teratoma. A 25 -year-old unmarried woman with lower abdominal pain and nausea was referred to our emergency room with suspicion of an ovarian mass. Ultrasonography showed a left ovarian mass measuring 9. 7 × 6. 5 × 6. 2 cm with heterogeneous components within it. Laparoscopy showed an enlarged, dusky left ovary with torsion. Detorsion was performed and followed by cystectomy. The pathology revealed cystic teratoma of the ovary. We report this case to emphasize that <b>untwisting</b> <b>of</b> potentially viable adnexa, followed by cystectomy, in patients with adnexal torsion appears to be a safe procedure. This conservative approach should be encouraged in women of childbearing age to reduce the possibility of premenopausal loss of ovarian function...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the arrangement <b>of</b> wood <b>strands</b> at the surface <b>of</b> oriented <b>strand</b> board (OSB) by image analysis. Two-dimensional image analysis enables the number <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> and the area <b>of</b> each <b>strand</b> to be computed. In addition, the fiber direction <b>of</b> each <b>strand</b> may be measured manually by recording the acute angle between the fiber direction and the longitudinal axis of the specimen. The image analysis results suggest the following. the average strand area is proportional to the reciprocal of the number <b>of</b> <b>strands.</b> Samples containing many smaller strands exhibit a larger variation in strand size. The average strand area does not correlate with the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>strand</b> area represented by the coefficient of variation. However, there is a reasonable correlation between the number <b>of</b> smaller <b>strands</b> in the range 0 to 1 cm(2) and the coefficient <b>of</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>strand</b> area. At low average fiber orientations, i. e. better orientation with the principal panel axis, there is smaller variability in orientation. The upper side and lower side of OSB exhibit a different relationship between average fiber orientation and strand area. The upper side of the specimens contains larger strands and exhibits better fiber orientation than the lower side. This is thought to be a function of the production process. The lower side strands fall on a smooth moving substrate, whereas the upper side strands fall on a stable substrate <b>of</b> <b>strands.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> is lower on the upper side of the OSB panel because small size strands tend to migrate to the lower side of the OSB during production.
