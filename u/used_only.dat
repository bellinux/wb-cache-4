Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method <b>used</b> <b>only</b> by the Indians, whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was <b>used</b> <b>only</b> by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Edwards curves have {{attracted}} great interest for several rea-sons. When curve parameters are chosen properly, the addition formulas <b>use</b> <b>only</b> 10 M+ 1 S. The formulas are strongly unified, i. e., work without change for doublings; even better, they are complete, i. e., work without change for all inputs. Dedicated doubling formulas <b>use</b> <b>only</b> 3 M + 4 S, and dedicated tripling formulas <b>use</b> <b>only</b> 9 M + 4 S. This paper introduces inverted Edwards coordinates. Inverted Edwards coordinates (X 1 : Y 1 : Z 1) represent the affine point (Z 1 /X 1, Z 1 /Y 1) on an Edwards curve; for comparison, standard Edwards coordinates (X 1 : Y 1 : Z 1) represent the affine point (X 1 /Z 1, Y 1 /Z 1). This paper presents addition formulas for inverted Edwards coor-dinates <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 9 M + 1 S. The formulas are not complete but still are strongly unified.
