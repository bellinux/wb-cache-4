In response, Aqil assembled his entire force of irregulars, amounting to some 300–400 men, and marched towards Shamdin's troops.

25|$|The 1930 season, at 6–2–1, was a {{rebuilding}} one for Sutherland, and {{was marked}} by a loss to Notre Dame {{that would be the}} only meeting between Sutherland and Knute Rockne due to his death in a 1931 plane crash. The Irish also spoiled Pitt's perfect season in a 1931 game at South Bend, although the Panthers finished 8–1 with six shutouts, including a 40–0 dismantling of Nebraska. That season also saw Pitt defeat Penn State in State College, using only one first-string player, by a score of 41–6 en route to winning the Eastern Championship. These accomplishments would prompt Parke Davis to again name the Panthers national champions. Pitt would exact revenge at home the following season by shutting out Notre Dame 12–0, and would also <b>upend</b> undefeated Penn in Philadelphia, as well as shut out Stanford at home {{on their way to the}} 1932 Eastern Championship. However, the season ended when the Panthers, in their third Rose Bowl, were again defeated by USC. The 1933 season was spoiled only by a 7–3 loss at Minnesota in which the Panthers fumbled twice inside their own 5-yard line. Minnesota would best Pitt again in 1934, when the Panthers squandered a third quarter lead to lose 13–7 to the undefeated Gophers. However, in 1934 Pitt also won at Nebraska 25–6, shut out Notre Dame 19–0, its third victory in a row over the Irish, and got revenge for the previous Rose Bowl losses to USC by defeating the Trojans 20–6 at Pitt Stadium. With these victories Pitt was named Eastern Champions as well as being awarded a share of the national championship by Parke Davis. Pitt underwent rebuilding in 1935, going 7–1–2. Of historic note, in 1935, Pitt battled then football powerhouse Fordham, who featured the Seven Blocks of Granite which included guard Vince Lombardi, to the first of what would be three consecutive scoreless ties at New York City's Polo Grounds. Pitt ended the season with a 12–7 win at USC.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this report is the <b>upending</b> of a {{floating}} monopile for an offshore wind turbine foundation. This is an assignment of Van Oord Dredging and Marine Contractors BV. An analytical model has been developed to simulate the <b>upending</b> of a monopile in MapleTM, based on the general theoretical principles {{and the experience of}} Van Oord. An experiment was then done to validate the analytical model. The MapleTM script can be used to calculate the forces of the crane for future projects. The monopile, sealed with two end-caps, is towed by a tugboat from the storage site to the installation site and is then <b>upended</b> by the jack-up vessel of Van Oord, the Aeolus. The end-caps guarantee buoyancy during transport and <b>upending.</b> After <b>upending</b> the end-caps are removed, either internally or externally. A conceptual design has been developed for both removal methods. With <b>upending</b> the vertical position of the monopile can be reached with a nett weight of the pile greater than the safe working load of the crane using the buoyant force. The minimum draught needed for the buoyant force to remain within the safe working load of the crane, determines the minimum hydrostatic pressure needed for the external removal of the bottom-cap. The top-cap can only be removed once the pile has been placed on the seabed, since the buoyant force is the auxiliary of the crane. As shown in figure 1, the <b>upending</b> of the monopile is performed, by vertically displacing the connection point between the pile and the crane. Because the crane hook is attached to the pile with a hinge, the monopile can rotate freely around this point. For the analytical model in MapleTM it is assumed that the <b>upending</b> process is quasi-static because the influence of the inertia is negligible. The experiment has confirmed that the inertia may indeed be neglected by showing the similarity between two scaled <b>upending</b> tests at different continuous hoisting velocities and the corresponding quasi-static simulation. Therefore the scaled <b>upending</b> correlates to the quasi-static model. It is found that, only when the lifting starts and stops, and respectively the acceleration and deceleration are relatively large, the inertia influences the <b>upending</b> process. Further research to refine the <b>upending</b> process, as well as the design of the end-caps is recommended. The hoisting speed of the crane can be optimized if the expectations of the experiment and the analytical model are confirmed in practice. The design depends on the airflow when releasing the end-cap and the internal pressure when lowering the pile towards the seabed. The internal pressure can be controlled using a pressure valve. These recommendations will lead to the optimized <b>upending</b> process of monopiles for offshore wind turbine foundations that are transported by towage using end-caps.

500|$|Critics {{have also}} {{commented on the}} broad {{influence}} of the book, with writers such as Budrys citing it as an influence upon their own writing. More generally it has been asserted that the work has been widely influential in the science fiction field, with The Paris Review claiming that [...] "No single work did more to <b>upend</b> the genre's conventions than The Left Hand of Darkness". Donna White, in her study of the critical literature on Le Guin, argued that Left Hand {{was one of the}} seminal works of science fiction, as important as Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, which is often described as the very first science fiction novel. Suzanne Reid wrote that at the time the novel was written, Le Guin's ideas of androgyny were unique not only to science fiction, but to literature in general.|$|E

500|$|To provide Bosh with an {{experienced}} frontcourt partner, the Raptors pulled a blockbuster trade {{prior to the}} 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers. Bosh—who had won an Olympic gold medal with the national team at Beijing 2008—started the season strong. He averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds and 3.7 assists in his first three games and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week {{for the fifth time}} in his career. A week later, he became Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds, surpassing Antonio Davis's record. While Bosh and O'Neal formed a formidable partnership in the frontcourt, the Raptors struggled to surpass the [...]500 mark. The principal deficiency of previous campaigns—wing players—continued to <b>upend</b> Toronto's progress. With the Raptors at 8–9, head coach Sam Mitchell was sacked and replaced by Jay Triano. Despite the move, injuries and weaknesses in the roster meant that the Raptors entered the All-Star break 13 games under [...]500. On January 29, 2009, Bosh was named an All-Star reserve, but an injury ruled him out of the game. Two weeks later, in a bid to bring in a wing player and create greater salary flexibility, O'Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks. The trade did not improve the team's win–loss record, however, and the Raptors were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining. The bright spark in Bosh's campaign was his career-high 22.7 points per game, as well as his being one of two players in the league that season (the other being Dwight Howard) to average a 20/10 in points and rebounds. On April 20, 2009, Colangelo announced that he would offer Bosh a contract extension during the summer, which Bosh later refused to sign.|$|E
