500|$|Temple and Davies {{thought that}} the episode was not a [...] "fun reappearance" [...] of an old monster; instead, they {{felt that there was}} [...] "an actual story to tell". Temple {{emphasised}} in his script that the Doctor overlooked the Ood <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Devil, and the character had to see his shortcomings. Temple's script also emphasised the Ood's slavery; both Temple and lead actor David Tennant commented that the existence of a species born to serve was complicated, the latter stating complications with Richard Dawkins' selfish gene theory. Donna's role in the episode was to further humanise the Doctor, and her opinion of the Ood changing from her initial disgust at their appearance to empathy for them was important to the episode and her character development. Susie Liggat cited the writing as part of Doctor Whos importance—she thought the story about [...] "liberating oppressed people" [...] could be applied domestically or globally.|$|E

The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, [...] which Lansbury opposed [...] {{as a form of}} economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers' Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a [...] policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of [...] "hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be told what to do with it". Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later.|$|E

[...] The fourth track, a mash-up of Queen's [...] "I Want It All" [...] and [...] "We Will Rock You", includes rap verses by Armageddon, formerly a member of Terror Squad. Torrini's take on [...] "White Rabbit" [...] includes a Middle Eastern-style outro with guitars and an orchestral pomp. According to Rick Florino of Artistdirect, the [...] "Sucker Punch Remix" [...] of Björk's [...] "Army of Me" [...] is based upon a trip hop production and [...] "repeatedly pummels via the psychedelic vocal delivery and careening, crushing guitars". de Vries considered emblematic of the film's theme of female empowerment having women covering songs originally performed by male singers - [...] "Search & Destroy", and [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] - during the action scenes for the concept of [...] "the female voice telling the story through song (...) where the iconic original performance is a very strong male performance”. The artists who would perform the covers were chosen for having [...] "female voices with enough authority and panache and just cultural presence to come out from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> those performances, and to make this about songs which both comment on the tone of the scene and also help navigate us across the sort of boundaries of these individual worlds which are part of Emily’s imagination." ...|$|E
