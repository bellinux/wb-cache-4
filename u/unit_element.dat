5|$|Max Verstappen {{received}} a five-place grid penalty for the Canadian Grand Prix after causing {{a collision with}} Romain Grosjean in Monaco. During the final practice session, Toro Rosso had to equip his car with the fifth internal combustion engine of the season. As he exceeded the limit of four units per power <b>unit</b> <b>element</b> per season, he {{received a}}n additional ten-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Since {{he did not}} post a {{lap time}} within 107% of the fastest time during Q1, Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} race stewards to be allowed to the start the race; they granted him permission to do so. After qualifying, McLaren had to fit his car with a fifth heat motor generator unit (MGU-H) and a fifth turbo charger for the season. As this exceeded the limit of four units per power <b>unit</b> <b>element,</b> Button was later handed ten-place and five-place grid penalties. As he was already due to start {{from the back of the}} grid, the penalty was substituted with a drive-through penalty, to be served within the first three laps of the race.|$|E

25|$|Drivers {{were only}} able to use five engines {{over the course of}} a season in 2014, down from eight in 2013. Drivers who used a sixth engine started the race from the pit lane, as opposed to the ten-place grid penalty handed down for going over the engine quota in {{previous}} season. Drivers were {{only able to}} use five individual components of each power <b>unit</b> <b>element</b> over the course of the season. If a driver went over this quota for any individual element, they incurred a ten-place grid penalty. They would receive a further five-place penalty for going over the five-unit allocation of any other element after the original ten-place penalty was applied in a bid to stop teams changing multiple elements of the engine unit after receiving a grid penalty.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTopologically {{interlocked}} materials (TIMs) are a {{class of}} materials made by a structured assembly of an array of identically shaped and sized <b>unit</b> <b>elements</b> that are held in a confining framework. The assembly can resist transverse forces {{in the absence of}} adhesives between the <b>unit</b> <b>elements.</b> The present study focuses on topologically interlocked materials with cellular <b>unit</b> <b>elements.</b> The resulting materials achieve their properties by a combination of deformation of the individual <b>unit</b> <b>elements</b> and their contact interaction. Drop tower tests were conducted to characterize the mechanical behavior of the cellular TIMs made of an intrinsically brittle base material. The TIMs were found to exhibit perfect softening, independent of the relative density of the cellular units. The analysis of the experiments revealed a positive correlation between strength and toughness in contrast to more conventional materials. An analytical model for the prediction of the observed material behavior is developed. Model predictions are in agreement with experimental data. The implications of the present findings for the design of these novel materials are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The coupled {{electromechanical}} {{response of}} dielectrics is analyzed {{in terms of}} the local response and the distribution of its microstructural <b>unit</b> <b>elements.</b> A comparison between two variational statements for a continuous and a discrete systems results in an estimate for the macroscopic coupled electromechanical energy-density function. Next, a few types of <b>unit</b> <b>elements</b> are considered and the corresponding behaviors of dielectrics with a random distribution of these elements are calculated. Additionally, to highlight the possible effect of local constraints among the <b>unit</b> <b>elements,</b> a deterministic model for a network of polymer chains is proposed and its response to electric excitation is determined. The practically common case of a uniaxial stretch aligned with the electric field is examined in detail and the results are compared with widely accepted macroscopic models and available experimental results...|$|R
