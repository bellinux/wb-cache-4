Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the characteristics of the reported cases {{of occupational}} diseases, in the context of the largest insurance scheme in Greece. Methods: Socio-demographic characteristics related to the identified cases of occupational diseases were collected from the archives of the special medical committee of the Social Insurance Institute (Idrima Koininikon Asfaliseon, IKA) for the year 1999. This year was chosen given that it largely represents the highest number of registered occupational diseases in comparison to the period 2000 - 2009. Results: Sixty-seven (67) occupational diseases were recognized (3. 4 cases/ 100, 000 employees). There were 32 new cases (incidence rate: 1. 64 / 100, 000 employees). Occupational skin conditions and diseases of the respiratory system accounted for 85 % of all diagnoses. Builders and unskilled blue collar workers were the most frequent occupational groups affected. Conclusions: These findings indicate a high rate of <b>under-registration</b> of occupational diseases in Greece, compared to data from the European Union. This <b>under-registration</b> could be attributed to a variety of limitations related to the current model of occupational health in Greece. The present pattern of registered occupational morbidity reflects the under-development of occupational health in Greece and stresses the need for further and intensified work in order to create modern occupational health services in this country...|$|E
40|$|Universal full {{coverage}} of birth registration by 2030 {{is one of}} the sustainable development targets which itself is of great significance for the accomplishment of many development goals such as poverty eradication, inclusion, as well as improvement of several health factors. Despite the importance of this topic, not much academic {{attention has been paid to}} study the problem of birth <b>under-registration</b> from the perspective of development studies. This research studies the issue of birth <b>under-registration</b> through a case study of Iran. The four main questions of this research are the quantitative significance of the problem, the main causes of birth <b>under-registration,</b> the most affected social groups, and the main problematic domain of action, in the context of Iran. By utilizing an abductive content analysis method, this research aims to understand the problem, rather than proposing policy recommendations. This desk study uses secondary sources and almost all of the sources are of qualitative nature. It is not based on any pre-defined theory and therefore does not aim to generalize nor theorize the findings. It, however, is based on available theories for developing the analytical framework. The adopted analytical framework is Bottleneck analysis which is a method designed by UNICEF specifically for the purpose of birth registration programming and policy evaluation. Birth <b>under-registration</b> in Iran - compared to other countries in the region - turned out to be very low. The findings provide information on many good practices regarding birth registration programming and also about several areas in need of improvement in Iran. By applying the analytical framework to the findings, identified disincentives have been categorized in three domains of supply, demand, and enabling environment, and the significance of disincentives in each domain has been assessed. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that almost all of the main causes of birth registration are of legal nature, especially patriarchal nationality laws. Also, it was found that the main risk groups were children of illegal immigrants, non-nationals, and unregistered parents, and the main problematic domain is found to be the domain of supply...|$|E

The study was carried out in Palermo (Italy). The impact of water meter ageing was evaluated in laboratory by testing 180 revenue meters, ranging from 0 to 45 years in age. The effects of the private water tanks were determined via field monitoring of real users and a mathematical model. This study demonstrates that the impact on apparent losses from the meter starting flow rapidly increases with meter age.

It also complicates the position advanced by some social scientists that Asian Americans are "becoming white. " Beyond the theoretical puzzle, low rates of electoral participation {{from one of the}} fastest-growing segments of the American population have sobering implications for the practice of democratic self-governance and the representativeness of public policies. In this dissertation, I approach the puzzle of Asian American under-participation in electoral politics from a contextual perspective by investigating how different political contexts change the extent to which Asian Americans under-participate in the electoral process. I employ a multi-method research design, beginning with statistical analyses that identify the correlates of <b>under-registration</b> and under-voting among Asian American citizens. I find that it is at the registration stage where Asian American "exceptionalism" in the sense of an unusually large and unexplained degree of under-participation in electoral participation occurs. I then perform an in-depth comparison of two California counties that differ substantially in their magnitude of Asian American <b>under-registration</b> relative to whites, and in their values of the correlates. I find that the incentives for electoral candidates and political parties to target Asian Americans for registration differ substantially between the two counties, and that the mobilization strategies that follow from those uneven incentives are what accounts for the difference between the counties in the degree of Asian American <b>under-registration.</b> I conclude that, when political agents are incentivized to target Asian Americans for mobilization, the gap in voter registration between socioeconomically comparable Asian and white American citizens is significantly reduced. The missing piece in the puzzle of Asian American under-participation in electoral politics is political mobilization...|$|E

Method: Systematic {{review of the literature}} on clinical and radiological results of cemented THA in RA. Results: Twenty-one case series and eight reports on four implant registries were included. The quality of most studies was judged to be poor. The reported rates of infection and dislocation in the case series were conflicting with a risk of bias due to <b>under-registration.</b> The registries proved unsuitable for providing reliable data on the incidence of these two complications. Increased rates of aseptic loosening were reported in 10 out of 20 case series on the cup and in six out of 19 on the stem. Nearly all of these were based on series implanted before 1980. None of the registries reported a significantly increased risk of aseptic loosening of cup or stem. Conclusions: Considering the relatively frequent reports of increased infection rates in combination with the potential <b>under-registration</b> of complications, RA patients have to be considered to have a mild increased risk of postoperative infection. Case series and registries cannot answer the question of whether RA is a risk factor for dislocation as multivariate analysis is required.

40|$|In {{water supply}} systems, a {{considerable}} amount of apparent loss is caused by meter <b>under-registration.</b> Water meters are subject to intrinsic systemic error depending on the actual flow rates passing through them. Furthermore, the moving parts of the meter are subject to wear and tear that progressively reduce meter accuracy. The increase in systemic error is especially evident at low flow rates because of growing friction in the rotating mechanism, which requires a higher flow to start the meter (starting flow). The aim {{of this paper is to}} experimentally investigate metering error in an attempt to find a direct link between meter age, network pressure and apparent losses caused by the inability of the meter to accurately register the volume passing though it at low flow rates. The study was performed through laboratory experiments in which worn-out water meters were tested using a test bench. The results of the laboratory experiments show that ageing and pressure are both relevant parameters for determining meter starting flow. These results were then applied to assess the effects on apparent losses of the age of the meter, varying pressure values upstream of the meter (the pressure in the network where the meter is installed) and different patterns of flow rates passing through the device (the consumption pattern of the user). The presented results are useful for understanding the effects of operating conditions on water meter <b>under-registration,</b> which can aid water managers in implementing effective replacement campaigns...|$|E

Official statistics registered a decrease in mortality over the 1990 s in spite of local wars, mass flows of refugees, and severe economic hardships faced by populations. According to official statistics, in 1999 - 2000 population size was about 5. 4 millions in Georgia and about 3. 8 millions in Armenia. Non-official estimates based on migration surveys are much lower: 4. 0 - 4. 1 millions and 3. 0 millions, respectively. This huge difference is mostly due to unregistered out-migration. In addition to corrections in population, corrections are made for <b>under-registration</b> of deaths. Hospital statistics is used for infant deaths and the Coale-Demeny model life tables are used for ages above 70. In Georgia, the introduction of payment for the declaration of vital events resulted in a greater <b>under-registration</b> of deaths than in Armenia.

O percentual de sub-registro foi 8, 6 % (Intervalo de ConfianÃ§a de 95 % - 7, 0 % a 10, 3 %), sendo que 95 % dos registros foram efetuados fora do prazo. O intervalo mÃ©dio de tempo entre o nascimento e o registro foi de 13, 1 anos. As coortes nascidas antes da lei da gratuidade do registro de nascimento foram registradas mais cedo (0, 7 ano) do que as nascidas depois da lei da gratuidade (15, 2 anos).

Os principais motivos do nÃ£o registro foram "falta de interesse dos pais" e "o pai nÃ£o reconheceu a paternidade".

The rate of unregistered births was 8. 6 % (95 % Confidence Interval 7. 0 % to 10. 3 %). 95 % of the registrations were performed after the period within which it is legally required in rural areas (within 105 days of birth).

40|$|Apparent losses form an {{important}} component of the International Water Association's water balance. While apparent losses look like real losses to a municipality, this is not actually the case. The main components of apparent losses are water meter <b>under-registration</b> and unauthorised consumption. Water utilities in South Africa and internationally are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of good meter management practices based on the vast amount of literature published and work done by municipalities in recent years. Water meters are known to increasingly under-register as they age and register consumption. They register consumption the least accurate at low flowrates and their accuracy in this range deteriorates the fastest. This study investigates the extent of the apparent loss problem in selected areas of South Africa due to meter inaccuracy in a number of different ways, including an inspection of new residential consumer meters, interrogation of a metering database, flow logging of domestic consumers with and without an Unmeasured Flow Reducer (UFR) installed and a compilation of reports on bulk consumer meters. It was found that 16 % of 402 properties investigated in the City of Cape Town had an on-site leakage and their median flowrate was 10 litres/ hour. In Bloemfontein, it was found that 28 % of the 167 properties investigated had an on-site leakage with a median flowrate of 20 l/h.

The most frequent types of skeletal dysplasia were achondroplasia, with a prevalence rate between 0. 5 and 1. 5 / 10 000 births, the thanatophoric dysplasia/achondrogenesis group (0. 2 and 0. 5 / 10 000 births), and osteogenesis imperfecta (0. 4 / 10 000 births). The mutation rate for autosomal dominant achondroplasia was estimated at between 1. 72 and 5. 57 X 10 (- 5) per gamete per generation...|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the lack}} of {{incentives}} for registration in Anagrafe also leads to a significant <b>under-registration</b> (and thus under-estimation) of EU and regular non-EU migrants. The overall gap in coverage in Anagrafe â€“ including irregular and unregistered migrants â€“ currently amounts to approximately 15 % of relevant individuals based on the estimates provided by Blangiardo (2016). As {{a result of this}} lack of a comprehensive listing, register-based sampling is not recommended in Italy. Istat continues nonetheless to use the Anagrafe to conduct immigration surveys, and such surveys are of crucial importance to deepen our knowledge of the foreign population living in Italy and to fill statistical gaps between censuses. However, it is necessary to bear in mind its significant limitations. Most importantly, sampling from the population register leads to selecting only regular and resident migrants, which are the most stable segment of the population of interest (e.g. migrants with a longer length of stay and more frequently reunited with their relatives).|$|E
40|$|Deterministic SIR {{models were}} applied to {{simulate}} Susceptibleâ€“Infectedâ€“Removed and to estimate the threshold condition for varicella outbreaks in children, reported in MedellÃ­n, Colombia. The expected numbers of susceptible, infected and removed individuals were compared with observed cases from notification of varicella outbreaks to the local Board of Health and from survey data. The threshold condition was estimated by the basic reproductive ratio and by the relative removal rate, through which measures for preventing and curtailing the outbreaks were identified. The model demonstrated a reasonable fit to the observations, except {{in two of the}} six outbreaks which probably reflected <b>under-registration</b> of cases. In order to have prevented these outbreaks, between 4 Â· 4 % and 52 Â· 9 % of the susceptible population should have been vaccinated assuming an 85 % vaccine effectiveness. Similarly, isolation of affected children should have been increased to between 4 Â· 3 % and 44 Â· 8 % per week...|$|E
