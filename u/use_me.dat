500|$|Welles's cinematographer for {{the film}} was Gregg Toland, {{described}} by Welles as [...] "just then, the number-one cameraman in the world." [...] To Welles's astonishment, Toland visited him at his office and said, [...] "I want you to <b>use</b> <b>me</b> on your picture." [...] He had {{seen some of the}} Mercury stage productions (including Caesar) and said he wanted to work with someone who had never made a movie. RKO hired Toland on loan from Samuel Goldwyn Productions {{in the first week of}} June 1940.|$|E
500|$|With {{the lyrics}} on Entren Los Que Quieran, Residente {{took a more}} {{political}} approach, inspired by events that transpired after the last album. [...] "Calma Pueblo" [...] discusses various topics including dishonest politicians, lip-synching in live performances, and payola. Residente also references Calle 13's sponsors with the line [...] "Adidas doesn't <b>use</b> <b>me,</b> I use Adidas." [...] Residente originally wrote eight pages of lyrics for [...] "Calma Pueblo", but later [...] "deleted and deleted" [...] many of the words, as {{he felt that the}} song's subject matter [...] "can come off like cheap pamphleteering. And that's not what I wanted to do." [...] "Digo Lo Que Pienso" [...] has been labeled as a [...] "scathing attack" [...] on San Juan mayor Jorge Santini.|$|E

500|$|Badler had {{a four-month}} guest {{contract}} with the show and she began filming her first scenes in April which were due to air in June 2010. Badler admitted that filming her first scenes were hard and she [...] "could not get it together". She said [...] "I noticed {{a few of the}} other new people. They all went through the same thing, where you have a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'". Badler also said that occasionally there were no rehearsals and that it was [...] "very daunting" [...] and challenging. She added that the cast were [...] "really nice" [...] and that she got used to the quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010. When Badler was asked if the door would be left open for Diana to return, she said [...] "Oh yes, absolutely. I was contracted for four months and the way that it ended is very {{up in the air and}} I'm sure that they will <b>use</b> <b>me</b> whenever they need to shake things up a bit, you know".|$|E
500|$|As his {{political}} significance waned, Livingstone gained more {{work in the}} media, commenting that the press [...] "started to <b>use</b> <b>me</b> only once they thought I was harmless". To receive these outside earnings, he founded a company known as Localaction Ltd. In 1987 he authored an autobiography for HarperCollins, If Voting Changed Anything They'd Abolish It, conducted journalism for the London Daily News, stood in for BBC Radio 2 disk-jockey Jimmy Young, {{and served as a}} judge for that year's Whitbread Prize. In 1989, Unwin Hyman published his second book, Livingstone's Labour: A Programme for the 90s, in which he expressed his views on a variety of issues, while that same year he was employed to promote Red Leicester cheese in adverts for the National Dairy Council and to appear in adverts for British Coal alongside Edwina Currie. In October 1991 Livingstone began writing a column for Rupert Murdoch's right-wing tabloid The Sun, a controversial move among British socialists. In his column he often discussed his love of amphibians and campaigned {{for the protection of the}} great crested newt, on the basis of which he was appointed vice president of the London Zoological Society in 1996–97. He subsequently began to write a food column for Esquire and then the Evening Standard, also making regular appearances on the BBC quiz show Have I Got News For You?. In 1995, Livingstone was invited to appear on the track [...] "Ernold Same" [...] by the band Blur.|$|E

2500|$|Mashinini {{joined the}} Garment Workers Union and {{organised}} in her factory. She became both a shop steward and a floor supervisor appointed by management. She later described the difficult situation resulting {{from these two}} positions: [...] "They could have sacked me if they had wanted. I was a shop steward, but {{if they wanted to}} sack you they could still sack you. Instead, they would try and <b>use</b> <b>me</b> to stop the trouble. They would <b>use</b> <b>me</b> like a fire extinguisher, always there to stop trouble." [...] Ultimately, she wrote, [...] "I had a dual role in the factory, but I was very clear where my first loyalty lay. I was appointed a supervisor but I was elected to be a shop steward by my fellow workers." ...|$|E

Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of {{whatever}} dance shots they needed." [...] In addition, Portman {{said in an interview with}} MSN: [...] "I did everything, and the dance double — Sarah Lane, who's a really wonderful dancer — they shot us both doing everything, but because most of the film is in close-up, they're able to <b>use</b> <b>me.</b> The parts I couldn't do were because it's doing very complicated turns en pointe. They would shoot me doing it in flat shoes and Sarah doing it in pointe shoes and find a way to make that work." [...] She also stated in a November 2010 interview with WBUR that [...] "there's a wonderful dancer, Sarah Lane, who did the more complicated pointe work. But I did the stuff that was possible to learn in a year." ...|$|E

2500|$|Klemperer {{hoped for}} a {{permanent}} position as lead conductor in New York or Philadelphia. But in 1936 he was passed over for both [...] first in Philadelphia, where Eugene Ormandy succeeded Leopold Stokowski at the Philadelphia Orchestra, and then in New York, where Arturo Toscanini's departure left a vacancy at the New York Philharmonic but John Barbirolli and Artur Rodziński were engaged in preference to Klemperer. The New York decision was particularly galling, as Klemperer had been engaged to conduct the first fourteen weeks of the New York Philharmonic's 1935-6 season. Klemperer's bitterness at this decision was voiced in a letter he wrote to Arthur Judson, who ran the orchestra: [...] "that the society did not reengage me is the strongest offense, the sharpest insult to me as artist, which I can imagine. You see, I am no youngster. I have a name and a good name. One could not <b>use</b> <b>me</b> in a most difficult season and then expell me. This non-reengagement will have very bad results not only for me in New York but in the whole world... This non-reengagement is an absolutely unjustified wrong done {{to me by the}} Philharmonic Society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hooley {{claims that}} she was promised major storylines that never materialised, was asked {{to come up with}} ideas for black characters, but that all her pages of {{suggestions}} (including developing an interesting relationship with the character Dot Cotton or having Josie start her own business) were ignored. She also claims {{that she was}} only used for two-thirds of her contracted appearances. She said: [...] "In the 18 months I was in EastEnders, I had no impact. There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered I was around and threw me a line where I would slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and accused me of playing a token black. I was so little-used that they even wrote me cheques for episodes I never appeared in. So why did they not <b>use</b> <b>me?</b> Why are they wasting the taxpayers' money? It was very dispiriting." ...|$|E
