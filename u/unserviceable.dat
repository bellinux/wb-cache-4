5|$|The 156th Fighter Air Corps of the 4th Air Army was {{the next}} unit to receive the La-7 in October 1944. At one point during the month, they had {{fourteen}} aircraft simultaneously <b>unserviceable</b> with engine failures. By 1 January 1945 there were 398 La-7s in front-line service of which 107 were <b>unserviceable.</b> By 9 May 1945 this had increased to 967 aircraft, of which only 169 were <b>unserviceable.</b> For the invasion of Japanese Manchuria, 313 La-7s were assigned and only 28 of these were <b>unserviceable</b> on 9 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cylinder}} passes the listed procedures, but the condition remains doubtful, further tests {{can be applied}} to ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered <b>unserviceable</b> after notifying the owner of the reason for failure.|$|E
5|$|The armed forces' third arm, the Liberian National Coast Guard, was {{established}} in 1959. Throughout the Tubman period the coastguard {{was little more than}} a few sometimes <b>unserviceable</b> patrol craft manned by ill-trained personnel, though its training improved in the 1980s to the point where it was considered the best trained of the armed services.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tests}} have been satisfactorily completed, a {{cylinder}} passing the test will be marked accordingly. Stamp marking {{will include the}} registered mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test are made by the test station and kept available for inspection. These include: If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder <b>unserviceable.</b>|$|E
5|$|External {{cleaning}} {{may also}} be required to remove contaminants, corrosion products or old paint or other coatings. Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder <b>unserviceable</b> by affecting the crystalline microstructure structure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders, {{which may not be}} exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|Project Alberta {{still had}} three test assemblies, F101, F102 and F103, but the damaged F32 was <b>unserviceable,</b> so new {{explosive}} blocks {{would have to}} be flown in from Project Camel. There were also shortages of some components, notably detonator chimneys. These were fabricated on Tinian. Seven B-29s of the 509th Composite Group flew Pumpkin bomb missions on 14 August. Word that Japan had surrendered reached Tinian the following day.|$|E
5|$|Following the German Invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, {{the heavy}} losses of front-line {{aircraft}} endured by the VVS {{together with the}} disruption of aircraft production resulted in I-5s being removed from training units and returned to combat service as ground-attack aircraft or night bombers until early 1942. Some I-5s were used by the 605th and 606th Fighter Regiments (Istrebitel'nyye Aviatsionyye Polki (IAP)) during the defence of Moscow as night bombers until re-equipping in February 1942. The 2nd Ground Attack Regiment (Shturmovoy Aviatsionyye Polki (ShAP)) was raised in September 1941 in the Crimea from reservists and the Kachin Flying School. By 10 October thirty-two I-5s were on hand, although attrition had reduced them to sixteen serviceable. They were down {{to a total of}} a dozen aircraft by 18 October. They served until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was withdrawn for conversion to Ilyushin Il-2s and redesignated as the 766th ShAP. The 11th ShAP was raised by the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet on 22 September 1941. On 18 October it mustered eighteen serviceable and fifteen <b>unserviceable</b> I-5s, although this was reduced to eleven serviceable and eight <b>unserviceable</b> aircraft by 7 November. It kept the I-5s in service until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|The 51st Transport Regiment had {{constructed}} an airstrip on Lorengau and commenced another, known as Momote Airstrip, at the Momote Plantation on Los Negros. Lorengau {{was used as}} a staging point for aircraft moving between Rabaul and airstrips in North East New Guinea. The importance of the Admiralty Islands to the Japanese increased as the result of Allied advances in New Guinea and New Britain which blocked off other air routes. By February, both airstrips were <b>unserviceable</b> and the antiaircraft guns were silent in order to conserve ammunition and conceal their positions. Ezaki had ordered his men to neither move nor fire in daylight.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} {{itself in}} India, XX Bomber Command {{under the command}} of Brigadier General Kenneth Wolfe undertook various tasks to prepare for raids against Japan. Foremost among these was stockpiling fuel at the airfields in China. Until late 1944, USAAF Air Transport Command aircraft did not transport fuel for XX Bomber Command, and this task was instead undertaken by the B-29s. This arrangement proved inefficient, however, as 12 B-29 sorties between India and China were needed to transport enough fuel and other supplies to enable one of the heavy bombers to fly a round trip between China and Japan. As a result, it took longer than expected to build up sufficient stockpiles in China to allow B-29 operations to commence. Moreover, continued technical problems with the Superfortress, and particularly their Wright R-3350 engines, resulted in many of XX Bomber Command's aircraft being <b>unserviceable</b> and in need of modification at all times.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Pendennis was neglected; many of its guns became <b>unserviceable</b> {{and some}} {{buildings}} fell into ruin. The old post of captain of Pendennis Castle was abolished in 1837, with the fortification commanded by a conventional military appointment. In the 1850s, renewed fears of a French invasion led to investment in new artillery at the castle, and nineteen 32- and 56-pounder (14.5 and 24.5 kg) guns were installed. Falmouth continued to be an important harbour, particularly for the Royal Navy. When new concerns about France emerged, an electronically operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from Pendennis and St Mawes. New 6- and 12-pounder (2.7 and 5.4 kg) quick-firing guns, supported by machine-guns for close defence, were assigned to the castle to deal with the emerging threat from enemy torpedo boats.|$|E
5|$|By the end {{of their}} active use in 1902 {{together}} they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full charges. By then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become <b>unserviceable.</b> Less wheels, the guns were removed from the fort in 1909; Adelaide's city council then set them in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide. Both were returned to the fort in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They are the only two guns of their type remaining in Australia. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the first firing at the fort. This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the Fort Glanville Historical Association (FGHA).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 300 to 500 mercenaries, Katanga had approximately 14,000 to 17,000 gendarmes in its service, of whom around 7,000 had not received military training. Through reconnaissance, the UN had learned that these forces were concentrated on defending the southern tier of the province (much of the north was already under central government control), with about 5,150 troops {{in and around the}} towns of Jadotville, Kolwezi, and Bunkeya. Another 2,000 garrisoned Ã‰lisabethville. The UN also estimated that the Katangese Air Force possessed a number of Harvards, Magisters, and de Havilland Vampires, amounting to a dozen combat aircraft, as well as some other transport aircraft and small planes. However, they believed that many Katangese aircraft were <b>unserviceable.</b> ONUC intelligence observed limited stockpiles of ammunition, petroleum, oil, and lubricants at a few airfields.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1944, the {{situation}} on all fronts rapidly worsened for the Axis forces. Soviet, Bulgarian and Partisan armies had liberated the whole eastern part of Yugoslavia and Partisan forces in Bosnia pressed their attacks on even larger Axis garrisons. In a surprise attack on 20 September, they captured the city of Banja Luka and the ZNDH's airbase at Zaluzani airfield, including 11 <b>unserviceable</b> aircraft. In the total confusion during the attack on the airfield, a number of ZNDH crews managed to take off and escape at the last moment, some even starting their take off runs when barely clear of open hangar doors, using suppressing fire provided by their machine-gun turrets, whilst others took off under heavy Partisan fire. The city and airbase were re-taken several days later in a heavy counter-attack by NDH and German troops.|$|E
5|$|There were no {{facilities}} in Port Moresby {{for the bulk}} storage of petroleum products, so they were shipped and distributed in 44-gallon drums, as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the imperial gallon. A shortage of 44-gallon drums developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from Rheem in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon drums were urged to empty and return them. <b>Unserviceable</b> drums were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (BIPOD) or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the Port Moresby Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty drums being returned to Australia in November.|$|E
5|$|When the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia commenced on 6 April 1941, only eight IK-2s were serviceable. One had been damaged in a landing accident, two {{were at the}} workshops in Zagreb being repaired, and the fourth <b>unserviceable</b> machine was in a badly damaged condition at Bosanski Aleksandrovac. That day and the next, the 107th Fighter Squadron patrolled over Bosnia but did not make any contact with the enemy. Two machines conducted a combat air patrol over the airfield of the 8th Bomber Regiment at Nova Topola. This pattern continued the following day without incident, but patrol duration and coverage was limited by the short range of the aircraft. On 8 April, a patrol unsuccessfully gave chase to a lone German reconnaissance aircraft, {{and later in the}} day, one of the IK-2s force landed, leaving seven operational aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} refit in Germany, she {{returned}} to France in early 1941 where she escorted returning warships, commerce raiders, and supply ships through the Bay of Biscay for several months. After her refit was completed, Steinbrinck was transferred to Northern Norway in 1942 where she participated in several minor operations before she was damaged running aground and forced to return to Germany for repairs. The ship returned to Norway in mid-1943 where she escorted German capital ships as they moved between Norway and Germany and participated in the German attack (Operation Zitronella) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle. Steinbrinck was ordered home in November to begin a lengthy refit, during which she was badly damaged by Allied bombs, and was <b>unserviceable</b> {{for the rest of}} the war. She was turned over to the Soviet Union after the war as war reparations and only served a few years before she was converted into a training ship and then a barracks ship before being sold for scrap in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Assembly of a Fat Man {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting {{to perform a}} specific task had to wait their turn outside the building. The first Fat Man assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly cracked and <b>unserviceable.</b> The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.|$|E
5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became <b>unserviceable</b> for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E
5|$|During the Evacuation of Greece, Formidable {{provided}} {{air cover}} for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron {{was forced to}} ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day. She put to sea on 6 May to provide air cover for the convoys involved in Operation Tiger. On the morning of 8 May, a pair of Fulmars claimed to have shot down a pair of Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one Fulmar failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers {{at the cost of}} one Fulmar forced to crash-land. Two Albacores and a Fulmar crashed due to non-combat causes during the day. The next day a pair of Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash-landed at its base in Sicily. As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May, a pair of Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s, damaging one bomber; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea. Many of the Fulmars had been rendered <b>unserviceable</b> during the operation and Formidable was unable to provide air cover until they were repaired.|$|E
5|$|JG 3 claimed 53 {{single-engine}} and 11 {{twin-engine aircraft}} destroyed. Five fighters and one four-engine bomber were also claimed damaged. Four Typhoons, three Spitfires, one Tempest and another unidentified aircraft were claimed shot down. All in all, JG 3 managed to destroy 43 aircraft according to British records, and damage a further 60, some seriously. The Geschwader believed it had destroyed 116. JG 3 {{did not come}} away unscathed. I./JG 3 lost nine of its aircraft and pilots, a 50% loss rate. Damage to the returning Gruppe aircraft meant the entire unit was <b>unserviceable.</b> RAF AAA were credited with shooting down five. JG 3 lost, altogether, 15 of the 60 fighters sent, a 25% loss rate. Some 15 pilots were missing; nine were killed and five captured, and another pilot was posting as missing in action and his fate remains unknown. Another source says 16 pilots; ten killed or missing and six captured.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{tenure at}} the aerodrome began ominously. The same day he was granted a request to travel as an {{observer}} in a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, disaster struck which could conceivably have ended his career. Instructed to familiarise himself with the aircraft around the airfield he examined a Caudron Type A, and proceeded {{to turn over the}} engine. The aircraft was listed as <b>unserviceable</b> and McCudden saw no danger in leaving the throttle fully open. Suddenly the engine started and it accelerated out of the hangar and into a Farman MF.11. McCudden watched as the propeller chewed the wing to pieces and damaged his Commanding Officer's car which had been parked nearby. He was able to reach the cockpit and switch off the ignition but not before extensive damage had been done. For this misdemeanor he was brought before Colonel Frederick Sykes, commanding the RFC Military Wing. Sykes was pleased with his overall progress, which likely saved him, but sentenced McCudden to seven days detention and a forfeiture of 14 days pay for the incident. Five years later Sykes again met McCuddenâ€”then {{at the height of his}} fameâ€”and chaffed him on the episode, even jokingly threatening to send him a bill for the car.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June {{the final}} {{elements}} of I. Gruppe arrived in Montdidier, making the unit complete. In the evening Weissenberger again claimed two P-47s shot down, his 181st and 182nd aerial victories. The airfield at Montdidier came under heavy fighter bomber attack on 11 June {{followed by another}} attack on 12 June resulting in significant damage to the airfield. On 12 June Weissenberger filed a claim for three aerial victories. Together with his wingman, Unteroffizier (Sergeant) Alfred Tichy, he took off at 06:00 and {{during the course of}} 12 minutes shot down three P-47s. After his first victory, Tichy was killed in action, crashing near Ã‰vreux. At 07:02 Weissenberger shot down his third P-47 of the day but his Bf 109 G-5 was hit in the engine forcing him to bail out near Saint AndrÃ©. The airfield in Montdidier was rendered <b>unserviceable</b> and I. Gruppe was forced to relocate. It was first moved to PÃ©ronne, then to Chauny, a makeshift airfield between Noyon and Tergnier. The constant attacks against German airfields forced another move in July 1944, this time to FriÃ¨res in the vicinity of Laon.|$|E
5|$|Operation Yoav {{had left}} Faluja as an enclave within Israeli-held {{territory}} and during November 1948 the Hammers routinely returned to bomb {{what became known}} as the Faluja Pocket. The town would nonetheless hold out until the end of the war. On December 22 Israel launched Operation Horev, its last major offensive of the war, to finally defeat the Egyptian expeditionary force and expel it beyond the borders of Mandatory Palestine. 69 Squadron once again flew in support of Israeli efforts in the south, targeting the air base at El-Arish, Khan Younis, Gaza and Rafah. The squadron also revisited Faluja to prevent an Egyptian sortie from the beleaguered pocket, and on New Year's Day 1949 flew a failed attempt to bomb an Egyptian Navy flotilla which had shelled Tel Aviv. 69 Squadron flew its last missions of the war in the early morning of January 7, 1949, against Rafah. Having evaded Egyptian flak on most occasions, both participating bombers were hit, rendering one <b>unserviceable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The R-2s were {{assigned}} to the 1st Armoured Regiment of the 1st Armoured Division where they participated in Operation Barbarossa. The division was withdrawn from combat after the Battle of Odessa in 1941. At the start of 1942, 40 tanks were sent to Pilsen for overhaul while 50 more were repaired in PloieÈ™ti. The division returned to the front on 29 August 1942 with 109 R-2s. By the eve of the Soviet Stalingrad Counter-offensive on 19 November the division could only muster 84 serviceable R-2s with as many as 37 <b>unserviceable</b> tanks stationed in the rear. The division was on the outer edges of the Stalingrad Pocket, but managed to breakthrough the western wing of the encirclement, although 77 R-2s were lost in the process. Only about a third of these were destroyed by the Soviets, the rest were either abandoned or broke down and couldn't be recovered. One R-2 arrived from Romania during December as a reinforcement. The 1st Armored Division was ordered home in early January 1943.|$|E
5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out every two hours. On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were <b>unserviceable.</b> Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not to be serious enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{over which}} the two brigades were to advance was {{generally}} steep with the track having been cut along a high spur line that dropped on either side into deep ravines that were covered by kunai grass interspersed with areas of thick jungle. North of Bonga, the ground was markedly different, with the track having been pushed through flat swamp land that was punctuated by many deep creeks; vegetation in the area was mainly thick secondary growth, although to the west, in the steep hills, kunai grass was predominate. As {{a result of the}} harsh conditions and terrain, as the Australian advance continued it was increasingly hampered by vehicle break downs and fatigue amongst their crews. Resupply was also a problem for the Australians and consequently a lack of spare parts developed. This meant that a number of jeeps became <b>unserviceable</b> and some of the Matilda tanks were unable to advance for some time while their crews waited for parts to be brought up.|$|E
5|$|During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four {{transport}} units: Nos.33, 34, 35 and 36Squadrons. No.34 (Transport) Squadron {{was established}} on 23February at RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, {{four days after}} the city was bombed for the first time. Coming under the control of North-Western Area Command, the squadron's initial strength was six personnel and two deHavilland DH.84 Dragons. They were immediately tasked with transport duties in northern Australia. As well as carrying freight, this involved collecting the first Japanese prisoner of war to be captured in Australia, a navy fighter pilot who had crashlanded during the raid on Darwin. One of the squadron's two officers, Flight Lieutenant J.W. Warwick, became the first (acting) commanding officer on 2March. The following day, one of the Dragons was destroyed on the ground at Wyndham, Western Australia, by enemy air attack. With its other aircraft <b>unserviceable,</b> and accommodation at Darwin's civil airfield inadequate, squadron headquarters relocated to Daly Waters Airfield on 5March. On 14March another Dragon was allocated; this was joined by two Avro Ansons and two de Havilland Tiger Moths in mid-May, by which time the squadron had moved to Batchelor Airfield. By the end of the month, the squadron had thirty-four personnel, including six officers. It lost one of the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1July, {{a few days after the}} plane crashlanded south of Katherine. The squadron relocated again on 15July, this time to Hughes Airfield. It remained at Hughes until 27August, when it transferred to Manbulloo Airfield; it operated from Manbulloo until it was temporarily disbanded on 13December and its aircraft transferred to No.6 Communications Flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{heavy snow}} fell {{in some areas}} of Yugoslavia, grounding the 52nd Fighter Group Hurricanes at KniÄ‡. In the north, a major air battle developed between Rovine and Bosanski Aleksandrovac, involving Hurricanes of both the 106th and 108th Squadrons. The Yugoslavs shot down one or two Bf 109s, but lost two Hurricanes in the process. By 10 April, the VVKJ was disintegrating quickly {{in the face of the}} successful German onslaught, but Hurricanes of the 105th Squadron were able to get airborne despite the continuing poor weather, patrolling for and engaging German aircraft without result. At KniÄ‡, rumours of the approach of German ground forces led the 164th Squadron to attempt to fly its Hurricanes to a safer airfield. Five machines got into the air, but almost immediately two of them collided, and another flew into a mountain wreathed in fog. The two surviving pilots returned safely to KniÄ‡. Meanwhile, the Hurricanes of the 163rd Squadron had been rendered <b>unserviceable</b> by their crews to prevent their capture and use by the Germans. When it became clear that the rumours of approaching German forces were unfounded, desperate attempts were made to return the aircraft to flying condition. The same day, Hurricanes of the 4th Regiment scored a victory over a Bf 109 while chasing reconnaissance aircraft over Bosnia.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Ivory Coast Airforce {{consisted}} of one Mil Mi-24 attack helicopter and three SA330L Puma transports (marked as potentially <b>unserviceable).</b>|$|E
25|$|Salisbury {{was active}} during the Seven Years' War, serving with George Pocock's fleet, and seeing action {{in most of}} his engagements with the Comte d'AchÃ©. She fought at Cuddalore, Negapatam and Pondicherry, and {{remained}} in the East Indies until being condemned as <b>unserviceable</b> at Bombay in 1761.|$|E
25|$|About 30 {{percent of}} French {{aircraft}} were rendered <b>unserviceable</b> {{by the end}} of the war, some as a result of minor damage sustained in air raids that remained unrepaired. The ArmÃ©e de l'Air admitted the loss of one Farman F221 and two Morane M.S.406s destroyed on the ground, but in reality its losses were greater.|$|E
25|$|These {{included}} {{trips to}} Hamm and Duisburg in the Ruhr, the ports of Lorient and Wilhelmshaven, {{and the city}} of Bremen, when, on the return leg, after 11 hours flying and with the loop aerial and port exactor <b>unserviceable,</b> James ordered his crew to bail out â€“ all landing safely in South Molton, Devon.|$|E
25|$|The Polish Air Force was {{defeated}} in just over two weeks. The Poles had distributed their operational planes to satellite airfields, so what was left on the airfields was <b>unserviceable</b> aircraft which were then destroyed by the Luftwaffe {{which is where the}} incorrect statement that the Polish Air Force was destroyed on the ground originated from.|$|E
25|$|As {{pressure}} of work demanded, it became necessary to regularly ferry the locomotive from one {{bank of the}} Kowie to the other, until a second locomotive was obtained in 1877, an 0-4-0 saddle-tank engine named Aid. The engine Blackie worked on the Kowie project until 1883, by which time it was completely <b>unserviceable</b> and was abandoned on a siding.|$|E
25|$|One Mosquito {{is listed}} as {{belonging}} to German secret operations unit Kampfgeschwader 200, which tested, evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the war. The aircraft was listed {{on the order of}} battle of Versuchsverband OKLs, 2 Staffel, Stab Gruppe on 10 November and 31 December 1944. However, on both lists, the Mosquito {{is listed as}} <b>unserviceable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were part}} of the 2002 QuiÃ±ones Plan, which was implemented in 2007 and aimed at putting <b>unserviceable</b> equipment back into service. In March 2012, the Peruvian Air Force was considering an option to modernize 20 EMB-312s in a program jointly conducted by the Brazilian Air Force and Embraer under a wide-ranging defence agreement signed with the Brazilian defence ministry.|$|E
