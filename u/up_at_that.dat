By age eleven he was studying the trumpet at Eisenhower Middle School.|$|E
25|$|Edward Jenner {{was born}} in Berkeley, England. At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to apothecary Daniel Ludlow and later surgeon George Hardwick in nearby Sodbury. He {{observed}} that people who caught cowpox while working with cattle were known not to catch smallpox. Jenner assumed a causal connection but the idea was not taken <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time. From 1770 to 1772 Jenner received advanced training in London at St Georges Hospital and as the private pupil of John Hunter, then returned to set up practice in Berkeley. When a smallpox epidemic occurred he advised the local cattle workers to be inoculated, but they told him that their previous cowpox infection would prevent smallpox. This confirmed his childhood suspicion, and he studied cowpox further, presenting a paper on it to his local medical society.|$|E

Lutz (John Lutz), Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway), Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), and Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson)—vent {{their anger}} at Liz; they {{complain}} that Boston is colder than New York, {{and they do}} not like sharing an office with the all-male staff of Boston Bruins fans who write for the Bruins Beat. Liz gets a tip from Jack to find a common enemy in the Boston affiliate of NBC. Liz comes up with the name [...] "Dale Snitterman", and tells the staff that Snitterman is causing all of their problems, not realizing until later that she had seen the name somewhere and did not make it <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>that</b> point, the staff finds Snitterman (Ray Bokhour) and harass him.|$|E

500|$|Entering {{his fourth}} season, Washington knew {{the only thing}} keeping him in the league was his {{guaranteed}} contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when {{in a game against}} Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: [...] "Listen, you better learn how to play this game." [...] The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions {{over the course of his}} long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> hour every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, in the mid-1950s, the Cold War was {{starting}} and the Canadian authorities {{were in the}} midst of expanding the military. Avro was involved in designing the first dedicated jet-powered, all-weather fighter for the RCAF, the Avro CF-100 Canuck. The project was somewhat delayed, although the company's continuing work on the Jetliner caused some controversy. After the prototype returned, it still had no immediate sales prospects, and C.D. Howe (the [...] "minister of everything") therefore [...] ordered the program stopped in December 1951. The second prototype Jetliner, nearly completed in the main assembly hangar, was broken <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time.|$|E

He writes, [...] "I had not imagined I might choke <b>up...</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment George W Bush wasn't just the president. He was a compassionate human being who had a sense of what Joyce and I were going through."

2500|$|Imperial lost no time. [...] On February 12 {{the company}} had started {{drilling}} Leduc No. 2, about three kilometres southwest of No. 1, trying to extend the producing formation. [...] But nothing showed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> level and company officials argued over how to proceed. [...] One group proposed abandoning the well, instead drilling a direct offset to No. 1; another group wanted to continue drilling No. 2 into a deep stratigraphic test. But drilling continued. On May 10 at , No. 2 struck the much bigger Devonian reef, which later {{turned out to be}} the most prolific geological formation in Alberta, the Leduc Formation.|$|E

2500|$|Approaching via the South Taconic {{from the}} west, entirely within New York, {{is a common}} route to the summit but also entails the {{greatest}} vertical ascent. The trailhead for the South Taconic is located on Quarry Hill Road, a long dead-end street in the northern section of North East, at an elevation just under 1,000 feet (300 m). After passing {{along the edge of}} an old meadow, it enters the woods, crosses into Taconic State Park and then climbs steeply past a series of cascades on the south side, at some points requiring that hikers scramble. It levels off at , where the first of many views over Dutchess and Columbia counties to the Catskill Escarpment {{on the other side of}} the Hudson River open <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>that</b> point it turns north and goes through some private lands over South Brace to Brace.
