Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> can be shared.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the law of}} <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> and trade secrecy {{as it applies to}} university researchers. It outlines the statutory and policy framework for university research activity and the commercialisation of that research, reviews the relevant civil and criminal law that protects <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> and trade secrets, and reviews the approach taken to <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> in the provisions of publicly available New Zealand university intellectual property policies. The article concludes that there is considerable uncertainty about the obligations of researchers and argues that greater clarity would benefit all parties. It proposes that, for staff working on specific projects, employment contracts should provide for clear identification of information to which an obligation of confidence arises, and the nature of that obligation. In addition, it proposes that universities review intellectual property policies in order to clarify claims made to <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> and the obligations applying to staff...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{communication}} systems, one of {{the most}} challenging tasks involves the implementation of adequate methods for successful and secure transfer of <b>confidential</b> digital <b>information</b> over an unsecured communication channel. Many encryption algorithms have been developed for protection of <b>confidential</b> <b>information.</b> However, over time, flaws have been discovered even with the most sophisticated encryption algorithms. Each encryption algorithm can be decrypted within sufficient time and with sufficient resources. The possibility of decryption has increased with the development of computer technology since available computer speeds enable the decryption process based on the exhaustive data search. This has {{led to the development of}} steganography, a science which attempts to hide the very existence of <b>confidential</b> <b>information.</b> However, the stenography also has its disadvantages, listed in the paper. Hence, a new method which combines the favourable properties of cryptography based on substitution encryption and stenography is analysed in the paper. The ability of hiding the existence of <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> comes from steganography and its encryption using a coding table makes its content undecipherable. This synergy greatly improves protection of <b>confidential</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

In Part I, we proposed a technique based on relation algebra to detect <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> leakage via protocol-based covert channels. In this paper, we continue developing investigative support for information confidentiality. We examine {{the application of the}} technique for detecting <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> leakage proposed in Part I in cryptanalysis and digital forensics to highlight its usefulness beyond the scope of covert channel analysis. By way of a short case study, we show the automation of the cryptanalysis application of the technique for detecting <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> leakage using a prototype tool and a known-plaintext attack...|$|R

The latter {{is placed in}} the public domain as a quid pro quo for the limited period of legal protection conferred by the patent. This article explores the nature and protection of <b>confidential</b> <b>information,</b> primarily by reference to the position in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The situations for employer/employee, and for outsiders are described. The relevance of 'Non-Analysis Agreements' (NAAs) when outsiders are involved is emphasised.
