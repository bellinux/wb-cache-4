5000|$|The {{creation}} of a [...] "British Academy for the Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies" [...] was first proposed in 1899 in order that Britain could be represented at meetings of European and American academies. The organisation, which has since become simply [...] "the British Academy", was initiated as an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>society</b> on 17 December 1901, and received its Royal Charter from King Edward VII on 8 August 1902.|$|E
50|$|As WSFS {{itself is}} an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>society,</b> each Worldcon is {{organized}} by a separate committee (usually) legally {{incorporated in the}} local jurisdiction; in the United States, these are usually set up as 501(c)(3) non-profit corporations. The local organizers may be standalone committees, {{or they may be}} organized by an existing local group; a few groups such as MCFI in Boston and SCIFI (Southern California Institute for Fan Interests Inc.), in southern California are permanent corporations set up to run Worldcons (or other one-off or rotating conventions) in different years in the same geographical area.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} and {{traditional}} unincorporated entities are sole traders, partnerships, and trustees of trusts, and the more modern unincorporated entities include limited partnerships (LPs) (but not incorporated limited partnerships), limited liability partnerships (LLPs) (but not UK Limited Liability Partnerships which are corporations), Limited liability limited partnership (LLLPs) and limited liability companies (LLCs). <b>Unincorporated</b> <b>societies</b> and clubs are also unincorporated entities.|$|R
50|$|Because the Society {{was formed}} pre-1874 {{it was an}} <b>unincorporated</b> Building <b>Society.</b> It {{retained}} this status until the 1950's when it eventually became an incorporated Building Society with all the benefits that incorporation brings.|$|R

5000|$|In 1890, the Virginia General Assembly {{passed an}} act {{incorporating}} the Virginia State Bar Association. Section 1 {{of the act}} provides: [...] "Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, That William J. Robertson, R.G.H. Kean, Thomas Tabb, John W. Riely, James A. Walker, Holmes Conrad, Frank V. Winston, S. Ferguson Beach, John H. Fulton, Charles A. Graves, Richard B. Tunstall, James C. Lamb, Charles M. Blackford, William J. Leake, Thomas S. Martin, Alexander Hamilton, James E. Heath, Micajah Woods, George M. Harrison, F.H. McGuire, and such other persons as are now associated {{with them in the}} <b>unincorporated</b> <b>society</b> known as the Virginia State Bar Association, or as may be hereafter associated with them under this charter, be, and they are hereby, incorporated under the corporate name of 'The Virginia State Bar Association,' for the purpose of cultivating and advancing the science of jurisprudence, facilitating the administration of justice in this State, and upholding and elevating the standard of honor, integrity, and courtesy in the legal profession." ...|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Worldcon" [...] {{is owned}} by the World Science Fiction <b>Society</b> (WSFS), an <b>unincorporated</b> {{literary}} <b>society</b> whose purpose is to promote interest in science fiction. WSFS has no standing officers, only small standing committees, and a large membership composed {{of the members of the}} current Worldcon. Its main activities are running the selection (voting) process for the annual convention and various awards. The conventions themselves are run by non-profit, volunteer fan organizations, who bid to host the event.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "social entrepreneurship" [...] {{is not a}} novel idea, but in the 2000s, {{it has become more}} popular among society and {{academic}} research, notably after the publication of [...] "The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur" [...] by Charles Leadbeater. Many activities related to community development and higher social purpose fall within the modern definition of social entrepreneurship. Despite the established definition nowadays, social entrepreneurship remains a difficult concept to define, since it may be manifested in multiple forms. A broad definition of the concept allows interdisciplinary research efforts to understand and challenge the notions behind social entrepreneurship. No matter in which sector of society certain organizations are (i.e. corporations or <b>unincorporated</b> associations, <b>societies,</b> associations or cooperatives), social entrepreneurship focuses on the social impact that an endeavor aims at. Whether social entrepreneurship is altruistic or not is less important than the effect it has on society.|$|R
5000|$|Symonds met {{the infamous}} occultist {{and founder of}} the Thelemite religion, Aleister Crowley in 1946, the year before Crowley's death. Crowley's will left the {{copyright}} of his works to his <b>unincorporated</b> magical <b>society,</b> the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), and made him Crowley's literary executor, though Crowley's legal status as an undischarged bankrupt meant that the copyrights actually ended up in receivership. At first fascinated by Crowley, Symonds became increasingly critical of his ideas and manners, in particular the use of drugs and sex. Along with one of Crowley's disciples, Kenneth Grant, Symonds edited and republished Crowley's autobiography and a number of his other works. Further to this, he authored four biographical works of his own: The Great Beast (1952), The Magic of Aleister Crowley (1958), The King of the Shadow Realm (1989) and The Beast 666 (1997). Due to his somewhat negative attitude to Crowley in these works, there were many involved in Thelema and ceremonial magic who were themselves critical of Symonds, including Israel Regardie, who called him [...] "that most hostile biographer." [...] Nonetheless, his significance in keeping Crowley's legacy alive has also been recognised, and it has been noted that [...] "Regardless of his reception, it is no exaggeration to state that without the publication efforts of Symonds (and Grant) Crowley could easily have been a forgotten figure by the 1970s." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1932, Crowley, now based back in England, fell seriously ill, {{and believing}} his death to be immanent, he sent Smith a {{testament}} proclaiming {{that in the}} event of his death, Smith would become Frater Superior and Outer Head of the Order (OHO) of the O.T.O.; he soon however recovered. In May of that year, Smith and Kahl began renting the large house at 1746 Winona Boulevard in Hollywood, and began to take in lodgers to help pay for it. Kahl and Wolfe began using the attic for Thelemic rituals, and in March 1933 they performed their first public Gnostic Mass in the room, hoping to attract interested persons to Thelema. Crowley was pleased with their progress, and asked them to raise funds so that he could afford to visit. The weekly performances of the Gnostic Mass began to attract increasingly large crowds, with their [...] "Crowley Nights" [...] attracting around 150 guests, among them the film star John Carradine. In April 1934, Smith incorporated the Church of Thelema under US law, although retained the North American O.T.O. as an <b>unincorporated</b> secret <b>society.</b> Crowley however was confused, and believed that Smith had incorporated the O.T.O., something which angered him; he subsequently complained about Smith in letters to other initiates. After an argument, Crowley and Smith ceased correspondence for a time. Smith also attempted to revive the largely defunct North American O.T.O., attracting 15 initial initiates, many of whom were dissatisfied members of the Choronzon Club, which was now in decline.|$|R
