The present study investigates research methodologies useful in the study of Hawaiian <b>upslope</b> <b>fog,</b> including: (1) development of an improved fog gage; (2) development of indirect approximation methods for estimating average droplet sizes during precipitation episodes and separating fog and rainfall components; (3) establishment of an extensive fog sampling network on the island of Hawaii employing continuous recording equipment, for both rain, fog, and wind; (4) development of an original computer program for detailed temporal and spatial analysis of rain, fog, and wind parameters.

40|$|Belonging to the {{southern}} subtropical moist type of monsoon climate, the Nanling mountainous area experiences heavy fogs whenever quasi-stationary fronts appear there from September to May. There can {{be as many as}} 15 - 18 days of heavy fogs per month. Fogs have more serious consequences in the Lechang-Ruyuan section of the Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway (the longest expressway in China) that passes through {{the main part of the}} Nanling Mts., where the road rises from 200 m to more than 800 m above sea level (ASL). For a major motorway in the mountainous areas of Nanling Mts., two multidisciplinary integrated eld observations were carried out, which measured visibility by the naked eyes, visibility by instrument, spectrum of fog-drops, liquid water content (LWC) of fog, tethered sounding, dual-parameter low-level sounding, turbulence diusion within fog layers, aerosol spectra of size and composition, sampled fog water compositions, and sampled rainwater compositions. Typical cases were probed for their analyses of synoptics, micro- and macro-structures and microphysics. It is understood that heavy fogs take place with high frequency in the area and bring about serious consequences. Being typical advection and <b>upslope</b> <b>fogs,</b> they are in essence low-lying clouds appearing at high altitudes, which are closely related with the activity of South China frontal processes, especially the South China quasi-stationary fronts, and re ect on the role of local terrai...|$|R
40|$|Forecasting the areal {{extent of}} dense fog {{is of great}} impor-tance to the aviation, ground and marine {{communities}} as it can result in delayed operations, damage and injU/y causing losses {{of millions of dollars}} each year. Therefore, fog forecasts for large areas are critical to many users and often result in the issuance of special weather statements after sign!ficant fog has formed or is expected to occur. Despite the use of numerical model output and sophisticated mesoscale models, improved forecasting of fog and its areal extent remain elusive. Attention has instead focused on the development of site specific climatologies, checklists and fog typing forecast schemes. Given the National Weather Service's modernization efforts and mesoscale emphasis, improved fore-casts of fog formation and its areal extent are needed. A methodology is presented to improve these forecasts by cOllsideringfog impacts, climatology and physiographic factors in relation to the dynamic-synoptic regime. To illustrate the method alld assess its usefulness a case study is presented for 6 - 8 March 1994 for the central guZf coast. Th e hindcast dynamic-synoptic analysis indicated that periods of sign!{icant fog developed first as a localized radiative event and then developed into a widespread advective-radiative event with <b>upslope</b> and sea <b>fog</b> contributions. Reductions in visibility were often quite varied across the region during the event [...] An. appreciation of the fog's formation and evolution through application of the method described would have provided more spec!{ic predictions of the fog's mesoscale distribution and formation mechanisms. The results of this study would suggest that furth er e. fforts concentrate on the development offorecast techniques that would better evaluate the formation and areal extent of dense fog. 1...|$|R
