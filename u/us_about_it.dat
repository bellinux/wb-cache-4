500|$|Dudley {{negotiated}} a separate {{peace with the}} Abenakis at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1713. [...] He hoped to separate the western Kennebec tribe from French influence and consequently adopted a fairly hard line, threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival and reiterating claims of British sovereignty over the Abenaki. [...] The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted from those negotiations and repeats the claims of sovereignty. Dudley claimed that the French had ceded Abenaki lands as part of Acadia, and one sachem responded: [...] "The French never said anything to <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and we wonder how they would give it away without asking us". [...] Nevertheless, Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects, and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine which flared into Dummer's War in the 1720s.|$|E
500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes. For example, the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", in which SpongeBob and Patrick learn profanity, was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience of getting in trouble as a child for using the f-word in front of his mother. Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life". The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself". The idea for the episode [...] "The Secret Box" [...] also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences. Hillenburg explained, [...] "Drymon had a secret box [...] and started telling <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E
500|$|Episodes {{were written}} {{by a team of}} writers, which {{consisted}} of Dohrn, David Fain, Greenblatt, Mr. Lawrence, Lender, Mark O'Hare, Povenmire, William Reiss, Springer, Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. During the season, the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for individual episodes. For example, in the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", SpongeBob learns profanity. The idea for the episode was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in front of my mother." [...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." [...] In [...] "Secret Box", SpongeBob wants to see what is inside Patrick's secret box. The idea came to Drymon because he too had a secret box as a child. Creator Hillenburg said, [...] " [...] started telling <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At daybreak on 8 February 1944, planes {{from the}} escort {{carriers}} were covering the convoy. At 13:00, the convoy changed course {{and started the}} last leg of the route toward the British Isles. At 19:30, fog set in and all ships were out of sight of LST-21 which turned on navigation lights and sounded whistle to avoid collision. At 8:45, the fog lifted and at 24:00 the convoy executed an emergency turn to starboard. On 9 February, at 00:35, the convoy resumed it course. At 01:13, they received a radio message that a submarine, , was sunk off the port side of the convoy. At 08:11, the convoy executed an emergency turn of 45 degrees to port, and at 08:40 resumed course. At 10:10, an escort on the starboard bow indicated a contact. LST-21s radioman tuned into an extra receiver on the escorts' and the planes' frequency and the officers and crew in LST-21s wheelhouse listened in on their communications. At approximately 11:00, a plane reported a sub on the surface bearing 150 degrees. The pilot kept repeating this to the Escort Commander, until the reply came back: [...] "Stop telling <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and get the 'bowstud.'" [...] A few minutes later, the plane reported back: [...] "One down. One down." [...] At 12:14, all ships received a message from the convoy commander confirming the sinking of the second submarine. The weather was thick and visibility only about a mile and a half. At 16:45, they received another message from the Commodore confirming the sinking of a third submarine. The escorts and planes were noted to be having a difficult time with communications due to all of the contacts, real or imagined.|$|E
