40|$|Abstract Health {{studies have}} {{repeatedly}} used air temperature (Ta), sometimes adjusted for humidity, when analyzing {{the impact of}} weather on mortality. The {{aim of this study}} is to highlight the importance of mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) and its impact on heat related mortality. Tmrt is an essential meteorological parameter that influences the thermal comfort (heat load) of humans. It is useful when assessing the impact of weather, especially heat, on people√¢s health. Tmrt is directly influenced by urban geometry and surface material, which also makes it a good measure to identify <b>urban</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> The performance of models using Ta and Tmrt for daily mortality is compared for Stockholm County, Sweden. It is demonstrated that Tmrt models fit heat related mortality better than Ta models, which implies that health studies should consider using Tmrt rather than Ta. The use of Tmrt models allows us to determine more accurate thresholds for increased risks of heat related mortality, and thus to better identify adverse weather conditions and heat prone urban geometries. Such information is needed to implement heat-warning systems and mitigate harmful effects of heat stress...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{areas are}} usually warmer than their {{surrounding}} natural areas, an effect {{known as the}} urban heat island effect. As such, they are particularly vulnerable to global warming and associated increases in extreme temperatures. Yet ensemble climate-model projections are generally performed {{on a scale that}} is too coarse to represent the evolution of temperatures in cities. Here, for the first time, we combine unprecedented long-term (35 -year) urban-climate model integrations at the convection-permitting scale (2. 8 km resolution) with information from an ensemble of general circulation models to assess temperature-based heat stress in a densely populated mid-latitude maritime region. We discover that the heat-stress increase towards the mid- 21 st century is twice as large in cities compared to their surrounding rural areas. The exacerbation is driven by the urban heat island itself, its concurrence with heat waves, and urban expansion. Cities experience a heat stress multiplication by a factor 1. 4 and 15 depending on the scenario. Remarkably, the future heat stress surpasses everywhere the <b>urban</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of today. Our novel insights exemplify the need to combine information from climate models, acting on different scales, for climatehange risk assessment in heterogeneous regions. Moreover, these results highlight the necessity for adaptation to increasing heat stress, especially in urban areas. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> in an <b>urban</b> setting can {{be defined}} as the zones exposed to {{significant}} risk due to climate-related extreme events such as flooding. Arguably, identifying the <b>urban</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> to flooding {{is one of the first}} steps in an integrated methodology for urban flood risk assessment and mitigation. The delineation of urban hotspots not only can provide useful information for the policy makers but also it can be useful as support information for indicating future urban dynamics and trends. This work employs two GIS-based frameworks for identifying the <b>urban</b> residential <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> This is done by overlaying a map of potentially flood prone areas (the topographic wetness index, TWI) and a map of urban morphology types (UMT) classified as residential. The topographic wetness index (TWI, Beven Qin et al. 2011) allows for the delineation of a portion of a hydrographic basin potentially exposed to flood inundation by identifying all the areas characterized by a topographic index that exceeds a given threshold. The urban morphological types (Pauleit and Duhme 2000, Gill et al. 2008, Cavan et al. 2012) form the foundation of a classification scheme which brings together facets of urban form and function. The application of the UMTs allows the delineation of geographical units. The distinction of UMTs at a 'meso'-scale (i. e. between the city level and that of the individual units) makes a suitable basis for the spatial analysis of cities. The TWI threshold value depends on the resolution of the digital elevation model (DEM), topology of the hydrographic basin (i. e. urban, peri-urban or rural) and the constructed infrastructure (Manfreda et al. 2011). This threshold value is usually calibrated based on the results of detailed delineation of the inundation profile for selected zones. In this study, the TWI threshold is calibrated based on the calculated inundation profiles for various return periods for selected zones within the basin through a Bayesian framework. The Bayesian framework enables the probabilistic characterization of the threshold value by calculating the complementary probability of false delineation of flood prone zones as a function of various threshold values. For a given return period, the probability of false delineation is calculated as the sum of the probability of indicating a zone flood prone which is not indicated as such by the inundation profile and the probability that a zone is indicated as not flood prone but indicated as flood prone by the inundation profile. Applying the above-mentioned procedure, taking into account all available information on the inundation profiles for various zones within the basin, leads to a probability distribution for the TWI threshold value. In the next step, the <b>urban</b> residential <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> to flooding are delineated in the GIS environment by overlaying the map of TWI and the UMT units classified as residential for various percentiles of the TWI threshold. Differences in exposure characteristics can be assessed for a range of different residential types, including for example between condominium/multi-storey, single storey stone/concrete and areas predominantly associated with mud/wood construction. For each percentile value considered, the delineated flood-prone residential areas and the number of people potentially affected to flooding are calculated. Moreover, the potential dependence of the estimated threshold percentiles on the flooding return period is investigated. As a demonstration, the urban residential hotspots to flooding are delineated for 16 th, 50 th and 84 th percentiles of the TWI value for the cities of Dar es Salaam and Addis Ababa...|$|R
40|$|Cities profoundly alter {{biological}} communities, favoring {{some species}} over others, though the mechanisms that govern {{these changes are}} largely unknown. Herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant in urban than in rural areas, and urban outbreaks {{have been attributed to}} reduced control by predators and parasitoids and to increased susceptibility of stressed urban plants. These hypotheses, however, leave many outbreaks unexplained and fail to predict variation in pest abundance within cities. Here we show that the abundance of a common insect pest is positively related to temperature even when controlling for other habitat characteristics. The scale insect Parthenolecanium quercifex was 13 times more abundant on willow oak trees in the hottest parts of Raleigh, NC, in the southeastern United States, than in cooler areas, though parasitism rates were similar. We further separated the effects of heat from those of natural enemies and plant quality in a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment. P. quercifex collected from <b>hot</b> <b>urban</b> trees became more abundant in hot greenhouses than in cool greenhouses, whereas the abundance of P. quercifex collected from cooler urban trees remained low in hot and cool greenhouses. Parthenolecanium quercifex living in <b>urban</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> succeed with warming, and they do so because some demes have either acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures. Our results provide the first evidence that heat can be a key driver of insect pest outbreaks on urban trees.

40|$|Quantification of {{flooding}} risk {{in urban areas}} is necessary as a decision-making support to stakeholders and policy-makers. It can also be effective in reducing the gap between perceived and quantified risk, in short- and long-term. The present work focuses on long-term flood risk assessment in urban areas in meso- and micro-scale. The meso-scale assessment may address an entire city; meanwhile, the micro-scale assessment covers smaller areas such as a neighborhood. This Ph. D. thesis is developed {{in line with the}} progress of the European FP 7 project Climate Change and Urban Vulnerability in Africa (CLUVA). The flood risk assessment procedure is developed specifically for risk assessment in the African urban context. In the micro-scale, special attention is given to risk assessment for the informal settlements (i. e., non engineered construction). The informal settlements, which {{can be viewed as a}} direct product of rapid and un-programmed urbanization, are particularly vulnerable to flooding. They are often located in potentially flood-prone areas and are constructed without formal engineering criteria. The application of the methods adopted and developed in this work is demonstrated for various urban contexts in Africa. Meso-scale applications are presented for cities of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). Detailed micro-scale flood risk assessment has been carried out for the urban informal settlements in the neighborhood of Suna in Dar es Salaam. A micro-scale flood hazard assessment has been performed also for the informal settlements located in the neighborhood of Little Akaki in Ethiopia. The flood risk assessment problem can be sub-divided into three main components, namely, hazard, vulnerability and exposure. Two different approaches are adopted herein for flood risk assessment in the micro- and meso-scale, respectively. The micro-scale flood hazard assessment procedure leads to the calculation of the inundation profiles [...] maximum flood height and velocity for each node within a lattice covering the zone of interest [...] for different return periods. This is done, herein, based on both historical rainfall data and future climate projections for the precipitation. The relationship between flood height and velocity at a given point is approximated by a power-law relation. This way, only the flood height is going to be used as an interface variable for calculating flooding risk. Meso-scale flood hazard assessment in this work is based on a geo-spatial dataset of potentially flood prone urban areas, called the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) map. In this approach, the flood-prone areas are identified by a TWI larger than a certain threshold. A GIS-based Bayesian parameter-estimation method is developed herein in order to estimate the TWI threshold based on the inundation profiles calculated for one or more micro-scale spatial windows. This Bayesian method is also used to estimate the TWI threshold based on the areal extent and delineation {{of flooding}} in previous flooding events. Flood vulnerability assessment can be regarded as the back-bone of this work. An efficient Bayesian and simulation-based algorithm is developed for the assessment of the vulnerability of a class of buildings to flooding. This Bayesian algorithm is based on assigning prescribed analytic uni- and bi-modal probability distributions for characterizing the structural fragility functions. This allows for efficient calculation of structural fragility based on a small number of (around 20 - 50) Monte Carlo simulations. The fragility calculations, for each of the three limit state defined in the procedure, are performed on a bi-dimensional finite-element structural model considering the openings (door and windows) constructed using the open-source software Opensees. This vulnerability assessment procedure takes into account the various sources of uncertainty due to building-to-building variability in construction geometry and detailing, and lack of complete knowledge about material mechanical properties and about characteristics of flood action (loading). The uncertain parameters considered in this work are classified into, discrete binary variables (logical statements) and continuous uncertain variables. The uncertain parameters are characterized by employing various data acquisition tools and methods, such as, orthophoto recognition, building survey, laboratory tests for material mechanical properties and literature survey. Vulnerability of the class of buildings to flooding is represented herein through the robust fragility curves, calculated as the statistics (16 th, 50 th and 84 th percentiles) of the set of plausible fragility curves, calculated by considering the above-mentioned sources of uncertainty. Flood risk assessment in this work is developed both in meso- and micro-scale. The meso-scale flood risk assessment leads to the identification of <b>urban</b> flooding <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and the evaluation of exposure to risk. Arguably, identifying the <b>urban</b> flooding <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> is one of the first steps in an integrated methodology for urban flood risk assessment and mitigation. In this work, three GIS-based datasets are employed for identifying the <b>urban</b> flooding <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> for residential buildings and urban corridors (i. e., urban roads wider than 15 m). This is done by overlaying a map of potentially flood prone areas (Topographic Wetness Index, TWI), a map of residential areas and urban corridors (extracted from a city-wide assessment of urban morphology types (UMT)), and a geo-spatial Census dataset. For different statistics of the TWI threshold (e. g. MLE estimate, 16 th percentile, 50 th percentile), the map of the potentially flood prone areas is overlaid with the map of urban morphology units identified as residential and urban corridors in order to delineate the <b>urban</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> for both <b>urban</b> morphology types. Moreover, information related to population density is integrated by overlaying geo-spatial Census datasets in order to estimate the number of people affected by flooding. Differences in exposure characteristics are also assessed for a range of different residential types. In the micro-scale, flood risk assessment for a single-class portfolio of buildings is performed by point-wise integration of flooding hazard and the robust fragility curves. Various risk metrics are adopted in this work, namely, the mean annual frequency of exceeding a specific limit state, the annual probability of exceeding a limit state, expected number of casualties and expected replacement/reconstruction costs. The micro-scale flood risk assessment approach can be viewed as a linear and modular path starting from precipitation data (based on historical data/climate projections), to flood hazard assessment based on analysis of the hydrographic basin, to simulation-based portfolio (class) vulnerability assessment, finally leading to the assessment of flooding risk. A GIS-compatible computer platform with Matlab¬Æ-based graphical user interface is developed in this work: VISK, "Visual Vulnerability & Risk", flooding module. VISK basically mirrors the procedure for micro-scale flood risk assessment developed in this thesis. This is done by performing detailed (micro-scale) flood risk assessment for building stock with more-or-less similar characteristics. The GIS compatibility allows for graphical processing of both input and output to the program, providing an efficient visualization of flooding risk. The results can be visualized both in a detailed building-to-building scale (of potential interest to single house-holds) or as overall estimates for the entire area (of interest to policy makers) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Concern {{is growing}} {{about the effects}} of {{urbanization}} on air pollution and health. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) released primarily from combustion processes, such as traffic, is a short-lived atmospheric pollutant that serves as an air-quality indicator and is itself a health concern. We derive a global distribution of ground-level NO 2 concentrations from tropospheric NO 2 columns retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Local scaling factors from a three-dimensional chemistry-transport model (GEOS-Chem) are used to relate the OMI NO 2 columns to ground-level concentrations. The OMI-derived surface NO 2 data are significantly correlated (r = 0. 69) with in situ surface measurements. We examine how the OMI-derived ground-level NO 2 concentrations, OMI NO 2 columns, and bottom-up NOx emission inventories relate to <b>urban</b> population.

In this paper, the multiple scattering effect between heterogeneous non-isothermal surfaces is described rigorously according {{to the concept of}} configuration factor, based on which a directional thermal radiance model is built, and the directional radiant character for urban canopy is analyzed. The model is applied to a simple urban canopy with row structure to simulate the change of Directional Brightness Temperature (DBT). The results show that the DBT is aggrandized because of the multiple scattering effects, whereas the change range of DBT is smoothed. The temperature difference, spatial distribution, emissivity of the components can all lead to the change of DBT. The ‚Äúhot spot ‚Äù phenomenon occurs when the proportion of high temperature component in the vision field came to a head. On the other hand, the ‚Äúcool spot ‚Äù phenomena occur when low temperature proportion came to the head.

Getis Ord (GI*) <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> analysis was used to identify locations of statistically significant <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of each of the four crime and disorder classifications. Strong spatial correlations were found between licensed premises and each of the four crime and disorder classifications analysed. MCC <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were also identified near licensed premises. Temporal profiling of the MCC <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> revealed all four crime types were simultaneously present in time and place, near licensed premises, on Friday through Sunday {{in the early hours of}} the morning around premise closing times. At other times, criminal damage and drugs <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were found to occur earlier in the evening, and disorder and violence at later time periods. Criminal damage and drug <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> flared for shorter time periods, 2 ‚Äì 3 h, whereas disorder and violence <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were present for several hours. There was a small spatial lag between Friday and Saturday, with offences occurring approximately 1 h later on Saturdays. The implications of these findings for <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> policing are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{potential}} applications of satellite remote sensing to regional science research in urban settings. Regional science {{is the study}} of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of satellite remote sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of <b>urban</b> deprivation <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The satellite remote sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird. Consistent relationships between socio-economic variables derived from censuses and field surveys and proxy variables of vegetation coverage measured from satellite remote sensing data have been found in several cities in the US. Different approaches and techniques have been applied successfully around the world, but local research is always needed to account for the unique elements of each place. Spectral mixture analysis, object-oriented classifications and image texture measures are some of the techniques of image processing that have been implemented with good results. Many regional scientists remain skeptical that satellite remote sensing will produce useful information for their work. More local research is needed to demonstrate the real potential and utility of satellite remote sensing for regional science in urban environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Meiotic {{recombination}} {{events have}} been found to concentrate in 1 ‚Äì 2. 5 kilo base regions, but these recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> do not share a consensus sequence and why they occur at specific sites is not fully understood. Some previous evidence suggests that poly-purine/poly-pyrimidine (poly-pu/py) tracts (PPTs), a class of sequence with distinctive biochemical properties, could be involved in recombination, but no general association of PPTs with meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> has previously been reported. Results We used computational methods to investigate in detail the relationship between PPTs and <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> We show statistical associations of PPT frequency with <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of meiotic recombination initiating lesions, double-strand breaks, in the genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae and with experimentally well characterized human meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Supporting a possible role of poly-pu/py-rich sequences in <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> recombination, we also found that all three single nucleotide polymorphisms previously shown to be associated with human <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> activity changes occur within sequence contexts of 14 bp or longer that are 85 % or more poly-pu/py and at least 70 % G/C. These polymorphisms are all close to the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mid points. Comparing the sequences of experimentally characterized human <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> with the orthologous regions of the chimpanzee genome previously shown not to contain <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> we found that in all five cases in which comparisons for the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> central regions are possible with publicly available sequence data, there are differences near the human <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mid points within sequences 14 bp or longer consisting of more than 80 % poly-pu/py and at least 50 % G/C. Conclusion Our results, along with previous evidence for the unique biochemical properties and recombination-stimulating potential of poly-pu/py-rich sequences, suggest that the possible functional involvement of this type of sequence in meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> deserves further experimental exploration. </p...|$|R

40|$|The major <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> of {{transposon}} Tn 5 insertion in plasmid pBR 322 (<b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> I) {{is in the}} promoter for the tetracycline resistance gene (tet). We made {{a series}} of pBR 322 derivatives with mutations in and around this promoter and assayed their effects on insertion of Tn 5 into <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> I. Those mutations which reduced transcription from the tet promoter also reduced the frequency of insertion into <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> I. Transcription and translation of tet are thought to cause the formation of paired domains of negative and positive supercoiling in pBR 322. An amber codon in tet, 345 base pairs from <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> I, decreases the negative supercoiling of the DNA segment containing <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> I because it terminates translation of tet prematurely. We report here that this amber mutation also reduces insertion into <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> I. These results suggest that the ability of Tn 5 to insert into its major <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> in pBR 322 depends directly on negative supercoiling of the target DNA...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Manual {{counting}} of microvessels is {{subjective and}} {{may lead to}} unacceptable interobserver variability, which may explain conflicting results. AIMS: To develop and test an automated method for microvessel counting and objective selection of the <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> based on image processing of whole sections, and to compare this with manual selection of a <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> and counting of microvessels. METHODS: Microvessels were stained by CD 31 immunohistochemistry in 10 cases of invasive breast cancer. The number of microvessels was counted manually in a subjectively selected <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> {{and also in the}} same complete tumour sections by interactive and automated image processing methods. An algorithm identified the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> from microvessel maps of the whole tumour section. RESULTS: No significant difference in manual microvessel counts was found between two observers within the same <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> and counts were significantly correlated. However, when the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> was reselected, significantly different results were found between repeated counts by the same observer. Counting all microvessels manually within the entire tumour section resulted in significantly different <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> than manual counts in selected <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> by the same observer. Within the entire tumour section {{no significant differences were found}} between the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of the manual and automated methods using an automated microscope. The <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> was found using an eight connective path search algorithm, was located at or near the border of the tumour, and (depending on the size of the <b>hot</b> <b>spot)</b> did not always contain the field with the largest number of microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: The automated counting of microvessels is preferable to the manual method because of the reduction in measurement time when the complete tumour is scanned, the greater accuracy and objectivity of <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> selection, and the possibility of visual inspection and relocation of each measurement field afterwards...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} meiotic crossover <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and block-like linkage disequilibrium (LD), we have extended our high-resolution studies of the human MHC class II region to a 90 -kb segment upstream of the HLA-DOA gene. LD blocks in this region are not as well defined as in the neighboring 210 -kb DNA segment but do show two regions of LD breakdown in which coalescent analysis indicates substantial historical recombination. Sperm crossover analysis of one region revealed a novel localized <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> similar in intensity and morphology to most other MHC <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Crossovers at this <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> are not obviously affected by a large insertion/deletion polymorphism near the <b>hot</b> <b>spot.</b> The second region of LD breakdown, within the DPB 1 gene, shows an extremely low level of sperm crossover activity and does not contain a sperm crossover <b>hot</b> <b>spot.</b> These results highlight the complexity of LD patterns {{and the importance of}} experimentally verifying crossover <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> 1625...|$|R
