Shortly after, Presley recorded Davis' song [...] "In the Ghetto" [...] in his sessions in Memphis. According to maverick record producer Jimmy Bowen, [...] "Ghetto" [...] was originally pitched to Sammy Davis, Jr. Mac, guitar in hand, played the song in a studio, with onlookers such as Rev.

Davis, the only Caucasian man in the room at the time, [...] eventually told Bowen, [...] "I don't know whether to thank ya, or to kill ya." [...] Davis eventually recorded the tune after Presley's version became a success, and was released in a Ronco In Concert compilation in 1975. It was later released on a campy Rhino Records Golden Throats compilation in 1991. The song became a success for Presley and he continued to record more of Davis' material, such as [...] "Memories" [...] , [...] "Don't Cry Daddy" [...] and [...] "Clean <b>Up</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> Backyard". Bobby Goldsboro also recorded some of Davis's songs, including [...] "Watching Scotty Grow", which became a number one Adult Contemporary success for Goldsboro in 1971. Other artists who recorded his material included Vikki Carr, O.C. Smith, and Kenny Rogers and The First Edition. [...] "I Believe in Music", often considered to be Davis's signature song, was recorded by several artists (including Marian Love, B.J.
