5|$|Digestion {{can take}} a long time. The food moves from the mouth to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial {{digestion}} occurs. <b>Unwanted</b> items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects <b>unwanted</b> items from its mouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any <b>unwanted</b> sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} {{perceived}} as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of <b>unwanted</b> sound, from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E
5|$|Rota Ree (voiced by Judy Strangis) is Wheelie's girlfriend who is {{constantly}} {{subject to the}} <b>unwanted</b> affections of Chopper.|$|E
5|$|When prey is swallowed, it is {{liquefied}} in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting slurry is wafted {{through the}} canal system by {{the beating of}} the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes in the canals may help to transport nutrients to muscles in the mesoglea. The anal pores may eject <b>unwanted</b> small particles, but most <b>unwanted</b> matter is regurgitated via the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from <b>unwanted</b> heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E
5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain and America, {{the film has}} sometimes been seen as drawing <b>unwanted</b> attention to Oxford's stereotypical reputation as a playground for the upper class. It stars Jeremy Irons and most college shots are of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E
5|$|During {{that same}} year, Opus Dei {{received}} some <b>unwanted</b> attention {{due to the}} extraordinary success of the novel The Da Vinci Code, in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively. The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the first}} report on {{attempted}} isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing <b>unwanted</b> contaminating elements such as the trivalent actinides, the group 5 elements, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes <b>unwanted</b> tastes and results in refined sugar or white sugar.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch {{public was}} furious {{at what they}} {{believed}} a hostile German act, which caused German diplomats to spread rumors of an impending British invasion of the Netherlands to divert the <b>unwanted</b> attention.|$|E
5|$|The immune {{response}} {{can be manipulated}} to suppress <b>unwanted</b> responses resulting from autoimmunity, allergy, and transplant rejection, and to stimulate protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the immune system (see immunization) or cancer.|$|E
5|$|There were {{occasional}} {{examples of}} men making <b>unwanted</b> homosexual advances, homosexuality being then criminal under both military and civil law, {{to escape the}} front lines, but prosecutions for this crime were rare, {{and there is also}} evidence of men turning a blind eye to homosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|This {{process can}} cause {{problems}} in lead-bismuth based liquid metal cooled nuclear reactors {{such as those}} used in the Soviet Navy's K-27. Measures must be taken in these reactors {{to deal with the}} <b>unwanted</b> possibility of 210Po being released from the coolant.|$|E
5|$|Although xenon has {{potential}} {{for use in}} computed tomography (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35%. A breathing mixture of 30% xenon and 30% krypton is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40% xenon fraction, while avoiding the <b>unwanted</b> effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas.|$|E
5|$|As aforementioned, {{while its}} exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often {{believed}} to be a dish created by slaves, made from slave owners’ <b>unwanted</b> food materials, such as animal innards or fatty cuts. African-American slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients {{in order to make the}} dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity among them.|$|E
5|$|At Norman's funeral, Harry swears vengeance toward Spider-Man, whom {{he deems}} {{responsible}} for his father's death, and asserts that Peter is all the family he has left. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she {{is in love with}} him. Peter, however, feels that he must protect her from the <b>unwanted</b> attention of his enemies. He hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves the funeral, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|Barium, as a {{metal or}} when alloyed with aluminium, {{is used to}} remove <b>unwanted</b> gases (gettering) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes. Barium is {{suitable}} for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.|$|E
5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who was {{building}} a reputation for signing <b>unwanted</b> foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer. However, he thought that success would also lead his 13 players who {{would be out of}} contract, to demand more money for a renewal.|$|E
5|$|Changing the {{relative}} {{phase of the}} subwoofer {{with respect to the}} woofers in other speakers may or may not help to minimize <b>unwanted</b> destructive acoustic interference in the frequency region covered by both subwoofer and main speakers. It may not help at all frequencies, and may create further problems with frequency response, but is even so generally provided as an adjustment for subwoofer amplifiers. Phase control circuits may be a simple polarity reversal switch or a more complex continuously variable circuits.|$|E
5|$|Creatures of Impulse is a stage {{play by the}} English dramatist W. S. Gilbert, {{with music}} by the composer-conductor Alberto Randegger, which Gilbert adapted from his own short story. Both the play and the short story concern an <b>unwanted</b> and ill-tempered old fairy who enchants people to behave in a manner {{opposite}} to their natures, with farcical results.|$|E
5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have <b>unwanted</b> effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to <b>unwanted</b> and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, update 1.4 was {{released}} which added a crafting system, rooms, a card in lunchboxes containing junk used in crafting, pets and a barbershop. Update 1.5 {{was released}} in April 2016, adding customization options for Vault dwellers along {{with the ability to}} scrap <b>unwanted</b> items and support for 3D Touch. Update 1.6 was released on July 14, 2016 adding a quest system, two new enemies (Feral Ghouls and Radscorpions) and two items in the shop. Additionally, the combat system was tweaked in the update.|$|E
5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or <b>unwanted</b> sound. Noise {{is an important}} component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E
5|$|Jon and Tyrion see the Wall for {{the first}} time as they arrive with Benjen and the other recruits. En route to the Wall, Tyrion and Jon discuss the Night's Watch. Tyrion is quick to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond the Wall (as it was in history), {{pointing}} out that now it is more a dumping ground for the <b>unwanted</b> of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} revamp her {{wardrobe}} after her separation from Roy Anderson and ordered some new clothes. When Pam's clothes are {{shipped to the}} office, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) insists that Pam perform a lunchtime fashion show to show off a new blouse. When it draws <b>unwanted</b> attention, Pam concludes {{that it is too}} revealing.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{said that}} he was working on defense {{balloons}} that could stop them in case of an attack against the United States through a company in Chicago, known as the Chicago Captive Balloon Company. The newspapers printed a counterview that warned against Jingoism and starting rumors that could lead to developing <b>unwanted</b> war airships or a cause for other nations to make military equipment against this new war technology.|$|E
5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent <b>unwanted</b> protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|Scully tells Doggett {{that while}} the DNA test disproves Fassl's culpability, it implicates a {{possible}} blood relative; Fassl, however, is an only child. Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person. Meanwhile, Fassl approaches Assistant District Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to {{be sent back to}} prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by the Bearded Man. After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the <b>unwanted</b> ability to physically change into another, more violent person.|$|E
5|$|Slaves {{had special}} sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from <b>unwanted</b> advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E
5|$|Social {{media was}} blamed for {{bringing}} <b>unwanted</b> {{visitors to the}} site and not {{pointing out that the}} area is off-limits to the public. Following these acts of vandalism, the state of Hawaii asked for the removal of directions to Kaniakapūpū on many social media websites and tourism blogs, and encouraged those who knew the direction to the ruins to come with respect.|$|E
5|$|Stone wool or {{rock wool}} is a spun mineral fibre {{used as an}} {{insulation}} product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a blast furnace fed with diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an <b>unwanted</b> by-product and run to waste.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total {{strontium chloride hexahydrate}} by weight. Small amounts {{are used in the}} refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities. The metal itself has a limited use as a getter, to remove <b>unwanted</b> gases in vacuums by reacting with them, although barium may also be used for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Summer 1949 {{brought an}} <b>unwanted</b> {{distraction}} for Robinson. In July, {{he was called}} {{to testify before the}} United States House of Representatives' Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.|$|E
5|$|The League Cup {{was clearly}} not one of Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the younger and less-known players. After being swept aside {{in the third round}} by Ipswich Town – a team {{at the bottom of the}} First Division – Ferguson came under intense scrutiny for fielding a reshuffled squad. However, the manager felt that it was, at the time, an <b>unwanted</b> domestic distraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} subplots {{on the show}} grew as more cast members were added. Regular subplots since the 1980s included: Howard and Marina trying to have an affair without Howard's wife finding out (a {{variation}} of the Wainwright-Partridge subplot of the 1970s), the older women meeting for tea and discussing their theories about men and life, Auntie Wainwright trying to sell <b>unwanted</b> merchandise to unsuspecting customers, Smiler {{trying to find a}} woman, Barry trying to better himself (at the insistence of Glenda), and Tom trying to stay {{one step ahead of the}} repo man.|$|E
