25|$|After their {{telegraph}} cables {{had been}} cut, the German Foreign Office {{appealed to the}} United States for use of their cable for diplomatic messages. President Wilson agreed to this, {{in the belief that}} such cooperation would sustain continued good relations with Germany, and that more efficient German-American diplomacy could assist Wilson's goal of a negotiated end to the war. The Germans handed in messages to the United States embassy in Berlin, which were relayed to the embassy in Denmark and then to the United States by American telegraph operators. However, the United States placed conditions on German usage, most notably that all messages had to be in clear (i.e., <b>uncoded).</b> The Germans assumed that the United States cable was secure and used it extensively.|$|E
25|$|The Afrika Korps had the {{intelligence}} {{services of the}} 621st Signals Battalion mobile monitoring element which arrived in North Africa in late April 1941, commanded by Hauptmann Alfred Seeböhm. The 621st Signals Battalion monitored radio communications among British units. Unfortunately for the Allies, the British not only failed to change their codes with any frequency, they were also prone to poor radio discipline in combat. Their officers made frequent open, <b>uncoded</b> transmissions to their commands, allowing the Germans to more easily identify British units and deployments. The situation changed after a counterattack during the Battle of Gazala resulted in the 621st Signals Battalion being overrun and destroyed, {{and a number of}} their documents captured, alerting British intelligence to the problem. The British responded by instituting an improved call signal procedure, introducing radiotelephonic codes, imposing rigid wireless silence on reserve formations, padding out real messages with dummy traffic, tightening up on their radio discipline in combat and creating an entire fake signals network in the southern sector.|$|E
500|$|Admiral Nimitz had one priceless advantage: US cryptanalysts had {{partially}} {{broken the}} Japanese Navy's JN-25b code. Since early 1942, the US had been decoding messages stating {{that there would}} soon be an operation at objective [...] "AF". It was initially not known where [...] "AF" [...] was, but Commander Joseph Rochefort and his team at Station HYPO were able to confirm that it was Midway: Captain Wilfred Holmes devised a ruse of telling the base at Midway (by secure undersea cable) to broadcast an <b>uncoded</b> radio message stating that Midway's water purification system had broken down. Within 24 hours, the code breakers picked up a Japanese message that [...] "AF was short on water." [...] (No Japanese radio operators who intercepted the message seemed concerned that the Americans were broadcasting <b>uncoded</b> that a major naval installation close to the Japanese threat ring was having a water shortage, which could have tipped off Japanese intelligence officers {{that it was a}} deliberate attempt at deception.) ...|$|E
500|$|At 16:00 on 6 April, Yamato, with Admiral Itō on board, {{the light}} cruiser [...] and eight destroyers {{departed}} Tokuyama {{to begin the}} mission. Two American submarines— and —sighted the Japanese force as it proceeded south through Bungo Suido. Although {{they were unable to}} attack (due to the ships' speed), they did spend several hours shadowing the Japanese sortie and sending updates of its course to the U.S. fleet. The submarines' messages, which were reportedly sent <b>uncoded,</b> were also picked up by radio operators on the Japanese ships.|$|E
500|$|Air Marshal Hermann Göring urged Hitler {{to let the}} Luftwaffe (aided by Army Group B) {{finish off}} the British, {{to the consternation of}} Halder, who noted in his diary that the Luftwaffe was {{dependent}} upon the weather and air crews were worn out after two weeks of battle. Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent <b>uncoded.</b> It was picked up by the RAF Y service at 12:42: [...] "By order of the Fuhrer... attack north-west of Arras is to be limited to the general line Lens-Bethune-Aire-St Omer-Gravelines. The Canal will not be crossed." [...] Later that day, Hitler issued Directive 13, which called for the Luftwaffe to defeat the trapped Allied forces and stop their escape. At 15:30 on 26 May, Hitler ordered the panzer groups to continue their advance, but most units took another 16 hours to attack. The delay gave the Allies time to prepare defences vital for the evacuation and prevented the Germans from stopping the Allied retreat from Lille.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{managed to}} avoid summary {{execution}} {{at the hands of}} the Germans and was held in several Italian prisons where he was interrogated frequently. He was later transferred to the Marlag und Milag Nord prisoner of war camp near Bremen. Marjorie Lewis did not know that Clark was still alive until he sent her an <b>uncoded</b> message, strictly against standing SOE orders, reading [...] "Bob sends love to Marjorie". After the camp was liberated Clark returned to London, sending ahead a telegram to Marjorie, stating: [...] "Arriving London from Germany. Meet me". They met and the two shook hands; they were later married in 1949. [...] Clark's teddy bear Falla, which he had had since the age of two, had accompanied him throughout his time as a prisoner and is thought to be the only teddy bear to have parachuted behind enemy lines and survived as a prisoner of war. [...] Clark served in the Pacific Theatre and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 March 1946 before he was demobilised later that year.|$|E
500|$|At 09:00 a German {{messenger}} {{crossed the}} Willemsbrug {{to bring an}} ultimatum from Schmidt to Colonel Pieter Scharroo, the Dutch commander of Rotterdam, demanding a capitulation of the city; if a positive answer had not been received within two hours the [...] "severest means of annihilation" [...] would be employed. However, Scharroo did not receive the message until 10:30. Not feeling inclined to surrender regardless, he asked Winkelman for orders; the latter, hearing that the document had not been signed nor contained {{the name of the}} sender, instructed him to send a Dutch envoy to clarify matters and gain time. At 12:15 a Dutch captain handed this request to von Choltitz. On the return of the German envoy at 12:00, Schmidt had already sent a radio message that the bombardment had to be postponed because negotiations had started. Just after the Dutch envoy had received a second ultimatum, now signed by Schmidt and with a new expiry time of 16:20, around 13:20 two formations of Heinkels arrived, not having received any recall orders. This was later explained by the Germans {{as a result of their}} having already pulled in their tow aerials. Schmidt ordered red flares to be fired to signal that the bombardment was to be broken off, but only the squadron making the bomb run from the southwest abandoned its attack, after their first three planes had dropped their bombs. The other 54 Heinkels, having approached from the east, continued to drop their share of the grand total of 1308 bombs, destroying the inner city and killing 814 civilians. The ensuing fires destroyed about 24,000 houses, making almost 80,000 inhabitants homeless. At 15:50 Scharroo capitulated to Schmidt in person. Meanwhile, Göring had ordered a second bombardment of the city—a group of Heinkels had already left—to be carried out unless a message was received that the whole of Rotterdam was occupied. When Schmidt heard of the order, he hastily sent an <b>uncoded</b> message at 17:15 claiming the city was taken, although this had yet to take place. The bombers were recalled just in time.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{corporations}} and supermarkets have introduced self-checkout machines, where {{the customer is}} trusted to scan the barcodes (or manually identify <b>uncoded</b> items like fruit), and place the items into a bagging area. The bag is weighed, and the machine halts the checkout when the weight of something in the bag does not match the weight in the inventory database. Normally, an employee is watching over several such checkouts to prevent theft or exploitation of the machines' weaknesses (for example, intentional misidentification of expensive produce or dry goods). Payment on these machines is accepted by debit card/credit card, or cash via coin slot and bank note scanner. Store employees are also needed to authorize [...] "age-restricted" [...] purchases, such as alcohol, solvents or knives, which can either be done remotely by the employee observing the self-checkout, or {{by means of a}} [...] "store login" [...] which the operator has to enter.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 May U-20 {{stopped a}} {{merchant}} schooner, the Earl of Lathom, off the Old Head of Kinsale, examined her papers, then ordered her crew to leave before sinking the schooner with gunfire. On 6 May, U-20 fired a torpedo at Cayo Romano from Cuba, a British steamer flying a neutral flag, off Fastnet Rock narrowly missing {{by a few}} feet. At 22:30 on 5 May, the Royal Navy sent an <b>uncoded</b> warning to all ships [...] – [...] "Submarines active off the south coast of Ireland" [...] – and at midnight an addition was made to the regular nightly warnings, [...] "submarine off Fastnet". On 6 May U-20 sank the 6,000 ton steamer Candidate. It then failed to get off {{a shot at the}} 16,000 ton liner Arabic, because although she kept a straight course the liner was too fast, but then sank another 6,000 ton British cargo ship flying no flag, Centurion, all in the region of the Coningbeg light ship. The specific mention of a submarine was dropped from the midnight broadcast on 6–7 May as news of the new sinkings had not yet reached the navy at Queenstown, and it was correctly assumed that there was no longer a submarine at Fastnet.|$|E
2500|$|An Offensive Sub-Committee of the British Committee of Imperial Defence was {{appointed}} on 5 August {{and established a}} principle that command of the seas was to be ensured. Territorial objectives were considered {{if they could be}} attained with local forces and if the objective assisted the priority of maintaining British sea communications, as British army garrisons abroad were returned to Europe in an [...] "Imperial Concentration". Attacks on German coaling stations and wireless stations were considered to be important, to clear the seas of German commerce raiders. Objectives at Tsingtau, Luderitz Bay, Windhoek, Duala and Dar-es-Salaam were considered and a German wireless station in Togoland, next to the British colony of Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea, was considered vulnerable to attack by local forces. The high-power wireless transmitter had been built at Kamina and controlled German communication in the Atlantic Ocean, by linking a German transmitter at Nauen near Berlin with German colonies in west Africa and south America. At the outbreak of war, the German acting-Governor of Togoland, who had [...] police, [...] police and [...] guards but no regular army forces, had proposed neutrality to the British and French colonial authorities under the Congo Act 1885 and then withdrawn from Lomé and the coastal region, when the British demanded unconditional surrender. The acting-Governor, Major Hans-Georg von Döring had sent an <b>uncoded</b> wireless message to Berlin disclosing his plan to retreat to Kamina, which had been intercepted and led to offensive operations against Kamina being authorised by the Colonial Office on 9 August. Anglo-French expeditions from northern Dahomey, Nigeria and the Gold Coast began on 12 August.|$|E
