5|$|Ragnar Nurkse's {{balanced}} growth theory too has been criticised {{on a number}} of grounds. His main critic was Albert O. Hirschman, the pioneer of the strategy of <b>unbalanced</b> growth. Hans W. Singer also criticised certain aspects of the theory.|$|E
5|$|The Man 1960 {{suspense}} {{episode of}} Startime {{was based on}} an original Broadway play written by Mel Dinelli. Murphy played a mentally <b>unbalanced</b> stranger who posed as a student and handyman and terrorized homeowner Thelma Ritter.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons Wrestling {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics. It received an aggregated score of 41.21% on GameRankings and 32/100 on Metacritic. They criticized {{the game for}} having simplistic, <b>unbalanced</b> gameplay and bad graphics, but praised the game's audio track.|$|E
5|$|The new risk {{stratification}} {{will be based}} on the new INRGSS staging system, age (dichotomized at 18 months), tumor grade, N-myc amplification, <b>unbalanced</b> 11q aberration, and ploidy into four pre-treatment risk groups: very low, low, intermediate, and high risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the match led to debates about the format of {{qualification}} tournaments, with the Australian manager Frank Farina and Thompson feeling that preliminary rounds should be introduced to avoid such <b>unbalanced</b> matches, views shared by the international footballing body FIFA. It {{eventually led to the}} introduction of a preliminary round in the Oceanian zone qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The <b>unbalanced</b> level of opponents also partly contributed to Australia's move to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Ali al-Ridha {{writes in}} his {{treatise}} that one's health is {{in accordance with the}} balance of phlegm, yellow bile, blood and black bile; an individual becomes sick when this proportion is <b>unbalanced.</b> Nutrition and traditional medicine may be used to cure imbalances. The liver {{plays an important role in}} producing and maintaining the required proportions in the body.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>unbalanced</b> schedule, when Boston {{forced the}} ALCS {{to a full}} seven games, the seventh game set a major league record for the rivalry between the two teams: it {{marked the first time}} two major league teams have played more than 25 games against each other {{over the course of a}} single season.|$|E
5|$|Origins was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews upon release. Critics praised the game for remaining faithful to the arcade versions and its additional features, but criticized it for its outdated gameplay and <b>unbalanced</b> rosters. In December 2014, the game was removed from its online platforms after Capcom's licensing contracts with Marvel Comics expired.|$|E
5|$|People {{from the}} {{overpopulated}} western highlands and the underdeveloped north {{are moving to}} the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment. Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations {{in the south and}} east. Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to <b>unbalanced</b> ratios in some regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} this {{principle}} is exactly {{like that of}} the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no <b>unbalanced</b> deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is about}} a young {{merchant}} marine officer who begins to suspect that his ship's captain is mentally <b>unbalanced</b> and endangering {{the lives of the}} ship's crew. The ship's crew, however, believes the vessel to be haunted and cursed and several mysterious deaths occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{obsession}} {{led him to}} {{deny that}} animals could be colored for other reasons: for protection by mimicry, as the naturalist Henry Walter Bates had proposed, supported by many examples of butterflies from South America; through sexual selection, as Charles Darwin had argued, again supported by many observations. The <b>unbalanced</b> treatment of animal coloration in Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom encapsulates Thayer's partial understanding and his rejection of other theories.|$|E
5|$|A mentally <b>unbalanced</b> Ricky Williams (David Baxt) {{is driven}} to {{re-enter}} the caves when {{a sample of}} crystals pulsates and the chemical intelligence exerts its influence through a mark on his arm. Thrown into a grille in a compromised environmental suit, Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) removes her helmet and freezes {{to death in the}} toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw. Documentation officer Kate Frost (Stephanie Beacham) shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he opens both the inner and outer airlock doors and renders the air inside the base unbreathable.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929, {{which resulted in a}} hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald (1866–1937) took office. In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis, as the May Report revealed that the budget was <b>unbalanced,</b> with an expected shortfall of £120million. On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her <b>unbalanced</b> character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as a warning to the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl was an {{excellent}} sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat <b>unbalanced,</b> however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|However, on {{the morning}} of 16 October Newman spotted Loire on the horizon and {{immediately}} ordered his ships in pursuit. Loire was faster than Mermaid in the high winds but was unable to outrun Kangaroo, which directly engaged the far larger frigate in a distant artillery duel. The difference in weight of shot between the combatants was greatly <b>unbalanced,</b> and Kangaroo eventually fell behind after suffering damage to her rigging. Loire too had been damaged, and by 06:45 the following morning Captain Segond realised he could not escape his pursuers and instead shortened sail, intending to engage Mermaid—by then the only pursuer still within reach.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if <b>unbalanced.</b> Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E
5|$|In season four, {{the story}} later gets {{turned into a}} stage play, then a film titled Lez Girls. Marina briefly returns during the play, portraying Jenny's character. Jenny realizes she is over Marina after being propositioned by her. Jenny becomes more mentally <b>unbalanced</b> when she adopts a dog {{to get close to}} a female veterinarian. The vet is a girlfriend of a {{columnist}} who gave Jenny's story a bad review. Pretending to be distraught, Jenny has the dog put down. Jenny begins secretly dating the woman as part of her plan to ruin her girlfriend's career. When Jenny is found out, she accused of being manipulative and evil.|$|E
5|$|Inseminoid (titled Horror Planet in the United States) is a 1981 British-Hong Kong science-fiction {{exploitation}} horror film. Director Norman J. Warren's eighth film, {{the plot}} of Inseminoid concerns a group of future scientists excavating the ruins of an ancient civilisation on a distant planet. When a monstrous alien creature attacks and inseminates {{one of the women}} in the team, chaos ensues as the <b>unbalanced</b> victim, possessing unnatural strength, murders her colleagues one after another in a psychotic bid to protect her unborn twin hybrid offspring. It stars Judy Geeson, Robin Clarke, and Stephanie Beacham. Victoria Tennant makes an early film appearance.|$|E
5|$|Major League Soccer's {{regular season}} runs from March to October. Teams {{are divided into}} the Eastern and Western Conferences. Teams play 34games in an <b>unbalanced</b> schedule: 23 matches against teams within their conference, plus 11 matches against teams from the other conference. Midway through the season, teams break for the annual All-Star Game, a {{friendly}} game between the league's finest players and a major club from a different league. At {{the end of the}} regular season, the team with the highest point total is awarded the Supporters' Shield.|$|E
5|$|Mania {{initially}} expressed skepticism of the show's {{combination of}} gothic lolita, dolls, magic, and comedy but later {{calls it a}} successful experiment and praised the character interactions and the dolls' designs. In their Rozen Maiden: Träumend review, Mania praised the visuals and characters but criticized the <b>unbalanced</b> comic and dark comments and described the revelations and finale as rushed. Anime News Network's review of Rozen Maiden: Träumend were mostly negative and addressed several points: the failed attempts at serious drama which were considered cliché and resulted in cheesy and melodramatic dialogue; the recycled background music; and the ending which was described as inconclusive and slapdash.|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from video game publications and {{sold more than}} {{one and a half}} million copies by January 2008. Critics praised the game's interactive storytelling and cinematic design, but criticized its <b>unbalanced</b> combat mechanics and poor artificial intelligence. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and Roleplaying Game of the Year at the 2008 Interactive Achievement Awards. Mass Effect was ported to the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 platforms in 2008 and 2012, respectively. A sequel, Mass Effect 2, was released in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The 1952 {{classification}} by French zoologist J. Alloiteau {{was built}} on these earlier systems but included more microstructural observations and did not involve the anatomical characters of the polyp. Alloiteau recognized eight suborders. In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill {{stressed the importance of}} microstructural observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were <b>unbalanced</b> and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E
5|$|The Battle for Middle-earth II {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} video game critics. Reviews praised the game's {{integration of the}} Lord of the Rings universe into a real-time strategy title, while criticism targeted the game's <b>unbalanced</b> multiplayer mode. The Battle for Middle-earth II received numerous awards, including the Editors' Choice Award from IGN. At the end of March 2006, The Battle for Middle-earth II reached fourth in {{a list of the}} month's best-selling PC games. A Windows expansion pack for the game was released on November 28, 2006, called , which features a new faction known as Angmar, new units, and several gameplay improvements.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} {{a strong and}} varied reaction from reviewers. Most heaped praise on the scenes featuring Karofsky, both the {{events leading up to}} his suicide attempt and when Kurt (Chris Colfer) visited him in the hospital. However, many felt the strength of this storyline <b>unbalanced</b> the episode, {{and the rest of the}} episode, particularly the Regionals competition and the Rachel and Finn wedding storyline, did not measure up. The final scene, which ended with Quinn (Dianna Agron) being in a potentially fatal car crash, was controversial.|$|E
5|$|The façade, though {{built in}} the style of the Taj Mahal, lacks {{symmetry}} as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an <b>unbalanced</b> appearance to the tomb. The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets at the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to the Taj Mahal where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|The ship's crew {{consisted}} of ten officers and 122 enlisted men. She carried {{a number of}} smaller boats, including two pinnaces, two cutters, and one dinghy. Arminius was not a particularly successful design; she suffered from severe, fast rolling, especially in heavier seas. She also shipped {{a great deal of}} water over the bow and was <b>unbalanced</b> in steering. The ship turned rapidly to starboard but was sluggish in turning to port. Indeed, the ship was required to have the rudder at 15degrees to port in order to remain on a straight course. It was also impossible to control the ship with only sail power.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} criticisms of van Kinsbergen's photographs. He missed some details and {{sometimes}} his series was <b>unbalanced.</b> Trained as an artist, his works lacked archaeological descriptions, {{the main purpose}} of his contract. The printing quality, however, is beyond question and he had success showing the beauty of classical Javanese arts. His photographs were shown to the public both in the 1873 International Exhibition in Vienna and the 1878 World Exhibition in Paris. His works can be seen in several places, including the National Museum in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and <b>unbalanced</b> behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was too small and <b>unbalanced</b> to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E
5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if <b>unbalanced</b> can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E
5|$|Johnston's best match {{performance}} came in {{the only}} loss in the Third Test at Adelaide. This happened when captain Lindsay Hassett was a late withdrawal due to injury, leaving Australia with an <b>unbalanced</b> team with only four specialist batsmen who could not consolidate the work done by the five specialist bowlers. It was in this match that Johnston passed 100 Test wickets, the fastest player to do so. Exploiting a wet patch at the striker's end, Johnston took 6/62 in the first innings as 22 wickets fell {{on the first day}} in treacherous batting conditions; however he was unable to stop an Australian defeat, taking only 1/50 in the second innings as the tourists reached their target of 233 with six wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|Most oil {{pollution}} in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen themselves {{in an attempt to}} remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and <b>unbalanced,</b> leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2009, {{as workers}} were {{assembling}} Madonna's {{stage at the}} Stade Vélodrome in Marseille for her July 19 concert, the stage collapsed, injuring eight workers and killing two. The accident caused city officials to cancel the concert. Charles Criscenzo, a 53-year-old French worker, was killed outright in the accident, which took place at around 17:15 GMT. The other worker Charles Prow, a 23-year-old from Headingley in Leeds, died overnight {{at a hospital in}} Marseille. Firefighters said the accident occurred when the roof of the stage became <b>unbalanced</b> as it was being lifted by four cranes, toppling one of them. Marseille city councillor Maurice de Nocera said that the roof started shaking and then collapsed gradually. This allowed the other workers to get out in time.|$|E
