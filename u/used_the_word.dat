5|$|Another {{claim for}} {{the origin of}} the term comes from the works of science fiction author Motoko Arai, who <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves.

5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} {{intrigued}} by the viewpoints of the two. Loran's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E

5|$|The Greeks <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> planēton {{to refer}} to the seven {{celestial}} bodies that moved with respect to the background stars and they held a geocentric view that these bodies moved about the Earth. In his work, The Republic (X.616E–617B), the Greek philosopher Plato provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to the most distant from the Earth, was as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that the most distant object moved the slowest.|$|E

50|$|The choice not to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'preventive' in <b>the</b> 2002 National Security Strategy, {{and instead}} <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'preemptive' was largely in {{anticipation}} of the widely perceived illegality of preventive attacks in international law, via both Charter Law and Customary Law.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt) Mrs. Gahr, {{my teacher}} {{for several years}} in the one-roomed country school I attended, always said a word is really yours when you have used it {{correctly}} in a sentence three times.
