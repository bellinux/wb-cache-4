5|$|Marigene Butler, head {{conservator}} at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research project}} between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample of paint {{was taken from the}} seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure <b>ultramarine,</b> the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer of paint overlaid with hatching and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with <b>ultramarine</b> and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated {{date for the}} Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in the panel to highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, <b>ultramarine,</b> lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake. There has been some discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E
5|$|The time in Arles {{became one}} of Van Gogh's more {{prolific}} periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, <b>ultramarine</b> and mauve. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.|$|E

5|$|The mantle is a vestment or robe worn {{by members}} since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century {{it was made}} of velvet. The mantle was {{originally}} purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and <b>ultramarine.</b> Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The heraldic shield of St. George's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle, but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparable}} {{but even}} more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural <b>ultramarine</b> is in The Girl with a Wineglass. The shadows of the red satin dress are underpainted in natural <b>ultramarine,</b> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and vermilion mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common blue}} pigment was smalt, {{which was made}} by {{grinding}} blue cobalt glass into a fine powder. It made a deep violet blue similar to <b>ultramarine,</b> and was vivid in frescoes, but it {{lost some of its}} brilliance in oil paintings. It became especially popular in the 17th century, when <b>ultramarine</b> was difficult to obtain. It was employed at times by Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, El Greco, Van Dyck, Rubens and Rembrandt.|$|E

25|$|In 1824 the Societé pour l'Encouragement d'Industrie in France {{offered a}} prize for the {{invention}} of an artificial <b>ultramarine</b> which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli. The prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet, {{but he refused to}} reveal the formula of his colour. In 1828, another scientist, Christian Gmelin then a professor of chemistry in Tübingen, found the process and published his formula. This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial <b>ultramarine,</b> which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product.|$|E

25|$|The {{material}} {{composition of}} the 1893 painted version was examined in 2010. The pigment analysis revealed the use of cadmium yellow, vermilion, <b>ultramarine</b> and viridian among other pigments of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Besides <b>ultramarine,</b> {{several other}} blues were {{widely used in}} the Middle Ages {{and later in the}} Renaissance. Azurite, a form of copper carbonate, was often used as a {{substitute}} for <b>ultramarine.</b> The Romans used it under the name lapis armenius, or Armenian stone. The British called it azure of Amayne, or German azure. The Germans themselves called it bergblau, or mountain stone. It was mined in France, Hungary, Spain and Germany, and it made a pale blue with a hint of green, which was ideal for painting skies. It was a favourite background colour of the German painter Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
25|$|The {{pigments}} {{employed by}} the artist are consistent with his other works. He painted the triptych with ochres, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, carmine and azurite. The sole rather unusual pigment is natural <b>ultramarine</b> used in small quantities in Virgin's robe.|$|E

25|$|Han purple in its pure form is {{actually}} a dark blue, that is close to electric indigo. It is a purple {{in the way the}} term is used in colloquial English, i.e., it is a color between red and blue. It is not, however, a purple in the way the term is used in color theory, i.e. a nonspectral color between red and violet on the 'line of purples' on the CIE chromaticity diagram. Perhaps the most accurate designation for the color would be to call it 'Han indigo', although it could also be regarded as a bright shade of <b>ultramarine</b> (classifying <b>ultramarine</b> as a color and not a pigment).|$|E
25|$|U.S. Air Force (USAF) {{groups have}} the same National Colour as the Army; the Organizational Colour is <b>ultramarine</b> blue, with the group's coat of arms beneath the USAF crest, which is an eagle on a cloud background. The fringe is in gold.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{pigments}} {{were also}} traded over long distances. The {{only way to}} achieve a deep rich blue was by using a semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli, to produce a pigment known as <b>ultramarine,</b> and the best sources of lapis were remote. Flemish painter Jan van Eyck, working in the 15th century, did not ordinarily include blue in his paintings. To have one's portrait commissioned and painted with <b>ultramarine</b> blue was considered a great luxury. If a patron wanted blue, they were obliged to pay extra. When Van Eyck used lapis, he never blended it with other colors. Instead he applied it in pure form, almost as a decorative glaze. The prohibitive price of lapis lazuli forced artists to seek less expensive replacement pigments, both mineral (azurite, smalt) and biological (indigo).|$|E
