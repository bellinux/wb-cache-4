5000|$|... 3,4-Methylenedioxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine (MDDM) is a lesser-known {{psychedelic}} drug. It is {{also the}} N,N-dimethyl analog of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). MDDM was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved), the dosage is <b>unspecified</b> and the <b>duration</b> unknown. MDDM produces only mild effects that are not well characterized in PiHKAL. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MDDM. This compound is however occasionally encountered as an impurity in 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) which has been synthesized by methylation of MDA using methylating reagents such as methyl iodide. An excess of reagent or a reaction temperature that is too high results in some double methylation of the amine nitrogen, yielding MDDM as well as MDMA. The presence of MDDM as an impurity can thus reveal which synthetic route was used to manufacture seized samples of MDMA. MDDM {{is also known as}} MDMMA, or as [...] "sass" [...] on the streets. This is in reference to the sassafrass plant from which MDDM can be derived.|$|R

In 1661 students in 8 th- 10 th grade in twelve grammar schools in Munich, Germany information on vertigo/dizziness was assessed by a questionnaire in the class room setting. Three month prevalence of dizziness/vertigo was estimated; symptoms were categorized as orthostatic dizziness, spinning vertigo, swaying vertigo or <b>unspecified</b> dizziness. <b>Duration</b> of symptoms and impact on daily life activities were assessed. 72. 0 % (95 %-CI = [69. 8 - 74. 2]; N = 1196) of the students (mean age 14. 5 Â± 1. 1) reported to suffer from at least one episode of dizziness or vertigo {{in the last three}} months. Most adolescents ticked to have symptoms of orthostatic dizziness (52. 0 %, 95 %-CI = [49. 5 - 54. 4], N = 863). The period prevalence for the other types of vertigo were spinning vertigo: 11. 6 %, 95 %-CI = [10. 1 - 13. 3], N = 193; swaying vertigo: 12. 2 %, 95 %-CI = [10. 6 - 13. 8], N = 202; and unspecified dizziness: 15. 2 %, 95 %-CI = [13. 5 - 17. 1], N = 253. About 50 % of students with spinning vertigo and swaying vertigo also report to have orthostatic dizziness. Most vertigo/dizziness types were confined to less than one minute on average. The proportion of students with any dizziness/vertigo accounting for failure attending school, leisure activities or obliging them to stay in bed were more pronounced for spinning or swaying vertigo. Dizziness and vertigo in grammar school students appear to be as common as in adults. In face of the high period prevalence and clinical relevance of dizziness/vertigo in adolescents {{there is a need for}} prevention strategies.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{literature}} contains {{conflicting data}} about in vitro microleakage evaluations and their usefulness and reliability. No standardization {{has yet been}} established. Here we consider features of published studies that might affect {{the results of the}} in vitro microleakage tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 144 in vitro microleakage studies, published in 14 international reviews between 1992 and 1998, which comprised 917 sets or groups of experiments. The published studies were entered in a database and compared using selected literature criteria: sample, cavities, restoration procedures, thermocycling and mechanical cycling, evaluation method. RESULTS: The methods employed vary widely. The most frequent methodological choices (%) were (1) specimen storage after extraction: <b>duration</b> (<b>unspecified,</b> 59. 2), medium (distilled or deionized water, 33. 8), temperature (unspecified, 52. 2), additives (none, 47. 0); (2) aging method (79. 1) : duration before aging (< 24 h, 35. 9); medium and temperature of storage before aging (distilled or deionized water, 26. 8; 37 degrees C, 54. 3); (3) medium of cycling (tap water, 50. 5), number of cycles ([250 - 500], 34. 6), number of baths (2, 84. 0), bath temperature (5 degrees C to 55 degrees C, 60. 6), immersion dwell time (30 s, 44. 3); (4) tracer: type (basic fuchsin, 40. 7), time of immersion (after thermocycling and/or mechanical cycles, 64. 1), immersion duration (basic fuchsin: 24 h, 59. 5); assessment of dye penetration of sections (91. 7) : direction (perpendicular, 88. 5), number (1, 47. 1).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Extant {{research}} comparing laboratory pain {{responses of}} children with chronic pain with healthy controls is mixed, with some studies indicating lower pain responsivity for controls and others showing no differences. Few studies have included different pain modalities or assessment protocols. OBJECTIVES: To compare pain responses among 26 children (18 girls) with chronic pain and matched controls (mean age 14. 8 years), to laboratory tasks involving thermal heat, pressure and cold pain. Responses to cold pain were assessed using two different protocols: an initial trial of <b>unspecified</b> <b>duration</b> and a second trial of specified duration. METHODS: Four trials of pressure pain and of thermal heat pain stimuli, all of <b>unspecified</b> <b>duration,</b> were administered, {{as well as the}} two cold pain trials. Heart rate and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and after completion of the pain tasks. RESULTS: Pain tolerance and pain intensity did not differ between children with chronic pain and controls for the unspecified trials. For the specified cold pressor trial, 92 % {{of children with}} chronic pain completed the entire trial compared with only 61. 5 % of controls. Children with chronic pain exhibited a trend toward higher baseline and postsession heart rate and reported more anxiety and depression symptoms compared with control children. CONCLUSIONS: Contextual factors related to the fixed trial may have exerted a greater influence on pain tolerance in children with chronic pain relative to controls. Children with chronic pain demonstrated a tendency toward increased arousal in anticipation of and following pain induction compared with controls...|$|E

The analysis shows that temporary employment is a stepping-stone to a permanent job. In addition, temporary employees work less than their permanent counterparts with reference to working time, which decreased their potential wages. From another hand, past unemployment episodes are likely to reduce considerably the chance of being re-employed on a permanent work arrangement. Finally, compared to other work arrangements, temporary employment is more often devoted to immigrant workers while national citizens {{are more likely to}} hold part time jobs.

While the firing costs literature would suggest that employment should fall following implementation of a heightened discharge standard, the contrary result in Montana is likely due to important procedural and other limitations imposed by the new statute on discharged employeesâ legal recourse...|$|E

In total, 31 tasks were identified and 209 samples collected. The work is allied to an epidemiological study of workers in these plants and the implication is that 'peak ' exposures, as described by task-based sampling, may be implicated in causing respiratory symptoms. The reported task geometric mean concentrations varied greatly. The lowest total inhalable dust concentrations were approximately 1 mg m~ 3 while the highest were around 100 mg m~ 3.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of a widely used approach, known as stated preference discrete choice experiments, to estimate the value of personal information in three real-life contexts and situations. The paper develops three experiments describing hypothetical situations in which respondents considered varying aspects of their personal information (e. g. storage, sharing with third parties) when (a) purchasing online a product, (b) a service or (c) conducting pure search online. The survey was carried out with sample quotas pre-specified in order to match the profile of the Internetuser population in the UK with respect to gender, age group, geographical area of residence and personal annual income. The results from the experiment provide new insights in the value and influence of attributes of personal information when conducting online transactions. In particular, main results show that there was little interest by respondents to pay in order to introduce control over their personal data, that the extend of sharing of personal information with third parties was seen the most important aspect when choosing online retailers and search engines, and that an <b>unspecified</b> <b>duration</b> of data storage was received as badly as the data storage beyond several years for online retailers and worse than shorter durations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of temporary employment in 19 European countries {{using data from the}} European Social Survey. The analysis shows that temporary employment is more feminized. Fixed term employment appears conversely connected with the age, which supports the fact that temporary employment seems to become the stepping stone to permanent jobs. In addition, temporary employees appear to work less than permanent workers with reference to working time, which reduced relatively their potential wages. Moreover, the probability of being in a fixed term contract is negatively correlated with the trade-union membership. However, non-permanent workers seem to be more favourable than permanent employees for the necessity of having strong trade unions, even if atypical employment is often associated with a less trade-union presence on the place of work. From another hand, past unemployment is likely to reduce considerably the chance to be re-employed on a contract of <b>unspecified</b> <b>duration.</b> Finally, estimates from a bivariate probit show that part time employment concerns more frequently citizens of the country while fixed term employment is more devoted to immigrants. However, some points of convergence characterize part-time and fixed-termâ contracts. Women are more frequently associated with these two kinds of flexibility. Nonetheless, part-time employment is more feminized than fixed-term contract. Age acts in the same sense, but fixed-term workers are younger than part-time workers.

40|$|Background Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) are characterised by {{impairments in}} communication and reciprocal social interaction. These impairments can impact on relationships with family members, augment stress and frustration, {{and contribute to}} behaviours that {{can be described as}} challenging. Family members of individuals with ASD can experience high rates of carer stress and burden, and poor parental efficacy. While there is evidence to suggest that individuals with ASD and family members derive benefit from psychological interventions designed to reduce stress and mental health morbidity, and enhance coping, most studies to date have targeted the needs of either individuals with ASD, or family members. We wanted to examine whether family (systemic) therapy, aimed at enhancing communication, relationships or coping, is effective for individuals with ASD and their wider family network. Objectives To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of family therapy as a treatment to enhance communication or coping for individuals with ASD and their family members. If possible, we will also seek to establish the economic costs associated with family therapy for this clinical population. Search methods On 16 January 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and two trials registers.
