5|$|Although Beebe and {{his team}} enjoyed {{rewarding}} seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. The reason they gave in their annual report was that the previous two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to analyze it, but in reality this was more the result of insufficient funding {{as well as the}} <b>unstable</b> <b>state</b> of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a comprehensive study of the area's ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area's politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in hope of finding a site for a research station where the politics would be more secure. Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état installed Marcos Pérez Jiménez as Venezuela's dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela. Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book High Jungle, which was the last of Beebe's major books.|$|E
5|$|While no new locales were {{introduced}} in Episode One, large alterations {{were made to the}} appearance of both City 17 where the game takes place and the Citadel from the end of Half-Life 2 to reflect the changing shape of the world and remind the player that their actions have major effects on the story line. The Citadel has degenerated from the cold, alien, and imposing fortress of the previous game into an extremely <b>unstable</b> <b>state.</b> This provides a visual cue to the player of the catastrophic damage they inflicted, and it allows for the introduction of new gameplay elements that accentuate the dangers which come with the Citadel's imminent collapse. In addition, it serves a thematic purpose by highlighting the weakening of the Combine's dominance in City 17. Likewise, City 17 has been altered to reflect the aftermath of the resistance's open rebellion, with vast swathes of destroyed buildings, and the introduction of foes previously kept outside its confines in Half-Life 2 to emphasize the scale of the uprising.|$|E

For systems with short-range interaction {{the transition}} between metastable and <b>unstable</b> <b>states</b> has been thought of as gradual. We show evidence, that one can define a sharp border between the two regions. We have analysed the lifetimes of states by considering the relaxation trajectories following a quench.

Using the limit of stability we define a line similar to a spinodal in the two-phase region...|$|R

The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.|$|E

The key questions here are to identify which {{parts of the brain}} are involved in sleep onset and what their mechanisms of action are. In humans and most animals sleep and wakefulness seems to follow an electronic flip-flop model i.e. both states are stable, but the intermediate states are not. Of course, unlike in the flip-flop, in the case of sleep, {{there seems to be a}} timer ticking away from the minute of waking so that after a certain period one must sleep, and in such a case even waking becomes an <b>unstable</b> <b>state.</b> The reverse may also be true to a lesser extent.|$|E

25|$|Neutral {{buoyancy}} in a diver is an <b>unstable</b> <b>state.</b> It {{is changed}} by small differences in ambient pressure {{caused by a}} change in depth, and the change has a positive feedback effect. A small descent will increase the pressure, which will compress the gas filled spaces and reduce the total volume of diver and equipment. This will further reduce the buoyancy, and unless counteracted, will result in sinking more rapidly. The equivalent effect applies to a small ascent, which will trigger an increased buoyancy and will result in accelerated ascent unless counteracted. The diver must continuously adjust buoyancy or depth {{in order to remain}} neutral. Fine control of buoyancy can be achieved by controlling the average lung volume in open circuit scuba, but this feature is not available to the closed circuit rebreather diver, as exhaled gas remains in the breathing loop. This is a skill which improves with practice until it becomes second nature.|$|E

30|$|To obtain new {{information}} about the mechanical and physical properties of dry wood in <b>unstable</b> <b>states,</b> the influence of heating history on viscoelastic properties and dimensional changes of dry wood in the radial, tangential, and longitudinal directions was studied between 100 ° and 200 °C. <b>Unstable</b> <b>states</b> of dry wood still existed after heating at 105 °C for 30 min and were modified by activated molecular motion in the first heating process to temperatures above 105 °C. This phenomenon {{is thought to be}} caused by the <b>unstable</b> <b>states</b> reappearing after wetting and drying again. Dry wood components did not completely approach the stable state in the temperature range tested, because they did not entirely surpass the glass transition temperatures in most of the temperature range. In constant temperature processes at 135 ° and 165 °C, E′ increased and E″ decreased with time regardless of the direction. This indicated that the <b>unstable</b> <b>states</b> of dry wood components were gradually modified with time at constant temperatures. On the other hand, anisotropy of dimensional change existed and dimension increased in the longitudinal direction, was unchanged in the radial direction, and decreased in the tangential direction with time at constant temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Several {{papers have}} {{recognized}} the effect of uncertainties in voltage stability analysis through probabilistic methods.

The main aim {{of this paper is to}} include <b>unstable</b> <b>states</b> caused by unsolvability and voltage controllability loss in the voltage stability probabilistic assessment. This goal is achieved through the combination of three techniques: the Monte Carlo Simulation Method, the nonlinear optimal power flow and the D’ matrix method.

The T-matrix for eta- 4 He scattering is evaluated within the Finite Rank Approximation (FRA) of few body equations. For the evaluation of time delay in the eta-d case, we use a parameterization of an existing Faddeev calculation and compare the results with those obtained from FRA. With an eta-N scattering length, a_η N = (0. 42, 0. 34) fm, we find an eta-d <b>unstable</b> bound <b>state</b> around - 16 MeV, within the Faddeev calculation.

40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of three stabilization mechanisms of <b>unstable</b> <b>states</b> of physical systems {{is presented in}} this review. These mechanisms are: the quantum Zeno effect, the stabilization of <b>unstable</b> <b>states</b> in an external fast oscillating field (i. e. the Kapitza pendulum), and the mechanism named as the spinning top mechanism. The common features of these mechanisms, {{as well as the}} differences between them, are analyzed in the paper. In particular, it is shown that the stabilization of quantum systems is possible without involvement of such concept as the collapse of wave function. For stabilization it is sufficient to have a stabilizing radiation flow with the Rabi frequency of transitions exceeding some frequency. This frequency is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state under stabilization. It is shown that the Top principle allows stabilizing unstable systems using affecting only those states to which these systems must go over. It is shown that stabilization of <b>unstable</b> <b>states</b> by impact of rapidly oscillating forces occurs by non-self-consistent exposure, i. e. the dynamics of stabilizing field is independent on the dynamics of the stabilized state. Stabilization using the spinning top principle involves self-consistent forces, and thus, in many cases can be the most effective mechanism of stabilization. Comment: 47 pages; 10 figure...|$|R
