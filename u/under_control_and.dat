5|$|Optimus awakens to {{find that}} three weeks have passed, {{and in that time}} Cybertron has been reformatted into a {{primordial}} state, Megatron is missing while the Decepticons that formed the Deceptigod have been fitted with explosive microchips to keep them <b>under</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> many unaligned Cybertronians (referred to as NAILs and led by former Autobot Metalhawk) have returned and are demanding the exile of both the Autobots and Decepticons so that they can have the planet for themselves. With the Matrix now emptied of all its power, Optimus decides to go by his old name of Orion Pax, and agrees to leave Cybertron forever in exchange for the Autobots being allowed to stay.|$|E
5|$|Reshef maneuvered his brigade as planned, {{entering}} into the previously discovered gap without any opposition. Leaving a combined recon and paratrooper {{force at the}} canal, he sent his tanks north and west to secure the flank of the projected crossing site and clear the Akavish and Tirtur roads from behind for the follow-on bridging equipment. He seized the Lakekan and Matzmed fortifications without resistance. Reshef informed Sharon that the forts were <b>under</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> that Akavish was clear. Sharon in turn informed Southern Command of these successes, sending a wave of jubilation through the Israeli commanders, delighted that the operation had begun so smoothly.|$|E
5|$|The Latvian {{government}} took {{a number of}} steps {{in order to try}} to bring the situation <b>under</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> in 2006 not only were the events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an announcement by Riga city council, for restoration. The monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work. Therefore, the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech. The unapproved events took place despite the ban. On November 23, 2006, the law requiring the approval of the authorities for public gatherings was ruled unconstitutional. In the future years the government mobilized the police force to guard the neighborhood of the monument and the events were relatively peaceful.|$|E

5|$|When news of {{the attack}} reached California, the US War Department decided to {{establish}} a military fort at Beale's Crossing to keep the Mohave <b>under</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> secure white travelers safe passage through Mohave lands. On December 26, 1858, Hoffman and fifty dragoons from Fort Tejon were dispatched to cross the desert and confront the Mohave. Irataba attempted to arrange a peaceful meeting, but Hoffman ordered his troops to fire on the warriors, who counterattacked and repelled the force. He returned in April 1859, by way of Fort Yuma, with four companies of the 6th Infantry Regiment. When they arrived at Beale's Crossing, the Mohave decided against attacking the army of five hundred soldiers. On April 23, at Hoffman's request, he and his officers met with several hundred Mohave warriors and their leaders. The indigenous leaders included Cairook, Irataba, Homoseh quahote (also called Seck-a-hoot and Asika hota), and Pascual, leader of the Quechan. During the meeting the Mohave were surrounded by armed soldiers who prevented them from leaving.|$|E
