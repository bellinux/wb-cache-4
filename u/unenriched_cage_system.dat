30|$|The {{transport}} {{of the laboratory}} animals to the research facility, the new environment and personnel all cause stress to the animals, which potentially influences {{the results of an}} experiment. For this and for reasons of animal welfare, animals should in general be transported to the facility about 1  week before the experiment. Regarding their housing, an enriched environment not only is less stressful to the animals than an <b>unenriched</b> <b>cage</b> but may also give more reproducible results [13]. Enrichment refers mainly to refugees and bedding and nesting material. Bored animals in an <b>unenriched</b> <b>cage</b> often develop stereotypic behaviour. This is repetitive activities at short intervals, and it would come as a surprise if neurotransmitter signalling—the target of most neuroimaging projects—would not be affected in one or the other way in bored animals and animals with stereotypic behaviour. In fact, housing in isolation affects the cognitive function of an animal and is even used as a model of depression in research [14, 15]. According to the animal welfare legislation, the isolated housing of an animal must be avoided if it is not required for a defined reason. However, mixing animals from different cages or any stressful event can result in harmful hierarchy fights, in particular, between males, again, potentially influencing an imaging experiment. The animals should thus be housed in stable groups in enriched cages, taking into account the minimal space requirements for their well-being. The required minimal available space per animal and maximal number of animals per cage are defined in national and European Union (EU) regulations and guidelines. Appendix A (Guidelines for accommodation and care of animals—Article 5 of the convention) to the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (ETS No 123) contains tables with information of minimal floor area and cage height besides many more useful information regarding animal housing and animal welfare in general. Using larger cages than the recommended minimal size allows more and diverse enrichment and finally better imitating the natural environment of the animals.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{selected}} enterprise indicators of laying were analyzed {{in terms of}} the impact of a hen housing system. For commercial egg production in the enterprise the laying hybrid Lohmann brown-LITE hen has been used since 2011. A total of 16 laying turns were included for the observation during the period of 20112014. Due to the sufficient number of data a nine-month laying batch has been chosen. The highest average number of eggs laid by one hen for the observation period was achieved in the Profit-Tier Layer <b>Cage</b> <b>System</b> by Big Dutchman (257. 0 pcs.). In the Laying battery <b>Cage</b> <b>System</b> by Kovobel the number of eggs was by 1. 3 pcs lower (255. 7 pcs). The lowest number of eggs was set down for laying hens kept in a <b>cage</b> free <b>systems</b> (249. 2 pcs). It was 7, 8 pcs and 6, 5 pcs lower respectively than with laying hens housed in the <b>cage</b> <b>systems</b> by Big Dutchman and Kovobel. The highest average intensity of laying for 9 -month laying period was found in the <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> by Big Dutchman (93. 9 %). In the <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> by Kovobel company it was 1. 0 % lower (92. 9 %). The intensity of laying at a <b>cage</b> free <b>system</b> amounted to 89. 2 % pcs. It was 4. 7 % and 3. 7 % respectively lower than when housed in the <b>cage</b> <b>systems</b> by Big Dutchman and Kovobel.

40|$|People’s affective or {{emotional}} state can alter their cognitive processing, biasing interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Those {{in a more}} positive state interpret such stimuli in a more optimistic manner than those in a negative state. Recently this research has extended to animals, and has shown that manipulations associated with negative affect cause animals to interpret ambiguous stimuli more pessimistically. We investigated whether exposure to environmental enrichment engenders optimistic responses to ambiguous stimuli. Rats, Rattus norvegicus, were trained on a novel conditional discrimination task whereby they learned the correct response necessary to obtain a food reward given the stimulus present during approach (rough or smooth sandpaper). One stimulus {{was associated with a}} higher-value reward than the other. Once the rats were trained, cognitive bias was probed by exploring their responses to an ambiguous stimulus (intermediate grade of sandpaper); a rat was defined as optimistic if it chose the response appropriate to the stimulus associated with the better reward. Animals transferred from <b>unenriched</b> to enriched <b>cages</b> showed more optimistic responses following the change. A control group maintained in <b>unenriched</b> <b>cages</b> showed pessimistic responses throughout. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} environmental enrichment can induce an optimistic cognitive bias in rats previously housed in standard caging, possibly indicative of a more positive affective state. These results add support to the suggestion that measuring cognitive biases can give an insight into animal emotional states; this has implications for animal welfare and preclinical testing of potential therapeutics for mood disorders...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{mariculture}} {{is gaining}} more attention as {{expansion of the}} nearshore aquaculture, led by increasing demand for food fish, is faced with stiff resistance from other nearshore stakeholders, including the environmentalists. Due to the necessity to move into offshore waters for aquaculture, single point mooring (SPM) fish cage concepts in offshore mariculture are presently being considered as viable candidates for achieving such an objective. Economic and environmental advantages over the traditional grid mooring systems have been reported for SPM cages. In addition, from an engineering point of view {{the ability of the}} SPM <b>cage</b> <b>systems</b> to align with the prevailing current or weather direction implies a smaller projected area, and correspondingly, a reduction of environmental loads and stresses which are associated with the mooring components. Harnessing these advantages of the SPM cage concept, during the PhD research work outlined in this thesis, a SPM cage concept that allows selfsubmergence was developed. This new design concept offers to minimize the complexity and operating costs compared to existing SPM concepts that require ballasting and de-ballasting manually or through automatic control systems for submergence or surfacing. Since the success of such a system depends on the operational performance in the offshore environment, the submergence characteristics of the self-submersible SPM <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> were analyzed through numerical simulations to show its effectiveness in relation to regular waves with following and oblique current directions. Regular as well as random wave cases were analyzed. Subsequently scaled physical model testing was conducted in order to verify the results from the numerical simulations with focus on the submergence characteristics of the self-submersible SPM <b>cage</b> <b>system.</b> The numerical simulations performed during the PhD research showed that the self-submersible SPM <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> responded effectively to increasing wave heights, by submerging deeper for increasing wave heights for a given current speed. It was found that the system is tuned-in to a particular (or a range of) intermediate wave heights and current levels in the sense that more pronounced submergence was observed for these loading conditions. By changing the reserve buoyancy of the <b>cage</b> <b>system,</b> the behavior could be manipulated in order to achieve a certain level of submergence. In random waves the submergence characteristics of the <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> were less effective than in regular wave cases. However, whether in regular waves with following currents, regular waves with oblique currents or in random waves with following currents, the self-submersible SPM <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> responded with additional submergence for increasing wave heights. In all the simulations and model tests, the <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> was found to be very stable and reaching equilibrium at a depth corresponding to the applied loading conditions. Although the scaled physical model and test conditions did not exactly match those of the numerical and the associated response simulations, the general trends of submergence characteristics of the self-submersible SPM cage concept were well captured by the experiments. Therefore, the numerical simulation results were verified, and the self-submersible SPM <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> is shown to have a potential for being used for the purpose of offshore mariculture.

One hundred ninety-two 1 -d-old non-beak-trimmed Hy-Line W- 36 White Leghorn chicks were reared using standard management practices in raised wire cages. At 19 wk of age, the birds were randomly assigned into battery cages or furnished cages. The battery cages were commercial wire cages containing 6 birds per cage, providing 645 cm 2 of floor space per birds. The furnished cages had wire floors and solid metal walls, with perches, a dustbathing area, scratch pads, and a nestbox area with a concealment curtain. Based on the company recommendations, 10 birds were housed per cage, providing a stocking den-sity of 610 cm 2 of floor space per bird. Behavioral ob-servations were conducted using the Noldus Observer software package. The birds were observed at 5 -min intervals for the entire light period. The birds housed in battery cages had higher posture and behavioral transi-tions and increased time spent walking and perform-ing exploratory behavior (P < 0. 05, 0. 01, respective-ly), which may indicate they were stressed, resulting in restlessness, whereas the birds housed in furnished cages had higher levels of preening (P < 0. 05). Preen-ing has been considered as a comfort behavior in birds. These results may suggest that furnished cages may be a favorable alternative system for housing birds by al-lowing them to perform certain natural behaviors.

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{the welfare of}} laying hens {{have led to the}} ban of conventional battery cages in Europe from 2012 onward and to the development of alternative housing systems that allow hens to perform a broader range of natural behaviors. Limited information is available about the consequences of alternative housing systems on transmission of zoonotic pathogens such as Salmonella Enteritidis. However, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis continues {{to be one of the}} leading causes of bacterial foodborne disease worldwide and this is mainly attributed to the consumption of contaminated eggs. A transmission experiment was performed to quantify the effect of the housing system on the spread of a Salmonella Enteritidis infection within a group of layers and on internal egg contamination. At the age of 16 wk, 126 birds housed on the floor were inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis. Three weeks later, the inoculated hens were housed together with equal numbers of susceptible contact animals in 4 different housing systems: a conventional <b>cage</b> <b>system,</b> a furnished <b>cage,</b> an aviary, and a floor system. Transmission and egg contamination were followed during a 4 -wk period.

40|$|The ban on {{the battery}} <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> in the European Union after 2012, mainly due to {{impaired}} hen welfare, forces farmers to change to alternative housing systems for laying hens.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess the EES performance of the battery <b>cage</b> <b>system,</b> and of the three most prevalent alternative housing systems in the Netherlands (i. e., the deep litter system with and without outdoor run, and the aviary system with outdoor run). To asses the EES performance of different egg production systems, the following indicators were quantified: labour income per full time equivalent; land and fossil energy use per kg egg produced; acidification, eutrophication and global warming per kg egg produced; animal needs index; mortality rate (21 - 68 wks); medicine use; deviations from the production curve; % farmers with physical complaints; % of second quality of eggs; and the Salmonella enteritidis status of the flock. In 2004, data were collected by visiting 16 farms with battery cages, 15 with a deep litter system without outdoor run, 17 with a deep litter system with outdoor run and 13 with an aviary system with outdoor run. Data were analysed statistically to reveal significant differences among production systems. Economic performance was best in the aviary system, whereas the battery <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> resulted in the best environmental performance. As expected, prerequisites to express natural behaviour were better in alternative systems, especially if hens had access to an outdoor run. On the other hand, alternative systems seem to run a risk for a higher mortality rate due to, e. g., cannibalism or a higher disease incidence. Between farm variation in mortality rate was high, consequently differences among systems were not significant. This large variation, however, also implies potential for improvement. Physical complaints of farmers and egg quality did not differ among production systems.

They allow {{easy access to the}} animal and can be adequately disinfected. These cages can be individually locked and also allow for full viewing of the animal...|$|R

These highly restrictive <b>cage</b> <b>systems</b> and {{the low level of}} skilled husbandry can lead {{to a wide range of}} welfare concerns including physical injuries, pain, severe mental stress and muscle atrophy. Some bears are caught as cubs and may be kept in these conditions for over 20 years.|$|R
