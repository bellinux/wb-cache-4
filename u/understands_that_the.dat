25|$|ThunderClan {{medicine}} cat apprentice Jaypaw finds a washed-up stick {{when he is}} out gathering herbs {{with his}} mentor, Leafpool. It has odd scratches on it; some that are crossed out and some that are not. As he struggles {{to figure out what}} it means, he has a dream in which he experiences what Fallen Leaves experienced. Jaypaw then <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scratches record ancient cats who undertook the trial in the tunnels and that the last uncrossed one was Fallen Leaves' mark, indicating that he did not emerge.|$|E

He returns to his village, where he again encourages Fist and Broken Leg who unite and travel to the base at Devils Crag. Athos now <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> villages will disappear because of Overcoming (the process led by the Glorious Helpmates) and wants to prevent this mass murder. Broken Leg does not want Athos to go since he believes Athos will die. In the entire section of the novel, there is almost not a single object iⱱn the forest {{that is not a}} mutable living thing. One can grow clothing from the forest, eat the ground itself as a meal, and so on.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} book, Voldemort seeks the wand {{in order to}} defeat Harry – his {{previous}} wands having failed – and breaks into Dumbledore's tomb to claim the wand as his own. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wand is not performing for him as legend says it should, and mistakenly concludes this is because it had become loyal to Snape when Snape killed Dumbledore, and would only become loyal to him upon his killing of Snape. He therefore kills Snape, and believes the wand will thereafter serve him and be unbeatable, but during his final duel with Harry his Killing Curse rebounds and he dies – as Harry had warned him – since the Elder Wand will not allow itself {{to be used by}} him against its true master.|$|E

Robert Rozett, head librarian at Yad Vashem and author of the entry on the [...] "Auschwitz Report" [...] in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, said of the Vrba controversy in 2005: [...] "There are people who come into the subject from a certain angle and think that they've uncovered the truth.

He played with his rock band at the event. Upon his entrance, Charlie Cook of The Cook Political Report rated McCotter's chances of nomination as [...] "virtually impossible". CBS News and other outlets commented on McCotter's lack of name recognition and described him as a [...] "little-known" [...] candidate. Nevertheless, the Free Press noted he had about $480,000 available in his congressional account to transfer to his presidential campaign account. Political communications operative Mark Corallo was hired along with a core group of advisers that included former Senator Bill Frist's chief of staff Eric Uelind, and former Iowa representative Christopher Rants.|$|E

[...] Through his teachings, Jonathan <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spirit cannot be really free without the ability to forgive, and that the way to {{progress}} leads—for him, at least—through becoming a teacher, not just through working hard as a student. Jonathan returns to the Breakfast Flock to share his newly discovered ideals and the recent tremendous experience, ready for the difficult fight against the current rules of that society. The ability to forgive seems to be a mandatory [...] "passing condition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bartlett's last {{published}} book of poetry, Around the Clock, {{appeared in}} 1989. Maxine Kumin commended {{the book with}} these words: [...] "Elizabeth Bartlett enumerates the eternal questions that preoccupy us 'while we try to sleep / on the rough floor of our hearts.' In the strictest of forms , she examines the human condition; the poetry is pitiless, yet redemptive." [...] Similarly, Josephine Jacobsen praised this work: [...] "Elizabeth Bartlett <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very large and the very small are siblings. Perceptive and emotionally vital, her poems ask all our own questions, poems in an original and lucid form." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Andrews {{acknowledges}} the metaphorical use {{of legal and}} financial imagery like Vendler and Booth. However he proposes further that the legal and financial imagery, along with a [...] "coolly ironic" [...] tone, disguises the speaker's true feelings which only fully appear in the couplet: [...] "Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,/ In sleep a king, but waking no such matter." [...] The couplet reveals that the speaker <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young man never fully gave himself. In this interpretation the legal and financial imagery of the three quatrains are more self-protective than sincere.|$|E

2500|$|After {{hearing that}} the people {{recorded}} on previous experiments are dead, one of the tourists guesses correctly they will die, too. The meeting ends abruptly as Morel leaves in anger. The fugitive picks up Morel's cue cards and learns the machine keeps running because the wind and tide feed it with an endless supply of kinetic energy. He <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> phenomena of the two suns and two moons are a consequence {{of what happens when}} the recording overlaps reality [...] one is the real sun and the other one represents the sun's position at recording time.

2500|$|At an evidentiary {{hearing in}} the federal {{district}} court, four experts testified on Panetti's behalf. One expert opined that Panetti suffered from schizo-affective disorder, resulting in a genuine delusion regarding {{the reason for his}} execution. The expert stated that Panetti believed that his execution was part of [...] "spiritual warfare" [...] between the [...] "demons and the forces of the darkness and God and the angels and the forces of light." [...] Panetti <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> State claims it is executing him for the murders, but believes that the State's reason is a sham and the real reason is that the State wants to stop Panetti from preaching. Panetti's other experts testified to similar conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|The eponymous {{celestial}} being, {{also referred}} to as [...] "Hyperion", is widely identified as Eminescu's alter ego; he combines elements of fallen angels, daimons, incubi, but is neither mischievous nor purposefully seductive. His daily mission on the firmament is interrupted by the lustful calls of Princess Cătălina, who asks for him to [...] "glide down" [...] and become her mate. He is persuaded by her to relinquish his immortality, which would require approval from a third protagonist, the Demiurge. The Morning Star seeks the Demiurge {{at the edge of the}} Universe, but only receives a revelation of mankind's irrelevancy. In his brief absence, the Princess is seduced by a fellow mortal. As he returns to his place in the sky, Hyperion <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Demiurge was right.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike computers, humans {{excel at}} {{this type of}} task. While {{segmentation}} and recognition are two separate processes necessary for understanding an image for a computer, {{they are part of}} the same process for a person. [...] For example, when an individual <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first letter of a CAPTCHA is an “a”, that individual also understands where the contours of that “a” are, and also where it melds with the contours of the next letter. [...] Additionally, the human brain is capable of dynamic thinking based upon context. It is able to keep multiple explanations alive and then pick the one that is the best explanation for the whole input based upon contextual clues. This also means it will not be fooled by variations in letters.|$|E

His insubordination {{to the government and}} his radical views on property were made explicit when he refused to help out against the deserters attacking Soroca.

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the song, {{as well as the}} album, was positive. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "fairly peppy for a PJ Harvey song about murder" [...] and rated it three stars out of five. In Pitchfork Media's review of Let England Shake, Scott Plagenhoef stated that [...] "Harvey blackly and comically shakes her head at those post-WWI diplomatic hopes" [...] and described it as [...] "a hilariously depressing coda; her song's character has experienced the unimaginable and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help." [...] Plagenhoef also cited it as the album's key song, alongside [...] "Written on the Forehead." [...] The Guardian described the song as [...] "a masterstroke" [...] and stated [...] "Harvey clearly <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> horror doesn't really need embellishing: her way sounds infinitely more shocking and affecting than all the machine-gun sound effects in the world." [...] Patti Smith, to whom Harvey has been compared in the past by critics, hailed the single. Speaking to The Guardian in January 2011, Smith said: [...] "It just makes me happy to exist. Whenever anyone does something of worth, including myself, it just makes me happy to be alive. So I listened to that song all morning, totally happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The postmodern view of Cleopatra is complex. Doris Adler {{suggests}} that, in {{a postmodern}} philosophical sense, we cannot begin {{to grasp the}} character of Cleopatra because, [...] "In a sense it is a distortion to consider Cleopatra at any moment apart from the entire cultural milieu that creates and consumes Antony and Cleopatra on stage. However the isolation and microscopic examination of a single aspect apart from its host environment {{is an effort to}} improve the understanding of the broader context. In similar fashion, the isolation and examination of the stage image of Cleopatra becomes an attempt to improve the understanding of the theatrical power of her infinite variety and the cultural treatment of that power." [...] So, as a microcosm, Cleopatra can be understood within a postmodern context, as long as one <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> purpose for the examination of this microcosm is to further one's own interpretation of the work as a whole. Author L.T. Fitz believes that {{it is not possible to}} derive a clear, postmodern view of Cleopatra due to the sexism that all critics bring with them when they review her intricate character. He states specifically, [...] "Almost all critical approaches to this play have been coloured by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading." [...] One seemingly anti-sexist viewpoint comes from Donald C. Freeman's articulations of the meaning and significance of the deaths of both Antony and Cleopatra at the end of the play. Freeman states, [...] "We understand Antony as a grand failure because the container of his Romanness [...] "dislimns": it can no longer outline and define him even to himself. Conversely, we understand Cleopatra at her death as the transcendent queen of [...] "immortal longings" [...] because the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her: unlike Antony, she never melts, but sublimates from her very earthly flesh to ethereal fire and air." ...|$|E
