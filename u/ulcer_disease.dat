5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>disease</b> and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>disease</b> (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>disease.</b> Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>disease</b> or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E

40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} and cigarette smoking are two etiologic {{factors that have}} {{a close relationship with}} peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases.</b> Chronic active gastritis is reportedly associated with chronic alcohol ingestion. Nonetheless, the inflammatory changes are likely to be related to concurrent Helicobacter pylori infection that is common among alcoholics. Moreover, chronic alcoholism is also correlated with the presence of gastric metaplasia. Both clinically and experimentally, alcohol had been shown to affect the mucosal barrier and histology. These ulcerogenic effects {{play a crucial role in}} altering gastric mucosal defense mechanisms. Cigarette smoking is coupled with the initiation and prolongation of gastric ulcers. Epidemiologic data show that cigarette smoking increases both the incidence and relapse rate of peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases</b> and also delays ulcer healing in humans. Retrospective studies also indicate that cigarette smoking is a key factor in inducing <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases</b> rather than a linked behavior. The general detrimental effects of cigarette smoking in the gastric mucosa include reduction of circulating epidermal growth factor, increase in tissue free radical production and the presence of free radicals in smoke, together with reduction of mucosal constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity. Furthermore, the alteration of normal gastric mucosal blood flow and angiogenesis and the suppression of cell proliferation contribute largely to the delay in ulcer healing in cigarette smokers. Concurrent consumption of alcohol and cigarette smoking significantly increases the risk of gastric ulcers. In animal experiments, cigarette smoking potentiated ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage. The reduction of mucus secretion, increase in leukotriene B 4 level, increased activities of inducible nitric oxide synthase, xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase, and the expression of adhesion molecules in the gastric mucosa accompanied such potentiating effects. Substances other than nicotine in cigarette smoke may also contribute to the above effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} of Helicobacter pylori eradication with {{the occurrence of}} renal dysfunction in patients with peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases</b> is still unclear. This study aimed to clarify the relevance of H. pylori eradication to the occurrence of chronic kidney diseases in patients with peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases.</b> Data that were available from 2000 - 2011 were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, and all patients with peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases</b> (n = 208 196) were screened for eligibility. We divided randomly selected patients into an H. pylori eradication cohort (cohort A, n = 3593) and matched them by age and sex to a without H. pylori eradication cohort (cohort B, n = 3593). Subgroup analysis was further performed for H. pylori eradication within ≤ 90 days of the diagnosis date (early eradication, n = 2837) and within 91 - 365 days (non-early eradication, n = 756). Cox proportional hazards regression {{analysis was used to}} estimate the {{association of}} H. pylori eradication with the risk of developing chronic kidney diseases and mortality. We observed that there were more patients suffering from chronic kidney disease in cohort B than in the early eradication subgroup of cohort A (8. 49 % vs. 6. 70 %, respectively, p = 0. 0075); the mortality rate was also higher in cohort B (4. 76 % vs. 3. 70 %, respectively, p = 0. 0376). Old age, pulmonary disease, connective tissue disorders, and diabetes were risk factors for chronic kidney diseases but early H. pylori eradication was a protective factor against chronic kidney diseases (hazard ratio: 0. 68, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 52 - 0. 88, p = 0. 0030), and death (hazard ratio: 0. 69, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 49 - 0. 96, p = 0. 0297). In conclusion, our findings have important implications suggesting that early H. pylori eradication is mandatory since it is associated with a protective role against the occurrence of chronic kidney diseases...|$|R

25|$|Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of {{more than}} half of the world's population, and the {{infection}} continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastroduodenal diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with Helicobacter pylori results in the development of chronic gastritis in infected individuals, and in a subset of patients chronic gastritis progresses to complications (e.g., <b>ulcer</b> <b>disease,</b> stomach cancers, some distinct extragastric disorders).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze cagA and vacA genotypes status in H. pylori isolates and relationship with clinical outcomes. Methods: Gastric biopsy specimens were cultured for H. pylori isolation and cagA and vacA genes were detected in these isolates. Data were collected and the results were analyzed using χ 2 and Fishers exact tests by SPSS software version. 16. Results: Of the total 115 H. pylori isolates, 79 (68. 7 %) were cagA positive and 82 (71. 3 %) of isolates contained the s 1 allele which 33 (28. 7 %) were subtype s 2. s 1 m 2 was the most frequent vacA allelic combination in the H. pylori isolates examined (63 cases), followed by s 2 m 2 (31 cases), s 1 m 1 (19 cases) and s 2 m 1 (2 case). Strains cagA positive were more frequent in peptic <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases</b> patients than non <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases</b> patients, as 47 (59. 5 %) and 32 (40. 5 %), while cagA negative were low, as 15 (41. 7 %) and 21 (58. 3 %), respectively.

Overall, in the present study, vacA s 1 /m 2, cagA-positive strains were predominant irrespective of clinical outcome, but s 2 /m 1 was rare...|$|R
50|$|João Dinis de Sousa, Viktor Müller, Philippe Lemey, and Anne-Mieke Vandamme {{proposed}} that HIV became epidemic through sexual serial transmission, in nascent colonial cities, {{helped by a}} high frequency of genital ulcers, caused by genital <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases</b> (GUD). GUD are simply sexually transmitted diseases that cause genital ulcers; examples are syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, and genital herpes. These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01-0.1% to 4-43% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated T cells expressing the CCR5 co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV.|$|R

40|$|Background: Proper {{knowledge}} of the patterns of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in different geographical regions is necessary for evolving proper strategies for control of these diseases. Aims: To study the pattern of STDs and to analyze the changes during a ten-year period from 1990 among patients attending Medical College Hospital, Kottayam Methods: Case records of 686 patients with STDs who attended the outpatient wing of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology were studied. Results: There were 504 males and 182 females in the total of 686 patients. Marital contact alone was reported by 123 (67. 6 &#x 0025;) female patients. Genital <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases</b> (GUDs) accounted for {{the maximum number of}} STDs, with 504 cases (73. 5 &#x 0025;), followed by condyloma acuminatum (17. 5 &#x 0025;) and gonorrhea (10. 1 &#x 0025;). Forty-three patients had multiple infections. The total number of patients {{during the first year of}} study was 129, while it was 41 during the last year. Bacterial STDs showed a striking reduction in numbers. The decline was less marked in the case of viral STDs. Conclusion: The majority of patients had genital <b>ulcer</b> <b>diseases.</b> Spouses were the most common source of infection for female patients. There was a marked decline in the number of patients with various STDs during the ten-year period.
