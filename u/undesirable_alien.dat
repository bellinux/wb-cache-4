60|$|That is {{something}} like a sincere first impression of the atmosphere of New York. Those who {{think that is the}} atmosphere of America have never got any farther than New York. We might almost say that they have never entered America, any more than if they had been detained like <b>undesirable</b> <b>aliens</b> at Ellis Island. And indeed there are a good many <b>undesirable</b> <b>aliens</b> detained in Manhattan Island too. But of that I will not speak, being myself an alien with no particular pretensions to be desirable. Anyhow, such is New York; but such is not the New World. The great American Republic contains very considerable varieties, and of these varieties I necessarily saw far too little to allow me to generalise. But from the little I did see, I should venture on the generalisation that the great part of America is singularly and even strikingly unlike New York. It goes without saying that New York is very unlike the vast agricultural plains and small agricultural towns of the Middle West, which I did see. It may be conjectured with some confidence that it is very unlike what is called the Wild and sometimes the Woolly West, which I did not see. But I am here comparing New York, not with the newer states of the prairie or the mountains, but with the other older cities of the Atlantic coast. And New York, as it seems to me, is quite vitally different from the other historic cities of America. It is so different that it shows them all for the moment in a false light, as a long white searchlight will throw a light that is fantastic and theatrical upon ancient and quiet villages folded in the everlasting hills. Philadelphia and Boston and Baltimore are more like those quiet villages than they are like New York.|$|R

Most often as the case such as in Northern Kenya these communities or clans are in conflict with each other mainly over the same scarce resources- water and pasture. This particular treatise explores the role of local NGOs in managing such inter-clan conflict. As aptly put by Lewis (1981 : 10 - 13), when grazing land is abundant, settlement patterns of the pastoral communities may include many non patrilineal kin, or other clans, the true patrilineal kin is honored when pressure arises in the form of diminishing water and pasture, in such instances those who are not one‟s clan become <b>undesirable</b> <b>aliens,</b> thus it is was not a surprise to witness, in the course of conducting the study the many sprouting settlements in Wajir County consisting of entirely agnatic kin, meant to protect “clan‟s” ideals at any costs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} history of three border regions along the Canada-U. S. international boundary during the First World War era (1914 - 1918), including Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan; St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and Calais, Maine; and White Rock, British Columbia, and Blaine, Washington. It examines the development of cross-border economies and border-crossing cultures in these communities before this period and reveals how the war–and specifically U. S. neutrality–affected such transnational relationships. Furthermore, it investigates local reactions to wartime legislation designed to better monitor the cross-border movement of enemy <b>aliens,</b> <b>undesirable</b> immigrant groups, enlisted men, and, following {{the introduction of the}} Military Service Act in 1917, men of military age (18 to 45). The three case studies included in this dissertation reveal that attitudes toward the international boundary’s permeability varied widely across Canada. In communities where the war was preceded by several generations of intense cross-border economic and social relations, such as at Windsor and St. Stephen, the conflict failed to disrupt the continued growth of distinct border-crossing cultures. In fact, in many cases residents of these communities used various local channels to express their belief that the federal government should better accommodate transnational traditions when implementing legislation affecting travel across the international boundary. Furthermore, the language used to formulate these protests reveals that many residents of Windsor and St. Stephen believed that they resided in a distinctly international community. By contrast, the White Rock case study reveals that where settlement at the border did not pre-date the introduction of a centralized immigration apparatus, there were far fewer protests against changes to the boundary’s permeability. The White Rock and Blaine example also demonstrates that concerns about the movement of certain goods and people–including alcohol and undesirable racial groups–factored into local conceptions of the international boundary and an extranational neighbour. Together, these three case studies provide insight into how Canadians in border communities interpreted the war, nationalism, and the Canada-U. S. relationship...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a history}} of the illegal immigration of Eastern European Jews to the United States that burgeoned after the passage of highly restrictive, nation-based immigration quotas in 1921 and 1924. I argue that the history of this illicit flow of people forces us to re-examine a central narrative of twentieth-century U. S. history, namely that 1924 saw the "closing of the gates" to European immigrants, and thus {{the end of an era}} in which European immigration was a matter of national urgency. I contend that the quota legislation escalated rather than settled struggles over questions of national inclusion and exclusion, and created new gray areas between alienness and belonging. The history of illegal immigration illuminates how the laws actually functioned on the ground, something we have as yet learned little about. The laws did reorder the rules governing the nation's literal and metaphorical borders, but this reordering happened unevenly, confusedly, and with much contention. Strategies Jewish migrants employed to enter the United States despite the quotas [...] -forgeries, disguise, and surreptitious entry [...] -challenged the laws' premise that it was possible to secure national borders against "undesirables," or to sort desirable immigrants from <b>undesirable</b> ones, and <b>aliens</b> from citizens. Jewish migrants, as a heterogeneous group coming from many countries and speaking many languages, particularly confounded the categories of ethnicity and nationality upon which the quota laws were based. Chapter One examines the genesis of the quota laws, focusing on the U. S. government's interest in counting and classifying, as well as the challenges Jews posed to such a project. Chapter Two considers U. S. Jewish leaders' responses to the illegal immigration of Jews over the Mexico-Texas border and to the plight of Jews stranded abroad with U. S. visas rendered defunct by the 1924 law. Chapter Three investigates Jewish alien smuggling and the criminalization of migration during the era. Chapter Four examines individual migrants' experiences of illegal immigration, especially their uses of disguises and forged documents. Chapter Five explores controversies over proposals for "alien registration," arguing that Jews escaped the specter of "illegal alienness" in part through their own political efforts. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{problem of}} land {{degradation}} {{is something that}} can not be ignored in this day and age. A food shortage as a result of desertification is a reality in especially, the African continent. One of the factors contributing to the problem of land degradation, is bush thickening. Bush thickening leads to the reduction of the grazing potential of natural rangelands. This has a direct effect on the cattle production and thus on the human livelihoods itself. Bush thickening usually occurs in areas that were exposed to over grazing in the past. The North West Province is the sixth largest province of South Africa. Nine (9) of the 28 magisterial districts of this province are considered to have a severe bush thickening problem. Several programmes have been initiated in South Africa to address the land degradation problem {{in order to make the}} land users more aware of the problem and to get involved in more sustainable natural resource management practises. Such an initiative is the LandCare program in South Africa, introduced by the National Department of Agriculture. LandCare has five themes, of which VeldCare is mainly based in the North West Province. This involves, amongst others, bush thinning, clearing or the total eradication of <b>undesirable</b> woody andlor <b>alien</b> plants to improve the grazing potential of rangelands. The clearing of the hush can be achieved by direct or indirect practices. Direct practices are when bush is eradicated by chemical or mechanical methods, whereas indirect practice focus more on the stocking rate and management of livestock, to prevent bush thickening. The indirect rangeland management practices were introduced together with awareness creation programmes in this study. Through this project, communities are given the opportunity to participate and take charge of the degradation problems in their region. LandCare therefore also focuses on education, training and capacity building of the land users in the rural areas. Three magisterial districts in the Western Region of the North West Province namely Ganyesa, Kudumane and Taung were identified by the Provincial Department of Agriculture to be monitored on account of their project development at the time. All three magisterial districts are subdivided into three Agricultural Development Centres (ADC's). These ADC's are again divided into a number of Field Service Units or FSU's. Benchmark sites were selected in certian FSU's for this study. The study sites were chosen to represent both the Morafe Ranches and Communal managed systems. The Morafe Ranch and communal management systems in the Ganyesa magisterial district were Water-Fouch 6 and Austrey respectively. In the Kudumane magisterial district, the Morafe Ranch systems were studied at the Heuningvlei study site. No communal managed rangeland system was monitored in this district, as there were no woody species in the vicinity of the exclosure plots used in this study. The Morafe Ranch system in the Taung magisterial district was at the Orange Grove study site and the communal managed rangeland was at the Ipelegeng study site. The data of the Ipelegeng study site however is unpresentable. The reasons are fully discussed in Chapter 4. In the study areas, several benchmark plots were selected that would represent the vegetation and management systems of the region. At the benchmark, an exclosure was erected. The fenced-in area would serve as a control to demonstrate the effect resting would have on a rangeland, while the outside of the exclosure normal grazing practise occurred. The aim was to determine the extent of bush thickening at the selected benchmark study sites, and how it will change both under the current grazing regime (outside the exclosure) and during resting (inside the exclosure) in the two management systems (Morafe Ranch and communal managed system). Quantitative surveys were carried out over a two year period to determine the structure and composition of the woody species. The average percentage of the woody species was calculated for the past three sampling periods (April 2001, December 2001 and May 2002). Although a two year period (three seasons) is much too short to detect any changes in the structure and composition of the woody component, the data and results will serve as good baseline data for long term monitoring and management projects. The benchmark sites are also used as demonstration plots that contribute to the awareness and training of the land users as part of the Landcare initiative. The vegetation sampling methods included the belt transect method, 2 x (4 x 100 m) or 5 x (4 x 40 m), depending on the size and shape of the exclosure. Each woody species rooted in the 4 m belt was noted as well as the structure class it occurred in. Five height classes were noted, namely: less than 0. 5 m, 0. 5 - 1 m, 1 - 2 m, 2 - 3 m, 3 - 4 m and higher than 4 meters. The environmental factor, rainfall, had the most influence on the slight changes that occurred in the species composition and structure of the woody vegetation. The rainfall data of the past five years could be considered as above average. It had a significant impact on the germination of seedlings of woody species, and thus influenced the less than 0. 5 m height class the most A major drawback to the data collection was the sampling practises, as different people participated in each sampling event Some of the species such as Grewiaflava, which has a multi stemmed growth form, was noted as one individual during one survey and in other cases as several individual plants. This caused much distortion in especially the density data and contributed to the fact that the results between sampling events and seasons could not be clearly correlated with each other. The data collected is represented as a percentage of the woody species for each benchmark site, inside and outside the exclosure. The species that were present in a more than 5 % abundance, as well as the structure classes, were represented in bar graphs. To give more perspective on the woody species data, the tree equivalents per hectare (TEha) per structure class, as well as the total tree equivalents, were calculated for each study site and survey period. The dominant height class was the less than 0. 5 m. The tree equivalent per hectare data show the 1 - 2 meter height class to have more influence on the herbaceous data at the study area. A species that was found in most of the benchmarks was Grewiaflava. The reduction in the grazing area might be significant, due to the growth form and large canopy cover of G. flava. Although Acacia mellifera was present in all the benchmark sites with more deep sandy soils, such as the Water-Fouch 6 -, Austrey -, Heuningvlei - and Ipelegeng study sites, the presence of A. hebeclada seems to be greater problem leading to bush thickening. Acacia hebeclada was more abundant than Acacia mellifera in most cases. The attitude towards the LandCare projects in each of the communities improved as the data was analysed and results presented to the land users, agricultural officers and the communities, a task which is often neglected in feedback sessions by scientists. Feedback to the communities therefore forms an integral part of such a long term study. As mentioned, the study period was too short to determine any significant differences in woody species composition, but it has contributed considerably to the awareness and capacity building of all stakeholders. If future data collection is done, it is essential that the surveyors should be thoroughly trained beforehand in the identification of woody species, especially the seedlings of the different Acacia species, as well as the sampling procedures, to avoid problems in the data analysis and results. Woody species should be noted as multi- or single stemmed to eliminate the problem of perception differences of different surveyors. Sampling methods can also be improved on in future. All in all, this LandCare project can be viewed as a success story. Despite some drawbacks, a lot was learned about the different natural resource management systems. Master...|$|R

Mitchell, with an attached file from the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, urging that British musician John Lennon (then living in New York City) be deported from the United States as an <b>undesirable</b> <b>alien,</b> due to Lennon's political views and activism. The document claimed Lennon's influence on young people could affect Nixon's chances of re-election, and suggested that terminating Lennon's visa might be [...] "a strategy counter-measure". Thurmond's memo and attachment, received by the White House on February 7, 1972, initiated the Nixon administration's persecution of John Lennon that threatened the former Beatle with deportation for nearly five years from 1972 to 1976. The documents were discovered in the FBI files after a Freedom of Information Act search by Professor Jon Wiener, and published in Weiner's book Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files (2000). They {{are discussed in the}} documentary film, The U.S. vs. John Lennon (2006).|$|E
5000|$|With {{the storm}} approaching, Curly, Ralph, Angel and Toots pull guns {{and take the}} Temples and Frank hostage. They explain that the sixth member of their party is notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), who was exiled to Cuba some years before for being an <b>undesirable</b> <b>alien.</b> The gang {{discovered}} Sawyer looking about and knocked him unconscious. As they are held at gunpoint, Temple lets go a stream of insults toward Rocco, who responds by taunting Temple, explaining how he will one day return to prominence. At one point Rocco gives Frank a pistol and offers to fight a duel with him, but Frank declines, stating that he believes in self-preservation over heroics and that [...] "one Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for." [...] Sawyer grabs the gun and tries to escape, but Rocco shoots him. In the gunplay it becomes apparent that the gun that Rocco gave to Frank was not loaded. Rocco's men take Sawyer's body by boat to deep water and throw it overboard.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of Filipinos in Egypt are {{employed}} as domestic workers, though employing foreigners in such positions is illegal under Egyptian law. Such workers typically gain entrance to Egypt either by entering alone on a tourist visa and overstaying, by applying an Egyptian visa intended for skilled workers and falsifying their intended employment, or by obtaining a visa for domestic work in a nearby country such as Jordan, Kuwait, or the United Arab Emirates and then having their sponsor there bring them to Egypt and leave them (as Egypt permits foreign tourists to bring their domestic helpers {{with them when they}} enter the country on holiday). Filipinos sometimes come to Egypt knowing that they will be employed as domestic workers, but often they are tricked by recruiters as to the nature of their employment; the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has had to issue public warnings that Egypt does not permit foreigners to work as domestic helpers, and in one case had to ban an employment agency from recruiting in the country and declaring its owner (an Egyptian whose son-in-law was alleged to be a powerful government official) an <b>undesirable</b> <b>alien.</b>|$|E
50|$|Born in New York City, U.S. in the {{emigrant}} {{family of}} Communist functionary Georgi Pirinski, Sr., he has roots from Pirin Macedonia. His mother Pauline {{was born in}} New York City {{and was a member}} of the Young Communist League at the City College of New York. She was a professor of English at Sofia University. His father found refuge in the U.S. after he participated in the unsuccessful Communist uprising against the Bulgarian regime in 1923 and was expelled from the U.S. as an <b>undesirable</b> <b>alien</b> about 1951. While a convinced communist, Pirinski did show some flashes of independent thinking, such as expressing disagreement in a private conversation with foreign visitors in 1970 at the decision of Bulgarian media to downplay the U.S. moonwalk the previous year. In the late 1970s, Pirinski was an aide to then Deputy Prime Minister Georgi Lukanov and then at the age of 31 became Bulgaria's youngest deputy minister (of foreign trade). He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1974, but political opponents later argued that the renunciation was judicially null. Pirinski was considered the BSP's favorite for the 1996 presidential nomination until the Constitutional Court barred him from participating in the presidential elections for failing to satisfy a constitutional requirement that the president be a Bulgarian citizen by birth (he was a U.S. citizen by birth).|$|E
