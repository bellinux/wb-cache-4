500|$|The bust {{was first}} CT scanned in 1992, with the scan {{producing}} cross {{sections of the}} bust every [...] In 2006, Dietrich Wildung, the director of Berlin's Egyptian Museum, while trying a different lighting at the Altes Museum—where the bust was then displayed—observed wrinkles on Nefertiti's neck and bags <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> suggesting the sculptor had tried to depict signs of aging. A CT scan confirmed Wildung's findings; Thutmose had added gypsum under the cheeks and eyes {{in an attempt to}} perfect his sculpture, Wildung explained.|$|E
500|$|In the hospital, as Buffy {{listens to}} the doctor confirm how Joyce died, the doctor says something, but the words [...] "I have to lie to you {{to make you feel}} better" [...] are spoken discordantly, as though, {{according}} to cinema scholar Katy Stevens, Buffy [...] "constructs what she believes to be an unmentionable truth—her culpability in her mother's death". In the same scene, Dawn is shot with a hand-held camera that drifts, giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe, unlike what Buffy already knows, that her mother's body is down the hall on a steel table. The scene with Buffy and Tara sitting in the waiting room was noted by Rhonda Wilcox for its reality in showing Gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous, particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for Maybelline while Buffy aired. Buffy sits with circles <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> unflattering hair, and slumped posture next to Tara, who had been criticized for being too heavy, despite her body type being more typical of women her age.|$|E
2500|$|The 1899 {{portrait}} of Williams depicts her wearing a pleated black {{dress with a}} high white collar. Her hair is in a tight bun, set against a dark brown background. Williams is turned slightly to the right, with a strong light cast {{on that side of}} her body. Her lips are pursed and her brow is furled; her expression is nearly a scowl. Dark circles are visible <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lydie, his wife, was {{kneeling}} beside his bed, her delicate hands clasped <b>under</b> <b>her</b> chin, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> large, glowing and ever grave fixed upon his face.|$|R
60|$|Kinney was {{beginning}} again, when Marcia, {{who had been}} stealing some covert looks at him <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> lashes, while she put together the sewing she was at work on, preparatory to going upstairs with the baby, joined Bartley in his invitation.|$|R
6000|$|Then, wreathed {{as it were}} in this {{lettered}} procession, was {{the figure}} of Helen as she had appeared {{at the moment of}} [...] "words"; her face a little hard, a little irritated, a little disappointed. He imagined himself going around and guessing <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye....</b>|$|R
60|$|He gave a shove {{against the}} yacht's side and glided away from <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> A {{rippling}} sound died out.|$|E
60|$|He {{noted the}} violet-blue shadows <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> as he arose, without {{offering}} to touch her. Nor did she offer invitation.|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} fingers tightly. Notwithstanding the shadows <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and {{the gleam of}} terror which still lingered there, she was beautiful.|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{felt his}} face grow warm <b>under</b> <b>her</b> watchful <b>eyes,</b> but he laughed.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, a {{young woman}} named Manon, who's been {{involved}} in a car accident, is being nursed to health at the hi-tech clinic directed by her mother, Professor Brügen. Manon seems to have issues recovering her memories after the incident. She has also the same marks <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him with a merciless steadiness. He drew back a few steps, cowering <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "I can't say," [...] he stammered. [...] "I don't know. What do you mean by these questions? I never thought about the moles afterward; I never looked. She wears her hair low--" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} face slowly round towards him. He was {{astonished}} to see the dark rings <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> the weariness of her smile.|$|E
60|$|Cassy knew Legree was uneasy <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and, therefore, {{she made}} no answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that strange, unearthly expression, as before.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the third day she brought only a small loaf of bread. There were dark circles <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She seemed as calm as ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{suppose you}} are going to cruise in the Moluccas," [...] {{continued}} Freya, who wanted to impart some useful information to Jasper if possible. At the same time she was always glad to know that those two men were a few hundred miles apart when not <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
50|$|Her main {{magic is}} {{manipulation}} magic (one hair muppet mini). By putting {{the hair of}} a person on a puppet or a stuffed toy, she can make him perform some actions. She looks scary when she uses her magic, mainly because it looks like she's cursing someone with a voodoo doll. She has a beauty mark <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and rarely smiles.|$|R
2500|$|Duo Grey Arrow - Catherine Jamet, the 39-year-old target girl in this {{experienced}} French husband-and-wife act, {{suffered a}} serious injury in 2001 {{when she was}} hit <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> while <b>her</b> husband was trying to perform a [...] "William Tell" [...] stunt at the World Circus Festival in Paris. The couple were reported to be planning to continue performing the act once she had recovered.|$|R
60|$|She {{started at}} the sound of his voice. She was dressed very simply in {{travelling}} clothes, and there were lines <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> as though she were fatigued.|$|E
60|$|She nodded. Looking at her {{now more}} closely {{he saw the}} shadows <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> only imperfectly concealed. The little gesture with which she {{answered}} him savoured of weariness.|$|E
6000|$|He {{recalled}} it, <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{but it came}} as {{from long}} ago. [...] "Oh yes. I can't deny it." [...] Then he added: [...] "So that if I stay--" ...|$|E
60|$|Indeed, all the {{children}} of the house look up to the old lady with habitual respect and attachment, and she seems almost to consider them as her own, from their having grown up <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> The Oxonian, however, is her favourite, probably from, being the youngest, though he is the most mischievous, and has been apt to play tricks upon her from boyhood.|$|R
50|$|During an Early Show on-air segment, Storm {{revealed}} {{on camera}} {{that she had}} a congenital defect known as port-wine stain <b>under</b> <b>her</b> left <b>eye.</b>|$|R
60|$|After a while, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> opened. Joan {{drew her}} chair nearer and slipped <b>her</b> arm in <b>under</b> <b>her,</b> and their <b>eyes</b> met.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Hauksbee {{accepted}} the responsibility, though it painted olive hollows <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and {{forced her to}} her oldest dresses. Mrs. Bent clung to her with more than childlike faith.|$|E
60|$|He would {{fade into}} {{something}} impalpable <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and then in}} a moment he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment.|$|E
60|$|After {{changing}} to Park clothes {{he went into}} the drawing-room. She was sitting idly {{in the corner of the}} sofa, her favourite seat; and there were circles <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> as though she had not slept.|$|E
60|$|Her {{dress was}} all disarranged; her face {{covered with the}} scars of scratches, and clots of blood had fixed <b>under</b> <b>her</b> nose; <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> had swollen up {{so that it was}} nearly closed, and red; her hair was hanging over her face and shoulders, and she laughed stupidly and leered with heavy, sodden ugliness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, never mind; I've got {{something}} {{more important to}} say than plantchette has," [...] said Cynthia, and she pulled the sheet away from <b>under</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was a good}} {{hour after}} our friends got aboard before the boat left her moorings, {{and then it was}} not without some secret dreads of sea-sickness that Aunt Melissa saw the seething brine widen between her and the {{familiar}} wharf-house, where she now seemed to have spent so large a part of her life. But the multitude of really charming and interesting objects that presently fell <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> soon distracted <b>her</b> from those gloomy thoughts.|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} {{looking at}} the torn drawing, when Somerset, observing on the table the particle of swan's-down he had found in the chair, gently blew {{it so that it}} skimmed across the table <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Whereupon Annaple's cheeks glowed all {{the more}} into {{resemblance}} of the baby-name which she had long ceased to deserve; but May could see the darkness <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> betraying {{that it was only}} excitement that drove away fatigue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shore I don't believe it. Any {{girl with}} a tender heart just couldn't let a man starve <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes...</b> Look at Dick, there. I'll bet he's had {{something}} to eat, mebbe potatoes an' gravy, an' pie an'--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] said Rosamond, {{with the}} same languor, looking out <b>under</b> <b>her</b> half-shut <b>eyes,</b> [...] "that I apply things to myself. I've met both sorts in my time." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Cheyenne {{was seriously}} {{injured in a}} car {{accident}} when she crashed a Jeep she was driving after her father refused to allow her to visit him while he was filming The Freshman in Toronto. She sustained a broken jaw, a laceration <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and a torn ear. Marlon Brando flew Cheyenne to Los Angeles to undergo extensive reconstructive and cosmetic surgery. The accident effectively ended her modeling career. After the accident, she began experiencing bouts of depression and attempted suicide.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} wait till {{later in the}} day, Blanche,' said the mother. She knew the meeting was inevitable, but she {{preferred}} having it <b>under</b> <b>her</b> own <b>eye,</b> if she could not reconnoitre.|$|R
