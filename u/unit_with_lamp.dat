30|$|Different {{methods have}} been applied to {{investigate}} the oxidation reactions of linseed oil. One of these methods comprises spreading the oil to achieve a given film thickness on selected supports, and then imposing different oxidation conditions on the samples. These conditions may involve thermal treatment in a forced-air circulation oven at 80 °C, natural ageing in the laboratory at room temperature and photo-ageing in a high speed exposure <b>unit</b> <b>with</b> a xenon <b>lamp.</b> The final step comprises the analyses of chemical changes during the treatments, as described later in the review (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999). The difficulty of this method is to maintain the same accurate film thickness to collect reproducible quantitative results.|$|R
30|$|The ZnO {{films were}} {{investigated}} by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Ka radiation (Philips, X pert pro MRD, Netherlands), UV–Vis absorption spectra (Cary, Lambda 950, America), Hall effect (Ecopia, HMS- 5500, Korea), photoluminescence (PL, LabRAM HR 800, France), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, EDAX Inc. Genesis, America). The device cross-section {{was obtained from}} using scanning electron microscopy (FEI Nova 450, America). The J–V characteristics were measured by a Keithley 2400 source <b>unit</b> <b>with</b> Xenon <b>lamp</b> (Newport, 3 A solar simulator, 94023 A-U, Germany) as the light source with simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm− 2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were taken by a home-made setup containing a Keithley 2400 Source Measure unit and Newport monochromator. The output power was also calibrated by Si photodetectors. The work function of various ZnO films was measured by using a Scanning Kelvin Probe microscopy (SKPM, UHV-KP, KP technology, Britain) in air at dark condition. The C–V measurements were acquired with an Agilent 4200 A at a frequency of 10  kHz and AC signal of 50  mV, scanning from − 1 to + 0.6  V, with a step size of 50  mV. The EIS of the QD SCs was performed on an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGTSAT 302 N, Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, Netherlands) in the dark with the frequency ranging from 0.1 to 106 Hz.|$|R
2500|$|UVGI {{can be used}} to {{disinfect}} air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing <b>units</b> <b>with</b> shielded UV <b>lamps</b> that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms. [...] For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.|$|R
