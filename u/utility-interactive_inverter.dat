40|$|Through this project, Advanced Energy Conversion (AEC) has developed, tested, {{refined and}} is {{preparing}} to commercialize a 2. 5 kW <b>utility-interactive</b> <b>inverter</b> system for distributed generation. The inverter technology embodies zero-voltage switching technology that will ultimately yield {{a system that is}} smaller, less expensive and more efficient than existing commercial technologies. This program has focused on commercial success through careful synthesis of technology, market-focus and business development. AEC was the primary participant. AEC is utilizing contract manufacturers {{in the early stages of}} production, allowing its technical staff to focus on quality control issues and product enhancements. The objective of this project was to bring the AEC inverter technology from its current pre-production state to a commercial product. Federal funds have been used to build and test production-intent inverters, support the implementation of the commercialization plan and bring the product to the point of UL certification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” Markov {{reliability}} {{models to}} estimate Photovoltaic (PV) inverter reliability are proposed for utility-interactive systems. These are then extended {{to generate a}} unified PV energy-yield model. The integrated reliability-energy yield framework is superior to conventional methods as it accounts for inverter failures and repairs. The proposed analytical framework is utilized to compare conventional central inverter architectures to emerging architectures that employ microinverters. Case studies applied to a 9 kW residential system indicate that over a 25 year period, in typical operating conditions, microinverters provide higher energy yield as compared to a conventional system. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that the energy yield is {{more sensitive to the}} repair time compared to the mean time to failure of the inverters.
