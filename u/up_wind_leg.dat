5000|$|Introduction: Wile E. Coyote, {{standing}} on the road, pulls out an arrow-shaped sign saying [...] "Coyote" [...] and another saying [...] "Apetitius Giganticus". The Road Runner speeds by with a Beep-beep and ruffles the coyote's fur. Wile flips the signs to read [...] "Road-Runner" [...] and [...] "Fastius Tasty-us", and <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> his <b>legs,</b> followed by his body, and chases the Road Runner. When the Road Runner sees the Coyote chasing him, he taunts him and gears into superspeed. This causes the road to roll up, a tunnel to turn inside-out, and a bridge to compress itself as he puts his would-be predator far behind. Wile E. stops short of the chasm, panting, and two light bulbs signal his new-found idea.|$|R

5000|$|A {{company may}} go into <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> either voluntarily or {{by order of}} the court. [...] A company enters {{voluntary}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> by passing a special resolution to appoint a liquidator. If the company is solvent when it enters voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> {{it is said to}} be in members' voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> and if it is insolvent it is said to be in creditors' voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{accounting}} period ends {{and a new}} one begins with the commencement of a <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> For this purpose a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company, or on the presentation of a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose {{in the case of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.|$|R
5000|$|During the Eastern Han (25-220 CE) and Jin dynasty (265-420) xiao and changxiao {{whistling}} became especially {{associated with}} Daoism. For example, the Hou Hanshu (82, tr. DeWoskin 1983: 77) biography of Xu Deng 徐登 mentions his companion Zhao Bing 趙柄 whistling to call <b>up</b> <b>wind.</b> [...] "On another occasion, {{he was seeking}} passage across a river, but the boat man would not take him. Bing spread out a cloth {{and sat in the}} middle of it. Then with a long whistle he stirred <b>up</b> <b>winds</b> 長肅呼風 and whipped up wild currents which carried him across." ...|$|R
50|$|SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D (also {{known as}} SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D Ride, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Ride or SpongeBob SquarePants 3-D) is a cel-shaded 4-D film {{based upon the}} popular {{television}} series SpongeBob SquarePants. It {{can be found at}} many aquariums and theme parks across the world. The ride consists of a pre-show which then leads into a stadium seated auditorium. The ride is in 4-D, meaning it is a motion simulator with a 3D movie. The effects on the ride vary at different parks. Water spray, bubbles, <b>wind,</b> <b>leg</b> ticklers, smoke, and smells are usually found.|$|R
50|$|A local legend {{says that}} a fairy bull would appear on the {{mountain}} ridge during years of drought. It would summon <b>up</b> <b>winds</b> and call for rain to come.|$|R

6000|$|He {{shows me}} the paper. It {{is an old}} scrap of print, the picture of an American patent door-spring, with {{directions:}} 'Fasten the spring either end <b>up.</b> <b>Wind</b> it <b>up.</b> Never unwind.' ...|$|R
50|$|In a {{compulsory}} <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> the day {{on which}} the relevant Court order is made will constitute {{the date of the}} commencement of the <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> The date on which the application to <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the company was filed is called the relation-back day. Whether the liquidation process is initiated by an order of the Court or through a creditors' voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a liquidator will be appointed to administer the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the affairs of the company.|$|R

60|$|Now {{he caught}} the scent of Numa, for he was {{traveling}} <b>up</b> <b>wind.</b> Presently his quick ears detected the familiar sound of padded feet and the brushing of a huge, fur-clad body through the undergrowth.|$|R
25|$|During {{the course}} of a <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a company may make an {{estimate}} of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> turns out to be before the actual <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> had started with that accounting period.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{found myself}} in a quandary. As you know, a {{rhinoceros}} is a very short-sighted brute, indeed his sight is as bad as his scent is good. Of this fact he is perfectly aware, but he always makes the most of his natural gifts. For instance, when he lies down he invariably does so with his head down wind. Thus, if any enemy crosses his wind he will {{still be able to}} escape, or attack him; and if, on the other hand, the danger approaches <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> he will at least have a chance of seeing it. Otherwise, by walking delicately, one might actually kick him up like a partridge, if only the advance was made <b>up</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Never tank, {{no matter}} how far back you feel. Three days from the finish, we were 12th, but less than 15 minutes {{separated}} us from the next two boats. One of them broke a rudder casting at Hatteras and carried it {{the rest of the way}} to Kill Devil Hills, giving up just over an hour, and while the other stayed ahead, Kirk Newkirk of Key Sailing withdrew from a top-10 place in the race because he was unwilling to face the prospect of another 16- to 18-hour light <b>wind</b> <b>leg.</b> The rest of the fleet held positions, and we had our top-10 finish.|$|R

5000|$|The same book states, {{in section}} 24.2, [...] "In a True Wind of 15 kn, the Soling crew will sail the close reach and {{reaching}} <b>legs</b> in Apparent <b>Winds</b> little stronger than True Wind. ... The 18-foot Skiff crew sails the cross <b>wind</b> <b>legs</b> in much stronger Apparent Winds which approach 30 kn. Even {{on the broad}} reaching legs they must still sail in a strong Apparent Wind which blows from ahead, so they still need to use strong-wind 'going-to-windward' handling techniques {{even though they are}} sailing downwind." [...] Figure 24.2 of this book provides vector graphics that show how the 18 ft Skiff can sail downwind faster than the speed of the wind.|$|R
50|$|The very {{objective}} of the company is to achieve cost effective technological innovations in the mining of minerals and to diversify into mineral based downstream projects.The Company is also aiming at long term fuel supply to lignite based power projects and setting <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> energy farms at Jaisalmer.|$|R
60|$|And so {{they came}} to a small gate which let into the castle wall where the shadow of a great tower made the {{blackness}} of a black night doubly black. Through many dim corridors, the lackey led them, and <b>up</b> <b>winding</b> stairways until presently he stopped before a low door.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> parks in parts of Inner Mongolia such as Bailingmiao, Hutengliang and Zhouzi.|$|R

40|$|I have {{my thesis}} {{dividend}} into two parts. In {{the first part}} (theory) I tried to draw up the legal background of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the commercial company, then I aimed to general aspects of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation (general reasons for <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> liquidator, insolvency proceeding), specifics of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation appertaining to particular type of commercial company and finally I described the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with the legal successor (legal forms of conversions). In the second part I made up an imaginary limited lability company (I couldn't get any real dates from the existing company because they are all subject of business secret) and tried to illustrate the process of <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with liquidation. I put emphasis on particular steps of liquidator and the formal standpoints of the liquidation process...|$|R

50|$|Ungoed Thomas J {{held that}} the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> {{petition}} could not succeed. It would be an abuse of process {{to ask for a}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition when a debt was bona fide under dispute. Here, the parties were actually disputing the existence of the debt, so the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition had to be rejected. His judgment was as follows.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 June, the {{barometer}} reading {{began to}} drop; and <b>winds</b> picked <b>up.</b> <b>Winds</b> reached 70 knots (130 km/h) by 06:00, and Twining again faced the might of a typhoon but emerged undamaged and resumed her picket duties {{late in the}} day. Following strikes on Kyūshū, she detached from the group on 10 June to escort [...] to Leyte.|$|R
50|$|Prince Edward Island is {{the only}} Canadian {{province}} without a hydroelectric power station. The province is largely dependent on imported power from NB Power generation facilities in New Brunswick. Two submarine power lines provide more than 80% of the provincial load. Since the early 2000, the provincial government has promoted the province as {{a good place to}} set <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> farms.|$|R
50|$|In a {{cruising}} environment however, sailing <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> {{is judged}} differently. Slowing down when beating to windward is sensible cruising. The junk rig is also self tacking. None {{of the running}} lines need to be touched to tack the boat through {{the eye of the}} wind: one simply puts the helm down, and the sails will swing over close hauled on the new tack.|$|R
50|$|On October 14, 2009, the {{remnants}} of Melor affected California and broke several rainfall records. Local California media had reported that the remnant of Typhoon Melor was able to kick <b>up</b> <b>winds</b> to as high as 70 mph. Some trees and power lines were downed {{as a result of}} this storm. Typhoon Melor's remnants produced up to 10 inches of rain in California's Santa Cruz Mountains.|$|R
