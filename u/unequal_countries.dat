50|$|When NAFTA {{was being}} {{developed}} to include Mexico, the developers {{of the deal}} presented it as way to create more middle class jobs in Mexico by increasing development and investment in Mexico.

50|$|However, the GEP {{also depends}} on other variables, among them the initial level of income inequality. Countries with a more equal {{distribution}} of income (as measured for example by the Gini index) experience a greater reduction in the poverty rate for a given increase in per capita income. The GEP ranges from slightly less than 1 for very <b>unequal</b> <b>countries,</b> to as high as 6 for very equal countries. This suggests that in poor countries that also have a very unequal distribution of income, economic reforms aimed at reducing inequality may be a prerequisite for pro-growth policies to make a substantial impact on poverty levels. On the other hand, for poor countries which already have an equitable distribution of income, pro growth policies should be the main poverty fighting tools (even if they increase inequality).|$|E

Various sources of welfare interdependence are identified, including the idea of"relative deprivation"as well other (positive and negative) welfare effects {{for poor people}} of belonging to a better-off group.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{performance}} of the Bank of Brazil (BB) in the 2001 - 2006 period, with a focus on the following aspects: has the BB actually performed the role of a typical public bank, functioning as an important instrument to foster development in Brazil? Or, instead, has its recent path been characterised by the reinforcement of a private logic of behaviour? The paper aims at raising a few questions regarding the role of the state in the economic activity, particularly the role that a big state-owned bank can and must perform to finance development in a peripheral (and <b>unequal)</b> <b>country</b> like Brazil. The general conclusion is that, since the mid- 80 s, the BB has increasingly lost the key function that it formerly exerted as a public bank.

By combining well reputed Chilean data, this study computes a ratio of AFER (15 - 17 years-old) between the 30 % of the population living in economically worst off areas (the numerator) against the corresponding 30 % better off segment of the population (the denominator). This ratio of AFER by relative socioeconomic status shows a stable evolution from 1. 45 in the year 1990 to 1. 10 in 2011. Sexual initiation, whose association with AFER is well established, also shows a dropping ratio, from 1. 24 in 1997 to 1. 01 in 2012.
