500|$|Sullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, [...] "I don't use {{the piano}} in {{composition}} – {{that would limit}} me terribly". [...] Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but [...] "to dig for it. ... I decide on [...] before I come {{to the question of}} melody. ... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation." [...] Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was [...] "vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve [...] "the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1894 Wood {{went to the}} Wagner festival at Bayreuth {{where he}} met the {{conductor}} Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master {{for a series of}} Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: [...] "I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> created a public for classical and modern music." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{fill the}} hall during {{the heat of}} the late-summer period, when London audiences tended to stay away from theatres and concert halls, Newman planned to run a ten-week season of {{promenade}} concerts, with low-priced tickets to attract a wider audience than that of the main season. Costs needed to be kept down, and Newman decided not to engage a star conductor, but invited the young and little known Henry Wood to conduct the whole season.

2500|$|In 610, Heraclius, an Armenian, revolted against Phocas {{and killed}} him, {{crowning}} himself as Emperor of the Byzantine Empire. He {{then tried to}} negotiate peace with Khosrow II by sending diplomats to his court. Khosrow, however, rejected their offer and said: [...] "That kingdom belongs to me, and I shall enthrone Maurice's son, Theodosius, as emperor. , he went and took the rule without our order and now offers us our own treasure as gifts. But I shall not stop <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> him in my hands." [...] Khosrow then had the diplomats executed.|$|E
2500|$|Hopper paid {{particular}} attention to geometrical design and the careful placement of human figures in proper balance with their environment. He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, [...] "It {{takes a long time}} for an idea to strike. Then I {{have to think about it}} for a long time. I don't start painting <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> it all worked out in my mind. I'm all right when I get to the easel". He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as [...] "sad face of woman unlit", [...] "electric light from ceiling", and [...] "thighs cooler".|$|E

He said: [...] "At how much do you sell that honey?" [...] (4) The seller said to him: [...] "Just taste it, and if it pleases you, you can make a bid." [...] (5) The man took a bag, poured out some, tasted the honey and gave it back to its owner. He said: [...] "Hold it, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> tried another one". (6) [...] held it in his hand, while the buyer took another bag, poured out some, tasted the honey and gave it back to its owner. (7) He held it in his other hand; then the buyer took one bag of honey and ran away. The honey-seller could not do {{anything}} because of the bags he held. (8) He started calling out to people to liberate him.|$|E
2500|$|Several Royal Navy {{ships were}} on their way, but once again French obstinacy had a semi-beneficial effect. Jones wished to take his prizes to Dunkirk, but the French captains insisted on {{following}} the original orders from their government masters {{to head for the}} island of Texel in the neutral United Provinces (the Netherlands). They arrived safely on 3 October, while the British ships searched for them in all the wrong places, having ignored a correct preliminary estimate by observers in Yorkshire. Jones immediately wrote a report to his own government superior, Benjamin Franklin, one notable feature of which was, inevitably, the conduct of Captain Landais. Furious though he was, he wrote, [...] "I forbear to take any steps With him <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the advice and approbation of your Excellency". Captain Cottineau, on the other hand, placed himself under no such obligation, and called Landais a coward to his face. Landais challenged him to a duel during which Landais ran his sword through Cottineau’s chest, just missing the heart. Landais’ later history is in the Alliance article.|$|E
2500|$|When Henry II {{attempted}} {{to give his}} land-less youngest son, John, a wedding gift of three castles it prompted his three eldest sons and wife to rebel in the Revolt of 1173–1174. Louis VII encouraged the three elder sons to destabilise his mightiest subject and not to wait for their inheritances. It was only after eighteen months of conflict that Henry II was able to force the rebels to submit to his authority. In Le Mans in 1182 Henry II gathered his children to plan for partible inheritance in which his eldest son, also called Henry, would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; Richard the Duchy of Aquitaine; Geoffrey Brittany and John would receive Ireland. This broke down into further conflict and the younger Henry rebelled again, but died of dysentery. In 1186 Geoffrey {{died as a result}} of a tournament accident but Henry was still reluctant to have a sole heir [...] so, in 1189, Richard and Philip II of France took advantage of a sickening Henry II with more success. Henry II was forced to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard as sole heir. When Henry II died shortly afterwards his last words to Richard were allegedly [...] "God grant that I may not die <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> my revenge on you".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the circle}} of her own court, she was {{surrounded}} by sympathizers of the Hats. Her favorite Henrika Juliana von Liewen was a prominent sympathizer of the Hats, as was Claes Ekeblad, Hans Henrik von Liewen, Anders Johan von Höpken {{and other members of}} her personal circle of friends, and through her court connections, she made an alliance with the Hats (party). Her strategy was to affect the votes in the parliament of the Riksdag through bribes. After the birth of her eldest son in 1746, she accompanied the crown prince on an official tour through the country, during which she gathered agents among members of the Caps through bribes. At the visit of the Cap's parliamentary Kalsenius, she described him as: [...] "The biggest villain in the world, but I will not leave <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> bribed him. That is the only means by which one can reach the goal one has in mind." [...] Kalsenius is also confirmed to have voted with the Hats party in the exactly the issues interesting to Louisa Ulrika during the votes in the Riksdag. Her goal was to overthrow the constitution and reintroduce the system of absolute monarchy with enlightened absolutism in Sweden. Her plans were internationally noted already by her creation of the L'Ordre de l'Harmonie, with the motto of unity. Her plans were opposed by Russia and Great Britain, who in 1746, allied with the Caps (party), attempted to stage a coup through their agents in Sweden against the royal house.|$|E
