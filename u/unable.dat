5|$|A small force sent {{north from}} New York by General Clinton in early October was also <b>unable</b> to assist Burgoyne.|$|E
5|$|After the British had withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner was <b>unable</b> to see Sword from his command bunker, {{so even though}} he was able to get two of his guns back in action, he was <b>unable</b> to direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E
5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is <b>unable</b> to handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are <b>unable</b> to proceed.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Władysław {{gave the}} Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping {{to persuade the}} Tsar to join in an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the king was {{ultimately}} <b>unable</b> to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, <b>unable</b> to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Although Hulagu was {{allied with}} Kublai Khan, his forces were <b>unable</b> {{to help in}} the assault against the Song, due to Hulagu's war with the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>unable</b> {{to quell}} the autonomist violence, Morales' {{government}} refused to declare a state of emergency, believing that the autonomists were attempting to provoke them into doing so.|$|E
5|$|An autopsy was {{performed}} on August 16, 1983, but was <b>unable</b> to determine cause of death. New Haven police investigated the death, but were <b>unable</b> to find evidence of foul play. In November 1983, {{the office of the}} Connecticut state medical examiner issued a report stating that Slee's death may have been related to stress. The police investigation into the matter was closed the same month.|$|E
5|$|At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Miura soon {{finds himself}} <b>unable</b> to {{penetrate}} Ip's impeccable defense and is overwhelmed by his relentless and direct blows. <b>Unable</b> to defend himself, Ip effortlessly uses {{him like a}} wooden dummy, inflicting a severe beating on him.|$|E
5|$|Balotelli was <b>unable</b> {{to answer}} call-ups to the Italian {{national}} under-15 and under-17 teams {{as he was}} still {{considered to be a}} Ghanaian immigrant.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{began the}} final quarter with the ball in a 2nd-and-11 {{situation}} and were <b>unable</b> to convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also <b>unable</b> to move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls. On their next possession Buffalo {{managed to get a}} first down off of a Drew Willy pass to tight end Jesse Rack, but were <b>unable</b> to move the ball further than UConn's 49-yard line and punted again.|$|E
5|$|Deleted scenes include: Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{believing that}} {{a higher power}} brought Michael to his desk, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) speculating on the culprit, Jim <b>unable</b> to handle Kelly's chattering, Jim eating lunch by himself in his car, Michael being <b>unable</b> to {{complete}} a sale, Michael stealing a crumpet from Dwight, Dwight and Angela having a secret conversation in the kitchen, and Jim asking Toby Flenderson (Lieberstein) how he handled Kelly's loquaciousness.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Llewelyn as Q: MI6's gadget designer. Llewelyn was {{disappointed}} {{because he was}} <b>unable</b> to travel to India since his scenes were filmed at Pinewood Studios.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was <b>unable</b> to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were <b>unable</b> to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cost-saving measures}} and extra {{investment in the}} line, the Southern Railway was <b>unable</b> to reverse the trend, and closed the line.|$|E

5|$|In the Georgian era, Norwich {{became an}} {{increasingly}} popular destination with travellers and {{developed into a}} fashionable shopping town. Buildings around the market were developed into luxury shops and coaching inns. The {{eastern side of the}} market was particularly fashionable and became known as Gentleman's Walk. The area around the market had become very congested by the 19thcentury, but the council was <b>unable</b> to raise funds for improvement and few alterations were made. Because many of the market's stalls were privately owned, the council was <b>unable</b> to rearrange the market into a more rational layout.|$|E
5|$|In {{the buildup}} to the race, Cambridge's P. D. Rickett was struck down by {{influenza}} {{for a week}} and was <b>unable</b> to train.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb {{with the bases loaded}} and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that Tony Gwynn was <b>unable</b> to see. Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, but was <b>unable</b> to prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely game-winning RBI.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} scene, a bullet-ridden, dejected Khan reads {{a letter he}} was <b>unable</b> to give Jasmine in the cargo hold of a ship leaving the city forever.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the NFA {{sought to}} {{purchase}} the chain from Diageo, but the deal collapsed when the NFA was <b>unable</b> to put together an acceptable financing package.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were <b>unable</b> to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin had been <b>unable</b> to explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon {{responded to}} the {{economic}} crisis by declaring a four-day banking holiday to begin on March 1, 1933. He twice extended the holiday, which finally ended on March 18. Responding to complaints of low prices by farmers, he closed burley tobacco markets in December of that year. At {{the end of the}} 1932 fiscal year, figures showed that the state incurred a $2 million deficit. Kentucky was also <b>unable</b> to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal because the state was often <b>unable</b> to raise the required matching funds.|$|E
5|$|Mood is {{described}} using the patient's own words, {{and can also}} be described in summary terms such as neutral, euthymic, dysphoric, euphoric, angry, anxious or apathetic. Alexithymic individuals may be <b>unable</b> to describe their subjective mood state. An individual who is <b>unable</b> to experience any pleasure may be suffering from anhedonia.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 2015, Jeremy Peace {{announced}} that his sale exclusivity deal was now off after potential buyer was <b>unable</b> to fulfil terms of sale.|$|E
5|$|On the tour's {{opening night}} at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound created by the {{screaming}} crowds {{was so great that}} The Beatles' amplification equipment proved unequal to it, {{so much so that the}} band members were <b>unable</b> to hear any sounds they were making themselves, whether speaking, singing, or playing their instruments. As a result, they were <b>unable</b> to count songs in or perform in unison.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game, {{offensive}} tackle Blane Neufeld was pronounced <b>unable</b> to play {{due to a}} broken foot suffered two weeks prior to the San Francisco Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{established}} the general geography of this region, and named {{many of its}} features; the Ross Sea, the Great Ice Barrier (later renamed the Ross Ice Shelf), Ross Island, Cape Adare, Victoria Land, McMurdo Sound, Cape Crozier and the twin volcanoes Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, but was <b>unable</b> to do so, achieving his Farthest South in a small Barrier inlet at 78°10′, in February 1842. Ross suspected that land lay {{to the east of}} the Barrier, but was <b>unable</b> to confirm this.|$|E
