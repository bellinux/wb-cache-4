60|$|I say 'very seldom' on purpose, {{because there}} are a few cases among the extreme lower animals where a water-haunting {{creature}} can be taken {{out of the water and}} can be thoroughly dried and desiccated, or even kept for an apparently <b>unlimited</b> <b>period</b> wrapped up in paper or on the slide of a microscope; and yet, the moment a drop of water is placed on top of it, it begins to move and live again exactly as before.

Whether anything like it ever really occurs in the higher ranks of animal life, however, is a different question; but there can be no doubt that to some slight extent a body to all intents and purposes quite dead (physically speaking) by long immersion in water--a drowned man, for example--may really be resuscitated by heat and stimulants, applied immediately, provided no part of the working organism has been seriously injured or decomposed. Such people may be said to be pro tem. functionally, though not structurally, dead. The heart has practically ceased to beat, the lungs have ceased to breathe, and physical life in the body is temporarily extinct. The fire, in short, has gone out.

60|$|A certain famous {{historical}} desert snail {{was brought}} from Egypt to England as a conchological specimen {{in the year}} 1846. This particular mollusk (the only one of his race, probably, who ever attained to individual distinction), {{at the time of}} his arrival in London, was really alive and vigorous; but as the authorities of the British Museum, to whose tender care he was consigned, were ignorant of this important fact in his economy, he was gummed, mouth downward, on to a piece of cardboard, and duly labelled and dated with scientific accuracy, 'Helix desertorum, March 25, 1846.' Being a snail of a retiring and contented disposition, however, accustomed to long droughts and corresponding naps in his native sand-wastes, our mollusk thereupon simply curled himself up into the topmost recesses of his own whorls, and went placidly to sleep in perfect contentment for an <b>unlimited</b> <b>period.</b> Every conchologist takes it for granted, of course, that the shells which he receives from foreign parts have had their inhabitants properly boiled and extracted before being exported; for it is only the mere outer shell or skeleton of the animal that we preserve in our cabinets, leaving the actual flesh and muscles of the creature himself to wither unobserved upon its native shores. At the British Museum the desert snail might have snoozed away his inglorious existence unsuspected, but for a happy accident which attracted public attention to his remarkable case in a most extraordinary manner. On March 7, 1850, nearly four years later, it was casually observed that the card on which he reposed was slightly discoloured; and this discovery led to the suspicion that perhaps a living animal might be temporarily immured within that papery tomb. The Museum authorities accordingly ordered our friend a warm bath (who shall say hereafter that science is unfeeling!), upon which the grateful snail, waking up at the touch of the familiar moisture, put his head cautiously out of his shell, walked up to the top of the basin, and began to take a cursory survey of British institutions with his four eye-bearing tentacles. So strange a recovery from a long torpid condition, only equalled by that of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, deserved an exceptional amount of scientific recognition. The desert snail at once awoke and found himself famous. Nay, he actually sat for his portrait to an eminent zoological artist, Mr. Waterhouse; and a woodcut from the sketch thus procured, with a history of his life and adventures, may be found even unto this day in Dr. Woodward's 'Manual of the Mollusca,' to witness if I lie.|$|E
6000|$|We are to understand, however, (for {{sometimes}} so {{the author}} hints,) that something stable in the Constitution of Regicide {{was required for}} our amity with it; but the noble Remarker is no more solicitous about this point than he is for the permanence of the whole body of his October speculations. [...] "If," [...] says he, speaking of the Regicide, [...] "they can obtain a practicable constitution, even for a limited period of time, {{they will be in}} a condition to reestablish the accustomed relations of peace and amity." [...] Pray let us leave this bush-fighting. What is meant by a limited period of time? Does it mean the direct contrary to the terms, an <b>unlimited</b> <b>period?</b> If it is a limited period, what limitation does he fix as a ground for his opinion? Otherwise, his limitation is unlimited. If he only requires a constitution that will last while the treaty goes on, ten days' existence will satisfy his demands. He knows that France never did want a practicable constitution, nor a government, which endured for a limited period of time. Her constitutions were but too practicable; and short as was their duration, it was but too long. They endured time enough for treaties which benefited themselves and have done infinite mischief to our cause. But, granting him his strange thesis, that hitherto the mere form or the mere term of their constitutions, and not their indisposition, but their instability, has been the cause of their not preserving the relations of amity,--how could a constitution which might not last half an hour after the noble lord's signature of the treaty, in the company in which he must sign it, insure its observance? If you trouble yourself at all with their constitutions, you are certainly more concerned with them after the treaty than before it, as the observance of conventions is of infinitely more consequence than the making them. Can anything be more palpably absurd and senseless than to object to a treaty of peace for want of durability in constitutions which had an actual duration, and to trust a constitution {{that at the time of}} the writing had not so much as a practical existence? There is no way of accounting for such discourse in the mouths of men of sense, but by supposing that they secretly entertain a hope that the very act of having made a peace with the Regicides will give a stability to the Regicide system. This will not clear the discourse from the absurdity, but it will account for the conduct, which such reasoning so ill defends. What a roundabout way is this to peace,--to make war for the destruction of regicides, and then to give them peace in order to insure a stability that will enable them to observe it! I say nothing of the honor displayed in such a system. It is plain it militates with itself almost in all the parts of it. In one part, it supposes stability in their Constitution, as a ground of a stable peace; in another part, we are to hope for peace in a different way,--that is, by splitting this brilliant orb into little stars, and this would make the face of heaven so fine! No, there is no system upon which the peace which in humility we are to supplicate can possibly stand.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of multiple independent sensing parameters {{in a single}} device is the key conceptual advantage of sensor devices based on an organic thin film transistor (OTFT) over simple organic chemiresistors. Practically, however, these multiple parameters must first be extracted from the electrical characteristics of the OTFTs and, thus, they are not immediately apparent. To exploit the advantage of OTFT sensors, we require a measurement technology to extract these parameters in real time. Here, we introduce an efficient, cost-effective system that is a faster and more compact alternative to the expensive and cumbersome laboratory-based instruments currently available. The characterisation system presented here records the electric behaviour of OTFTs {{in the form of}} its "saturated transfer characteristics" multiple times per second for virtually <b>unlimited</b> <b>periods</b> of time, with the option to multiplex up to 20 devices in parallel. By applying a bespoke algorithm to the measured transfer characteristics, the system then extracts, in real time, several underlying transistor parameters (on- and off-current, threshold voltage, and charge carrier mobility). Tests were conducted on the example of a poly(thieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene) (PBTTT) OTFT exposed to ethanol vapour. The system extracts the underlying OTFT parameters with very low noise without introducing apparent correlations between independent parameters as an artefact...|$|R
