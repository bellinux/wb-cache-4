5|$|At {{both state}} and federal realms in Australia, assent is used as the means of {{enforcing}} a referendum that is required.

5|$|The Court {{held that}} <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> the suspect {{actually}} {{stated that he}} was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying a waiver.|$|E

5|$|The oldest graves are to {{the north}} of the church, which is unusual: ordinarily the {{southern}} part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining unconsecrated <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> extra space for graves was required. The path between the road and the church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other. One author has suggested that the mound alongside the path might indicate that the church is located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement.|$|E

25|$|Living in Oakland at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Martin Eden struggles to rise above his destitute, proletarian circumstances through an intense and passionate pursuit of self-education, hoping to achieve a place among the literary elite. His principal motivation is his love for Ruth Morse. Because Eden is a rough, uneducated sailor from a working-class background and the Morses are a bourgeois family, a union between them would be impossible <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> he reached their level of wealth and refinement.|$|E
25|$|Value-added Theory - Neil Smelser (1962) {{argues that}} {{collective}} behavior {{is actually a}} sort of release valve for built-up tension ("strain") within the social system, community, or group. If the proper determinants are present then collective behavior becomes inevitable. Conversely, {{if any of the}} key determinants are not present no collective behavior will occur <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> the missing determinants fall into place. These are primarily social, although physical factors such as location and weather may also contribute to or hinder the development of collective behavior.|$|E

25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one {{would be willing to}} rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> proven guilty.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of melanistic (all-black) Malayan tapirs have been observed. In 1924, an all-black tapir was sent to Rotterdam Zoo and was {{classified}} as a subspecies called Tapirus indicus brevetianus after its discoverer, Captain K. Brevet. In 2000, two melanistic tapirs were observed during a study of tigers in the Jerangau Forest Reserve in Malaysia. The cause of this variation may be a genetic abnormality {{similar to that of}} black panthers that appear in populations of spotted jaguars. However, <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> more T. i. brevetianus individuals can be studied, the precise explanation for the trait will remain unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{privilege}} {{of habeas corpus}} has been suspended or restricted several times during English history, most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two World Wars and the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the habeas corpus procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as habeas corpus is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, {{so long as the}} detention is in accordance with an Act of Parliament, the petition for habeas corpus is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998, the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> it is acted upon by the government.|$|E

25|$|While {{evidence}} such as {{size and}} scale of site and of individual structures (e.g., El Tigre at El Mirador) is compelling, {{developments in the}} Southern area remain resilient against conclusive consensus. The temporal priority of plentiful as opposed to scant evidence of stelae and writing in the Preclassic south compared to the Mirador Basin must be based principally on absolute dating, although this problem, itself, becomes difficult to resolve when events are dated by 14C (“calibrated” or “uncalibrated”) – still {{the most widely used}} absolute dating method in Mesoamerica – and which cannot be rendered more fine-grained than ca. 100 years and often is less precise. Accordingly, the debate about temporal priority will remain unresolved <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> other absolute dating methods such as archaeomagnetics and luminescence (hitherto, thermoluminescence), are applied more widely, or Long Count-dated texts, e.g., Cycle 6, are found earlier than those found thus far, which are Cycle 7. While relative dating methods – principally ceramic – are highly reliable, having been cross-referenced from many sites, and with sophisticated statistics available, unless anchored to absolute dates, these remain uncertain especially when the scholar’s focus is on the early periods of development in Mesoamerica.|$|E
500|$|In April 1942 Walker {{joined the}} Operations Division (OPD) of the War Department General Staff as {{executive}} officer of Brigadier General St. Clair Streett's Theater Group. He co-authored a memorandum with Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower in which they advanced {{the position that the}} determinations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [...] "must be taken as authoritative <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> modified by the same or higher authority." [...] After his death, Walker was awarded the Legion of Merit in recognition of his contributions as a staff officer at OPD.|$|E
500|$|Whilst {{the royal}} {{prerogative}} is deployed by the UK government when making (and unmaking) treaties, the Supreme Court held in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union {{that it does}} not give the government the power to serve notice of termination of the UK's membership of the EU (under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union), <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> Parliament decides to do so. The Court's reasoning was that such a notice will inevitably affect rights under domestic law (many EU rights having direct effect in the UK), in which realm the royal prerogative has no application. [...] Nor was there scope for inferring that when enacting the European Communities Act 1972 Parliament had intended royal prerogative powers to survive for the purpose of serving such a notice. [...] Consequently, only Parliament can decide to serve such a notice.|$|E

500|$|The Chicago Police Department had {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} Burge through its Office of Professional Standards (OPS). Known as the Goldston Report (September 28, 1990) for its lead investigator, this internal report determined that [...] "the preponderance of evidence is that abuse did occur {{and that it was}} systematic." [...] The report [...] "listed the names of fifty alleged victims of torture and brutality, the names of detectives who had been involved, and stated: 'Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end'." [...] The 1990 report was never publicly released, as it was customary to keep such internal investigations private <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> prosecution took place. But it was the basis of the process of the Police Department's suspension, hearing and firing of Burge in 1991-1993.|$|E
500|$|In January 2009, Morgan appealed again under {{paragraph}} 3 of Schedule 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to the High Court of England and Wales requesting {{a review of}} the minimum term recommendation. This too was rejected, in July of that year, with the presiding judge, Mr Justice Openshaw recommending, [...] "The sentence is– and remains– a sentence of imprisonment for life. The defendant may not even be considered for release until he has served at least 20 years (less the time served before sentence). That {{is not to say that}} he will then be released; indeed he will be detained <b>unless</b> <b>and</b> <b>until</b> the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer presents a risk to the public.
