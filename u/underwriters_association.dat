5000|$|Regulation of the {{insurance}} industry began in the United States in the 1940s, through several United States Supreme Court rulings. The first ruling on insurance {{had taken place in}} 1868 (in the Paul v. Virginia ruling), with the Supreme Court ruling that insurance policy contracts were not in themselves commercial contracts and that insurance was not subject to federal regulation. This [...] "judicial accident", as it has been called, influenced the development of state-level insurance regulation. This stance did not change until 1944 (in the United States v. South-Eastern <b>Underwriters</b> <b>Association</b> ruling [...] ), when the Supreme Court upheld a ruling stating that policies were commercial, and thus were regulatable as other similar contracts were.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Supreme Court {{found in}} the 1944 case of United States v. South-Eastern <b>Underwriters</b> <b>Association</b> that the {{business}} of insurance was subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. [...] The United States Congress, however, responded almost immediately with the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. [...] The McCarran-Ferguson Act specifically provides that the regulation {{of the business of}} insurance by the state governments is in the public interest. Further, the Act states that no federal law should be construed to invalidate, impair or supersede any law enacted by any state government for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, unless the federal law specifically relates to the business of insurance.|$|E
5000|$|Since the Paul case in 1868, it {{had been}} widely {{believed}} {{that the federal government}} was excluded from regulating the insurance industry. Before the South-Eastern <b>Underwriters</b> <b>Association</b> case, [...] "insurance already {{was one of the most}} highly regulated industries in the American economy," [...] with every state having an insurance department and detailed laws on protection of policy holders in case of insolvency. But regulation of other aspects of iinsurance varied widely among the states. The prospect of a federal take-over of insurance regulation, alarmed state regulators and thirty five states had filed amicus curiae briefs supporting the decision of the district court. State insurance regulators and insurance executives complained to Congress that the decision would upset the extensive system of state regulation and taxation (as Justice Jackson had warned), even though Attorney General Biddle denied any such intent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{question}} in the case, as formulated by the Court itself, was [...] "whether the Commerce Clause grants to Congress the power to regulate insurance transactions stretching across state lines." [...] For nearly 80 years before then, the Supreme Court had consistently held that [...] "Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce,” [...] "the business of insurance is not commerce," [...] and [...] "contracts of insurance are not commerce at all, neither state nor interstate." [...] Those cases, however, dealt with the negative implications of the Commerce Clause, i.e., whether the business was [...] "interstate commerce" [...] such {{that it could not}} be regulated by the individual states. The South-Eastern Underwriters case, however, involved the question whether the business of insurance was [...] "interstate commerce" [...] sufficient to allow Congressional regulation. The Supreme Court in United States v. South-Eastern <b>Underwriters</b> <b>Association,</b> 322 U.S. 533 (1944), 4-3 decision written by Justice Hugo Black, reversed the district court, holding that (1) the Sherman Act intended to cover the alleged acts of monopolization; and (2) that the transaction of insurance across state lines was [...] "commerce among the states" [...] which the Constitution permitted Congress to regulate.|$|E
5000|$|In 1942, at {{the request}} of the Attorney General of Missouri (whose {{insurance}} regulators felt powerless to correct abuses they had identified since 1922), the Department of Justice investigated and a grand jury in Georgia indicted the South-Eastern <b>Underwriters</b> <b>Association,</b> 27 of its officers and 198 member companies. The indictment charged the defendants with two counts of antitrust violations: (1) conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act to fix the premium rates on certain fire insurance policies and boycott non-complying independent sales agencies that did not comply; and (2) monopolization of markets for the sale of fire insurance policies in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The district court sustained the defendants' demurrer and dismissed the indictment, holding that [...] "the business of insurance is not commerce, either intrastate or interstate" [...] and that it [...] "is not interstate commerce or interstate trade, though it might be considered a trade subject to local laws either State or Federal, where the commerce clause is not the authority relied upon." [...] In January 1955 the Supreme Court heard arguments on the prosecutors' appeal from the district court.|$|E

40|$|The {{insurance}} industry {{is one of}} the oldest industries in the world, with some accounts dating it as far back as the Code of Hammurabi (Code) –the first known set of codified laws that were promulgated by the famed Babylonian king. The practice of bottomry, “one of the earliest forms of insurance... used throughout the ancient world,” can conservatively be traced to the Code, which was created in the eighteenth century B. C. There is further evidence suggesting that, prior to the establishment of the Code, the Babylonians entered into primitive insurance contracts as far back as the fourth millennium B. C. The modern {{insurance industry}} has its roots in the well-known insurance company Lloyd’s of London, which began underwriting marine insurance policies in English coffee houses in 1688. Underwriting is the process by which insurers determine whether, and at what cost, to insure against a given risk. The United States currently has the world’s largest insurance market. As of 2005, the American insurance industry “employ[ed] about 2. 3 million people, and insurance gross premiums totaled $ 1. 15 trillion. ” In 2006, insurance gross premiums totaled $ 1. 4 trillion, an increase of nine percent over the 2005 totals, and there were 7660 domestic insurers in the United States. Yet, despite the prevalence and importance of insurance, the industry remains almost entirely regulated by state law. The primary federal statute dealing with insurance, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, declares that “the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest” and that “[n]o Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance.... ” With the ubiquity of insurance in our society, the industry affects nearly everyone and influences a vast array of relationships; however, many are unaware of the ways in which insurance impacts their lives until something goes wrong. There are myriad social institutions that shape the lives of individuals, and it would be cumbersome to contemplate each one on a daily basis. For many, “[i]t is enough that they work and that we know how to use them. ” This Comment seeks to address an issue of primary importance for many homeowners in coastal Massachusetts—the inability to purchase property insurance through the voluntary market. In many areas of the Massachusetts seacoast, private insurers have completely withdrawn coverage. The only means through which many of these homeowners can obtain property insurance is through the Massachusetts Property Insurance <b>Underwriters</b> <b>Association</b> (MPIUA), a state agency organized under the Massachusetts Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) statute. The MPIUA is intended to act as an “insurer of last resort,” allowing homeowners otherwise unable to buy property insurance through the private market to obtain property insurance through the government sponsored program. While the MPIUA was meant to be an insurer of last resort, it has quickly become the primary insurer in several Massachusetts coastal markets. While the MPIUA is laudatory in its goals, this Comment addresses serious flaws inherent in the MPIUA and its potential shortcomings in the event of a catastrophe. Part II of this Comment discusses key factors that have led to a coastal property insurance meltdown. Chief amongst these factors is an increase in the frequency and severity of catastrophic events (most particularly hurricanes) which has led to increased exposure and liability for insurance companies in vulnerable markets. Part II also introduces the concept of FAIR Plans (both in Massachusetts, and, briefly, in other markets) and analyzes how the MPIUA became the primary insurer for many Massachusetts coastal property owners. Part III concentrates on the statute that enabled the creation of the MPIUA, the statutory authority and limitations imposed on the MPIUA (as well as its potential shortcomings), and a study of a legal dispute between the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance concerning the appropriate interpretation and application of the statutory authority granted to the MPIUA. Finally, Part IV examines why FAIR Plans are typically ill-suited to act as primary insurers, and contains a discussion of different approaches which could be taken to remedy the coastal property insurance conundrum...|$|E
