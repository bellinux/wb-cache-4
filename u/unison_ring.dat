40|$|This Master Thesis was {{accomplished}} {{during the period}} 20 th August 2007 to 18 th of January 2008 at Volvo Aero Corporation. The Master Thesis was the final moment in the MSc programme in Mechanical Engineering at Lule√• University of Technology. During {{the development of a}} new aero engine family a new Variable Bleed Valve system (VBV-system) was designed, the second phase of this design was to reduce the weight of the components by considering alternative materials and methods of manufacture: thus improving Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). Several concepts were discussed with regards to the VBV- system and one of these was to replace some of the existing metallic (Aluminum & Titanium) components with a composite alternative and the <b>unison</b> <b>ring</b> was considered to be a prime candidate for this study. The challenge in using composites is the complexity of the material. Different mechanical properties and performance can be achieved by different numbers of layers, fiber orientations and choice of fiber and matrix. In order to use composites, a full understanding of the mechanical behavior of the <b>unison</b> <b>ring</b> is required. This resulted in a review study of the existing <b>unison</b> <b>ring.</b> The most important task was to investigate how changes in the <b>unison</b> <b>ring</b> stiffness could affect the opening and closing of the 10 VBV doors, located in the Fan Hub Frame. With the results given in the review study, a concept generation (including basic laminate theory) was made to determine the final concept design. From the concept generation, it was determined that the <b>unison</b> <b>ring</b> should be designed as a sandwich, with composite laminates on top and bottom. Between the two composite laminates foam or honeycomb should be used. The composite material was chosen to be a standard aerospace composite, which are based on long fiber reinforcements (carbon) with epoxy matrix. Most of the fibers are orientated along the <b>unison</b> <b>ring,</b> to keep both tensile stiffness (AE) and bending stiffness along the <b>unison</b> <b>ring</b> as high as possible. To ensure that the composite laminate was fiber dominated, at least 10 % of the fibers and a maximum of 60 % of the fibers were oriented in four different directions. The research performed in this study has been a limited concept study, therefore more studies are needed before a final design can be achieved. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Currently unison {{rings in}} the high {{pressure}} compression region of aeroengines are made in metal. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to develop an alternative hybride (metal/composite) design concept which considered weight, cost and functional aspects. Of particular interest was the investigation of a thermal strain compatibility with metals in transient temperature fields. Using finite element (FE) analysis it was possible to design a successful composite <b>unison</b> <b>ring</b> for the compression stage of an aeroengine. Some aspects of the concept have been verified in practice, so that the application of this technology in aerengines is now possible. (orig.)
