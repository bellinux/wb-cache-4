As former slaves of Cherokee citizens, the Freedmen were adopted into the Cherokee Nation after the Civil War pursuant to a treaty with the United States, and given <b>unqualified</b> <b>rights</b> of citizenship. The incorporation of the Freedmen into the tribe was resisted from the start, and now, faced with a decision of the Cherokee Nation’s highest court affirming the descendents’ citizenship rights, the Nation prepares to vote on a constitutional amendment which would impose an Indian “blood quantum” requirement for citizenship. If approved, potentially thousands of African-descended citizens would be eliminated from the tribal registry. In this Article, Professor Ray examines the legal and social history of the Cherokee Freedmen to criticize and reject definitions of Cherokee political identity based on either the federal Dawes Rolls of the allotment era, or notions of “Indian blood. ” Both, he argues, are heteronymous authorities for determining tribal citizenship criteria and should be replaced by the critical hermeneutic of indigenous cultural resources. Professor Ray offers a model for constructing tribal citizenship criteria that attempts to deliver ancestry from biology, and law from legal fetishism of the Dawes Rolls. The wise use of sovereignty, he suggests, requires sustained dialogue between Freedmen’s descendents and Cherokees by ancestry, not the “quick fix” of the political process...|$|R

The technologic and mostly social development implies continually higher demands on real property owners. A legal possibility of the public {{interference with}} the right of real property ownership is clearly necessary in the course of arrangements and operation of technical infrastructure which forms an essential physical back-bone of energy, electronic communications and water management industries. Specific technical infrastructure and construction laws need to reflect both the already existing property relationships between real property owners and technical infrastructure operators and the emerging ones. The private settlement of those relationships in compliance with Civil Code is generally preferred. Because of the obvious public interest on technical infrastructure development the public law supports technical infrastructure operators with respect to real property owners' rights to gain and exercise the right of way which is necessary to arrange and operate relevant elements of technical infrastructure.

40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court in District Attorney’s Office v. Osborne confronted {{novel and}} complex {{constitutional}} {{questions regarding the}} postconviction protections offered to potentially innocent convicts. Two decades after DNA testing exonerated the first inmate in the United States, the Court heard its first claim by a convict seeking DNA testing that could prove innocence. I argue that, contrary to early accounts, the Court did not reject {{a constitutional right to}} postconviction DNA testing. Despite language suggesting the Court would not “constitutionalize the issue” by announcing an <b>unqualified</b> freestanding <b>right,</b> Chief Justice Roberts’s majority opinion proceeded to carefully fashion an important, but qualified and derivative procedural due process right. While denying relief to Osborne for narrow factual and procedural reasons, the Court’s ruling swept more broadly. The Court held that states with postconviction discovery rules, as almost all have enacted, may not arbitrarily deny access to postconviction DNA testing, and then pointed to the generous provisions of the federal Innocence Protection Act as a model for an adequate statute. The Court also continued to assume that litigants may assert constitutional claims of actual innocence in habeas proceedings. In this Essay, I explore the contours of the Osborne due process right, its larger implications for constitutional interpretation, and, more specifically, whether the decision has the potential to create pressure on the States to provide meaningful avenues for convicts to litigate their innocence...|$|R

This involved British warships blockading the port of Beira to try to cause economic collapse in Rhodesia. Wilson was applauded by most nations for taking a firm stand on the issue (and none extended diplomatic recognition to the Smith régime). A number of nations did not join in with sanctions, undermining their efficiency. Certain sections of public opinion started to question their efficacy, and to demand the toppling of the régime by force.

It is true only of the States where slavery already exists; and it is because the propagandists of slavery are well aware of this, that they are so anxious to establish by positive enactment the seemingly moderate title to a right of existence for their institution in the Territories,--a title which they do not possess, and the possession of which would give them the oyster and the Free States the shells. Laws accordingly are asked for to protect Southern property in the Territories,--that is, to protect the inhabitants from deciding for themselves what their frame of government shall be. Such laws will be passed, and the fairest portion of our national domain irrevocably closed to free labor, if the on-slaveholding States fail to do their duty in the present crisis.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{concept of}} social {{security}} was introduced into the South African constitutional system through section 27 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. Section 27 (l) (c) of the Constitution states that everyone {{has the right to}} have access to social security including, if they are unable to support themselves and their dependants, appropriate social assistance and that the state must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources to achieve the progressive realisation of these rights. Section 28 of the Constitution relates directly to the social security rights of children and drafted as an internally <b>unqualified</b> constitutional <b>right.</b> The Constitutional Court has, however, in The Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others 2000 11 BCLR 1169 (CC), subjected section 28 to the same internal limitations as the other social security rights in the Bill of Rights. The question which this study addresses is whether or not South Africa government is in compliance with its constitutional and international law obligations in respect of the social security rights of children. Social assistance in respect of children takes the form of grants, specifically the child support grant, the foster child grant and the care dependency grant. Due to the categorical nature of children's social security rights, it is submitted that the state is currently conforming to neither the guidelines laid down in the Grootboom case in respect reasonableness and progressive realisation, nor its international obligations in terms of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the United Nations on Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on Human and People's Rights and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. In response to this submission the following are some of the recommendations flowing from this study: 1) In respect of the child support grant, the amount of the grant should be increased to correspond with the prevailing poverty rate and linked to inflation; the grant should be made more universally accessible, to include child headed households, refugee children, children of non-citizens and all {{children under the age of}} 18; the means test should be reviewed or done away with completely and the take-up rate of grant should be improved. 2) The care dependency grant should be extended to include non-citizen and refugee children as well as children with minor disabilities, chronic illnesses and HIVIAIDS or a supplementary needs grant for such children should be introduced. 3) Foster parents should be provided with incentives to take in HIV-positive children or children with disabilities. 4) The courts should, either themselves, or by a mandate to government, start developing minimum core entitlements in respect of basic rights.

Third, {{proposals to}} obstruct skilled migration are ethically and legally complex.
