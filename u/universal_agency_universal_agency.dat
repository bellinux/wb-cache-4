40|$|The role of identities, such as {{national}} and religious identity, in shaping {{individual and group}} positions towards military intervention, has been relatively underexplored. Study 1 (O’Dwyer, Lyons & Cohrs) explored the relationship between national identity and support for military intervention in the Republic of Ireland by elaborating on the social representation of the foreign policy orientation of Irish neutrality. 22 people participated in four focus groups, in which {{participants were asked to}} three vignettes in which hypothetical conflict events were described. A thematic analysis (Braun & Clark, 2001) revealed the existence of four themes: constraint versus <b>agency,</b> <b>universal</b> versus conditional acceptance, moral ambivalence and projecting national identity. In Study 2 (Lyons & Wilson), the role of religious identity and socio-political beliefs on support for military intervention was examined. 32 students (16 Muslim and 16 Christian) in the UK participated in four focus groups. As in Study 1, the discussions centred around three vignettes and participants’ views about involvement in the hypothetical conflicts. Focus group data were analysed using Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Corbin & Strauss, 2007). The analysis revealed the anchoring role of religious identity and socio-political beliefs in individual and group positions’ towards military intervention.

60|$|Following this rude conception, which {{ascribed}} geological phenomena to one agency, acting {{during one}} primeval epoch, {{there came a}} greatly-improved conception, which ascribed them to two agencies, acting alternately during successive epochs. Hutton, perceiving that sedimentary deposits were still being formed {{at the bottom of}} the sea from the detritus carried down by rivers; perceiving, further, that the strata of which the visible surface chiefly consists, bore marks of having been similarly formed out of pre-existing land; and inferring that these strata could have become land only by upheaval after their deposit; concluded that throughout an indefinite past, there had been periodic convulsions, by which continents were raised, with intervening eras of repose, during which such continents were worn down and transformed into new marine strata, fated to be in their turns elevated above the surface of the ocean. And finding that igneous action, to which sundry earlier geologists had ascribed basaltic rocks, was in countless places a cause of disturbance, he taught that from it resulted these periodic convulsions. In this theory we see:--first, that the previously-recognized agency of water was conceived to act, not as by Werner, after a manner of which we have no experience, but after a manner daily displayed to us; and secondly, that the igneous agency, before considered only as originating special formations, was recognized as a <b>universal</b> <b>agency,</b> but assumed to act in an unproved way. Werner's sole process Hutton developed from the catastrophic and inexplicable into the uniform and explicable; while that antagonistic second process, of which he first adequately estimated the importance, was regarded by him as a catastrophic one, and was not assimilated to known processes--not explained. We have here to note, however, that the facts collected and provisionally arranged in conformity with Werner's theory, served, after a time, to establish Hutton's more rational theory--in so far, at least, as aqueous formations are concerned; while the doctrine of periodic subterranean convulsions, crudely as it was conceived by Hutton, was a temporary generalization needful as a step towards the theory of igneous action.|$|R

40|$|From the 1990 s onwards, {{significant}} {{developments have}} occurred in the international telecommunications sector that have affected the South African telecommunications industry and peoples’ access to the network. Rapid developments in Information and Communication Technologies and the reorganisation of telecommunications operators through commercialisation, privatisation and the effects of market liberalisation have resulted in monopoly operators moving away from their public service mandates. Globalisation and adherence to World Trade Organisation rules are causing operators to rebalance their tariffs closer to cost. Long-distance rates are decreasing while the cost of local calls is increasing. High-end users of telecommunications services are benefiting while low-end, largely residential users are being priced off the network. The end result is a negative effect on universal access to telecommunications services. This study examines the extent to which commercialisation, privatisation and liberalization are affecting the provision of telecommunications services and the government’s goal of achieving universal access in South Africa. Qualitative research methods were utilised to establish that the state owned operator, Telkom, has transformed itself from a public service operator to one that is fully commercialised and prepared for an Initial Public Offering and competition. Telkom no longer attempts to ensure that its tariffs are affordable for all people. However, positive developments presented themselves {{in the form of an}} increasingly competent regulator, a reorganised and dedicated <b>Universal</b> Service <b>Agency,</b> and the popularity of cellular telephony. The primary discovery of this study is that the liberalisation of the South African telecommunications sector cannot be assumed to have a negative effect on the provision of service. This study finds that liberalisation will most likely benefit the country through the role out of new infrastructure, the provision of new services and ultimately the reduction of those services themselves. In order for universal access to be achieved in this country the study recommends that the resources of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa be enhanced to enable the regulator oversee the industry effectively. Secondly, the <b>Universal</b> Service <b>Agency</b> must provide clear definitions of universal access and universal service as well as manage the Universal Service Fund with greater efficiency. Lastly, the two bodies mentioned above must ensure that services are affordable for all people of this country...|$|R

60|$|One of the ablest recent {{supporters}} of the Volitional theory has furnished an explanation, at once historically true and philosophically acute, {{of the failure of}} the Greek philosophers in physical inquiry, in which, as I conceive, he unconsciously depicts his own state of mind. “Their stumbling-block was one as {{to the nature of the}} evidence they had to expect for their conviction.... They had not seized the idea that they must not expect to understand the processes of outward causes, but only their results; and consequently, the whole physical philosophy of the Greeks was an attempt to identify mentally the effect with its cause, to feel after some not only necessary but natural connection, where they meant by natural that which would per se carry some presumption to their own mind.... They wanted to see some reason why the physical antecedent should produce this particular consequent, and their only attempts were in directions where they could find such reasons.”(126) In other words, they were not content merely to know that one phenomenon was always followed by another; they thought that they had not attained the true aim of science, unless they could perceive something in the nature of the one phenomenon from which it might have been known or presumed previous to trial that it would be followed by the other: just what the writer, who has so clearly pointed out their error, thinks that he perceives in the nature of the phenomenon Volition. And to complete the statement of the case, he should have added that these early speculators not only made this their aim, but were quite satisfied with their success in it; not only sought for causes which should carry in their mere statement evidence of their efficiency, but fully believed that they had found such causes. The reviewer can see plainly that this was an error, because he does not believe that there exist any relations between material phenomena which can account for their producing one another; but the very fact of the persistency of the Greeks in this error, shows that their minds were in a very different state: they were able to derive from the assimilation of physical facts to other physical facts, the kind of mental satisfaction which we connect with the word explanation, and which the reviewer would have us think can only be found in referring phenomena to a will. When Thales and Hippo held that moisture was the universal cause, and external element, of which all other things were but the infinitely various sensible manifestations; when Anaximenes predicated the same thing of air, Pythagoras of numbers, and the like, they all thought that they had found a real explanation; and were content to rest in this explanation as ultimate. The ordinary sequences of the external universe appeared to them, no less than to their critic, to be inconceivable without the supposition of some <b>universal</b> <b>agency</b> to connect the antecedents with the consequents; but they did not think that Volition, exerted by minds, was the only agency which fulfilled this requirement. Moisture, or air, or numbers, carried to their minds a precisely similar impression of making intelligible what was otherwise inconceivable, and gave the same full satisfaction to the demands of their conceptive faculty.|$|R

After a brief biographical and intellectual orientation, the theme of history and eschatology in Levinas’s work will be explored as guiding theme of his thought. To him, history is for the powerful flow of being that undermines ethical subjectivity; eschatology refers to the interruption of history by its other: ethics. In this exposition, attention will be given to his relationship with Rosenweig and Buber. An analysis of the central notion of ethics as infinite responsibility to the other as well as the political thrust of it, namely the search for justice for the other as brother, will be presented as Levinas’s philosophical interpretation of eschatology. The question of justice spontaneously leads us to a twin question: to whom am I responsible? Who is Israel? A tension between <b>universal</b> ethical <b>agency</b> and particularistic Jewish identity will be explored. From the preceding discussion conclusions will be drawn relevant to the particularity of Israel and the Jewish religious literature and their place in Levinas’s philosophy of history and eschatology. This will allow for a suggestion on how to understand the relation between the Greek and Jewish elements of Levinas’s work...|$|R

We have characterized trypanosome isolates from Molossidae bats captured in Mozambique, Africa. Morphology and behaviour in culture, supported by phylogenetic inferences using SSU (small subunit) rRNA, gGAPDH (glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase) and Cyt b (cytochrome b) genes, allowed to classify the isolates as a new Schizotrypanum species named Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) erneyi sp. nov. This is the first report of a Schizotrypanum species from African bats cultured, characterized morphologically and biologically, and positioned in phylogenetic trees. The unprecedented finding of a new species of the subgenus Schizotrypanum from Africa that is closest related to the America-restricted Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi marinkellei and T. cruzi provides new insights into the origin and evolutionary history of T. cruzi and closely related bat trypanosomes. Altogether, data from our study support the hypothesis of an ancestor trypanosome parasite of bats evolving to infect other mammals, even humans, and adapted to transmission by triatomine bugs in the evolutionary history of T. cruzi in the New World.

Gravitational flow systems of various horizontal and vertical extents are organized into hierarchically nested complex patterns controlled by the configuration of the water table’s relief and modified by the rock framework’s heterogeneities of permeability. The systems are ubiquitous and act simultaneously on broad ranges of the spatial and temporal scales of measurement. Their <b>universal</b> geologic <b>agency</b> is manifest by numerous different, even disparate, natural processes and phenomena. Several of these are associated with geothermal heat flow.

40|$|THISARTICLE {{primarily}} {{attempts to}} discover {{the place of the}} newspaper today and in the predictable future as a part of permanent book collections. Thus, it deals with the general political newspaper in all its forms, as it was visualized, for instance, by the compilers of the Union List of Newspapers, published by the H. W. Wilson Company in 1937. The thoughts and statements found in this article are derived from expressions about and observations of conditions in Western countries only, primarily the United States. There {{is no doubt that the}} peculiar nature of the newspaper is responsible for its problematic position among the various materials acquired by libraries. And it is not only its form, its mass, its rate of growth that is offering unusual problems to its integration in the library’s book stock, but even more perhaps its internal character, its content. The general attitude towards the newspaper, shared by many men of the book, is traceable to the inevitably continuous intrusion of this protean vehicle of the printed word, with its gossip large and small, its sensational news and its sensational advertising, and to the casual way in which it is used. But man concerned with studying seriously his own environment has for some time discovered that the newspaper is by its very nature a source for his purposes for which historians of pre-newspaper times rightly envy him. The work of many historians reflects this value of the newspaper. J. F. Rhodesl and Lucy M. Salmon, 2 two eminent Americans, have not only used newspapers extensively in their works, but shown in critical works how they may be used. Rhodes said in 1909 that it is not the duty of the historian to find out whether the newspapers are as good as they should be, but to study their in 3 uence upon their environment and their importance as contemporary and <b>universal</b> news <b>agencies</b> of the past.

Determinants of corporate financial disclosure in an unregulated environment: Evidence from the early 20 th century In this paper we investigate the determinants of corporate financial reporting in an unregulated setting. Prior to the First World War, limited liability companies in Belgium were obliged to publish a financial statement, but financial reporting was virtually unregulated. Investor protection was generally very poor. Nevertheless, Belgian stock markets were booming. We relate reporting choices to (i) costs of asymmetric information; (ii) the controlling influences from <b>universal</b> banks; (iii) <b>agency</b> conflicts of debt; (iv) dividend payments; (v) corporate performance and (vi) industry. Using a unique sample of 567 firm-year observations for 131 listed Belgian firms, we document that while {{the amount of information}} disclosed in the financial statements was generally low relative to the current levels of disclosure, there was also significant variation in financial reporting across firms. Our results suggest that financial reporting choices were significantly affected by universal bank affiliations, bond financing and stock returns.
