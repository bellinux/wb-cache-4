40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to investigate, in a {{free-living}} opportunistic breeder, the <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbill</b> (Loxia leucoptera), the degree to which annual changes in photoperiod and differences in the timing of breeding in different years correlate with the secretion of reproductive hormones.

50|$|Numerous {{species of}} songbirds extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the Clark's nutcracker, black-capped chickadee, {{mountain}} chickadee, boreal chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, pygmy nuthatch, red <b>crossbill,</b> <b>white-winged</b> <b>crossbill,</b> dark-eyed junco, and pine siskin. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume {{vast quantities of}} seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. Woodpeckers commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Blue grouse forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover.|$|R
40|$|On 28 June 1977 Stephen B. Vander Wall {{observed}} <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbills</b> (Loxia leucoptera) at {{an elevation}} of 2500 m {{on the crest of}} the Bear River Range, 13 km west of Laketown, northern Cache and Rich Cos., Utah. Having censused this area monthly since May 1976, I am certain the species was not present before the last week of June 1977. This occurrence in itself is surprising since only two small flocks had previously been reported in Utah (Worthen 1973, Behle and Perry 1975). Subsequently, I suspected breeding activities in early July and made weekly observations to verify breeding. Also, I captured, examined and banded 19 <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbills</b> at a small (3 ̆c 75 3 ̆em 2) stock pond adjacent to a subalpine meadow on 28 July (7 captured), 6 August (8) and 16 August (4). The pond was the only source of surface water within several km 2 during 19772 ̆ 7 s extreme summer drought in the region. Many species, including Red Crosssbills (L. curvirostra), regularly visited the pond and were easily mist-netted. The nets were baited with salt to attract crossbills (see Samson 1976). Birds stopped visiting the pond in mid-August when it went dry. However, the addition of 200 l of water on 14 August was effective in reattracting many species including crossbills...|$|R
50|$|The Pack River {{watershed}} {{is home to}} {{a number}} of species protected by the Endangered Species Act. Bull trout, a threatened species, hatch in the upper river, and migrate the length of the river to grow upwards of 30 inches in Lake Pend Oreille before returning as adults to spawn again in the upper river. Terrestrial species found here include the endangered woodland caribou and grey wolf, and threatened species grizzly bear, Canada lynx, and bald eagle. Idaho wildlife species of special concern supported by the Pack River watershed include the wolverine, fisher, northern goshawk, and the <b>white-winged</b> <b>crossbill.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{other species}} of birds {{can be seen in}} the park. Seaducks, loons, gannets, gulls and alcids {{frequent}} the beaches. Especially common are the razorbill, the surf scoter, the black scoter, the long-tailed duck, the red-throated loon, the common loon, and the lesser black-backed gull. Brant geese, including the occasional black brant, can sometimes be seen at the athletic fields in foul weather. A flock of Bonaparte's gulls inhabits the park in winter. Farther inland, orange-crowned warblers, <b>white-winged</b> <b>crossbills</b> and red crossbills have been reported. Other birds found in the park have been white-winged gulls, little gulls, black-headed gulls, the sooty shearwater, the black-legged kittiwake, the parasitic jaeger, the vesper sparrow and the snow bunting.|$|R
40|$|As far as {{the birds}} are concerned, this was an uneventful winter, {{with only a few}} rarities. Highlights include the second pile-up of rare gulls at L. McConaughy, and a Common Redpoll influx. Best of the rarities (all subject to Records {{committee}} scrutiny and pending its acceptance) were a 5 th record Red-necked Grebe at L. McConaughy; a first-record Mew Gull at L. McConaughy; Iceland, Lesser Black-backed, and Great Black-backed Gulls at L. McConaughy; a Cassin’s Finch at Crawford; <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbills</b> at Norfolk and North Platte; and a Hoary Redpoll at Wakefield. Out-of-season reports were record-early Blue-winged Teal in Dixon Co, Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull in Lancaster Co, record-late Bonaparte 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls at Sutherland Res, and 2 nd-record wintering Great-tailed Grackles at Lincoln...|$|R
40|$|This {{winter was}} {{generally}} mild with {{most parts of}} the state at least somewhat dry. The most interesting avian phenomena were a major incursion of <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbills</b> and a warm-up in late January which resulted in several waterfowl species putting in very early appearances. Because of the latter, it was difficult to assess the status (wintering or migrant) of birds reported in late January to early February from major reservoirs and waterfowl concentration spots without some information on ice conditions. Thanks to Larry Einemann, I had detailed information about ice conditions at Branched Oak L, but I would appreciate a few notes on other reservoirs during the winter. Jan Johnson pointed out that my reporting of records from the Wakefield School feeders that she maintains did not make it clear that these feeders are in fact in Wayne County, as are the southern 3 blocks of the town. My apologies; I believe (hope) that this may only be a problem in the Winter 2000 - 2001 report, recently published in Nebraska Bird Review. This winter offered many items of interest; a brief summary follows. Surprising late sightings included the 2 nd-latest ever American Bittern; the 4 th-latest Baltimore Oriole; and 5 species of shorebirds-most of which were spotted at Pawnee L-that were as much as 3 weeks later than previous latest dates. In contrast, several waterfowl species had influxes in late January, noticeably Greater White-fronted Goose. The Eurasian Collared-Dove continues to increase, although so far it has avoided major population centers in the east. A major invasion of <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbills</b> occurred, and Snowy Owls were more in evidence than usual. Noticeable for their absence were American Black Duck and Evening Grosbeak. Rarities were unspectacular; the best were 5 species usually not encountered in a winter report: Cinnamon Teal, Sage Thrasher, Pine Warbler, Smith 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur, and Lesser Goldfinch. Also good finds were Tufted Duck, Mew Gull, Great Black-backed Gull, Mountain Chickadee, and Varied Thrush...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{difficult}} to separate from parrot crossbill and Scottish crossbill, both of which breed within its Eurasian range, as plumage distinctions from those two species are negligible, though the head and bill are smaller than in either of the other species. Care is needed in identification, especially in Eurasia, where the glip or chup call {{is probably the best}} indicator. The identification problem is less severe in North America, where only red <b>crossbill</b> and <b>White-winged</b> <b>crossbill</b> occur. However, there has been debate as to whether different call types should be considered separate species. For example, the South Hills crossbill, occurring in the South Hills and Albion Mountains in Idaho {{has been described as a}} new species (Loxia sinesciuris) because it shows a very low degree of hybridization with the red crossbill. There are also genetic differences between the call type populations. Nevertheless, few ornithologists have chosen to give these forms species status.|$|R
5000|$|White-tailed {{deer are}} {{numerous}} {{and many are}} hit by motorists on roads in northern Wisconsin year-round. Black bears, foxes, raccoons, rabbits, beavers, river otters, squirrels, chipmunks, pheasants, grouse and wild turkeys are popular game in these northern woods. Elk and wolves have been reintroduced {{and there have been}} sightings of moose and pine marten. [...] Bird species include northern cardinal, blue jay, gray jay, common raven, boreal and black-capped chickadees, black-backed and pileated woodpeckers, red-winged blackbirds, owls, ducks, common loons, bald eagles, evening grosbeaks, red and <b>white-winged</b> <b>crossbills</b> and many species of thrushes, sparrows and warblers. Brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout are found in many miles of excellent streams. Walleye, small and largemouth bass, crappie, northern pike, and many species of panfish make the area's lakes famous for freshwater fishing. A record muskellunge, Wisconsin's state fish, was caught in these waters. The beauty, heritage, and recreational opportunities of these majestic forests draw thousands of tourists to the Chequamegon-Nicolet area every year.|$|R
40|$|The {{most obvious}} {{feature of this}} winter’s avian {{movements}} {{was the number of}} Snowy Owls, unprecedented in living memory, that invaded the state. A tally maintained by Joel Jorgensen and Lauren Dinan of Nebraska Game and Parks indicated that over 200 snowies were found in the state, and most were documented. Not as popular with the public, but perhaps of greater scientific interest were the mid-winter reports of species normally rare at this time of year. Most notable in this respect were waterfowl, grebes, cranes, and sparrows. A read-through of these species suggests the very mild winter experienced over most of Nebraska allowed a number of species to linger into winter, if not survive into spring. Cranes were an interesting case; a large flock of Sandhills actually overwintered, a rare occurrence, while a Whooping Crane family and a lone Common Crane moved into Nebraska with early-migrating Sandhill Cranes. Related was the appearance at feeders of two Pheucticus grosbeaks, but only one <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbill</b> sighting (3 birds) ensued, despite an incursion of the species into Iowa...|$|R
2500|$|The Athabasca Plain {{ecoregion}} in the Boreal Shield provides {{breeding grounds}} for the Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus), <b>white-winged</b> <b>crossbill</b> (Loxia leucoptera), Cape May warbler (Dendroica tigrina), Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata). In the south west area of the Boreal Shield ecozone lays the Churchill River Upland which has the second highest population of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). [...] This Upland area is home to waterfowl, such as the common loon (Gavia immer), red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), {{as well as other}} ducks, and geese on the many lakes of the region. The raven (Corvus corax), spruce grouse, gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis), Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis), northern three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and hawk owl (Surnia ulula) can be sighted in the boreal forests. The Mid-Boreal Upland ecoregion features these characteristic birds: white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), ovenbird, (Seiurus aurocapillus) and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus). The ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula) and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are common sightings in the Mid-Boreal Lowland ecoregion.|$|R
40|$|During {{winter in}} the United States and {{southern}} Canada, the Common Redpoll (Carduelis /lammea) generally is considered a bird of open woodlands, weed patches, fields, and brushy fence rows, where it feeds mainly on birch (Betula) and alder (Alnus) seeds (Godfrey, The Birds of Canada, Nat. Mus. Bull. No. 203, 1966). Thus, in a mixed flock with 30 <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbills</b> (Loxia leucoptera) and several Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) on 30 November 1977, 26 km east of Preston, Franklin Co., Idaho, I {{was surprised to see}} 25 Common Redpolls feeding on cones at the top of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). At 13 : 00 on 7 December 1977, I found 25 Common Redpolls and 25 Pine Siskins feeding on spruce cones in the Bear River Mountains (elev. = 2500 m), Cache Co., 18 km west of Laketown, Utah. I collected 2 males and 1 female from this flock. Previously, only 3 specimens of redpolls had been collected in Utah, but sight records have increased in recent years (Hayward et a!., Birds of Utah, Great Basin Nat. Mem. 1, 1976). Several other mixed flocks containing 20 - 50 redpolls were seen that day...|$|R
40|$|This {{winter was}} {{generally}} unremarkable {{except for the}} occurrence of good numbers of several species at {{the western edge of}} the state, notably Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Pygmy Nuthatch, and Bohemian Waxwing. There were a couple of sightings of Mountain Chickadee and one of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Finch for good measure. All of the winter finches on the Nebraska list (except for Hoary Redpoll) appeared, most notably Pine Grosbeak, represented by two birds. One of these was in the southwest (Kansas had several reports) but the other was in the east, suggesting either multiple points of origin, or, as suggested by some in Kansas, northern rather than western origin. Also in good numbers were Red-breasted Nuthatches, but Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrows were scarce. Black-capped Chickadees remained in very low numbers in southern Nebraska west of the Missouri River Valley. Of interest was the discovery of wintering Marsh and Winter Wrens along the central Niobrara Valley; perhaps this is a regular occurrence, but who 2 ̆ 7 s been looking? This phenomenon may be linked to other occurrences that would be expected in a warmer winter: several species of ducks that are generally not seen in midwinter were found on the Scottsbluff and Gering Sewage Lagoons, sapsuckers were in good numbers, catbirds and Brown Thrashers put in unexpected winter appearances, and a Loggerhead Shrike was far to the north. Notable sightings were several, ranging from huge counts to birds rare in winter but expected at other times to bona fide rarities, although the last is a matter of one 2 ̆ 7 s definition of rare. Best sightings in these categories were probably the 2, 000, 000 Snow Geese reported (half the North American population), 4 Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes, a financially savvy Sharp-tailed Grouse, a first-documented Dec Osprey, 3 rd-latest Least Sandpipers, Great Black-backed and lceland Gulls, first winter record for White-winged Dove, 9568 crows and 10, 216 robins at Calamus Res, <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbill,</b> and, of course, 2 Pine Grosbeaks...|$|R
40|$|This rather mild season {{stood out}} for its {{wintering}} waterfowl, most obviously at Keystone L, where Stephen Dinsmore counted an amazing 22 species of waterfowl on 29 January. Check the species {{accounts for the}} incredible wintering numbers; species were topped by Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s first Tufted Duck, and assorted other goodies, such as 5 Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes, Waterfowl, loons, and grebes also rewrote the midwinter record book, including no fewer than 3 Red-necked Grebes, Some interesting wintering birds also appeared at Harlan Co Res, Other interesting winter records, some no doubt due to the mild fall, included Greater Yellowlegs at two locations, Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull and an adult Black-legged Kittiwake at Harlan Co Res, wintering Hermit Thrush at L Ogallala, a January Gray Catbird in the northwest, a male Dickcissel at Alma, and Orange-erowned and Northern Parula warblers in December, the latter at Keystone L! Sparrows which generally winter only very rarely in NE were well-represented, although poorly-documented, including a Smith 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur in Cass Co, Present in good numbers were Northern Shrike and Purple Finch, the latter welcome after some low years, and Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire appeared in low numbers. The Eurasian Collared-Dove continued its expansion in the state, even breeding during the winter period! Westerly reports involved a Red-bellied Woodpecker in Scotts Bluff Co, Carolina Wrens pushing westward, and Winter Wrens wintering in the L McConaughy area, This winter produced some outstanding rarities also, Hiding among the numerous scaup,a Tufted Duck at Keystone L proved a frustrating dip-twitch for many, while a Pomarine Jaeger and Mew Gull were well seen only by one Stephen Dinsmore (who also found, and refound many times for others, the Tufted Duck), Possibly most frustrating was what would likely have been a first state record Slaty-backed Gull at Harlan Co Res, {{which could not be}} refound despite a two-day search, A tantalizing record was of Golden-crowned Sparrows in Cherry Co in early December, the 2 nd winter in a row for this species. A Dark-eyed (Gray-headed) Junco was spotted in Papillion, and a couple of <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbills</b> were found...|$|R
40|$|Some {{of you may}} {{be curious}} about the sources of {{sightings}} I use to compile these reports. The primary sources are reports posted to NEBirds, the Nebraska Listserv, along with the full reports (early and late dates, peak counts for all species) sent by a few faithful reporters around the state. The latter reports are very useful overviews of movements in the reporters 2 ̆ 7 regions. Lately, thanks to a suggestion by Clem Klaphake, I have been receiving the eBird daily rarity report for Nebraska which I find to be an excellent check against reports posted to NEBirds, while providing a few additional reports of interest. As eBird becomes a major depository and source of data, how {{and to what extent}} these data can be utilized by seasonal reporters and state records committees is a topic under serious discussion. More on that as it unfolds. In these reports, I often cite 2 ̆ 2 early dates 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 late dates. 2 ̆ 2 These follow the style in Birds of Nebraska (Sharpe et al., 2001) and refer to the first or last set of accumulated dates that are within a few days of each other, preferably 3 or fewer, and so presumably define a sort of 2 ̆ 2 consensus 2 ̆ 2 arrival or departure date. Now to the birds. This was an interesting fall in several ways. Raptor enthusiasts were excited about Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Hawk and Crested Caracara reports, while nesting Mississippi Kites, Broad-winged Hawks, and Ospreys added interest. An amazing number of wood-warblers were found in the west, notably such rarities as Tennessee, Nashville, Magnolia, Bay-breasted, Chestnut-sided, and Blackburnian. I often think {{that the best way to}} find these 2 ̆ 2 eastern 2 ̆ 2 birds is to go west! A few wood-warblers arrived early: Black-and-white, Tennessee, Nashville, and Mourning. Perhaps most exciting was the appearance of almost the full suite of Rocky Mountain birds and 2 ̆ 2 winter finches 2 ̆ 2 that are somewhat expected from time to time, with Pine Grosbeak the only exception. Steller 2 ̆ 7 s Jay, Mountain Chickadee, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Finch, and Evening Grosbeak were out west, Red and <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbills</b> were in the east, and Common Redpoll was essentially statewide...|$|R
40|$|This season, {{partly due}} to the {{departure}} of my co-writer Joel Jorgensen and {{partly due to}} mental aging, I have shortened the species accounts by including only data that add to our current knowledge base. I will not routinely list early and late dates and peak counts for each species unless they are significant; readers should refer to past issues of NBR for guidelines as to what are early or late dates and high counts. Observers are, however, urged to report early and late dates and high counts of all migrant species; {{it is difficult to know}} if a sighting is significant until all the reports are pooled in my computer. In general, most observers thought this a fairly routine fall, although the Panhandle continued to be a source of significant new information, thanks to consistent coverage by Steven Dinsmore. Similar coverage of the Rainwater Basin by Joel Jorgensen also has enhanced our knowledge considerably. Every report is valuable: very few of the large list of observers fail to have at least one of their sightings included in the report. There were no new species added to the state list this fall, but this year was amazing in that respect, with 7 new species (some awaiting approval by the Records Committee) bringing the total state list to a very respectable 441 species. Rarest this fall was the pair of Black-bellied Whistling-Ducks in the Rainwater Basin, a second documented state record. Also very rare were a 7 th state record White-winged Dove and 8 th state record Lesser Goldfinch. Other interesting finds included a Brant of the western race, 3 Pomarine Jaegers, the first documented central Nebraska Blue-headed Vireo, a Mountain Chickadee, a Varied Thrush, another report of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, the first Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole for fall east of the Panhandle, and a <b>White-winged</b> <b>Crossbill.</b> Some rather amazing counts were made: 35, 000 Western Grebes (considered conservative by the experienced observer!), a total of about 300 Great Egrets, 6000 and 4200 Blue-winged Teal, 1492 Ruddy Ducks (no estimating there!), 12, 000 Cliff Swallows, 16 Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s Sharp-tailed Sparrows, and good numbers of Purple Finches for a change. Interesting range expansions were noted for Carolina Wren, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and Chipping Sparrow, while the continued presence of Pileated Woodpeckers at Fontenelle Forest adds to the uniqueness of that area in terms of species which breed there and nowhere else that we know about: Red-shouldered Hawk and Yellow-throated Warbler are others.
