If F is algebraically closed, this is equivalent to a curve of genus zero; however, the field of all real algebraic functions defined on the real algebraic variety x2+y2= −1 is a field of genus zero {{which is not a}} rational function field.|$|E

The Romans created many primarily decorative <b>unicursal</b> designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic.

50|$|In English, {{the term}} {{labyrinth}} is generally synonymous with maze. As {{a result of}} the long history of <b>unicursal</b> representation of the mythological Labyrinth, however, many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two. In this specialized usage maze refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction, while a <b>unicursal</b> labyrinth has only a single path to the center. A labyrinth in this sense has an unambiguous route to the center and back and presents no navigational challenge.|$|E

50|$|The {{historically}} attested {{instances of}} the symbol appear in two traditional, topologically distinct, forms. The symbol appears in <b>unicursal</b> form, topologically a trefoil knot also {{seen in the}} triquetra. This <b>unicursal</b> form is found, for example, on the Tängelgårda stone. The symbol also appears in tricursal form, consisting of three linked triangles, topologically equivalent to the Borromean rings. This tricursal form {{can be seen on}} one of the Stora Hammars stones, as well as upon the Nene River Ring, and on the Oseberg ship bed post. Although other forms are topologically possible, these are the only attested forms found so far.|$|E

5000|$|Although early Cretan coins {{occasionally}} exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns, the single-path (<b>unicursal)</b> seven-course [...] "Classical" [...] design without branching or {{dead ends}} became {{associated with the}} Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC, and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth - even though both logic and literary descriptions {{make it clear that}} the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze. Even as the designs became more elaborate, visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from Roman times until the Renaissance are almost invariably <b>unicursal.</b> Branching mazes were reintroduced only when garden mazes became popular during the Renaissance.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{resurgence}} of interest in labyrinths and a revival in labyrinth building, of both <b>unicursal</b> and multicursal patterns. In modern imagery, the labyrinth of Daedalus is often represented by a multicursal maze, in which one may become lost.|$|E

5000|$|The use of {{labyrinths}} {{has recently}} been revived in some contexts of Christian worship. Many churches in Europe and North America have constructed permanent, typically <b>unicursal,</b> labyrinths, or employ temporary ones (e.g., painted on canvas or outlined with candles). For example, a labyrinth was {{set up on the}} floor of St Paul's Cathedral for a week in March 2000. Some conservative Christians disapprove of labyrinths, considering them pagan practices or [...] "new age" [...] fads.|$|E
50|$|The <b>unicursal</b> hexagram is a hexagram or six-pointed {{star that}} can be traced or drawn unicursally, in one {{continuous}} line rather than by two overlaid triangles. The hexagram can also be depicted inside a circle with the points touching it. It is often depicted in an interlaced form with {{the lines of the}} hexagram passing over and under one another to form a knot. It is a specific instance of the far more general shape discussed in Blaise Pascal's 1639 Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem.|$|E
5000|$|By the 4th century BC, the Greeks also {{associated}} the labyrinth with the familiar [...] "Greek key" [...] patterns of endlessly running meanders. [...] Coins from Knossos were struck with the labyrinth symbol in the 5th through 3rd centuries BC. The predominant labyrinth form {{during this period}} is the simple seven-circuit style known as the classical labyrinth, and over time the term labyrinth came {{to be applied to}} any <b>unicursal</b> maze, whether of a particular circular shape (illustration) or rendered as square.|$|E
5000|$|The words pentacle and pentagram (a five-point <b>unicursal</b> star) are {{essentially}} synonymous, {{according to the}} Online Oxford English Dictionary (2007 revision), which traces the etymology through both French and Italian back to Latin, but notes that in Middle French the word [...] "pentacle" [...] was {{used to refer to}} any talisman. In an extended use, many magical authors treat them as distinct. In many tarot decks and in some forms of modern witchcraft, pentacles often prominently incorporate a pentagram in their design.|$|E

5000|$|An Eulerian cycle, Eulerian circuit or Euler tour in an {{undirected graph}} is a cycle that uses each edge exactly once. If such a cycle exists, the graph is called Eulerian or <b>unicursal.</b> [...] The term [...] "Eulerian graph" [...] is also {{sometimes}} {{used in a}} weaker sense to denote a graph where every vertex has even degree.

5000|$|A maze is a path or {{collection}} of paths, typically from an {{entrance to a}} goal. The word is used to refer both to branching tour puzzles through which the solver must find a route, and to simpler non-branching ("unicursal") patterns that lead unambiguously through a convoluted layout to a goal. (The term [...] "labyrinth" [...] is generally synonymous, but also can connote specifically a <b>unicursal</b> pattern.) The pathways and walls in a maze are typically fixed, but puzzles in which the walls and paths can change during the game are also categorised as mazes or tour puzzles.|$|E
