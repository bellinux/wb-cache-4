40|$|Inspection is an {{important}} stage in the manufacturing process of machined parts. Coordinate measuring machines (CMM) have become more automatic, programmable, and capable of fulfilling the growing demands of inspection. However, fixturing (datum alignment) of parts is still done manually, consuming valuable inspection time. In this paper, we describe an automated datum alignment technique which integrates a vision system with the CMM to avoid part fixturing. The rough position of the part is estimated through image analysis. This initial reference frame drives the CMM through an automatic datum alignment procedure, thereby automatically establishing the reference frame without the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixtures.</b> This technique has been demonstrated {{for two and a}} half dimensional (2. 5 D) machined parts with well-defined features that exhibit a stable position on a flat table...|$|E

40|$|Thirty {{years into}} its development, {{additive}} manufacturing {{has become a}} mainstream manufacturing process. Additive manufacturing build up parts by adding materials one layer at a time based on a computerized 3 D solid model. It {{does not require the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixtures,</b> cutting tools, coolants, and other auxiliary resources. It allows design optimization and the producing of customized parts on-demand. Its advantages over conventional manufacturing have captivated the imagination of the public, reflected in recent mainstream publications that call additive manufacturing "the third industrial revolution. " This paper reviews the societal impact of additive manufacturing from a technical perspective. Abundance of evidences were found to support the promises of additive manufacturing in the following areas: (1) customized healthcare products to improve population health and quality of life, (2) reduced environmental impact for manufacturing sustainability, and (3) simplified supply chain to increase efficiency and responsiveness in demand fulfillment. In the mean time, the review also identified the need for further research in the areas of life-cycle energy consumption evaluation and potential occupation hazard assessment for additive manufacturing...|$|E

The scanners bring great advantage over conventional kinematics by delivering outstanding dynamics and processing speeds. That enables utilization of high power lasers and production volume increase by minimization of processing times. However, in batch production, as well as in small series or R&D tedious workpiece positioning and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixtures</b> draws the limits on time saving. Here, we introduce developed modules for CAD/CAM systems, tailored to support remote laser scanning systems by enabling process design “directly on the sample”. The presented solution uses orthogonal workspace imaging and raster vectorization for aided geometry fitting and adjusting process trajectories to the real position of workpiece. The developed algorithms bring flexibility and integrate designing stage with process realization. The system can adapt execution task to misaligned workpiece and still keep defined precision. This minimizes operation times and process failures. System errors were estimated experimentally on geometrical primitives. As a system validation, two industrial use-cases are presented, where material surplus removal is required. Overall system performance meets these tasks’ accuracy requirements.

In this paper the new-formed bone is analyzed, in cases that see the surgical creation of defects in testing animals. The morphological aspects of perimplant bone, regenerated by means of bone substitutes or not, were evaluated. A coronal defect was created {{by means of a}} counter-sink bur. The following step provided for osseointegrated fixtures, with a machined or blasted (TiOblast) surface, to be installed. Some bone defects were filled with Bio-Oss®, and covered with resorb-able membrane (Vycril®), others were left unfilled. The animals were sacrificed after different periods of time (24 and 45 days). Some thick sections (200 µm) underwent then microradiography and were examined with a microscope, under transmitted and polarized light. Other sections, thin (5 µm), were coloured with toluidine blue, Gomori's Stain and Soloch-rome Cyanine/Congo red. Data confirm the excellent behaviour of bovine bone and of TiO blasted fixtures. The experimental results bring into evidence that, in cases of Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) by means of membrane, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixtures</b> with a blasted surface (TiOblast), and of Bio-Oss® as bone substitute, made osseointegration easier. Results, moreover, suggest that in case of implant surgery with GBR, in order to allow the maturation of regenerated bone, it's healing time must be prolonged...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a process planning methodology for a rapid injection mold tool manufacturing system that involves additive and subtractive techniques, whereby slabs are sequentially bonded and milled using layered tool paths. Mold tools are grown in a bottom up fashion, {{eliminating the need}} for multi-axis machining operations (beyond three axes) and allowing small features in deep cavities. In this research, a new layer bonding method using friction stir welding of aluminum plates is presented. In this manner, one can create seam-free laminated aluminum injection mold tooling using a unique combination of industrial adhesives and friction stir spot welding to initially secure the slab, then continuous friction stir welding of layer perimeters that are sequentially machined in a layer wise process. The original research is presented as a journal article. This research includes three areas of interest that will enable highly automated process planning. The first research area focuses on determining the process plan for applying adhesives on the laminated plates that will be sufficient to resist the forces acting on the plate due to subsequent friction stir spot welding. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixtures</b> and clamps for machining in rapid manufacturing create a potential problem for collision of the tool/spindle and the workpiece setup. Therefore, the process proposed in this thesis uses a combination of industrial adhesives and friction stir spot welding to secure the aluminum plates for machining. The second area focuses on determining the number, location and sequence of friction stir spot welds sufficient to secure the plate prior to continuous friction stir welding. The use of adhesive alone is assumed to be not sufficient to withstand the high forces involved in the friction stir welding process. Therefore, there is need to friction stir spot weld the plates to hold them against the previously formed stack. The location and the number depend on the geometry of that particular layer. The final research area focuses on creating a toolpath planning method for the friction stir welding and CNC machining of each laminated plate. The FSW toolpath is generated based on a predetermined offset distance from the boundary of the polygon representing each cross sectional slice of the mold, while the CNC machining uses a basic waterline toolpath strategy. The impact of this research is that it will provide a completely automated process planning approach for rapid tool manufacturing that is currently not possible using existing additive- or subtractive- only approaches...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{in a number of}} robotic areas how the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> virtual <b>fixtures</b> improves task performance both in terms of execution time and overall precision, [1]. However, the fixtures are typically inflexible, resulting in a degraded performance in cases of unexpected obstacles or incorrect fixture models. In this paper, we propose the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> adaptive virtual <b>fixtures</b> that enable us to cope with the above problems. A teleoperative or human machine collaborative setting is assumed with the core idea of dividing the task, that the operator is executing, into several subtasks. The operator may remain in each of these subtasks as long as necessary and switch freely between them. Hence, rather than executing a predefined plan, the operator has the ability to avoid unforeseen obstacles and deviate from the model. In our system, the probability that the user is following a certain trajectory (subtask) is estimated and used to automatically adjusts the compliance. Thus, an on-line decision <b>of</b> how to <b>fixture</b> the movement is provided. I...|$|R
