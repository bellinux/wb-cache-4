5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept <b>using</b> <b>and</b> refining Crystal Tools. For , the engine was adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E

Most Megami Tensei titles are stand-alone entries with their own stories and characters. Recurring elements include plot themes, a story shaped by player choices, and game mechanics, the most notable being the ability to fight <b>using</b> <b>and</b> often recruit creatures (Demons, Persona) to aid the player in battle. Elements of multiple philosophies and religions, occultism, cyberpunk and early science fiction have all been incorporated into the series at different times.|$|E
40|$|Aims Genetically {{influenced}} {{aspects of}} adolescent behaviour {{can play a}} role in alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> peer affiliation. We explored the correlations between friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescent own <b>use</b> with a genetically sensitive design. Design Genetic and environmental factors were estimated on adolescent reports of their friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> their own <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. The correlations between the genetic and environmental factors that influence friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> were also estimated. Participants A total of 862 twin pairs aged 11 – 17 years sampled from the UK population-based Cardiff Study of All Wales and North-west of England Twins (CaStANET). Measurements Data on adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> <b>and</b> the alcohol <b>use</b> of their three best friends were obtained using self-report questionnaires. Findings A significant genetic influence was found on adolescent friends' alcohol use (about 30 %). Significant correlations of 0. 60 and 0. 70 were found between the genetic influences on friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' own <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. Common environmental influences were almost completely correlated for friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> (0. 91 <b>and</b> 0. 94). Conclusions There is considerable overlap in the common environmental and genetic factors that contribute to the relationship between adolescents' own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> that of their friends. These findings contribute to understanding of the mechanisms by which friends' alcohol use influences adolescent drinking behaviour...|$|R

5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, <b>using</b> <b>and.</b> This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is <b>using,</b> <b>and</b> he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E

5|$|Ron Wolf, who {{had been}} the Oakland Raiders’ Director of Player Personnel since 1963 and was {{credited}} with much of their success, was hired as Vice President of Operations. Los Angeles Rams general manager Don Klosterman and former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram were early candidates for the job; but Klosterman withdrew, and Stram was interested in a combined coach/general manager position. Wolf was directly responsible for the drafting of 20 of the Raiders’ 22 starters, and his effectiveness at scouting talent was believed to be a major reason for the Raiders’ being one of the few teams not to belong to a scouting combine. The Buccaneers quickly developed a Raiders flavor, choosing to hire a scouting staff rather than rely on the computerized scouting reports that almost all other teams were <b>using,</b> <b>and</b> hiring Raiders business manager Ken LaRue to serve in the same capacity. One of Wolf’s responsibilities was to assist in the hiring of a head coach. Wolf persuaded Culverhouse {{that it would be better}} for any prospect to gain a year of experience and knowledge in his present job, rather than be named at expansion time, when there was little or no advantage to having a coach in place.|$|E
