The observations correspond to the vari-ables of interest up to an additive noise. We suggest an estimation procedure based on deconvolution. It requires the knowledge of the density of the noise which is not avail-able. But we have at our disposal another specific sample with replicate observations for twin pregnancies. This allows both to estimate the noise density and to improve the deconvolution step. Convergence rates of the final estimator are studied and compared to other settings. Our estimator involves a cut-off parameter for which we propose a cross-validation type procedure. Lastly, we estimate the target density in spontaneous pregnancies with an estimation of the noise obtained from replicate observations in twin pregnancies.

40|$|Cet article présente un débitmètre à <b>ultrasons</b> conçu en tant que capteur {{intelligent}} pour la mesure des écoulements en surface libre ou en conduites fermées. Ce type de débitmètre peut être utilisé pour des applications industrielles ou de gestion de l’eau. Il répond à la forte demande des autorités de supervision des ressources en eau dans les régions semi-arides d’agriculture irriguée. Un état de l’art et les principes généraux des mesures de débits de liquide par <b>ultrasons</b> sont donnés. Le débitmètre original proposé utilise le principe de la mesure des délais entre les impulsions envoyées vers l’amont et vers l’aval dans le fluide. L’approche repose sur la mesure de la différence du temps de transit des ondes acoustiques sur une ou plusieurs cordes de mesure, réparties sur un intervalle suffisant, de manière à assurer la précision requise. Cette méthode permet une véritable intégration du profil des vitesses, ce qui assure une meilleure précision. La vitesse du son dans le fluide est éliminée des calculs grâce à l’utilisation des temps de transmission réciproques. Les calculs de débit sont assurés par un micro-contrôleur. Les calculs théoriques et les technologies proposées ont donné lieu à la réalisation d’un prototype expérimental. Une première application de ce débitmètre à ultrason est réalisée en laboratoire en conduite fermée dans une installation d’essai comportant une seule paire de transducteurs à ultrason. Une seconde application expérimentale est menée sur un banc d’essai comprenant un canal artificiel de forme trapézoïdale de dimensions géométriques bien déterminées avec une pente variable. Ces tests ont permis de vérifier la précision de l’appareil et de valider les techniques et les principes {{mis en oeuvre}} dans la conception du débitmètre. Measuring {{fluid flow}} {{is one of the}} most important measurements in the industrial fields of process control and water management. In fact, it may well be the most frequently measured process variable. Other measurements are water temperature, pressure and level. There are two types of ultrasonic flow meters used for discharge measurement: the Transit Time and Doppler flow meters. The first type is widely applied to fluid flows in pipes and open channels and is sensitive to suspended solids or air bubbles in the fluid. The second type is more popular and less expensive, but is not considered as accurate as the transit time flow meter. In this work, the Transit Time flow meter is discussed and applied, for the first time, to discharge measurements in pressurized conduits in a laboratory setting, and to open channel irrigation. We used the Transit Time method, which is based on the dependence of the velocity of an ultrasonic signal in a given medium on the velocity at which this medium is itself flowing. Therefore, pressure disturbances of small magnitude are propagated through a fluid at velocity that is the sound velocity relative to the fluid. If the fluid also has a velocity, the absolute velocity of the pressure disturbance propagation is the algebraic sum of the two. This ultrasonic method uses measurements of the transit time of high frequency energy pulses between one or more pairs of transducers to determine the flow rate of the liquid. The relationship between the measured transit time of an ultrasonic pulse and the average velocity along the pulse path is well described in this paper. This paper presents the state of the art of the general principle of liquid flow measurements by ultrasonic methods and the problems associated with such measurements. Using the ultrasonic transit time approach, we designed an ultrasonic flow meter according to a smart sensors concept, for the measurement of irrigation water flowing through pipelines or open channels. The new flow meter works on the principle of measuring time delay differences between sound pulses transmitted upstream and downstream in the flowing liquid. The speed of sound in the flowing medium is eliminated as a variable because the flow rate calculations are based on the reciprocals of the transmission times. The transit time difference is digitally measured by means of suitable microprocessor controlled logic. We initially carried out experimental tests in closed conduits. The installation consisted of three tanks (storage tank, volumetric tank or etalon tank, and supply tank), a pipeline with the primary intelligent flow meter devices being tested, an ultrasonic level-meter and a volumetric flow meter for calibration. The secondary devices included a pump, valves for controlling the apparatus and a level gauge. This apparatus enabled the calibration of flow meters for various volumetric flows. The data can be gathered with a fixed sampling time and are stored and/or transmitted to the computer system, which enables not only data storage, but also the calculation of the time of measurement at a specified level of accuracy and volumetric flow rate. The laboratory experiment was carried out to facilitate hydraulic studies with a flow rate ranging from 1. 25  L/s to 50  L/s. The steel pipeline had a diameter of 100  mm. The flow rate is calculated and the characteristics of calibrated flow meter are plotted. The report from each measurement is shown on the monitor and may be printed. The flow meter is connected to a straight section of pipe that is run at least 15  pipe diameters upstream of the sensor without obstructions, and a minimum of 10  pipes diameters downstream without obstructions (locating a flow meter too close to a flow disturbance may cause a systematic error). In addition to laboratory tests, the flow meter has also been evaluated in open channels. Open channel flow is defined as flow in any channel where the liquid flows on a free surface, is not under pressure, gravity is the only force causing the flow and a continuous and progressive decline in water surface elevation occurs as the flow moves downstream. Examples of open channel flows are rivers, streams, creeks, and other uncovered conduits. Open channel flow measurement is used in many applications: water supply networks, allocation of water for irrigation and agriculture, sewage treatment plants, etc. The discharge measurements in open channels may be computed by means of a rating curve, which is used to convert records of water level readings into flow rates. Because many phenomena can cause the rating curve to change, it must be checked periodically. In this context, the ultrasonic transit time technique is extremely useful in water management. By means of this technique, the flow rate is determined using single and multipath configurations. However, special attention must be paid to define the vertical velocity distribution and the suitable integration method. The experiment was conducted in liquid (water) using a single path with two transducers (i. e., the velocity profile is sampled along a single line only), and a double path with four transducers; the liquid velocity was varied from 0. 075  m/s to 2. 4  m/s. The channel has a trapezoidal form (length: 4. 2  m, width: 0. 45  m, depth varying from 0. 05 to 0. 38  m) with channel slopes manually adjusted from 0. 001 to 0. 02, so as to produce variable flows. In conclusion, the ultrasonic flow meters have the potential to significantly reduce the installation and operating costs of meter stations while providing accuracy levels consistent with, or better than, other traditional metering methods (vortex shedding, differential pressure, orifices, nozzles and venturi meters, Pitot-static-flow meters, magnetic flux, etc.). There may also be a substantial reduction in maintenance cost as the device utilizes digital measurement techniques and provides a wealth of diagnostic information on the status of the electronic measurement system. The suggested ultrasonic flow meter designed according to a smart sensor concept constitutes a necessary link for the optimal water resources management of an irrigation system. It can be used with confidence and offers an economical and accurate means of measuring the flow of water in open channels. Typical uncertainties are of the order of 2 % for single path and 1 % for two paths and are attainable with careful application. In closed conduits, the results of the experiments demonstrate the validity and the performance of the laboratory ultrasonic flow meters. The application of the flow meters under favourable conditions produces a relative error that does not exceed 1 %. This preliminary result shows the usefulness of these ultrasonic flow meters. Further investigations, however, are still needed in order to determine the overall performances of this instrument in terms of repeatability, linearity, reliability, and response time...|$|E

This paper presents a new, completely user-independent algorithm called carotid artery intima layer regional segmentation (CAILRS, a class of AtheroEdge™ systems), which automatically segments the intima layer of the far wall of the carotid ultrasound artery based on mean shift classification applied to the far wall. Further, the system extracts the lumen-intima and media-adventitia borders in the far wall of the carotid artery.

40|$|Tese de Doutoramento em Engenharia Química e Biológica - Ramo do Conhecimento Tecnologia MicrobianaThe {{development}} of biomaterials for medical applications envisages {{the design of}} three-dimensional structures – the scaffolds. These structures, mimicking the biological structures and interacting with the surrounding tissues through biomolecular recognition, elicit cellular responses mediated by specific interactions. Among the different scaffolds used in biomedicine, the materials based on polysaccharides present promising characteristics, due to their biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, degradability and appropriate mechanical properties, allowing for a favorable controlled interaction with living systems. Recombinant proteins are widely used in the biomedical field, namely in the fuctionalization of biomaterials. It is well established that Carbohydrate-Binding Modules (CBMs) present in several glycanases are structural and functionally independent of the catalytic module; therefore, their application as fusion partners may be exploited, contributing to protein expression, solubilization, purification, and finally for the functionalization of polysaccharide-based materials. This is the main subject of this thesis: {{the evaluation of the}} potential of CBMs as tools for the improvement of the biocompatibility of polysaccharides. One of the molecules often used to improve cells adhesion is the peptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). The RGD sequence, present in several proteins of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM), is a ligand for integrin-mediated cell adhesion; this sequence was recognized as a major functional group responsible for cellular adhesion. Several polysaccharide-based materials have been produced recently at the DEB-UM laboratories, namely dextrin based hydrogels and bacterial cellulose scaffolds. In this study, recombinant proteins containing a CBM with starch affinity were fused to the bioactive molecule RGD, using recombinant DNA technology, in order to functionalize dextrin-based hydrogels. The general introduction of this thesis is presented in chapter 1 and includes a bibliographic revision of: 1) the applications of polysaccharides as biomedical biomaterials (this revision is restricted to the dextrin and bacterial cellulose (BC) based materials, the ones that were used in this work); 2) the strategies available for the production of recombinant proteins, using bacterial systems; and 3) a state of the art on the CBMs and their applications. The chapter 2 describes the {{development of}} a methodology for the expression and purification of the recombinant protein CBM-RGD, which has a CBM from the human protein laforin fused to a RGD sequence. Different commercial heterologous Escherichia coli expression systems (pET 29 a, pET 25 b and pGEXT 41) were used in order to obtain high levels of soluble protein. Despite the use of the periplasmatic secretion approach (pET 25) or the fusion of CBM with enhancing solubility tag (GST), the recombinant proteins were always obtained in the insoluble fraction. The utilization of CHAPS and arginine allowed the protein solubilization and purification, but not the production of functional protein with starch binding ability. Using the pET 29 a vector, the recombinant proteins were obtained in inclusion bodies (IB). After solubilization and refolding, the CBM was recovered and showed starch affinity. This is the first report on the expression of the functional CBM from the human protein laforin. The chapter 3 describes the production of recombinant proteins containing a bacterial CBM, which belongs to an α- amylase from Bacillus sp. TS- 23. This protein, like the laforin CBM, also has starch affinity, being designated a Starch- Binding Module (SBM). The recombinant SBM and RGD-SBM proteins were cloned, expressed, purified and tested in vitro. The evaluation of cell attachment, spreading and proliferation on the dextrin-based hydrogel surface activated with recombinant proteins were performed using mouse embryo fibroblasts 3 T 3. The results showed that the RGD-SBM recombinant protein improved, by more than 30 %, the adhesion of fibroblasts to dextrin-based hydrogel. In fact, cell spreading on the hydrogel surface was observed only {{in the presence of the}} RGD-SBM. The fusion protein RGD-SBM provides an efficient way to functionalize the dextrin-based hydrogel, improving the interaction with cells. The characterization of dextrin-vinyl acrylate (dextrin-VA) and dextrin-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (dextrin-HEMA) hydrogels was presented in a previous study carried out at the DEB-UM laboratories. In this work (chapter 4) the in vivo biocompatibility and degradability of these hydrogels are reported. The histological analysis of subcutaneous implants of these hydrogels, featuring inflammatory and resorption events in mice, was carried out over a period of 16 weeks. While dextrin-HEMA hydrogel was quickly and completely degraded and reabsorbed, dextrin-VA degradation occurred slowly, apparently through an erosion controlled process. A thin fibrous capsule was observed 16 weeks post-implantation, surrounding the non-degradable hydrogel. In the case of the degradable material, only a mild inflammatory reaction was observed, with few foamy macrophages being detected around the implant. This reaction was followed by complete resorption, with no signs of capsule formation or fibrosis associated with the implants. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the dextrin hydrogels are fully biocompatible, since no toxicity on the tissues surrounding the implants was found. Moreover, it may be speculated that a controlled degradation rate of the hydrogels may be obtained, using dextrin with grafted HEMA and VA in different proportions. Chapter 5 presents the evaluation of Bacterial Cellulose – NanoFibers (BC-NFs) nanotoxicology. BC is a promising material for biomedical applications, namely due its biocompatibility. Although BC has been shown to be neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic, the properties of isolated BC-NFs on cells and tissues has never been analysed. Considering the toxicity associated to other fibre-shaped nanoparticles, it seems crucial to evaluate the toxicity associated to the BC-NFs. The results from single cell gel electrophoresis (also known as comet assay) and the Salmonella reversion assay showed that NFs, produced from BC by a combination of acid and ultrasonic treatment, are not genotoxic under the conditions tested. A proliferation assay using fibroblasts and CHO cells reveals a slight reduction in the proliferation rate, although no modification in the cell morphology is observed. Overall, this work reports the successful expression and isolation of the atypical human CBM, from the protein laforin. It provides a contribution to the development of a strategy based on the use of CBMs as tools for the modification of the surface properties of biomaterials, improving the interaction with cells. Finally, this work characterizes biocompatibility aspects of biomaterials currently under development at DEB-UM laboratories. O desenvolvimento de biomateriais para aplicações biomédicas centra-se no desenho de estruturas tri-dimensionais – scaffolds – capazes de mimetizar as funções biológicas e interagir com os tecidos envolventes, através do reconhecimento biomolecular. Entre os diferentes materiais usados para produzir scaffolds, os constituídos por polissacarídeos (como é o caso dos hidrogeis de dextrino e os materiais de celulose bacteriana - BC) apresentam características promissoras devido à sua biocompatibilidade, hidrofilicidade, degradabilidade e propriedades mecânicas, permitindo a sua utilização biomédica. As proteínas recombinantes são amplamente usadas em biomedicina, nomeadamente na funcionalização de diversos biomateriais. Sabe-se que os módulos de ligação a carbohidratos (CBMs), presentes em várias glicanases, são estrutural e funcionalmente independentes do domínio catalítico. Assim, a sua utilização em proteínas de fusão tem sido explorada, com o propósito de facilitar ou aumentar a expressão, solubilidade e purificação das proteínas. Uma das moléculas frequentemente usada para melhorar a adesão celular é o péptido Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Esta sequência, presente em diversas proteínas da matriz extra-celular, é um ligando para adesão celular mediada por integrinas, sendo reconhecido como o principal grupo funcional na adesão celular. Nos últimos anos, foram produzidos nos laboratórios do DEB-UM diversos materiais à base de polissacarídeos, nomeadamente hidrogeis de dextrino. Neste trabalho, usando tecnologia de DNA recombinante, foram produzidas proteínas bi-funcionais constituídas por um CBM (com afinidade para o amido) fundido com a molécula bio-activa RGD, com o propósito de os funcionalizar. Pretende-se assim melhorar a interacção do material com as células, favorecendo a adesão celular pela interacção com a molécula RGD que por sua vez está ligado ao material através do CBM. Na Introdução geral desta tese (capítulo 1) apresenta-se: 1) uma revisão sobre biomateriais baseados em polissacarídeos (em particular dos hidrogels de dextrino e das nanofibras (NFs) de celulose bacteriana); 2) as estratégias usadas para produzir as proteínas recombinantes em sistemas de expressão bacterianos; 3) e uma revisão sobre os CBMs e as suas aplicações. O segundo capítulo descreve a metodologia desenvolvida para a expressão e purificação da proteína de fusão CBMRGD, pertencendo este CBM à proteína humana laforina. Foram utilizados diferentes sistemas comerciais para expressão heteróloga em Escherichia coli (pET 29 a, pET 25 b e pGEXT 41), com o intuito de obter elevados níveis de proteína solúvel. Os sistemas de expressão que permitem a secreção das proteínas para o espaço periplasmático (pET 25) ou a fusão com a GST (pGEXT 4 1), um tag que potencia a solubilidade das proteínas, conduziram à obtenção de proteínas insolúveis. A adição de CHAPS e arginina ao tampão de lise, embora resultando num aumento da solubilidade, não permitiu a obtenção de proteína funcional, isto é, com afinidade para o amido. Usando o vector pET 29 a, a proteína foi obtida em corpos de inclusão que, depois de solubilizados e submetidos ao processo de refolding, permitiram obter proteína funcional com afinidade para o amido. Este é o primeiro relato da expressão funcional deste CBM humano. No capítulo 3 descreve-se a produção de proteínas de fusão contendo um CBM bacteriano, da α-amilase do Bacillus sp. TS- 23. Este CBM também apresenta afinidade para o amido, sendo por isso designado por SBM (Starch-binding module). As proteínas recombinantes SBM e RGD-SBM foram produzidas usando um sistema de expressão de E. coli. O seu efeito na adesão, spreading e proliferação celular foi avaliado in vitro, usando fibroblastos de embrião de rato 3 T 3. Os resultados mostraram que o tratamento do hidrogel de dextrino com RGD-SBM melhorou a adesão celular em mais de 30 %. Para além disso, só na presença da proteína foi possível observar as células alongadas na sua superfície. Assim, a proteína de fusão revelou-se eficiente para funcionalizar o hidrogéis de dextrino. A caracterização dos hidrogéis de dextrino-vinil acrilato (dextrino-VA) e dextrino-hidroxietilmetacrilato (dextrino-HEMA) foi objecto de estudo em trabalhos anteriores, também desenvolvidos no DEB-UM. Neste trabalho (capítulo 4) apresentam-se os resultados da caracterização de biocompatibilidade e degradação destes hidrogéis in vivo. A análise histológica de implantes subcutâneos em ratinhos permitiu estudar os eventos de reabsorção e a resposta inflamatória. De acordo com os resultados, a degradação e reabsorção dos géis de dextrino-HEMA ocorre rapidamente; a degradação dos géis de dextrino-VA é mais lenta, devendo-se principalmente a processos de erosão. Após 16 semanas, foi observada uma fina cápsula fibrosa a rodear o implante não degradável. No caso do gel degradável, observou-se uma resposta inflamatória de baixa intensidade, sendo detectados alguns macrófagos com material fagocitado a envolver o implante. Esta reacção foi seguida pela completa reabsorção do material, não havendo sinais de formação de qualquer cápsula fibrosa. Estes resultados sugerem que os hidrogéis de dextrino são biocompatíveis, uma vez que não foram detectados sinais de toxicidade nos tecidos que envolviam o material. Os resultados sugerem também que é possível obter hidrogéis com velocidades de degradação controlada, usando dextrino substituído com HEMA e VA em diferentes proporções. O capítulo 5 apresenta o estudo da nanotoxicidade de NFs de celulose bacteriana. A BC apresenta grandes potencialidades para aplicações biomédicas, sendo descrita como um material não citotóxico ou genotóxico. No entanto, o efeito das NFs, isoladas por tratamento ácido e <b>ultrasons,</b> nas células e nos tecidos não foi descrito. Considerando a toxicidade associada a outros nanomateriais com forma de agulha, o estudo da nanotoxicidade destas fibras torna-se crucial. Os resultados obtidos no ensaio cometa e de reversão da Salmonella mostraram que as NFs produzidas a partir da BC, não são genotóxicas na condições utilizadas. Para além disso, os resultados obtidos nos ensaios de proliferação celular usando fibroblastos e células CHO mostraram que, apesar de uma ligeira redução na proliferação, não são detectadas diferenças morfológicas. Em resumo, este trabalho descreve, pela primeira vez, a expressão funcional do CBM atípico da proteína humana laforina. Este trabalho também contribui para o desenvolvimento de ferramentas que utilizam os CBMs recombinantes para a modificação das propriedades da superfície de materiais. Por último, são caracterizados aspectos da biocompatibilidade de materiais que estão a ser desenvolvidos nos laboratórios do DEB-UM. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{control is}} {{becoming}} imperative for various processes, and polymerization processes are absolutely no exception. The major objectives of on-line {{monitoring and control}} of polymerization processes are maintaining the process safety, manufacturing polymers with well-defined properties, and reducing costs. Polymers are found in a large variety of products. It is a well accepted fact that a significant quantity of polymers are manufactured in emulsion polymerization, and that the economic importance of these products is beyond question. The reaction medium in emulsion polymerization involves the dispersion {{of one or more}} monomers (which are usually partially or totally hydrophobic) in a continuous aqueous phase* with a water soluble initiator and an emulsifier. The reaction therefore takes place under heterogeneous conditions, and the final product, called a latex, consists of suspended polymer particles in water, stabilized by the emulsifier. Industrial emulsion polymerization processes can be classified into two groups according to the final use of the latex. In some emulsion polymerization processes the produced latex is an intermediate product, and it is coagulated after the fact to give the final bulk polymer (e. g. polyvinyl chloride, styrene butadiene rubber). In other processes, the produced polymer is used directly (or perhaps after some intermediate formulation steps) {{in the form of a}} latex. Polymers produced in this way are used as water-based paints (acrylics lattices), adhesives (polyvinyl acetate latex), and finishes for textiles, paper or leather (acrylic polymers). * Of course not all emulsions use water as the continuous phase. Water-in-oil, or inverse processes also exist. However, we will limit our discussion to the more common oil-in-water processes. The final latex properties depend on the polymer molecular weight distribution, particle size distribution, morphology, glass transition temperature, and composition (when several monomers are used). These properties are strongly determined by the amount and type of additives, initiator, emulsifier and chain transfer agent, the monomer addition policy, the reaction temperature and the reactor configuration. Hence, emulsion polymerization processes are characterized by a large number of manipulated variables, which means that, in order to describe the relationships between them, we would need highly complex process model. In order to ensure the economical production of a polymer with the desired properties under safe conditions, important decisions must usually be made during plant operation, by means of automatic on-line control. In the context of control, the process is a dynamic system (described by a set of differential equations) with well-known inputs (that can usually be used as manipulated variables), process 'states' that are the variables representing the evolution of the process, and finally measured process outputs (which are usually a combination of the process states). Control of the process states is based on a suitable process model. It also requires some on-line state measurements. In spite of the importance of emulsion polymerization, process control is still a particularly difficult task. The difficulties in controlling emulsion polymerization are often associated with the lack of on-line measurements of several properties, the high reaction rate, the sensitivity of the reaction to small amounts of additives, and the highly complex reaction networks that result in a complex nonlinear model combined with a number of unknown variables. One of the main control objectives in an emulsion polymerization process is to track polymer composition. This is of absolute importance in terms of final properties of the produced polymer-e. g. glass transition temperature, particle morphology, mechanical and chemical resistances. Controlling polymer composition is indispensable if several monomers with different reactivity ratios are involved in the reaction at a nonazeotropic monomer composition, which is the case of most industrial systems. If no control action is taken in this case, the polymer composition will vary during the reaction, and this will lead to a heterogeneity in the polymer properties (unless the polymer is made in a CSTR). Polymer composition can however be controlled by employing appropriate monomer feed flow rates. The most efficient monomer addition policy, in terms of composition control and simultaneous minimization of process time consists of applying a variable monomer feed flow rate of the more reactive monomer(s), that should be a function of the residual amount of monomer remaining in the reactor and their reactivity ratios. Therefore, controlling polymer composition requires on-line measurement of the polymer composition and the instantaneous quantity of residual monomers, an adequate mathematical model correlating the monomer feed flow rates with the produced polymer composition (inputs-outputs), and finally the use of a robust control technique. On-line sensors developed for the direct monitoring of emulsion polymerization can be classified into two broad categories: sensors that require a sampling device or a circulating loop to perform the analysis (e. g. gas chromatography and densimetry), and in situ sensors (e. g. Spectroscopic and ultrasonic probes). The copolymer composition can be monitored by means of on-line gas chromatography (based on the analysis of the residual monomer), or by densimetry (if combined with an additional sensor). However, the measurements in these sensors present some difficulties related to the latex sampling and treatment, and sometimes, time delays caused by long analysis times. This is not to say that we cannot use these sensors, by rather we must be aware of their limitations. In the second category, the analysis is performed in the reactor, and therefore problems related to time delays and to plugging of the sampling loop are minimized. However, some sensors such as the infrared spectroscopy, while very promising, are still in the stage of development, and we are still faced with the problem of coagulation on the sensor. When these techniques become available, they will provide valuable information on the state of the reactor. Nevertheless, given the complicated nature of emulsion systems, we will still need to apply advanced control strategies such as those outlined in what follows. Due to the difficulty of performing on-line measurements of all the states of the process, combined with a lack of accurate phenomenological models, estimation techniques have been developed to infer estimates of certain variables that are not available on-line, from auxiliary measurements. State observers, or software sensors, are designed based on the process model and on the process outputs. If the observability conditions are satisfied, the observer reconstructs some of the unmeasurable states of the model from the available measurements. Good state observers can overcome modeling uncertainties and measurement noise, and are therefore useful for process monitoring, control, fault detection, and are also used as filters of random effects associated to the measurements. Despite the highly nonlinear behavior of the polymerization process, mainly due to the reaction rate, linear estimation (e. g. Kalman filter) techniques have usually been used to infer information about the evolution of several unmeasurable states of the process. Similarly, linear control techniques (PID, adaptive) have usually been applied to track several variables of the linearized nonlinear system. This is due to the difficulty of dealing with nonlinear systems and to the fact that nonlinear estimators are usually restricted to a class of nonlinear systems. However, linear estimation and control techniques are inadequate for highly nonlinear processes. Nowadays, recent developments in nonlinear theory allow us to implement nonlinear estimation (e. g. high gain observer) and control (e. g. geometric control) techniques to several classes of systems without extensive calculations. The main objective of this research is to apply such nonlinear techniques to estimate and control the polymer composition, and to maximize the process productivity under safe reactor operation. The fundamental on-line information about the evolution of the process is obtained by calorimetry. Calorimetry is often useful in vinyl polymerization reactions, since they tend to be very exothermic. On an industrial level, the main use of calorimetry is currently reactor safety (by reactor temperature control), and the estimation of the rate of heat produced by the polymerization, which is proportional to the overall reaction rate. In Chapter 2 we will review the theoretical nonlinear estimation and control techniques that will be used throughout this research. Calorimetry will be discussed in Chapter 3. The observer development to estimate the polymer composition in co- and terpolymerization processes is presented in Chapters 4 and 5. In Chapter 6, we develop a control strategy for polymer composition for both co- and terpolymerization processes. Finally, in Chapter 7, we treat the topic "Maximizing productivity under safe conditions", where the polymer composition is controlled and the reaction rate is simultaneously maintained at a predefined maximum limit. La nécessité de produire des polymères avec des propriétés spécifiques et reproductibles, de minimiser le temps et les coûts et de contrôler la sécurité de l'expérience nous contraint à utiliser des méthodes avancées de contrôle de procédés de polymérisation. Les polymères sont aujourd'hui utilisés dans des domaines différents. Une grande partie de ces polymères est produite en émulsion. La formulation de base d'une réaction de polymérisation en émulsion classique, contient de l'eau qui constitue la phase continue, et des monomères qui sont dispersés dans l'eau et stabilisés grâce à un agent émulsifiant. Les particules de polymère ainsi produites sont suspendues dans l'eau, grâce à l'émulsifiant. Le milieu résultant est donc appelé 'latex'. Les propriétés du latex dépendent de beaucoup de paramètres, tels que la distribution de la masse molaire de polymère, la distribution des tailles de particules, la température de transition vitreuse, la morphologie, et la composition du polymère, si la réaction fait intervenir plusieurs monomères. Ces propriétés sont influencées par plusieurs variables, la nature et la quantité des additifs tels que, l'amorceur, le tensioactif les agents de transfert éventuels, la façon dont ces produits et les monomères sont introduits dans le réacteur, la température de la réaction, l'agitation, et le type de réacteur utilisé. Ces nombreuses variables sont alors nos variables de commande, que nous devons faire varier pour obtenir les propriétés désirées. En réalité, afin d'obtenir des propriétés spécifiques, tout en assurant la sécurité du procédé, plusieurs paramètres sont fixés a priori, tels que la quantité initiale de réactifs et la température de la réaction. Ceci dit, plusieurs paramètres restent à faire varier en ligne, pendant la réaction, comme la température de la double enveloppe, pour maintenir la réaction à la température prévue, et le débit d'ajout des monomères, qui nous permettront de contrôler les propriétés du latex (la taille des particules et la composition du polymère). Ce genre d'intervention en ligne pour améliorer la qualité et la sécurité du procédé, le contrôle en ligne du procédé de polymérisation en émulsion, sont l'objet but principal de ce travail. Du point de vue du contrôle, le procédé est un système dynamique (représenté par des équations différentielles) possédant des entrées, des états (les variables décrivant l'évolution du procédé), et finalement des sorties (qui sont les variables mesurées en ligne, et sont en général, une combinaison des états du système). Pour contrôler un procédé, un modèle représentatif de ce procédé est nécessaire. Faute de trouver un modèle parfait du procédé, des informations en ligne provenant des sorties du système, s'avèrent nécessaires pour accomplir la stratégie de contrôle. En réalité, les raisons pour lesquelles, les méthodes de contrôle avancées n'ont pas été utilisées lors des procédés de polymérisation en émulsion sont le manque de capteurs en ligne capables de donner des mesures pour la plupart des propriétés des polymères, la rapidité de la réaction, la sensibilité de la réaction à la présence de petites quantités d'additifs, la nonlinéarité du modèle du procédé et le grand nombre de paramètres inconnus dans le modèle et l'interaction entre ces paramètres. Une des propriétés intéressantes à contrôler lors des procédés de polymérisation en émulsion, est la composition du polymère, pour les procédés faisant intervenir plusieurs monomères à une composition non azéotropique. La composition du polymère intervient au niveau de la détermination de la température de transition vitreuse, des propriétés mécaniques, ainsi que de la morphologie du polymère. Il a été trouvé dans la littérature que l'ajout du monomère le plus réactif à des débits variables est la méthode la plus efficace pour contrôler la composition tout en assurant une vitesse de réaction relativement élevée. En utilisant une méthode avancée de contrôle, nous pouvons alors maintenir la composition à une valeur désirée. Ceci nécessite une connaissance approfondie du procédé ainsi que la mesure en ligne de la composition de polymère. Les capteurs en ligne utilisés pour suivre les procédés de polymérisation en émulsion peuvent être divisés en deux catégories: des capteurs nécessitant une boucle de circulation externe, ou un système de prise d'échantillons afin d'effectuer l'analyse (Chromatographie en phase gazeuse, densimétrie); et des capteurs in situ qui effectuent les analyses dans le réacteur (Spectroscopie Infrarouge, sondes <b>ultrasons).</b> La chromatographie en phase gazeuse peut être utilisée pour mesurer, en ligne, la composition du mélange de monomère résiduel, si le réacteur est équipé d'un système automatique de prise d'échantillons, de dilution, dans certains cas, et d'injection dans le chromatogramme. La densimétrie a été également utilisée pour la mesure en ligne de la composition du polymère. Une boucle de circulation du latex dans l'appareil est donc indispensable pour effectuer l'analyse. Cependant ces deux méthodes présentent quelques difficultés expérimentales, telles que la floculation du latex dans les appareils et le retard des analyses, qui sont dues, pour partie, au transfert du latex. C'est pourquoi, les expériences sont préférablement suivies avec les capteurs in situ, où l'analyse est effectuée dans le réacteur. Cependant, ces capteurs, tels que l'infrarouge, l'ultrason et la spectroscopie Raman sont en phase de développement, et nous ne possédons pas encore de modèles complets liant ces mesures avec les propriétés du latex. Le manque de capteurs en ligne qui donnent des mesures réelles des procédés est un problème fréquent dans plusieurs domaines. Dans les procédés de polymérisation en émulsion, ce manque est d'abord dû à la nature hétérogène et visqueuse du latex qui rend la mesure directe des propriétés du polymère souvent difficile. Ensuite, l'équipement d'un procédé avec plusieurs capteurs serait économiquement impossible. A cause du manque de capteurs, et du manque de modèles exacts des procédés, des efforts ont été faits dans le domaine de l'estimation logicielle des états, non mesurés expérimentalement, en se basant sur des mesures réelles et le modèle du procédé. Ces observateurs, ou estimateurs, ou encore capteurs logiciels, sont conçus à partir du modèle du procédé en utilisant les sorties réelles du procédé. Si le système est observable, l'observateur nous permettra d'obtenir des informations sur les états non mesurés du procédé. Les observateurs sont souvent utilisés pour le suivi des procédés, mais sont également très utiles pour le filtrage, la détection de panne et le contrôle des procédés. Les méthodes d'estimation et de contrôle linéaire ont souvent été appliquées dans le domaine de la polymérisation en émulsion, et ce malgré la nonlinéarité des modèles représentant ces procédés. Ceci est dû premièrement à la difficulté de manipuler les outils non linéaires, au temps nécessaire à l'ordinateur pour résoudre ces observateurs et au fait que les observateurs non linéaires proposés dans la littérature étaient souvent limités à un groupe de systèmes non linéaires. Ces sujets ne posent aucune difficulté aujourd'hui, avec le développement de la théorie non linéaire, et l'évolution de la rapidité et de la capacité des ordinateurs. L'objectif de ce travail est le contrôle de la composition des polymères, tout en assurant une vitesse de réaction élevée, ainsi que la sécurité de l'opération. Puisque les modèles représentant ce procédé sont nonlinéaires, nous allons utiliser des méthodes d'estimation et de contrôle nonlinéaires adaptées au procédé. La stratégie d'estimation est constituée de trois parties. Dans la première partie, nous allons développer un capteur qui fournit des informations précises et rapides sur le procédé. La deuxième partie est constituée de l'estimation de la composition du polymère lors des procédés de co- et terpolymérisations en émulsion. La dernière étape est la construction de lois de commande adéquates qui nous permettent d'obtenir la composition et la vitesse de réaction désirées. Dans le premier chapitre, une introduction générale du sujet ainsi que la stratégie de recherche sont proposées. Le deuxième chapitre contient les théories d'estimation et de contrôle nonlinéaires que nous allons utiliser tout au long de ce travail. Le troisième chapitre traite des capteurs en ligne pour les procédés de polymérisation en émulsion. D'après certains critères, nous choisissons d'utiliser la calorimétrie pour suivre le procédé. Cependant, ce capteur ne nous donne pas directement une mesure de la vitesse de la réaction, car plusieurs paramètres dans le bilan thermique restent inconnus. Pour contourner ce problème, nous allons utiliser une méthode d'optimisation de la conversion globale du monomère, en corrigeant les paramètres inconnus. Pour ce faire, les mesures de la température du réacteur, de la double enveloppe, et quelques mesures expérimentales de la conversion sont nécessaires. Dans le quatrième chapitre nous utilisons les informations obtenues par calorimétrie, pour estimer la composition du polymère lors des procédé de copolymérisation. Nous traitons le cas d'un observateur nonlinéaire à grand gain qui tient compte de la réaction dans la phase aqueuse et un autre où on néglige l'effet de la phase aqueuse. Il s'avère que, pour les monomères étudiés, la composition du polymère n'est pas sensible à la réaction dans la phase aqueuse. Ce phénomène est peut être dû au fait que la plupart des radicaux sont dans les particules, surtout pour un taux de solide élevé. La deuxième raison est que les monomères utilisés ici sont seulement partiellement solubles dans l'eau, ce qui fait que la quantité de monomère dans les particules est plus importante que dans la phase aqueuse. Dans le cinquième chapitre, un observateur nonlinéaire à grand gain est construit pour suivre la composition du polymère lors des procédés de terpolymérisation. Puisque le quatrième chapitre montre clairement que nous n'avons pas besoin de tenir compte de la phase aqueuse pour l'estimation de la composition, un modèle de monomères hydrophobes est choisi pour construire l'observateur. Le chapitre 6 expose les lois de commande développées pour maintenir la composition de co- et de terpolymères sur une trajectoire prédéfinie. Des lois de commande nonlinéaires avec une linéarisation entrée-sortie sont utilisées. Dans ce chapitre, nous établissons un contrôleur local de la pompe, qui assure l'exécution des débits envoyés par la commande de la composition. Dans le dernier chapitre nous évoquons le concept de maximisation de productivité. Notre objectif est de maintenir la composition à une valeur prédéfinie, et en même temps maximiser la vitesse de la réaction. Les variables de commande sont les débits d'ajout de monomères. La variable contrôlée est la concentration de monomère dans les particules. Cependant, pendant le contrôle de la concentration de monomère dans les particules il faut faire attention à ce que la chaleur produite par la réaction soit inférieure à la chaleur maximale que la double enveloppe est capable d'évacuer...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. In view of {{an increasing number of}} reports describing epoxy resinthermoplastic blends, it is clearly important to identify the effects of the thermoplastic on the blend properties. In this work difunctional epoxy resin monomer (Epikote 828) cured with diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS) or dicyandiamide (DICY) are the model systems used. The thermoplastic is a polyethersulphone (PES) with either hydroxyl terminations (Victrex 5003 P, ICI) capable of reaction with epoxy monomer or chlorine terminated (<b>Ultrason</b> E 2010, BASF) which is incapable of reaction. The glass transition characteristics of the PES materials are very similar but the <b>Ultrason</b> E 2010 is of lower average molecular weight and can be expected to contain more chain ends. Epoxy-DDS-PES systems were prepared with 20 phr and 30 phr of PES. The effects of the PES on crosslinking and isothermal physical ageing behaviour were examined. Enthalpy relaxation data were curve fitted using a Kohlrausch function. Mechanical and dielectric spectroscopy data were analysed using W-L-F and power law methods. Despite a tendency for the PES to reduce the crosslink density of the network, the blends had glass transition temperatures almost identical to the unmodified resin. The reduction in crosslink density improved Glc compared to the unmodified resin but promoted faster physical ageing and more rapid embrittlement when the blends were aged at the same temperature as the neat resin. The epoxy-DICY-PES system was studied at one composition of 30 phr PES. The system was two phase but fast curing led to premature arrest of the phase separation process. Annealing at various temperatures from below the glass transition of the low temperature phase to just below the glass transition of the high temperature phase resulted in what is believed to be microscopic morphological changes detectable only barely by DSC and quite clearly from dynamic mechanical analysis. These changes were not manifest in the morphology of fracture surfaces. Annealing was found to decrease G 1 c. This study is funded by the Defence Research Agency...|$|R

Moreover, the persistence of the cavitation effects on the wall facing the emitter, in spite of the deflection of the streaming jet, is correctly reproduced by the model. It is also shown that predictions based either on linear acoustics with the correct turbulent solution, or with Louisnard's model with Eckart-Nyborg's theory yields unrealistic results.

As a result, the k-space method for nonlinear wave propagation is shown here to be computationally more efficient than the conventional finite element method or finite-difference time-domain method for the conditions studied here.

In addition, tumors are detected early in the reconstruction process. Results for reconstructions of a simple two-dimensional model of the human breast are presented. These reconstructions are extremely accurate when system noise and variations in tissue parameters are not too great.

The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined the neural substrates of cross-modal binding during audio-visual speech perception in response to either seeing the facial/lip or tongue (tongue movement inside the mouth acquired by means of <b>ultrason)</b> movements of a speaker. To this aim, participants were exposed to auditory and/or visual speech stimuli in five different conditions: an auditory-only condition, and two visual-only and two audiovisual conditions that showed either the facial/lip or tongue movements of a speaker. Common overlapping activity between conditions were mainly observed in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus, extending ventrally to the posterior middle temporal gyrus and dorsally to the parietal operculum, the supramarginal and angular gyri, as well as in the premotor cortex and in the inferior frontal gyrus. In addition, sub-additive neural responses were observed in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus/sulcus during audio-visual perception of both facial and tongue speech movements compared to unimodal auditory and visual speech perception. Altogether these results suggest that the left posterior superior temporal gyrus/sulcus is involved in multisensory processing of auditory speech signals and their accompanying facial/lip and tongue speech movements, and that multisensory speech   perception   is   partly   driven   by   listener’s knowledge of speech production.

Außerdem wurden die Methoden der Ellipsometrie, der Atomkraftmikroskopie (AFM) und der Rasterelektronenmikroskopie (REM) zur Charakterisierung von Schichtsystemen herangezogen. Ein Vergleich des Wechselwirkungsverhaltens der mikroporösen Polymere <b>Ultrason</b> E 2010 ™ und Polycarbonats Makrolon™ mit den beiden Freonen R 22 und R 134 a sowie der homologen Reihe der Alkohole Methanol bis Pentanol wurde unter Verwendung von Reflektometrischer Interferenzspektroskopie (RIfS) realisiert. Diese Methode vereinigt viele Vorteile der optischen Sensoren. Sie eignet sich sowohl zur Bestimmung der Wechselwirkungen von gasförmigen Analyten mit dünnen Polymerschichten, als auch zur Untersuchung von Affinitätsreaktionen in flüssiger Phase. Die Reduktion der Stützpunkte auf dem Interferenzspektrum auf wenige Wellenlängen ermöglicht die Vereinfachung des Sensorsystems und Gewinnung eines portablen Sensorsystems. Der zur Verfügung stehende {{low-cost}} 4 lambda-Aufbau beinhaltet diese Vorgaben und wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit stets zu Sensormessungen verwendet. Durch Kombination dieser Methoden konnten komplementäre Informationen über die Wechselwirkungen zwischen Polymer und Analytmolekülen gewonnen werden. Neben den mikroporösen Polymeren wurden erstmals hochverzweigte Polymersysteme in der sensorischen Anwendung eingesetzt. Bei diesen Systemen handelt es sich um hochverzweigte Polymersysteme des Typs AB 2, die am Institut für Polymerforschung (IPF) Dresden synthetisiert, charakterisiert und während dieser Arbeit auf die Anwendungsmöglichkeit in der optischen Sensorik untersucht wurden. Diese Polymersysteme fallen durch ihre funktionellen Gruppen auf und können somit selektiv und maßgeschneidert eingesetzt werden. Zur Quantifizierung von Gemischen in der Gasphase wurden Untersuchungen der Sorptions- und Desorptionskinetiken der verschieden großen Analytmolekülen mit mikroporösen und hochverzweigten Polymeren durchgeführt. Die Auswertung mit multivariaten Auswerteverfahren wie Neuronalen Netzen (ANN, Artificial Neuronal Networks) wurde zur Klassifizierung und Quantifizierung der Messdaten verwendet. Die Anwendung modellfreier Methoden ermöglichte die exakte Durchführung und Bewertung zuvor festgelegter vollfaktorieller Versuchspläne. Die daraus gewonnenen Ergebnisse ließen die Optimierung der sensitiven Polymersysteme zu, so dass es möglich wurde, das Sensorsystem immer exakter an die Vorgaben anzupassen. Investigations by reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS) in gaseous phase {{are presented}} in this work. In addition, the methods of ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{were used for the}} characterisation of layer systems. A comparison of the interaction behaviour of the microporous polymers <b>Ultrason</b> E 2010 ™ and polycarbonate Makrolon™ with the two freons R 22 and R 134 a (refrigerants) as well as the homologous alcohols methanol to pentanol were realised by reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS). This detection method combines many advantages of the optical sensors. It is suitable for the determination of interactions between gaseous analyte molecules and thin polymer layers {{as well as for the}} investigation of affinity reactions in liquid phase. The characteristic points on the interference spectrum were reduced to four wavelengths. The reduction allows the simplification of the sensor system and production of a portable sensor system. The available low-cost 4 lambda-system contains these defaults and was always used parallel to RIfS for calibration measurements. Complementary information about the interactions between polymer and analyte molecules could be won by combination of these detection methods. In the present work hyperbranched polymers were used for the first time in sensory application. The hyperbranched polymer consists of AB 2 structure. At the institute of polymer research (IPF) Dresden the polymer was synthesised, characterised and during this work researched to the application in the optical sensor technology. The quantification of analyte mixtures in the gas phase were carried out by investigation of the sorption and desorption kinetic of anlaytes of different sizes into the microporous and hyperbranched polymers. The evaluations with multivariate data analysis were used for the qualification and quantification of the measuring data.

40|$|International audienceInterdigital {{transducers}} (IDT) {{are widely}} used to generate surface acoustic waves directly on piezoelectric materials. However, in most applications, the generating fingers are straight, giving rise to the emission of plane waves. One notable exception is the circular IDT proposed by Day and Koerber for isotropic substrates [IEEE Trans. Sonics and <b>Ultrason.</b> SU- 18, 461 (1972) ]. More recently, the focused interdigital transducer (FIDT) {{has been used to}} obtain high intensity generation at the focal spot. The FIDT uses surface wave emission inside a circular arc for concentrating acoustic energy at its focus. However, the anisotropy of the substrate can lead to aberrations at the focal point. We investigate the problem of constructing an extended source that will focus elastic energy to a single point on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal. On the surface of a piezoelectric solid that is mechanically excited at a single point, concentric waves originate and form in the far field a ripple pattern that follows the shape of the wave surface, obtained by plotting the group velocity {{as a function of the}} emission angle. We conversely propose the concept of an annular interdigital transducer (AIDT), in which the shape of the fingers follows the wave surface. The surface acoustic waves generated by an AIDT are expected to converge to the center of the transducer, producing a spot that is limited in resolution by diffraction only. Experiments have been conducted on Y and Z cut lithium niobate (LiNbO 3). AIDTs operating at a resonance frequency of 75 MHz have been constructed. Electrical measurements show that despite anisotropy in-phase emission at all angles is obtained for Rayleigh waves. In addition, spatial maps of the displacements at the surface have been obtained using a heterodyne optical probe, showing an important focusing of surface acoustic waves in the center of the device. The measured displacement fields at resonance show surface ripples converging to- a spot at the center of the transducer. This result is promising for several applications including intense microacoustic sources...|$|R

In 1877, French {{physicist}} Pierre Curie discovered piezoelectric crystals; that is {{also acknowledged}} {{as the beginning of}} the story of the diagnostic ultrasound. In the 1930 s ultrasound became a widely used tool in the medical field. On the other hand; the first physician that has used ultrasound as a diagnostic device was Karl Dussik at 1940. Dussik has successfully located the brain tumors and cerebral ventricles by using ultrasound waves. In 1948; a technological milestone; B-mode imaging has been invented by Douglas Howry. Starting with the invention of CW Doppler by Robert Rushmer, Dean Franklin and Don Baker at 1956; ultrasound has been rapidly developed. Late 1960 s and the beginning of 1970 s was the years that echocardiography, PW Doppler was invented and ultrasound become one the indispensable imaging modalities of today s diagnostic medicine. Today ultrasound is used {{for a wide variety of}} examinations of different organ of the human body. The only limitation is the lack of imaging of the organs which has air inside; such as stomach and lungs. Except this limitation ultrasound is an imaging modality which is non-invasive; radiation free and easy to perform in every circumstances. One other advantage of the ultrasound is the cost of the ownership compared with other imaging modalities. An ultrasound systems contains four modules. These are the transducer; central processing unit; monitor and optional print out units. The most important unit among of these four is the transducer that generates the ultrasound waves via piezoelectric crystals. Piezoelectric crystals start to resonance whenever there is a voltage applied to them. They also have the ability to convert any pressure applied to them to electric signals. Basically an ultrasound wave at special frequency is generated by applying voltage to the piezoelectric crystals that is located in the transducer. These waves propagate through human body by passing different tissues. During this propagation some of these waves are scattered from different tissues and these scattered and reflected waves return back to transducer and apply pressure to same piezoelectric crystals that is used to generate the ultrasound signal at the first place. Each tissue has a different acoustic impedance value that is directly related with the speed of the sound wave and the density of the tissue. The frequency of the ultrasound waves is an important parameter that effects of the resolution and penetration capabilities. Higher frequency corresponds with lower penetration but higher resolution. Lower frequency corresponds higher penetration but lower resolution. Axial and lateral resolution is directly related with the frequency. There are five different imaging modes. These are A (amplitude) -mode; B (brightness) -mode; M (movement) - mode; Doppler mode and 3 D/ 4 D mode which improved dramatically in the near past. A-mode is based on imaging the amplitude of the reflected wave on time domain. This mode is one of the first modes that has been used for imaging; but as of today there is no practical advantage to any other modes. So it is no more used. B-mode image is obtained by giving different gray levels to different intensities of reflected waves and combining of all informations from different piezoelectric crystals to get a 2 D image. This mode is the gold standard on ultrasound imaging. But on the other hand the movement of the organs like hearth is also very important to diagnose certain illnesses that points out the M-mode. M-mode is used for to observe the differences of B-mode images in time domain. Doppler mode is mainly to examine the hemodynamic in human body. The speed of the blood flow in hearth or vessels is examined via Doppler mode which also contains three sub groups as CW (continuous wave); PW (pulsed wave) and color Doppler imaging. All of these hemodynamic measurements are based on using Doppler effect to determine the speed and direction of the flow in the specific organ. The last imaging mode is 3 D/ 4 D which is basically constructing volume image by using a set of B-mode images. Today s technology enables to obtain these volume images close to real time; so new terminology of 4 D imaging has been started to be used especially on obstetric imaging. As it is stated before the most important component of an ultrasound system is transducer. We can easily group the transducers according to the crystal arrays or the physical shapes of the transducer. Considering the crystal arrays there are three sub groups which are linear; annual and phased arrays. Linear arrays; has crystals that has isolated from each other on a linearly lined transducer aperture. These crystals are triggered as sub groups sequentially with certain time delays in order to obtain focusing. Annual arrays have circular shaped crystals. Compared with linear and phased arrays the number of the crystals is very limited. But because of the shape of the piezoelectric crystals; these arrays has the opportunity to do two dimensional focusing as an advantage. Phased array transducer has a smaller aperture compared with the linear array transducers. Opposite to the linear arrays; all crystals are triggered at the same time with certain time delays in order to obtain focusing. The major advantage of phased arrays is the capability to steer the sound waves in order to image wider area on the far field. Therefore these arrays are used mainly at sector transducers. One of the major issues on both linear and phased array transducers is the maintain focusing on elevation plane. There are two ways; one of them is to use special concave piezoelectric crystal shape, the other one is using more them 1 crystal array parallel to each other. Regarding the shapes of the transducers there are three groups which are linear, convex and sector. Each of them has different advantages. For instance linear transducer is ideal for to image wider area at the near field. Convex is mainly used for abdominal and obstetric because of wider image view in the far field. Finally sector is used for imaging from a narrow acoustic window and to have an access to a very wide imaging area on the far field. That is exactly clinician needs to examine hearth from a narrow intercostal acoustic window. There are still rooms to improve on today s ultrasound technology. Transducer technology is the main area that the major research and developments is done is the. As ultrasound resolution is limited with the number of piezoelectric crystals on a limited aperture; all researchers are actively trying to replace these crystals with alternative sound generator. Therefore the silicone transducers are invented and still work in progress. One other area is the capability of using the ultrasound device as an therapeutics device besides diagnostic area. The goal is to do organ specific medicine delivery by using contrast agents. Also having additional information about the tissue morphology and characterization is one of the areas to improve. The last subject is the maintaining objectivity. As we indicated before ultrasound is a dynamic examination. Usually the diagnose has to be done during the scanning. Therefore the operator dependency is very high. Any malpractice can create serious problems at the end. Therefore researchers are trying to add more intelligence to the systems in order to detect the human errors. The last area that is recently improved is fusion imaging. Fusion imaging is enabling to do cross modality imaging synchronized electronically with each other. As a resume; ultrasound is one of the leading imaging modalities due to ease of use; accessibility; and the wide variety of usage in human body. On the other hand; a successful ultrasound exam is directly related to the operator. The most important issue for the operator is to know the limitations of the ultrasound and to have the fundamental knowledge on optimising the image during the scanning. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

The dependence of frequency domain photoacoustic (FD-PA) signals on the optical absorption coefficient (mu(a)) and the effective attenuation coefficient (mu(eff)) of a turbid medium [polyvinyl chloride-plastisol (PVCP) ] with tissuelike optical properties was measured, and empirical relationships between these optical properties and the photoacoustic (PA) signal amplitude and the laser fluence rate were derived for the water (PVCP system with and without optical scatterers). The measured relationships between these sample optical properties and the PA signal amplitude were found to be linear, consistent with FD-PA theory: mu(a) = a(A/Phi) - b and mu(eff) = c(A/Phi) + d, where Phi is the laser fluence,A is the FD-PA amplitude, and a, [...] .,d are empirical coefficients determined from the experiment using linear frequency-swept modulation and a lock-in heterodyne detection technique. This quantitative technique can easily be used to measure the optical properties of general turbid media using FD-PAs. (c) 2008 Optical Society of America.

40|$|Nanofibers or nanowebs {{produced}} by electrospinning have several prominent properties {{such as high}} surface area to volume ratio, high porosity and pore size in nanorange. As the porosity of electrospun nanoweb is more than 90 %, they are candidates for air filters and liquid filtration membranes. However, the application of electrospun nanofibers membranes {{has yet to make}} breakthrough in other avenues of separation than air filtration, especially in pressure-driven liquid separations, such as ultrafiltration (UF) or nanofiltration (NF). In this project, the preparation of polyethersulfone (PES) membranes by electrospinning was studied. The influence of processing parameters, i. e., polymer concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, spinneret-to-collector distance, relative humidity, were investigated. The treatment of the proto-membrane formed by immersion in an aqueous coagulation bath was also studied. More comprehensive characterizations of the nanofiber membranes, including fiber diameter, pore size, porosity, thickness, basic weight and tensile strength as well as air and water permeability were investigated. Thereby, we expect that this work will open up the avenue toward the use of nanofibers for very important applications of separation technology. Of particular interest are membranes in water purification, e. g., pre-filters to minimize contaminations and fouling prior to ultra- or nano-filtration. PES (<b>Ultrason</b> 6020 P) was dissolved in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) at concentrations of 9 %, 15 %, 22 %. The polymer solution was electrospun under processing conditions i. e., a spinneret-to-collector distance of 10 cm, an applied voltage of 30 kV, a flow rate of 20 μL/min, and a spinneret diameter of 0. 8 mm, stationary substrate set-up, aluminum foil and PET nonwoven served as the substrate. The first results showed that the 22 % PES solution can be electrospun into well-defined nanofiber. The overall morphology of the membranes obtained is changed from a fiber network into spherical particles connected by fibers with the decrease of the polymer concentration in the solution used for electrospinning. The properties of nanofiber can be measured on aluminum foil or PET nonwoven as substrate. Image analyses gave a mean fiber diameter of 489 ± 142 nm but under stationary spinning conditions that leads to a 3 dimensional fiber web on the substrate. When the 22 % PES solution was electrospun membrane using a moving substrate under processing conditions i. e., applied voltage of 18 kV, a spinneret-to-collector distance of 10 cm, a flow rate of 20 μL/min, a spinneret diameter of 0. 8 mm, a speed of substrates moving of 2. 2 cm/min, 65 % RH and served the PET nonwoven as substrate, yielded a more planar and homogeneous membrane. The thickness of membrane was 200 μm. The image analyses gave a mean fiber diameter of 800 nm. However, the proto-membrane which had been treated by immersion into the water bath lead to a pronounced porosity on the nanofiber surface which will be useful, for instance, for increasing binding capacity to the fiber surface. In addition, the membranes which had been electrospun under processing condition at high humidity resulted in irregular fiber formation. All test results for membranes showed that the fiber diameter and membrane structure and, consequently, membranes properties were clearly affected by applied voltage and spinneret-to-collector distance. The electrospun membrane was prepared by an applied voltage 18 kV at distance spinneret-to-collector of 10 cm, a flow rate of 20 μL/min, a spinneret diameter of 0. 8 mm, a speed of substrates moving of 2. 2 cm/min, 65 % RH and served the PET nonwoven as substrate exhibited the pore size of 1. 8 μm, the porosity of 93 % and basic weight of 0. 169 mg/cm 2. All membranes showed similar and high contact angle. The electrospun membranes prepared by applying higher voltage have lower flux than membranes prepared with lower voltage. The electrospun membranes which were prepared by increasing distance between spinneret-to-collector (kept other conditions) exhibited high water flux and clear correlation between structure and performance that decreasing of mean pore size leads to decreasing water flux of electrospun membranes. However the results suggested that PES electrospun nanofiber membranes are excellent materials for high water flux MF applications. Regarding nitrogen gas flow through electrospun membranes, the membranes which were prepared by increasing applied voltage showed decreasing gas permeability. Moreover with the DEHS aerosol, with particles size of 400 - 1000 nm, filtration performance of electrospun nanofiber web was much greater than that of the 4 layers commercial nonwoven (Novatexx 2429) with pore size of 8 μm. This result clearly demonstrated the potential of electrospun nanofiber in the development of filter material against aerosol nanoparticles. The filtrate fluxes of commercial membrane (Membrana MicroPES; pore size 1 μm) was much smaller than the filtrate fluxes of PES electrospun membrane with pore size ranging between 1. 7 - 4. 5 μm. Overall, PES electrospun membrane showed greater water flux than commercial membrane both before and after separation of silica nanoparticles (size 35 nm). The water flux before separation of all membrane was higher than after silica nanoparticles separation. The PES electrospun membranes had higher particles rejection than PES commercial membrane. Besides, the rejection of electrospun membranes was well above 90 %, while commercial membrane rejected the nanoparticles by only 85 % {{in the beginning of the}} filtration. Moreover, the PES electrospun membranes exhibited the rejection above 98 % at the end of rejection experiment run. Such the results showed, electrospun nanofiber PES membranes can be used in various applications such as removal of nano or microparticles from waste-water, e. g., pre-filters to minimize contaminations and fouling prior to UF or NF...|$|R
