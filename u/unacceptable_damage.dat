40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problem in the Swedish forestry is damages caused by wild deer. The damages result in great consequences, not only economical due to quality and production loss, they also effect the biodiversity in the forest. The main principle in Swedish forestry is that damages should be avoided. Different measures are available to prevent and reduce already existing damages, the measures are many and of different character. The report Survey of forest damages and wild deer {{is the result of a}} cooperation with Södra forest owner association. With 50 000 members and 36 000 connected forest farms, Södra is the largest forest owner association in Sweden. The purpose of the study Survey of forest damages and wild deer is to examine and map how members within Södra experience problems caused by wild deer, what kind of help is requested from Södra and which measures are made by the members to prevent damages. The report is based on a survey sent to members within the Kinna region. The survey contained 31 questions and was sent to 152 randomly selected members. 41 answers were returned and later processed. The answers collected shows that almost every one of the respondents conducts measures to prevent <b>unacceptable</b> <b>damages</b> caused by wild deer. The most common measure is hunting. The most common measure to save value in already damaged forest is pruning. Among the measures to provide game with feed, environmental regard in connection to forestry measures is most commonly occurring. The main part of the forest owners state that they have little problems with damages caused by fallow and red deer while damages caused by elk and roe deer are more common. Södras members asks for more information about the wild deer -elk and roe deer. How to create feed for wild game, how to save value in already damaged forests and how to avoid <b>unacceptable</b> <b>damages</b> caused by wild deer are other areas where the members want more information from the association...|$|R

5000|$|The Atomic Cafe {{was also}} {{released}} during the Reagan Administration’s forced civil defense revival. Barry Posen and Stephen Van Evera explain this revival in their article “Defense Policy and the Reagan Administration: Departure from Containment” published in International Security. They {{argue that in}} 1981-82 the Reagan Administration was moving from an essentially defensive grand strategy of containment to a more offensive strategy. Due to the greater demands of its more offensive strategy “the Reagan Administration ... proposed the biggest military buildup since the Korean War.” Of key relevance to The Atomic Cafe, the Reagan move toward offense included {{the adoption of a}} more aggressive nuclear strategy that required a large U.S. nuclear buildup. Containment only required that U.S. strategic nuclear forces be capable of one mission: inflicting <b>unacceptable</b> <b>damage</b> on the Soviet Union even after absorbing an all-out Soviet surprise attack. To this [...] "assured destruction" [...] mission the Reagan administration added a second [...] "counterforce" [...] mission, which required the capacity to launch a nuclear first strike against Soviet strategic nuclear forces that would leave the Soviets unable to inflict <b>unacceptable</b> <b>damage</b> on the U.S. in retaliation. The U.S. had always invested in counterforce but the Reagan administration put even greater emphasis on it. The counterforce mission was far more demanding than the assured destruction mission, and required a vast expansion of U.S. nuclear forces to fulfill. Civil defense was a component of a counterforce strategy, as it reduced Soviet retaliatory capacity, hence civil defense was a candidate for more spending under Reagan's counterforce nuclear strategy. Posen and Van Evera argue that this counterforce strategy was a warrant for an open-ended U.S. nuclear buildup.|$|E

This triad {{made it possible}} for the United States to impose <b>unacceptable</b> <b>damage</b> to the Soviet Union with one strategic force independent of the other two forces. These different forces had their advantages and disadvantages. Bombers could deliver large payloads and strike with great accuracy, but were slow, vulnerable while on the ground, and could be shot down. ICBMs are safe in their underground silos while on the ground, but were less accurate than bombers and could not be called back when launched. Submarines were least vulnerable but were also least accurate and communication could be poor at times. Each of these forces provided the United States with different options to tailor their response to the situation.|$|E

The technique was largely abandoned in the late 1950s with the advent of megavoltage radiation equipment, which enabled the delivery of more penetrating external radiation.|$|E

50|$|Heavy infestations {{may make}} the land {{completely}} impenetrable and will require cutting first just to access the stems. The root systems will also be so pervasive that removing them would require digging up the entire area; doing this in woodland areas will cause <b>unacceptable</b> <b>damage</b> to the surface roots of trees and to flowering bulbs and should be avoided. In this case, chemical control using a selective weedkiller such as triclopyr to wet the photosynthesising bramble leaves is very effective if applied {{in accordance with the}} manufacturer's instructions. However, a heavily infested area of uncut brambles will require an inordinate amount of poison to wet the leaves; it is far cheaper, and more effective, to cut the area as close to ground level as possible in the spring, clear the debris into piles to reveal the ground surface and to accurately spot spray the shoots that will emerge two to three weeks later as soon as they have a small amount of new foliage. This will kill the plant back into its root system using {{a small fraction of the}} poison required to spray whole bushes. The area may first be cleared using a tractor-mounted rotary mower, motorised string trimmer or with a scythe. A short-bladed, 24 inch mm, scythe in good hands can be faster than using a string trimmer, leaves a neater cut close to the ground, avoids collateral damage to other plants that are desirable to keep, and deposits the cut debris aligned in swathes that are easier to remove and stack. The area must be cut and cleared at some point anyway and it is easier to clear the debris while green and flexible than dead and dry, so clearing when green then spraying a little is more efficient than spraying a lot then clearing when dry.|$|E
