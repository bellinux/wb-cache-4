5|$|Isotope {{analysis}} {{can be used}} to allow researchers to make inferences about the diet of the species being studied. Two isotope analyses of bone collagen extracted from the remains of Late Pleistocene wolves found in Beringia and Belgium indicate that wolves from both areas preyed mainly on Pleistocene megafauna, which became rare {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene 12,000 years ago. The Beringian wolf preyed most often on horse and steppe bison. In the period leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> Glacial Maximum (50,000YBP–23,000YBP), they also ate woodland muskox, and after this time they also ate mammoth. The analysis supports the conclusion that these wolves were capable of killing and dismembering large prey.|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E

As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the history of Iran and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections {{all over the world}} today.

25|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} 1995 with various record producers, including Nellee Hooper, Flood, Howie B, and Osborne, who were introducing the band to various electronica influences. At the time, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. was inactive {{due to a}} back injury, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting. Upon Mullen's return, the band began re-working much of their material but ultimately struggled to complete songs. After the band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming 1997 PopMart Tour before the record was completed, they felt rushed into delivering it.

Styles defeated Harper the following week on SmackDown Live to become the number one contender, but Orton betrayed Wyatt and reclaimed his right to face Wyatt at WrestleMania 33, leading to a match between Styles and Orton for the WrestleMania number one contendership, which Styles lost.|$|E
25|$|In 1996–97, Robson led Boro to both {{domestic}} cup finals but they lost both, losing 1–0 in a replay to Leicester City in the League Cup Final and 2–0 in the FA Cup Final to Chelsea, while they suffered relegation in the Premier League—which {{would have been}} avoided {{if they had not}} been deducted three points in mid-season for cancelling a fixture at late notice. However, at least Boro had the consolation of staying alive in the league <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> day of the season. Boro were already bottom of the league at the turn of 1997, but when the points were deducted they found themselves seven points adrift of safety with the 17th placed team having a game in hand. However, results slowly improved {{over the next few weeks}} and by the end of March a succession of very good results had seen Boro climb out of the relegation zone. This, coupled with the excellent cup runs, saw Robson voted Premier League Manager of the Month for March 1997. Robson made one playing appearance this season on New Years Day, starting in a 2–0 defeat away to Arsenal. This proved to be his last game as a professional footballer, though it wouldn't be until the following year that he formally announced his retirement.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of sillaginids have large enough populations to allow an entire fishery to be based around them, with King George whiting, {{northern}} whiting, Japanese whiting, sand whiting and school whiting the major species. There have been no reliable estimates of catches for the entire family, as catch statistics generally include only those species taken in large numbers, {{but there are some}} species which make up significant numbers of the bycatch. To add to this problem, many of the lesser known species are taken by subsistence fisheries and not reported. From estimates by the FAO, however, it is evident that the family {{is one of the most}} important in the Indo-Pacific region, having an estimated catch of 22 718 tonnes in 1990 alone. In this same report, it was shown that the greatest three utilizers of sillaginids were the Philippines, Western Australia and Thailand respectively. The records also suggested that the catch increased from 1983 when it was 17 570 t, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> estimate in 1990 of 22 718 t. No such estimates have been carried out since. Modern records for Australia show that this trend has reversed, with all catches from Australia totaling 4 372 t in 2006 compared with 1990's 6000 t haul. Statistics from other countries are unavailable for such comparison.|$|E

25|$|Parma {{ordered a}} redoubt thrown {{up on the}} closest margin of the river. On the {{opposite}} bank he constructed another and planted artillery with a force of eight hundred Flemish soldiers under the Count of Bossu in the one and {{an equal number of}} Walloons in the other. He collected all the flatboats, ferries and rafts that could be found and at Rouen and then under cover of his forts he transported all the Flemish infantry and the Spanish, French and Italian cavalry during the night of 22 May to the opposite bank of the Seine. At the same time batteries were erected along the banks to keep off the Dutch fleet. Next morning he sent up all the artillery together with the Flemish cavalry to Rouen making use of what he could of the broken arches of the destroyed bridge in order to shorten the distance from shore to shore. With this he managed to convey his whole army with all its trains across the river. A force was left behind <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> moment to engage in skirmishes and to display themselves as largely as possible for the purpose of distracting the King's force. The young Prince of Parma Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma had command of this rearguard and the escape was successful.|$|E
25|$|Kawauchi {{improved}} his half marathon best to 1:02:40 at the Kagawa Marugame Half Marathon in February 2011, finishing inside the top ten. He {{set his sights}} on a top eight finish at the Tokyo Marathon later that month but exceeded his own expectations by running a time of 2:08:37 hours and taking third place. As the best Japanese performer, he earned selection for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. In June he entered the Okinoshima Ultramarathon and led the 50km race right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 600 metres, at which point he collapsed due to heat stroke and failed to finish the race. At the World Championship Marathon held in Daegu he finished in 18th place – a performance which helped the Japanese team including Hiroyuki Horibata and Kentaro Nakamoto to a silver medal in the 2011 World Marathon Cup. He competed extensively {{towards the end of the}} year and his form held well: he managed fourth at the Osaka Marathon, then took third at the Fukuoka Marathon. The latter was an Olympic qualifying race and he was the first placed Japanese. The Japan Association of Athletics Federations played down his selection choices, saying his time of 2:09:57 was not fast enough, but Kawauchi upturned tradition by saying the race was a warm-up for the second qualifier in Tokyo – Japanese runners rarely enter both selection races due to their proximity in the running calendar. Only two weeks later Kawauchi entered the Hofu Marathon and was runner-up behind Mongolia's Serod Bat-Ochir. He remarked that the fatigue from the previous race had hurt his chances of winning the race.|$|E
