50|$|The Eichleay {{company is}} noted {{for being the}} namesake of a formula used for pricing federal change orders and/or dispute claims. In 1954, Eichleay was under {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} three NIKE missile sites in Pennsylvania. The government changed the scope of work, resulting in change orders. The process of delaying the work, however, resulted in losses for Eichleay due in part to maintained overhead costs during the suspension period. The resultant ruling recognized that (1) a contractor should be entitled to compensation for <b>unabsorbed</b> <b>overhead</b> resulting from owner caused delay, and (2) there was, at the time, no accepted method of allocating home office overhead to a particular contract to determine the amount of compensation.|$|E
40|$|When a {{delay causes}} {{contractors}} {{to be shut}} down or turn idle for a period of time, fixed overhead as well as general and administrative expenses continue to be incurred. However, the amount of direct costs to which these expenses can be allocated or expensed is reduced. The result is an amount of <b>overhead</b> that is <b>unabsorbed,</b> which can be allocated to that specific delay. Various pricing methods for calculating these <b>unabsorbed</b> home office <b>overhead</b> expenses currently exist in the construction litigation process today. The per diem Eichleay method is the most frequently utilized method. In this era of financial austerity, the armed forces are facing challenges to maintain operational readiness with fewer personnel and leaner operating capital due to shrinking defense budgets. One way to optimize these precious and limited resources is the efficient and effective use of construction funds and personnel in Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFACENGCOM) construction administration. This report focuses on the commonly utilized Eichleay method of computation, as well as alternative methods currently utilized in today's construction industry. Research and analysis was conducted on current litigated construction claims resulting from disputes involving the Eichleay formula. Assumptions about the Eichleay formula method and its shortcomings have been provided. Emphasis on utilizing other methods of calculating these damages to the contractor as well as situation specific modifications of the Eichleay formula itself are also included. Conclusions were drawn from the data that identify significant strengths and weaknesses among these common place case situations. Recommendations were made for future possible improvements regarding the recognition and avoidance of potential claims by contractors. The target audience of this report is the junior construction project manager (Naval Civil Engineer Corps officer/civilian government personnel) and is to be utilized as a guide in the NAVFACENGCOM construction organization atmosphere for calculating legitimate contractor's <b>unabsorbed</b> home office <b>overhead</b> expense for a government caused suspension, delay, or disruption to the contract performance.
