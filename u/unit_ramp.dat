40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Optimal generation scheduling attempts to minimise the cost of power production while satisfying the various operation constraints and physical limitations on the power system components. The thermal generation scheduling problem {{can be considered as}} a power system control problem acting over different time frames. The unit commitment phase determines the optimum pattern for starting up and shutting down the generating units over the designated scheduling period, while the economic dispatch phase is concerned with allocation of the load demand among the on-line generators. In a hydrothermal system the optimal scheduling of generation involves the allocation of generation among the hydro electric and thermal plants so as to minimise total operation costs of thermal plants while satisfying the various constraints on the hydraulic and power system network. This thesis reports on the development of genetic algorithm computation techniques for the solution of the short term generation scheduling problem for power systems having both thermal and hydro units. A comprehensive genetic algorithm modelling framework for thermal and hydrothermal scheduling problems using two genetic algorithm models, a canonical genetic algorithm and a deterministic crowding genetic algorithm, is presented. The thermal scheduling modelling framework incorporates unit minimum up and down times, demand and reserve constraints, cooling time dependent start up costs, <b>unit</b> <b>ramp</b> rates, and multiple unit operating states, while constraints such as multiple cascade hydraulic networks, river transport delays and variable head hydro plants, are accounted for in the hydraulic system modelling.

The results of the performance of the algorithms on small, medium and large scale power system problems is presented and compared with other conventional scheduling techniques.

This paper introduces carbon trading in the dispatching model, gives full consideration to the benefit or cost of carbon emission and introduces carbon emission in the dispatching model as a decision variable so as to achieve the unity of the economy and the environmental protection of the dispatching model. A low carbon economic dispatching model is established based on multiple objectives, such as the lowest thermal power generation cost, the lowest carbon trading cost and the lowest carbon capture power plant operation cost. Load equalization, output constraint of power <b>unit,</b> <b>ramping</b> constraint, spinning reserve constraint and carbon capture efficiency constraint should be taken into account in terms of constraint conditions. The model is solved by the particle swarm optimization based on dynamic exchange and density distance. The fact that the introduction of carbon trading can effectively reduce the level of carbon emission and increase the acceptance level of wind power is highlighted through the comparison of the results of three models’ computational examples. With the carbon trading mechanism, carbon capture power plants with new technologies are able to give full play to the advantage of reducing carbon emission and wind curtailment so as to promote the development of the energy conservation and emission reduction technology and reduce the total cost of the dispatching system...|$|R

H 577 P EE 2016 Luoxvi, 167 pages :color illustrationsGlobal {{environmental}} crises, such as {{the global}} climate change and awful air pollution in major cities over the world, are causing profound changes to both the power system and the transportation sector. On one hand, power systems worldwide are evolving towards a greener version by integrating increasing amount of renewable energy sources, especially wind power (WP). On the other hand, as {{an effective way to}} reduce greenhouse gas emission, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are currently incentivized in many countries and more and more types of PEV are being rolled out by various automakers. With the adoption of PEV surging, a rapid increase of PEV charging load can be expected in the coming years. The uncertainty and variability of WP generation will weaken the controllability on the supply side of the power system and require more fast-reacting reserve, while bulk uncontrolled PEV charging may severely stress the network at all voltage levels, threatening the system reliability, lowering its efficiency, and jeopardizing the system economy. Controlled PEV charging, however, could be a valuable source for large-scale demand response (DR). The DR is identified as a very effective tool to facilitate smooth WP integration, and clean electricity from WP to propel PEVs can significantly decarbonize the transportation sector. Thus, a lot of synergies can be explored between the PEV charging load and the WP generation. As an effort to safely accommodate the PEV charging load at the initial stage of PEV adoption before the upgrade of the network infrastructure, this thesis firstly proposes a real-time scheduling scheme for PEV charging in low-voltage residential distribution network. This scheme schedules PEV charging to either minimize system losses or prevent over-low voltage, depending on the PEV penetration level. Since most often voltage drop would become a binding constraint when a low-voltage distribution feeder is subject to high PEV penetration level, a scheduling method is first developed to enlarge the voltage safety margin. Then, a novel factor is derived to allow the scheduling scheme to be flexibly adjusted from being voltage-safety-oriented to loss-minimization-oriented, or vice versa. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheduling scheme is fast and effective with circuit losses close to optimal at low PEV penetration level and voltage drops maintained within the tolerable limit at high PEV penetration level. To facilitate the PEV demand response, a decentralized charging control scheme is devised in this thesis. In the proposed control scheme, individual PEV would autonomously adjust its power in response to two system-level directional signals. Since the power adjustment would also take into account the PEV's urgency level of charging (ULC), the charging/discharging power among PEVs will be distributed automatically according to their heterogeneous charging requirements. The mechanism that can trigger divergent PEV power adjustment is analyzed to obtain the stability condition for the proposed control scheme. For the control inaccuracy caused by interrupted individual PEV power adjustments, a remedy is proposed and proved. As an application, the power of a PEV fleet is controlled by the proposed decentralized charging control scheme to compensate undesired fluctuations in a wind farm's power output. Simulation results verify that the controlled PEV power can respond to undesired WP fluctuations timely and accurately, and the power distribution among PEVs is consistent with the heterogeneous PEV charging requirements. Increasing amount of WP in the power system will force conventional generators to go through more frequent cycling operations which have damaging effects on generator components. In this context, a 3 -level hierarchical scheme is proposed to utilize the PEV power to hedge against the <b>unit</b> <b>ramp</b> cycling (URC) operations. A general URC operation model is proposed for the first time. Net load variation range (NLVR) is used to capture the WP forecast uncertainty. The top-level scheduling model reshapes the NLVR by coordinating PEV charging load to minimize the URC operations that can be caused by the possible net load realizations in the NLVR. Based on updated WP forecasts, the middle-level dispatch model exempts the over-scheduled anti-URC regulation onus on PEVs to promote PEV charging. Nevertheless, the actual dispatch of net load is confined within the reshaped NLVR from the top-level scheduling to avoid overly restoring the PEV power. At the bottom-level is the proposed decentralized charging control scheme to implement the PEV power dispatch instruction. Simulation results show that with the proposed hierarchical scheme, the PEV-aided URC operation mitigation is effective and most of the desired charging energy is preserved to satisfy the charging requirements for the majority of PEVs. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is shown to be robust to WP forecast errors. The associated cost to accommodate the WP uncertainty and variability (WPUnV) in a power system is referred as the wind power uncertainty cost (WPUC) which would increase rapidly with WP penetration level. This thesis investigates to what extent the controlled PEV power would help reduce this WPUC. A comprehensive WPUC model is proposed in which generator cycling costs are included. Also, the proposed decentralized charging control scheme is used to obtain a realistic response of the PEV load to the system dispatch instruction. With the WPUnV decomposed into two components, namely hourly WP forecast errors and sub-hourly WP fluctuations, the WPUC raised by each of the components will be evaluated. Simulation results show that generator cycling costs are non-negligible parts of the WPUC and controlled PEV power has a favorable effect on reducing the overall WPUC. The controlled PEV power, however, may not be as helpful as expected to mitigate the WPUC induced by the WP forecast errors on hourly scale. Yet, the WPUC raised by sub-hourly WP fluctuations can be largely reduced with the controlled PEV power. Department of Electrical EngineeringPh.

The purpose of this study was to describe the discharge properties of abductor hallucis motor <b>units</b> during <b>ramp</b> and hold isometric contractions, as well as its discharge characteristics during fatigue. Intramuscular electromyographic recordings from abductor hallucis were made in 5 subjects; from those recordings, 42 single motor units were decomposed. Data were recorded during isometric ramp contractions at 60 % maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), performed before and after a submaximal isometric contraction to failure (mean force 41. 3 +/- 15. 3 % MVC, mean duration 233 +/- 116 s). Motor unit recruitment thresholds ranged from 10. 3 to 54. 2 % MVC. No significant difference was observed between recruitment and derecruitment thresholds or their respective discharge rates for both the initial and postfatigue ramp contractions (all P > 0. 25). Recruitment threshold was positively correlated with recruitment discharge rate (r = 0. 47, P < 0. 03). All motor units attained similar peak discharge rates (14. 0 +/- 0. 25 pulses/s) and were not correlated with recruitment threshold. Thirteen motor units could be followed during the isometric fatigue task, with a decline in discharge rate and increase in discharge rate variability occurring in the final 25 % of the task (both P < 0. 05). We have shown that abductor hallucis motor units discharge relatively slowly and are considerably resistant to fatigue. These characteristics may be effective for generating and sustaining the substantial level of force that is required to stabilize the longitudinal arch during weight bearing...|$|R
30|$|The high {{penetration}} of wind energy sources in power systems has substantially increased {{the demand for}} faster-ramping thermal units participating in the frequency regulation service. To fulfill the automatic generation control (AGC) and compensate the influence of wind power fluctuations simultaneously, ramping capacity {{should be considered in}} the dispatch model of thermals. Meanwhile, conventional methods in this area do not take the impact of transmission loss into the dispatch model, or rely on offline network model and parameters, failing to reflect the real relationships between the wind farms and thermal generators. This paper proposes an online approach for AGC dispatch units considering the above issues. Firstly, the power loss sensitivity is online identified using recursive least square method based on the real-time data of phasor measurement units. It sets up power balance constraint and results in a more accurate dispatch model. Then, an improved multi-objective optimization model of dispatch is proposed and a connection is established between the thermal <b>units</b> with fast <b>ramping</b> capacity and the wind farms with rapid fluctuations. Genetic algorithm is used to solve the dispatch model. The proposed method is compared with conventional methods in simulation case in the IEEE 30 -bus system. Finally, simulation results verify the validity and the feasibility of identification method and optimization model.|$|R
