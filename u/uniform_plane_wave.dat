40|$|An {{integral}} part of a compact range is the means of providing a <b>uniform</b> <b>plane</b> <b>wave.</b> A Cassegrain reflector system is one alternative for achieving this goal. Theoretically, this system offers better performance than a simple reflector system. The longer pathlengths in the Cassegrain system {{lead to a more}} uniform field in the plane of interest. The addition of the subreflector creates several problems, though. System complexity is increased both in terms of construction and performance analysis. The subreflector also leads to aperture blockage and the orientation of the feed now results in spillover illuminating the target areas as well {{as the rest of the}} range. Finally, the addition of the subreflector leads to interaction between the two reflectors resulting in undesired field variations in the plane of interest.

The principal waves considered are TEM mode <b>uniform</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> of electric field strength 1 V/m with the operating frequency of 10 GHz. The auxiliary waves observed are chosen to be propagating in r–direction with θ = φ = π/ 4. When the principal wave is propagating in x–direction with polarization in y–direction, the space constants [2] of the principal wave are ǫ = 8. 854 pF/m and µ = 1. 257 µH/m.

40|$|A compact {{range is}} a {{facility}} {{used for the}} measurement of antenna radiation and target scattering problems. Most presently available parabolic reflectors do not produce ideal <b>uniform</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> in the target zone. Design improvements are suggested to reduce the amplitude taper, ripple and cross polarization errors. The ripple caused by diffractions from the reflector edges can be reduced by adding blended rolled edges and shaping the edge contour. Since the reflected edge continues smoothly from the parabola onto the rolled surface, rather than being abruptly terminated, the discontinuity in the reflected field is reduced which results in weaker diffracted fields. This is done by blending the rolled edges from the parabola into an ellipse. An algorithm which enables one to design optimum blended rolled edges was developed {{that is based on}} an analysis of the continuity of the surface radius of curvature and its derivatives across the junction. Futhermore, a concave edge contour results in a divergent diffracted ray pattern and hence less stray energy in the target zone. Design equations for three-dimensional reflectors are given. Various examples were analyzed using a new physical optics method which eliminates the effects of the false scattering centers on the incident shadow boundaries. A Gregorian subreflector system, in which both the subreflector and feed axes are tilted, results in a substantial reduction in the amplitude taper and cross polarization errors. A dual chamber configuration is proposed to eliminate the effects of diffraction from the subreflector and spillover from the feed. A computationally efficient technique, based on ray tracing and aperture integration, was developed to analyze the scattering from a lossy dielectric slab with a wedge termination...|$|R

40|$|Microwave (MW) thawing of 2 D frozen {{cylinders}} {{exposed to}} <b>uniform</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> from one face, is modeled using the effective heat capacity formulation with the MW power {{obtained from the}} electric field equations. Computations are illustrated for tylose (23 % methyl cellulose gel) which melts over a range of temperatures giving rise to a mushy zone. Within the mushy region the dielectric properties are functions of the liquid volume fraction. The resulting coupled, time dependent non-linear equations are solved using the Galerkin finite element method with a fixed mesh. Our method efficiently captures the multiple connected thawed domains that arise due to the penetration of MWs in the sample. For a cylinder of diameter D, the two length scales that control the thawing dynamics are D/D-p and D/lambda(m), where D-p and lambda(m) are the penetration depth and wavelength of radiation in the sample respectively. For D/D-p, D/lambda(m) much less than 1 power absorption is uniform and thawing occurs almost simultaneously across the sample (Regime I). For D/D-p much greater than 1 thawing is seen to occur from the incident face, since the power decays exponentially into the sample (Regime III). At intermediate values, 0. 2 < D/D-p, D/lambda(m) < 2. 0 (Regime II) thawing occurs from the unexposed face at smaller diameters, from both faces at intermediate diameters and from the exposed and central regions at larger diameters. Average power absorption during thawing indicates a monotonic rise in Regime I and a monotonic decrease in Regime III. Local maxima in the average power observed for samples in Regime II are due to internal resonances within the sample. Thawing time increases monotonically with sample diameter and temperature gradients in the sample generally increase from Regime I to Regime III. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} the pseudochiral omega (Ω) medium as a subset of the wider set of bianisotropic linear media. The introduction of this novel electromagnetic medium is physically motivated by pointing out its similarity to transversely biased ferrites. We also study, theoretically, the possibility of using the Ω medium in some novel microwave devices such as tunable cavity resonators and reciprocal phase shifters. The study focuses on the interaction between the conducting Ω microstructures in the Ω medium and the electromagnetic fields in such devices. We also introduce {{the concept of the}} non-local Ω medium as a generalization of the pseudochiral Ω medium. The constitutive relations of such media are given and the wave equation governing the electric field in these materials is presented. From the solution of the wave equation, it is shown that the eigenmodes of propagation in a non-local Ω medium are linearly polarized <b>uniform</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> and that the fields of {{at least one of the}} eigenmodes strongly interact with the medium. The frequency characteristics of the material parameters of the non-local Ω medium are derived based on a proposed equivalent-circuit model of the non-local Ω element. The model yields physically acceptable results except at extremely high frequencies where the circuit-model approximation no longer applies. The <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in an unbounded three-dimensional non-local Ω medium is studied and the equation of the index surface is obtained. The eigenmodes of propagation and their wavenumbers as well as their wave impedances are also given for specific directions of propagation. The reflection and transmission coefficients of an Ω half-space are obtained and the problem of wave reflection by a lossy Ω layer in front of a perfectly conducting ground is analyzed theoretically. It is shown that the resonance of the conducting Ω microstructures in the Ω medium can enhance energy dissipation in the medium and, therefore, can result in a noticeable reduction in the magnitude of the reflection coefficient. The theory of Ω waveguides is also developed and the problems of parallel plate and slab waveguides are solved. The radiation problem is tackled by considering the case of a uniform infinite-line current source embedded in an unbounded Ω medium and the case of such a source above an Ω half-space. Finally, we present a suggestion for the practical implementation of some of our proposed ideas in the area of microwave devices. ...|$|R
