5|$|Harlof Klovstad, {{medical officer}} on the Southern Cross Expedition, 1898–1900, died of <b>unrecorded</b> causes during 1900.|$|E
5|$|Tarrare {{was born}} in rural France, near Lyon, around 1772. His date of birth is <b>unrecorded</b> {{and it is not}} even known if Tarrare was his real name or a nickname.|$|E
5|$|Degsastan {{appears not}} to have been the first battle between Áedán and the Bernicians. The death of his son Domangart {{in the land of the}} Saxons is {{mentioned}} by Adomnán, and it is presumed that Bran died in the same otherwise <b>unrecorded</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for {{the total}} number of {{casualties}} in the war vary, because many deaths went <b>unrecorded.</b> Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, China {{was the top}} {{producer}} of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries {{are believed to have}} <b>unrecorded</b> production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents.|$|E
5|$|Like other Hawaiian honeycreepers, the hookbill {{possessed a}} {{distinctive}} musty odor. The bird's only known vocalization was an inconspicuous chirp; however, all other Hawaiian honeycreepers are excellent vocalists that demonstrate {{an array of}} sounds, and therefore the hookbill likely had a broader, <b>unrecorded</b> repertoire.|$|E
5|$|The cast of this {{black-and-white}} film is <b>unrecorded.</b> The dialogue, {{captured by}} the film's director-cum-producer, was in Malay. The snakes used {{in the production of}} this film came from The Teng Chun's personal zoo.|$|E
5|$|A growing {{population}} and political concerns (admitting two states meant having four new senators for the Republican Party) caused Dakota Territory {{to be divided}} in half and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations formally admitting South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889. Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went <b>unrecorded.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{pedigreed cat}} is one whose ancestry is {{recorded}} by a cat fancier organization. A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals {{of the same}} breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats. Cats of <b>unrecorded,</b> mixed ancestry {{are referred to as}} domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.|$|E
5|$|At 06:30 on 5 April, 26 P-38s of the U.S. 1st Fighter Group {{conducted}} a sweep over the Sicilian Strait. Meanwhile, 18 B-25s of the 321st Bomb Group—escorted by 32 P-38s of the 82nd Fighter Group—set {{out on a}} maritime interdiction operation. Six of the P-38s returned to base for <b>unrecorded</b> reasons. The B-25s claimed two ferries damaged and a destroyer sunk. One B-25 was shot down.|$|E
5|$|Eventually in 1992, the {{surviving}} material {{was released on}} home video, accompanied by in-camera narration by Tom Baker to bridge the <b>unrecorded</b> content. In later years, Shada was reinterpreted in several forms including an audio play featuring Eighth Doctor Paul McGann (also presented on the Web, accompanied by basic Flash animation) and a novelization by Gareth Roberts.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{the year}} nor {{the date of}} Stigand's birth is known. He was born in East Anglia, {{possibly}} in Norwich, to an apparently prosperous family of mixed English and Scandinavian ancestry, as is shown {{by the fact that}} Stigand's name was Norse but his brother's was English. His brother Æthelmær, also a cleric, later succeeded Stigand as bishop of Elmham. His sister held land in Norwich, but her given name is <b>unrecorded.</b>|$|E
5|$|The date of {{the first}} church {{to be built in}} Stretford is <b>unrecorded,</b> but in a lease dated 1413, land is {{described}} as lying next to a chapel. Many of the present day churches in the area were constructed during the late 19th and early 20th century, as the population of Stretford began to grow.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} executions Calcraft carried out is <b>unrecorded,</b> {{but it has}} been {{estimated}} at 450, of whom 35 were women, making him one of the most active of British executioners. Among his better-known victims was François Courvoisier, executed on 6 July 1840 outside Newgate Prison. Courvoisier had been valet to Lord William Russell, and had murdered his master after being caught stealing silverware from the household.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} these {{personal}} modifications mostly went <b>unrecorded.</b> It is believed he achieved a height of 10,000 feet in nine minutes, curtailing the standard time by some five minutes. It was perhaps on exaggeration but no record remains to certify what McCudden did. He did note the maximum ground-level speed as 135mph in his log book. He achieved these feats with the limited resources of a front-line squadron and without any official assistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{total loss}} of life {{resulting}} from Pontiac's War is unknown. About 400 British soldiers were killed in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death. George Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed or captured, a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers killed. The violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee their homes. Native American losses went mostly <b>unrecorded.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is <b>unrecorded</b> when Bodiam Castle was {{dismantled}} (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted {{to prevent them from}} being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} as herbalism, {{the study}} and use of plants for their medicinal properties. Many records of the Holocene period date early botanical knowledge {{as far back as}} 10,000 years ago. This early <b>unrecorded</b> knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee, which make up much of the Cherokee land today. The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E
5|$|Frawley, {{who also}} served as cinematographer for the film, had a relaxed {{approach}} to making films; he did not use screenplays and never numbered the scenes. During the assembling of Frawley's films, the sole material for editors to rely on was a pad with notes scrawled in it. The identities of the cast of The Bold Bank Robbery are <b>unrecorded.</b> The film, silent and shot in black-and-white, was filmed in Philadelphia. It was shot using a camera that company creator Siegmund Lubin had built back in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{the nephew}} of Walkelin, Bishop of Winchester, and Simon, Abbot of Ely. His parents were Osbert and Anna, and his brother Peter was also a royal clerk. Where {{he was born and}} raised is unknown; he is {{documented}} as cantor of Rouen Cathedral, and precentor of the same cathedral, although the date of his appointment to either office is <b>unrecorded.</b> By 1091 he had become archdeacon of Rouen. He served in the royal chancery under successive kings of England, William I and William II.|$|E
5|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature {{mean that the}} snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is <b>unrecorded.</b> It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
5|$|Jørgen Christian Jensen {{was born}} on 15 January 1891 in Løgstør, Denmark, the son of Jørgen Christian Jensen and Christiane, known as Jensen. His early life is {{otherwise}} <b>unrecorded.</b> In 1908 {{at the age of}} 17, he travelled to the United Kingdom, before emigrating to Australia the following March. He sailed to Melbourne, but then moved to Morgan, South Australia and then Port Pirie, working as a sailor on river steamers on the Murray River, and as a labourer. He was naturalised as a British subject in Adelaide on 7 September 1914.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of William Bruce's youth, and his date of birth is <b>unrecorded.</b> He was {{probably}} born at Blairhall in western Fife, in around 1630, the second son of Robert Bruce of Blairhall and Katherine Preston. He may have attended St Andrews University in 1637–1638, which would suggest that his birth date was as early as 1625. The Bruces were a well-connected Episcopalian family, strongly loyal to the king, and descended from Thomas Bruce a cousin of King Robert II, who had been granted lands in Clackmannan and Fife. Bruce's first cousin Edward Bruce was created Earl of Kincardine in 1643.|$|E
5|$|Possession of Bodiam Castle {{passed through}} {{several generations of}} Dalyngrigges, until their line became extinct, when the castle passed by {{marriage}} to the Lewknor family. During the Wars of the Roses, Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the House of Lancaster, and when Richard III of the House of York became king in 1483, a force was despatched to besiege Bodiam Castle. It is <b>unrecorded</b> whether the siege went ahead, but {{it is thought that}} Bodiam was surrendered without much resistance. The castle was confiscated, but returned to the Lewknors when Henry VII of the House of Lancaster became king in 1485. Descendants of the Lewknors owned the castle until at least the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski sailed on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and sailed the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June. Likely because of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are <b>unrecorded,</b> but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor {{in defiance of the}} detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|Records {{state that}} plague deaths in London and the suburbs crept {{up over the}} summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures {{are likely to be}} a {{considerable}} underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. Quakers refused to co-operate and many of the poor were just dumped into mass graves <b>unrecorded.</b> It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the Great Fire of London the following year. In the few districts where intact records remain, plague deaths varied between 30% and over 50% of the total population.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} he was {{appointed}} Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of Öland and Gotland with six students from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to Visby in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, {{and then returned to}} Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously <b>unrecorded</b> plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in , written in Swedish. Like , it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} the Gulf of Mexico, Charlie had weakened to a 105mph (165km/h) hurricane. On August 21, it remained a Category2 hurricane while crossing the Gulf of Mexico until 18hours before landfall. On August 22, Charlie rapidly intensified, and it strengthened {{to a second}} peak of 135mph (215km/h) off the mainland Mexican coast. Later, Charlie made landfall near Tampico with 125mph (200km/h) sustained winds. The strongest winds were {{believed to have been}} north of the eye, and were <b>unrecorded.</b> The storm quickly weakened over land, and it dissipated on August 23 in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Urse died {{some time}} in 1108. Little is known of his wife, Alice, whose death is <b>unrecorded.</b> Urse was succeeded as sheriff by his son Roger d'Abetot, who was exiled in about 1110 and {{forfeited}} the office of sheriff. Roger's successor, Osbert d'Abetot, was probably Urse's brother. Urse also had a daughter, probably named Emmeline, who married Walter de Beauchamp. Walter succeeded to Urse's lands after Roger's exile. A charter for Saint-Georges de Boscherville Abbey may indicate that Urse had a second son, named Robert. Urse may also have had another daughter, who married Robert Marmion, as some of Urse's estates went to Marmion's family and others to the Beauchamps.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the chronicle}} {{indirectly}} implies that Rögnvaldr {{was also a}} son of Finnguala, {{there is evidence that}} strongly suggests that he had a different mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard. Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was a son of Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been an <b>unrecorded</b> wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. The chronicle records that because Óláfr was only a child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 {{his wife}} Sarah died, {{although}} {{the cause is}} <b>unrecorded.</b> Evans remarried two years later in April 1818 to Hetty Ward, who was many years his junior and {{the daughter of the}} New York innkeeper. In these last years Evans lived in New York with his new wife. In early 1819 Evans developed an inflammation of the lungs and after a month of illness, died on April 15, 1819. Just four days prior, on April 11, news had reached him in New York that the Mars Works in Philadelphia had burned down, though his sons-in-law were committed to re-establishing the business and did so further outside of the city. Evans was buried at Zion Episcopal Church in Manhattan, but when that church was sold his body was moved several times until finally resting in 1890 in an unmarked common grave at Trinity Cemetery, Broadway at 157th Street, New York City.|$|E
5|$|In 1985–86 Cleveland County Archaeology Section {{carried out}} a major {{excavation}} of {{the west end of}} the nave to consolidate an area of subsidence. Its cause was the collapse of an <b>unrecorded</b> burial vault. The excavations found more evidence of the fire of 1289 including scorched masonry, a shattered bell and broken grave-slabs. The remains of 47 people – 21 men, 17 women, 6 children and 3 of undetermined gender – were discovered, some of whom had been buried with grave goods including a gold finger ring and jet crosses. Two chalices and patens were found alongside the remains of two priests. The skeletons were cremated and the ashes scattered in the Monks' Walk in the Priory Gardens. A geophysical survey carried out to the west and east of the west range indicated the existence of the remains of other monastic buildings which have yet to be excavated.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus was {{succeeded by}} his son; the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Zenobia, {{the mother of}} the new king, was the de facto ruler and Vaballathus {{remained}} in her shadow while she consolidated her power. Gallienus dispatched his prefect Heraclian to command military operations against the Persians, but he was marginalized by Zenobia and returned to the West. The queen was careful not to provoke Rome, claiming for herself and her son the titles held by her husband while guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the borders with Persia, Zenobia fortified different settlements on the Euphrates including the citadels of Halabiye and Zalabiye. Circumstantial evidence exist for confrontations with the Sasanians; probably in 269 Vaballathus took the title Persicus Maximus ("The great victor in Persia") and the title might be linked with an <b>unrecorded</b> battle against a Persian army trying to regain control of Northern Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Vitus Bering {{had been}} a {{prominent}} sailor in Russia. After successful expeditions in 1725, 1728, and 1730, Bering was sent to explore {{what is now the}} Bering Sea area of the Pacific in 1740. He soon settled on Kamchatka, where he started a settlement and built two additional vessels, dubbed St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1741 Bering and his company started towards North America, but were stalled by a storm and in being delayed were forced to take land. During the storm they could not make out the Alaskan coast. The storm proved too powerful so the ships turned around, along the way charting several of the Aleutians, including Gareloi. Since then, it has been barely studied, resulting in a fragmentary knowledge of its eruptions and possibly even <b>unrecorded</b> episodes.|$|E
5|$|When he took vows as a cleric is <b>unrecorded,</b> but Nigel held a prebend, an ecclesiastical {{office in}} the cathedral, in the see of London before holding one of the offices of archdeacon in the diocese of Salisbury, {{although}} which archdeaconry he held is unclear. Most modern historians believe that Nigel was brother to Alexander of Lincoln, later Bishop of Lincoln, but this relationship is not specifically attested in the sources, which merely state that both were Roger's nephews. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, considered both Alexander and Nigel to be well educated and diligent. Nigel attended the consecration of Bernard as Bishop of St David's at Westminster in 1115, and may have returned to England from Laon by 1112. From {{the time of his}} return until around 1120 he served as a royal chaplain and attested a number of royal charters.|$|E
5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have <b>unrecorded</b> production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E
