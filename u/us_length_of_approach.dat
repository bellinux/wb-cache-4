Controlling for age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, income, fruit and vegetable consumption, current smoking and alcohol use, we found that: (1) foreign-born adults had lower BMI than US-born adults; (2) among foreign-born adults, longer residence in the United States was associated with higher BMI; and (3) the effect of birthplace-length of US residence on BMI differed by education level, gender and race/ethnicity. Specifically, longer residence in the United States was associated with the greatest percent increases in BMI among the lowest educated groups than higher educated groups, among women (vs. men) and among Hispanics (vs. other racial/ethnic groups). These findings suggest that a protective effect of foreign birthplace on BMI appears to attenuate with <b>length</b> <b>of</b> residence in the United States, and also reveal that BMI/obesity trajectories associated with <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> residence vary by education, gender and race/ethnicity.

40|$|Abstract Background: Whether or not {{antibiotic}} stewardship protocols {{based on}} procalcitonin levels results in cost savings remains unclear. Herein, our {{objective was to}} assess the economic impact of adopting procalcitonin testing among patients with suspected acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) {{from the perspective of a}} typical US integrated delivery network (IDN) with a 1, 000, 000 member catchment area or enrollment. Methods: To conduct an economic evaluation of procalcitonin testing versus usual care we built a cost-impact model based on patient-level meta-analysis data of randomized trials. The meta-analytic data was adapted to the US setting by applying the meta-analytic results to <b>US</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> stay, costs, and practice patterns. We estimated the annual ARI visit rate for the one million member cohort, by setting (inpatient, ICU, outpatient) and ARI diagnosis. Results: In the inpatient setting, the costs of procalcitonin-guided compared to usual care for the one million member cohort was $ 2, 083, 545, compared to $ 2, 780, 322, resulting in net savings of nearly $ 700, 000 to the IDN for 2014. In the ICU and outpatient settings, savings were $ 73, 326 and $ 5, 329, 824, respectively, summing up to overall net savings of $ 6, 099, 927 for the cohort. Results were robust for all ARI diagnoses. For the whole US insured population, procalcitonin-guided care would result in $ 1. 6 billion in savings annually. Conclusions: Our results show substantial savings associated with procalcitonin protocols of ARI across common US treatment settings mainly by direct reduction in unnecessary antibiotic utilization. These results are robust to changes in key parameters, and the savings can be achieved without any negative impact on treatment outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{accidents}} are commonly found on horizontal curves. It is therefore important to design horizontal curves that elicit safe driving behavior. This thesis investigates how curve geometry influences the driver behavior in horizontal curves by using naturalistic driving data. Seven curves were selected, all on rural two-lane roads with a posted speed limit of 70 km/h. The curve geometry factors studied were radius, presence and <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> spiral transitions and <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> and exit tangent. Regression analyses {{were used to}} analyze how these factors influenced the driver behavior in terms of speed and maximum lateral acceleration. The speed behavior was also analyzed by studying speed profiles. The study showed that all studied factors influenced the driver behavior in the selected curves. The speed increased for larger radii, and longer approach tangent resulted in higher speed {{at the beginning of}} the curvature. Longer transition resulted in higher speeds at the center of the curve, and did not affect the maximum lateral acceleration – indicating a changed trajectory. All but one of the selected curves did not fulfill the existing recommendations on curve design provided by the Swedish Transport Administration. The speed profiles showed that the median speed exceeded the posted speed limit in all curves except one. Driving at higher speeds than what a curve is designed for could increase risks. The study also found that speed patterns in curves seemed to be independent of the choice of speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} {{community has}} assumed that using a head-up display (HUD) instead of conventional head-down displays will increase accuracy and safety during approach and landing. The putative mechanism for {{this increase in}} safety is that previously demonstrated improvements in lateral and vertical control of the aircraft in flight should carry over to the landing situation. Alternatively, it is possible that, during approach and landing, the HUD might affect the pilot's ability to assimilate outside cues at the decision height, thereby reducing the success ratio for landings using an HUD. This article reports a pair of experiments that test these competing hypotheses. Taking {{advantage of the opportunity}} when an air transport operator introduced HUD in an existing aircraft fleet, we were able to use a Boeing 737 - 700 full-motion simulator flown by commercial airline pilots. Weexplored the effects of (a) HUDuse, (b) ambient visibility, and (c) <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> lighting on the size and location of the touchdown footprint.

Based on these empirical data, the minimum visibility for approaches using HUDs could be set lower than for approaches without an HUD. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{shape memory}} alloy NiTi has {{successfully}} proved {{in many areas of}} medical technology. This paper describes the innovative idea and development of orbital floor implants made of NiTi. Pseudoelastic NiTi has the peculiarity that it can withstand large mechanical deformations of up to 8 % without being plastically deformed, i. e. it goes back to its original shape with relief of the strain. This material property can be used to produce flexible, yet stable implants. The NiTi implants can be implanted into the body in compressed form over relatively small approaches. Arriving at the fracture position, they develop self-reliantly in the previously memorized shape. The perioperative trauma is reduced. The treatment of orbital floor fractures is often done surgically by use of implants from rigid materials such as titanium, which are inserted in the eye socket through an open approach on the lower eyelid. Implants made of a pseudoelastic {{shape memory alloy}}s can help to reduce the required incision <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach.</b> It is even possible to insert the implant in a minimally invasive procedure via endoscopic access routes and to completely avoid open approach.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess treatments and costs associated with blood and blood product transfusions in a historical cohort of 189, 457 inpatients in the US and 34, 987 inpatients in Belgium undergoing knee or hip surgery. Methods: Descriptive analysis, logistic regression and ordinary least squares regression were used to describe the factors associated with the use and cost of allogeneic blood transfusion. Results: Hospitalisation costs for joint replacement surgery totalled $ 12, 718 (SD= 6, 356) and averaged 4. 33 days in the US, while costs in Belgium were $ 6, 526 (SD= 3, 192) and averaged 17. 1 days. The use of low molecular weight heparin and tranexamic acid was much higher in Belgium than the US (36 % and 99 % compared to 0 % and 40 %, respectively). Patients in the US spent 12. 7 (p< 0. 0001) fewer days in the hospital, 0. 3 (p< 0. 0001) fewer days in the intensive care unit and were 88 % less likely to have allogeneic blood transfusions (OR= 0. 22, 95 % CI 0. 22 - 0. 23), but incurred $ 6, 483 (p< 0. 0001) more costs per hospitalisation than patients in Belgium. Conclusions: While hospital costs for patients were greater in the <b>US,</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay was shorter and patients were less likely to have transfusion services than those patients in Belgium.
