5|$|Greinke {{made his}} first start for the Angels on July 29. After a stretch of four <b>unproductive</b> starts from August 3–19 (1–1, 7.20 ERA in 25 innings), Greinke {{followed}} up with four consecutive starts of at least seven innings and two or fewer runs — all of them wins. In those starts, he produced a 1.88 ERA in 28 innings.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in 194849, {{playing in the}} first three matches of the season for Victoria as an opening batsman. However, he was <b>unproductive,</b> scoring only 91 runs at a batting average of 15.16, and was dropped. He moved to Queensland the following season in search of more opportunities and was selected in one match.|$|E
5|$|Junkin {{became known}} as a draft bust due to his <b>unproductive</b> career. An ESPN article in 2008 noted Junkin noted as the eighth biggest draft bust of all time. He was also {{named one of the}} Cleveland' Browns worst three draft picks from 1995 or earlier.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, Rangel {{advocated}} continued funding of anti-poverty efforts, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Child care and development block grant. Rangel {{also had an}} <b>unproductive</b> relationship with Ways and Means chairman Bill Thomas, leading to an incident in which Thomas called the United States Capitol Police on Rangel for having his members read {{a bill in the}} library, an action Thomas apologized for.|$|E
5|$|Harvey then {{returned}} to productivity with 145 against Warwickshire and added a further half-century in the remaining matches. He also took 5/57 in an innings to help set up a seven-wicket win over the Minor Counties, although the match was not first-class. Harvey compiled 197 runs at 19.70 in five Tests with two half centuries. It was by far his most <b>unproductive</b> summer in England, with 976 runs at 31.48. Such was {{the dominance of the}} Laker-Lock-led attack that Harvey was Australia's fifth-highest runscorer in the Tests and fourth in the first-class matches.|$|E
5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and <b>unproductive.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{the start}} of a barren month for Brown, who passed 30 only once in 11 {{first-class}} innings, totalling 171 runs at 15.55. He ended the <b>unproductive</b> sequence with an unbeaten 100 against Nottinghamshire. This came after Bill Voce had bowled Bodyline {{at the start of the}} Australian innings, in contravention of a prior agreement. After an Australian protest, Voce missed the remainder of the match and Brown's innings was punctuated by angry heckling by the local supporters.|$|E
5|$|Numismatic author Dean Albanese {{considers}} the legend that Washington provided the gold {{for the first}} 400 eagles to be improbable; holding $4,000 in coin would have tied up much of Washington's capital in <b>unproductive</b> cash. Albanese suggests that as many surviving 1795 eagles are found with little wear, Washington may have had the government purchase pieces to give to dignitaries. By some reports, one eagle was presented to Washington, though whether it was from this first coinage is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|She {{intended}} to follow Mrs. Tittlemouse with a tale about a pig {{in a large}} format book similar to the original Ginger and Pickles, but was forced to abandon the project after several <b>unproductive</b> attempts at composition. Instead, she occupied the winter of 191011 with supervising the production of Peter Rabbit's Painting Book, and composing Timmy Tiptoes, a tale about indigenous North American mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was <b>unproductive.</b> The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as <b>unproductive</b> reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in <b>unproductive</b> orientations in the active site.|$|E
5|$|After {{scores of}} 6 and 12 in the Fourth Test, {{he missed the}} final Test due to injury, ending an <b>unproductive</b> Test summer in which he managed only 186 runs at 23.25. The series was noted for Morris' {{difficulties}} against the spin duo of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin, who bowled left-arm orthodox and leg spin respectively. The pair was responsible for five of his eight dismissals on the tour. Morris did not play a match after the new year and ended the season with 698 runs at 53.69. He topped his state's Shield batting averages, leading from the front as New South Wales regained the title.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several <b>unproductive</b> negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was <b>unproductive</b> or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either <b>unproductive</b> or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|During the 1938 tour, McCabe {{had been}} {{generally}} <b>unproductive</b> and he missed {{much of the}} subsequent Australian season due to illness and only played sporadically thereafter before cricket was cancelled due to World War II. He {{served in the military}} in a clerical position for a year before he was discharged due to a chronic feet problems. McCabe was plagued by poor health in his middle age, and was hospitalised for a liver ailment shortly before his death. He {{died at the age of}} 58 after falling off a cliff adjacent to his home in Mosman. There was innuendo that it was a suicide, but the coroner ruled that it was an accident.|$|E
5|$|From there on, Harvey's {{series was}} <b>unproductive,</b> failing to pass 31 {{in the six}} innings of the final three Tests. Australia's form slumped along with that of Harvey, losing the next two Tests and the series 3–1. Harvey ended with 354 runs at 44.25 for the series. Despite this, he {{continued}} to productive in the other first-class matches and {{was by far the}} most productive batsman in the 1954–55 Australian season, accumulating 1100 at 47.83 runs ahead of Les Favell's 663. He scored a pair of 62s in a 36-run win over New South Wales, 95 and 66 against Queensland and 82 and 47 in a match for a Tasmania Combined XI against England.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old <b>unproductive</b> wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and <b>unproductive</b> activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{focused on}} the {{propaganda}} war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts. In these, he presented himself as a Marxist-Leninist, speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Fidel Castro. Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were <b>unproductive,</b> for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle. His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions. He also sought support from Western nations, visiting Western embassies in Mozambique, and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The 1962–63 home Ashes {{series was}} Australia's first Test matches in 18 months. After an <b>unproductive</b> season last year, O'Neill started the new summer with 15 and 2/30 for a Western Australia Combined XI against Ted Dexter's Englishmen. His victims {{with the ball}} were Dexter and batsman Tom Graveney. He then made his first century in over a year, scoring 131 against Western Australia for his state. O'Neill {{completed}} his preparation for the Tests by helping New South Wales to defeat Dexter's men by an innings. He scored 143 and took 2/36, removing Graveney and leading batsman Colin Cowdrey.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the barn}} owl has been much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet {{have been made in}} most parts of the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, <b>unproductive</b> areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms do not seem to be consumed.|$|E
5|$|The major {{risks to}} the jaguar include {{deforestation}} across its habitat, increasing competition for food with human beings, especially in dry and <b>unproductive</b> habitat, poaching, hurricanes in northern parts of its range, and the behavior of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock. When adapted to the prey, the jaguar {{has been shown to}} take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{results of}} the mission were mixed. The astronaut returned healthy after nine hours of confinement in a low-gravity environment. Observation of the Earth's surface proved <b>unproductive,</b> however, because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures. The public and political reaction was muted {{compared with that of}} earlier missions, as the Cuban Missile Crisis soon eclipsed the Space Race in the news. The mission was a technical success: all the engineering objectives were completed without significant malfunctions, and the spacecraft used even less fuel than expected. This confirmed the capabilities of the Mercury spacecraft and allowed NASA to plan with confidence for a day-long flight, MA-9, which had been an early goal of the Mercury program.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are <b>unproductive</b> and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, {{considering}} it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E
5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically <b>unproductive.</b> By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E
5|$|Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot, the British fleet {{commander}} in North America, {{was aware that}} Destouches was planning something, but did not learn of Destouches' sailing until 10 March, and immediately led his fleet out of Gardiner Bay in pursuit. He {{had the advantage of}} favourable winds, and reached Cape Henry on 16 March, slightly ahead of Destouches. Although suffering a tactical defeat, Arbuthnot was able to pull into Chesapeake Bay, thus frustrating the original intent of Destouches' mission, forcing the French fleet to return to Newport. After transports delivered 2,000 men to reinforce Arnold, Arbuthnot returned to New York. He resigned his post as station chief in July and left for England, ending a stormy, difficult, and <b>unproductive</b> relationship with General Clinton.|$|E
5|$|By the {{day after}} the regular session ended, Dayton had vetoed all of the budget bills passed by the legislature, and said in a {{statement}} that he anticipated a shutdown would occur. Dayton did not call a special session of the legislature to further address the budget during May or June, claiming that the lack of agreement between him and Zellers and Koch would make it <b>unproductive</b> to do so. He remained in contact with legislative leaders, sticking by the $35.8 billion budget he proposed late in the session, with minor changes. As the end of June approached, Koch urged the governor to call a session to pass a temporary 'lights-on' bill while a final deal was reached, but he refused to answer this proposal on the grounds that extending the budget's deadline would not serve the goal of reaching a final agreement. Since the budget impasse had not ended by the end of June 30, the shutdown began at midnight of June 30–July 1, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Following the IPL, Pathan resumed {{international}} {{duties in}} the Kitply Cup and the 2008 Asia Cup. He had an <b>unproductive</b> {{time with the}} ball; although he scored a total of 86 runs at 28.66, he took seven wickets at 51.42 at an economy rate of 6.56. Pathan was overlooked for the Tests in Sri Lanka but was called into the team for the one-dayers, but played in {{only three of the}} five fixtures. He took three wickets at 34.66, conceding 5.20 runs an over, and struggled with the bat, scoring 19 runs at 6.33 as the Indian batting collapsed in each match. He was then included in an India A team for a series of matches against touring counterparts from New Zealand and Australia. He had average results, taking four wickets at 43.75 and an economy rate of 4.86, and scored 56 runs at 18.66 in four games. He did better the Challenger Trophy, taking six wickets at 14.00 at an economy rate of 3.42, and scored 71 runs at 35.50 as India Blue won all three matches.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's 1950–51 {{season was}} {{similarly}} <b>unproductive,</b> with the Test players back in Australia {{for a home}} series against England. He was only selected for the two first class matches against Tasmania, was even less successful. In the first match, he made a duck in the first innings, {{before coming to the}} crease {{at the end of the}} run-chase and being yet to score as a nine wicket win was completed. In the next match he made 0 and 9, as Victoria scraped home for a nine run win, despite Harvey conceding 20 runs from four wicketless overs. He ended the first class season with 9 runs at 3.00. In a Second XI fixture against New South Wales, he made 61 before being bowled by Alan Davidson. In the first innings he delivered one over and was attacked heavily, conceding 23 runs. In the second innings, he bowled 13 overs and took 1/49 as New South Wales ended 24 runs short of making Victoria bat again with three wickets in hand when the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Viet Cong {{was back}} in action again; this time the 165th Regiment of the 7th Division {{targeted}} the Tong Le Chon Special Forces Camp, located southeast of the 1st Infantry Division's area of operations. Just after midnight on August 7, the 165th Regiment attacked Tong Le Chon {{and was able to}} penetrate the Special Forces Camp, but was forced to flee after an ammunition bunker exploded. That night the Viet Cong assaulted the base several times more, but on each occasion they were repelled by artillery fire and close air-support. By September, the scale of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese activities in III Corps had perplexed the U.S. commanders of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. In the meantime, however, Hay decided {{to put an end to}} large-scale operations which had proven to be <b>unproductive,</b> until the enemy's real intentions were known. Instead, Hay continued to commit his 2nd Brigade to pacification efforts in southern Bình Dương Province, while the 3rd Brigade provided protection for engineers clearing Highway 13.|$|E
5|$|In metapopulation terminology, {{migrating}} {{individuals are}} classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A {{site is a}} generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are <b>unproductive</b> sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become <b>unproductive</b> hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
5|$|Stalin died in March 1953, {{and in the}} {{reorganisation}} that followed, the Presidium was abolished and {{a smaller}} Politburo reconstituted. Although Brezhnev was not made a Politburo member, he was appointed head of the Political Directorate of the Army and the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant-General, a very senior position. Brezhnev's patron Khrushchev succeeded Stalin as General Secretary, while Khrushchev's opponent Malenkov succeeded Stalin as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Brezhnev sided with Khrushchev against Malenkov, but only for several years. On 7 May 1955, Brezhnev was made General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR. On the surface, his brief was simple: to make the new lands agriculturally productive. In reality, Brezhnev {{became involved in the}} development of the Soviet missile and nuclear arms programs, including the Baykonur Cosmodrome. The initially successful Virgin Lands Campaign soon became <b>unproductive</b> and failed to solve the growing Soviet food crisis. Brezhnev was recalled to Moscow in 1956. The harvest in the years following the Virgin Lands Campaign was disappointing, which would have hurt his political career had he remained in Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climate deterioration, {{resulting}} in more land becoming <b>unproductive.</b> Self-sufficient farms were based around a single homestead or a small cluster of homes. More oats and barley were grown than corn, and cattle {{were the most important}} domesticated animal. From c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at greater heights and made land more productive. The system of infield and outfield agriculture may have been introduced with feudalism from the twelfth century. By the late Medieval period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile. These were settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, organised in run rigs. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen. The rural economy boomed in the thirteenth century and {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Black Death was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century.|$|E
