25|$|During the World War II period, the American Jewish {{community}} was bitterly and deeply divided and {{was unable to}} form a common front. Most Jews from Eastern Europe favored Zionism, which saw a return to their historical homeland as the only solution; this had the effect of diverting attention from the persecution of Jews in Germany. German Jews were alarmed at the Nazis but were disdainful of Zionism. Proponents of a Jewish state and Jewish army agitated, but many leaders were so fearful of an antisemitic backlash inside the <b>U.S.</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> demanded that all Jews keep a low public profile. One important development was the sudden conversion of most (but not all) Jewish leaders to Zionism late in the war. The Holocaust was largely ignored by American media as it was happening. Reporters and editors largely did not believe the atrocity stories coming out of Europe.|$|E

The following day (22 July 1964), Douglas-Home sent a memorandum to the Foreign Secretary Rab Butler, in which he [...] "decreed that the United Kingdom should 'make life intolerable' for Nasser, 'with money and arms', and that this 'should be deniable if possible'." [...] The result was that a secret Joint Action Committee was created to handle British policy on Yemen.

[...] The Wiggles performed during the intermission of Barney Live stage shows, which The New York Times likened to [...] "getting the warm-up slot for the Stones" [...] in the pre-school entertainment world. [...] In 2000, when video sales took off in the US, Lyrick began to distribute Wiggles videos and advertised them by including Wiggles shorts as trailers in their Barney videos, which, as Anthony Field stated, [...] "pushed us over the edge". [...] At first, the group's videos were distributed in boutique stores such as FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy, and on-line. [...] According to Paul Field, they entered the mass media market when their videos became top-sellers at Amazon.com, and their first two videos, Yummy Yummy and Wiggle Time, landed in the top ten at Amazon.com.

[...] Deutch denied that the controlled reporting influenced policy and decisions, but confirmed its [...] "substantial role in framing the debate." [...] The Director also stated that the disinformation did not influence arms control negotiations, and that Ames' espionage hampered U.S. coverage of internal Soviet affairs, Soviet/Russian foreign policy (concerning nonproliferation and the CIS), and [...] "The extent {{of the decline of}} Soviet and Russian military technology and procurement programs." [...] In response, Specter and Kerrey insisted that the true extent of the damage caused by Ames was still unknown, noting that the DAT had not reviewed all intelligence reports from suspect sources and that the State Department {{was not included in the}} study. Specter also quoted a Defense official who said that accelerated procurement cost about $200 million.|$|E

[...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there.
