Not only does he assume a totally {{believable}} African accent and manner, he convinces us with every move and gesture that he's a resourceful Everyman elevated to genuine heroism by {{a struggle to}} do the right thing. —William Arnold, writing in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Michael Rechtshaffen, writing in The Hollywood Reporter, said actor [...] "Cheadle impressively carries the entire picture, delivering the kind of note-perfect performance that's absolutely deserving of Oscar consideration." [...] Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times called it a [...] "riveting drama", while exclaiming [...] "The film works not because the screen is filled with meaningless special effects, formless action and vast digital armies, but because Cheadle, Nolte and the filmmakers are interested in how two men choose to function in an impossible situation. Because we sympathize with these men, we are moved by the film." [...] In the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote that the film was a [...] "harrowing experience", and that [...] "it documents for a mass audience what it was like. It's useful, in that it shows how it can happen. It's even hopeful, in that it shows that it's possible—not guaranteed, but possible—for people to maintain their humanity in the face of unhinged barbarism." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today, said the film was [...] "one of the year's most moving and powerful films, anchored by a magnificent performance by Don Cheadle." [...] She declared, [...] "Hotel Rwanda emerges as an African version of Schindler's List." [...] The film however, was not without its detractors. Dave Sterrit of The Christian Science Monitor, felt that although the subject matter was crucially important, he commented that [...] "the movie dilutes its impact with by-the-numbers filmmaking, and Cheadle's one-note performance displays few of his acting gifts." [...] Left equally unimpressed was Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly. Commenting on the character significance of the U.N. personnel, she said it was [...] "a bad day for narrative, if not for diplomacy, when there is only one 3-D character among the entire <b>U.N.</b> <b>lot,</b> clad in their blue helmets, and that role is rasped by Nick Nolte with moral remorse rather than his more usual hint of dissolution." [...] In her overall summation, she wrote [...] "Hotel Rwanda is a strange history lesson that leaves us more overlectured than properly overwhelmed." [...] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice, added to the negativity by saying the film was [...] "told to us secondhand, or glimpsed in distant scuffles" [...] and [...] "Like the majority of movies about the last century of holocausts, Hotel Rwanda is as earnest and tasteful as its creators. To capture the white-hot terror of social calamity, someone a little more lawless and fierce might be called for." ...|$|E

The major causes of abandonment was being born by a single/unmarried mother or by poor parents. Family adversity and parental dysfunction was the major cause of only one fourth of the abandonments. More than half of abandoned children were admitted {{during the first six}} months of life, and only one quarter after age three. The average time spent in orphanages was 14 years for boys and 17 years for girls. No more than 25 % of the boys and 12 % of the girls were keeping in contact with the family during in-care. As many as 73 % of the boys and 41 % of the girls were physically abused and 23 % of the girls and 17 % of the boys were sexually abused in the orphanage.

50|$|Secondly, the FLN {{can count}} on the Third-Worldist support. After the Second World War, many new states were created {{as a result of}} decolonization. In 1945, there were 51 states in the UN, and in 1965, they are 117. Thus, {{the balance of power in}} the <b>UN</b> changed a <b>lot,</b> and the {{recently}} decolonised countries are now a majority, so they have huge capacities. In addition to that, those new states are part of the Third-Worldist movement. They went to be a third path in a bipolar world (it is the non-alignment), they are against colonisation, and for modernization. Thus, they feel concerned by the Algerian conflict and support the FLN on the international stage. As an example, in 1954, a few days after the first insurrection, the radio in Yugoslavia (Third-Worldist) begin to make propaganda for the struggle of Algeria. Furthermore, the FLN is invited in 1955 at the Bandung conference to represent Algeria, which is a huge international recognition. Finally, Third-Worldist countries try to ensure that the Algerian conflict will be discussed at the UN general assembly. As a result, the French government is more and more isolated.|$|R
40|$|Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV), an {{economically}} significant seed-transmitted virus of pea has been {{commonly found in}} pea germplasm collections of many countries. The virus is suspected to have spread world-wide due to the exchange of infected germplasm material. Owing to the secondary spread of the virus in the field by aphid vectors, {{a low level of}} seed infection leads to a high proportion of the disease. The symptoms produced on sensitive pea cultivars are often not very characteristic. Resistance to this virus, known to be governed by a recessive gene ’sbm’, {{is in the process of}} being incorporated into improved pea varieties. Before accomplishing this genetic programme, testing of seed lots by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay can greatly contribute in limiting the spread of the virus. In view of the importance of the disease and of the area of pea under cultivation, the present review has sought to deal at length with diverse aspects of the disease and the virus and also the sources and inheritance of resistance to PSbMV in pea germplasm collections. a récente augmentation des surfaces réservées à la production de Pois protéagineux et la fréquente contamination des collections de gènes par un virus transmissible par les graines, le Pea seed-borne mosaic virus ont conduit à compiler l’ensemble de l’information disponible à ce jour sur ce virus, d’autant que la difficulté à voir les symptômes et l’efficacité avec laquelle les pucerons transmettent le Pea seed-borne mosaic virus sont deux facteurs très favorables à sa dissémination.

40|$|International audienceAmong a set {{of objects}} accidentally {{discovered}} in 2003 at Chalonnes- sur-Loire (Maine-et-Loire, France), a Middle Bronze Age hoard has been identified. The other objects, including a triangular side scraper, are dated from the Late Bronze Age and will be studied later. These eleven Middle Bronze Age objects (called "the Belvédère set" in this paper) are two frag- ments of chisels, a fragment of the handle of another flanged tool, a fragment of the handle of a flanged axe belonging to an eastern type (Porcieu-Amblagneu or Langquaid or some variants), two fluted flanged axes with a rare lateral pattern, two simple undecorated bracelets, and three pieces of bracelets of the Drône type. They were all well prepared after casting. Some of them were strongly used and then thrown away. The fluted flanged axes are nearly new and could still be useful. In total they represent a stock of 1 kg of metal. The objets belong to two functional categories, tools and jewellery. The chronological analysis allows us to date them to the Bronze B 2; they belong to both the Atlantic and Eastern cultural spheres. This association is quite frequent in the Atlantic sphere, but the Chalonnes-sur-Loire set differs from several points of view: these objects show evidence of cultural links between the lower Loire valley and both the Channel and the North Alpine arc and {{they are much more}} fragmented than other hoards associating jewellery and tools. Another set of objects discovered at the same place in 1901 (called "the Pierre-Cou set") pre- sents several chronological and cultural similarities with the Belvédère set. It consist of three axes including one fluted flanged axe, eighteen bracelets including two of the Drône type, amber beads and a spearhead. Both sets of objects, Belvédère and Pierre-Cou, constitute a conventional so-called mixed hoard, a type of hoard identified in the 1950 s by Wolfgang Kimmig. We can thus propose that the Belvédère set is only part of a big- ger hoard of the Middle Bronze Age mixed type. The Chalonnes-sur-Loire hoard would be then one of the most western Middle Bronze Age mixed hoards. This hoard (or hoards) was located in a particular place, {{from the point of view}} of the natural environment. The objects were discovered in the middle of an island formed by two branches of the Loire which forms a bend at this place. Tin and copper mineralisations are found in the close neighbourhood of the discoveries. These natural patterns, observed for several other Bronze Age hoards in Europe, seem to be significant social factors.

40|$|L'influence du facteur {{thermique}} sur la contamination de la carpe par le 60 Co a été étudiée pour 4 températures : 8 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C et 25 °C. Pour chaque expérience, <b>un</b> <b>lot</b> homogène de 10 individus, d'une masse initiale d'environ 2, 3 g et nourris ad libitum, est introduit dans 5 litres d'eau, renouvelée tous les 3 à 4 jours et contaminée à raison de 1, 2. 105 Bq. l- 1. Entre deux renouvellements, la concentration du 60 Co dans l'eau décroît sensiblement et l'état ionique du radionucléide, introduit à 100 % sous forme cationique, évolue vers des formes anioniques et neutres. Ces deux faits sont liés au métabolisme des poissons dont {{la croissance}} pondérale est corrélée à la température, la distribution de la nourriture étant adaptée aux besoins des individus. Globalement, la quantité totale de radiocobalt fixée par les carpes apparaît très fortement liée au facteur thermique mais, selon le niveau des températures, des situations différentes se dégagent pour des mêmes écarts. Il n'y a pas proportionnalité comptéte entre élévation de température et accumulation du 60 Co mais une augmentation discontinue témoignant de l'existence de paliers, dont le plus important se situe à 20 °C. Le facteur de concentration du 60 Co est, par contre, peu influencé par le facteur thermique pour les écarts inférieurs à 10 °C ou quand la température maximale est inférieure à 20 °C. L'incidence de la température devient sensible quand les écarts dépassent 10 °C et notamment lorsque sont atteintes des valeurs correspondant à l'optimum thermique des carpes. A l'équilibre, le facteur de concentration moyen du 60 Co est de 3, 6 à 8 °C, 4, 4 à 15 °C, 5, 1 à 20 °C et 6 à 25 °C. The problems of simultaneous thermal and radionuclide pollutions {{have led to}} a number of laboratory and field studies of the temperature effects on the radioactive contamination of aquatic organisms. AMIARD and KHALANSKI (1981) concluded from their bibliographic study that a temperature rise generally has a positive effect on biological accumulation of radionuclides in freshwater organisms. Due to insufficient data, however, this conclusion {{does not appear to be}} substantiated for 60 Co uptake by fish. An experimental study was therefore undertaken to assess the effect of temperature on 60 Co uptake by Caprinus carpio. The importance of 60 Co results from the fact that, apart from tritium, radioactive cobalt isotopes represent the major components of liquid wastes discharged from pressurized water reactors, which are widely operated in France (BARDIN et al., 1982; PICAT et al., 1986). The common carp (Caprinus carpio L.) was selected as the subject of this experimentation because of its wide geographic distribution and the frequency with which it is found in field samples, making it a suitable biological indicator (D'AUBENTON and SPILLMANN, 1978; FOULQUIER and PALLY, 1982; FOULQUIER et al., 1985). The effect of temperature on 60 Co contamination of the carp was investigated by conducting the same experiment at four temperatures (8 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C and 25 °C) determined by ecological and physiological criteria. In each experiment, young carps with a mean weight of 2. 3 g were placed in a tank containing 5 liters of water contaminated with 1. 2 x 105 Bq. l- 1 of 60 Co. The water was renewed at intervals of 3 - 4 days. Modifications in the ionic form of the radio-active cobalt dissolved in the water were monitored by percolating filtered water samples through ion exchange resin columns. The carps were fed to satiation with an industrial food containing 12 % minerals, 8 % fats and 58 % proteins (dry weight) together with vitamins and trace elements including 0. 2 mg. kg- 1 of cobalt. Radioactivity levels in the fish were measured, after mild anesthesia, with a single-channel amplitude selector equipped with a thallium-activated flat sodium iodine probe. Between successive water renewals, the 60 Co concentration diminished (Table 1) and the ionic form of the radionuclide remaining in solution was significantly modified. The 60 Co was introduced in chloride form and was initially found exclusively as a cation; anionic or neutral forms appeared and became dominant after a few days (Figure 1). These two phenomena are probably related to the fish metabolism which is temperature dependent. Thus, food was distributed according to the individual requirements, and an exponential correlation was observed between the temperature and the weight gain in the carps (Table 1). The appearance of anionic and neutral forms may be attributed to excessive amounts of organic matter due to the presence of the fish and food (FUKAI and MURRAY, 1973; KILLEY et al., 1984). This evolution also results from a significant increase in ions such as HCO 3 -, Cl-, SO 4 [...] , PO 4 [...] and NH 4 + (FRITSCH and BAUDIN, 1984) which may combine with Co++ ions to form neutral molecules and anionic complexes (TRISHAN et al., 1981). Radioactive decay in the mater is also temperature-dependent : the amount of fecal matter, which strongly adsorbs radioactive cobalt, is proportional to the metabolic intensity in the fish. The overall 60 Co uptake by the carps (Table 2) appears to be strongly related to the temperature, but the effect of a given temperature rise varied with the initial temperature (Table 4). The 60 Co uptake was not fully proportional to the temperature rise, but was observed to increase in stepwise fashion indicating the existence of various thresholds. The most significant of these was noted at 20 °C, which is the lower limit of the optimum temperature range for carps. The 60 Co concentration in th fish (Table 3) was influenced to a much lower extent by the temperature than the total uptake. Small temperature variations (5 - 7 °C) had little or no effect on the concentration factor; this was also true for larger variations, from 8 °C to 20 °C (Table 4). Temperature effects were only significant between 8 °C and 25 °C, and between 15 °C and 25 °C. The 60 Co concentration variation in time was similar for all four temperatures, with two successive phases (Figure 2). It can be expressed mathematically by an exponential model based on the existence of several compartments in living organisms characterized by the influx and efflux rates for the element under consideration (GOLSTEIN and ELWOOD, 1971; AOYAMA and INOUE, 1973; PENTREATH, 1975; GONTIER, 1983). The maximum value and the time required to reach equilibrium were determined by extrapolation from the equations for the concentration factor variations. The results were 3. 6 and 510 days at 8 °C, 4. 4 and 220 days at 15 °C, 5. 1 and 125 days at 20 °C, and 6 and 110 days at 25 °C. These values indicate that a temperature rise diminishes the time required to reach equilibrium and slightly increases the concentration factor by an amount that is statistically significant only for major temperature differences (Table 4). Detailed investigations of various freshwater species, notably Caprinus carpio, have demonstrated the decisive effect of temperature on metabolic activity in these animals (LEVESQUE, 1980). The results presented here indicate that the 60 Co uptake rate in the carp is not proportional to the temperature rise as is generally the case for physiological processes. From a radiation protection standpoint, this observation suggests that the temperature is not an essential factor in 60 Co contamination of freshwater fish...|$|E
40|$|In 1953 　Kim So Un (1908 - 1981) {{published}} "The Man Who Has Planted Welsh Onions" in Japan {{which included}} thirty-four Korean folk lores. The {{title of this}} book was named {{after one of the}} thirty-four folk lores. Here is the story: Once upon a time because the people could not distinguish human beings from cows, people fought each other and killed their fellow countrymen to eat them. In grief over this situation in his homeland, one gentleman went on a pilgrimage to seek for non-belligerent country. Finally he reached the country of peace. Over there one old man told him that ever since the people started eating Welsh onions, people could become to tell human beings from the cows. He, therefore, brought back the Welsh onion seeds to his homeland and planted them. He, however, was mistaken for a cow and was eaten by his fellow countryman. The Welsh onions have grown up thereafter and have eaten by the people. The country has become peaceful, however the countrymen did not thank the gentleman at all and forgot him. Since the author has wondered why Kim So Un named his book of folk lores after such a short story, he has looked into Kim's life. Kim So Un was born in colonial Korea ruled by Japan in 1908. He came to Japan when he was 12 years old. In his encounterance with discrimination and prejudice against the Koreans in Japan, he noticed the ignorance of Korean culture in the background of Japanese discrimination against the Koreans. He, therefore, started translating the Korean folk songs into Japanese to introduce Korean culture to Japan, because folk songs imply the Korean people's heart of poem. Thanks to the support from many Japanese intellectuals including Hakushu Kitahara and Toson Shimazaki, Kim So Un published series of collections of Korean folk songs, nursery rhymes and poems. He consequently became an outstanding poet in Japan. In 1945 after Korea won its independence, Kim So Un remained to stay in South Korea, where the Government has taken a policy to deny and exclude all of the Japanese culture. Despite such a national policy, Kim So Un insisted the importance to recognize "goodness" and "beauty" of each country and to respect each other's culture in order to reconciliate the Japanese and the Korean. He also commented the excellence of Japanese culture. He was therefore labeled as "pro-Japanophile" and was deported from Korea. This book of Korean folk lores was published during his deportation. The author's presumption why Kim So Un has deliverately selected this story is that Kim So Un might have seen himself in "The Man Who Has Planted the Welsh Onions". Because people did not understand Kim So Un's effort to try to establish mutual understanding and reliance through cultural exchanges between the Japanese and the Korean, who have hatred each other. Kim So <b>Un</b> had a <b>lot</b> to sympathize about this folk lore. The author believes it is Kim So Un himself "who has planted Welsh Onions". The Welsh onion means the spirit to respect other culture...|$|R
