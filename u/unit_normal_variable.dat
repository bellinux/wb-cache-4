40|$|Recalculation, and extension, of {{original}} tables for fitting /Sy curves (Johnson, 1965) {{brought to light}} errors in original values of the location parameter — y. Corrections for these values are presented. Some key words: Frequency curves; Tables; Transformations. Recently, tables (Johnson, 1965) giving values of — y and S> 0 such that the variable Y = sinh{(Z-with Z a <b>unit</b> <b>normal</b> <b>variable,</b> has specified moment-ratios ^jf!x and /? 2, have been recalculated and extended. Values are now available to seven decimal places for ^Jfix = 0 - 05 (0 - 05) 3 - 00, with /?a starting from the lowest possible exact 0 - 05 value for each-Jfiu increasing by intervals of 0 - 05 for the first ten /? 2 values, and thereafter by 0 - 1 for fifty further values. The program for this calculation was written by Mr J. O. Kitchen, whose valuable assistance it is a pleasure to recognize. The new values of S agreed {{with those in the}} earlier paper, apart from an occasional discrepancy of 1 in the last place of decimals shown. Unfortunately, {{there were a number of}} discrepancies in the values of — y. I t is hoped that a corrected table will appear in a revised reprinting of Volume 2 of the Biometrika Tables for Statisticians. The following notes are intended in the meantime to correct errors in the original values of — y. (i) There are a few isolated corrections, as set out below...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating {{the ratio of the}} means of independent <b>normal</b> <b>variables</b> in agricultural research. The first part of the research examines the distributional properties of the ratio of independent <b>normal</b> <b>variables,</b> both theoretically and using simulation. The second part of the research evaluates the relative merits of two common estimators of the ratio of the means of independent <b>normal</b> <b>variables</b> in agricultural research, an arithmetic average and a weighted average, via simulation experiments using normal distributions. The results are then tested using research data from rice breeding multi-environment trials in Jilin Province, China, in 1994. These data are used to demonstrate the diagnostic approach developed for assessing the “safe ” use of the arithmetic and the weighted average methods for estimating the ratio of the means of independent <b>normal</b> <b>variables.</b> Copyright © 2006 C.

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the dot product is as follows. The only mass flowing through the {{cross-section}} is the amount normal to the area, i.e. parallel to the <b>unit</b> <b>normal.</b> This amount is: where θ is the angle between the <b>unit</b> <b>normal</b> [...] and the velocity of mass elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor , as θ increases less mass passes through. All mass which passes in tangential directions to the area, that is perpendicular to the <b>unit</b> <b>normal,</b> doesn't actually pass through the area, so the mass passing through the area is zero. This occurs when θ = π/2:These results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product. Sometimes these equations are used to define the mass flow rate.|$|R
