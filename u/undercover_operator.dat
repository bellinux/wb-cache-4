25|$|On August 6, 2010, various {{media outlets}} {{released}} {{a transcript of}} conversations between an RCMP <b>undercover</b> <b>operator</b> and Pickton in his holding cell. While the RCMP censored the undercover officer's name {{throughout most of the}} document, his name was left uncensored in several portions of the document that the RCMP released to the public. This uncensored version was available to the public, through Global News, CTV News, and the Vancouver Sun, for about an hour before being pulled and re-edited. It is not known the extent of the damage this mistake caused the undercover officer.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} his bad health Holst worked hard and took on several {{dangerous}} assignments, among them meetings with people who were suspected {{of working with the}} German security services. Holst also organised squads for liquidating dangerous German and collaborationist Norwegian agents. Holst was a skilled <b>undercover</b> <b>operator,</b> fully aware of the risks of being captured, and always carried a gun and a poison pill with him so that if he was caught, he could commit suicide and not reveal information about the organisation.|$|E

50|$|This unit {{performs}} as {{a high-level}} national SWAT {{team and the}} unit's men also undertake <b>undercover</b> missions. UTK <b>operators</b> are specially trained to intervene in high-risk events like hostage and barricade situations by hostile forces, especially terrorists and/or criminals. UTK is the Malaysian most experience unit in dealing with counter-terrorism in urban areas.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Vernon Coleman {{writes that}} [...] "Just before Christmas 1989 two <b>undercover</b> <b>operators</b> finally persuaded Feldberg {{to allow them}} to take video and still {{photographs}} of him at work. Flattered by the attention he was getting (one of the investigators, Melody MacDonald, was a former fashion model (she published her investigation in the above mentioned book)) Feldberg agreed." [...] Vernon goes on to state that [...] "As a result of film which the investigators took just after Feldberg's eightyninth birthday, the Medical Research Council held an inquiry. The published report of the inquiry shows that according to the Medical Research Council Feldberg failed to ensure that four of the rabbits he used were sufficiently anaesthetized during experiments performed at the National Institute for Medical Research, in Mill Hill, London. The Medical Research Council's report describes the benefit likely to accrue from Feldberg's work as 'negligible' and admitted that 'applied to the methodology the word [...] "crude" [...] is not inappropriate'. They conclude that 'a number of animals perished for no discernible beneficial reason' and criticized the British Home Secretary for the fact that he 'failed to weigh adequately the likely benefit of the research against the likely adverse effects on the animals involved'. In some ways Feldberg was probably unlucky. I very much doubt if he was the only scientist in Britain who was failing to anaesthetize laboratory animals properly. He certainly wasn't the only scientist doing research work of negligible value. It's quite clear from this case history that it is a lie to say that animals which are experimented on are invariably and adequately anaesthetized. The truth is that most animals have no anaesthetic at all; and even when an anaesthetic is used the chances are high that it will be inadequate." ...|$|R
40|$|For {{approximately}} {{the last fifteen}} years, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been mounting highly sophisticated undercover sting operations in Canada known colloquially as Mr. Big stings. These undercover operations involve multiple officers posing {{as members of a}} ruthless, powerful and wealthy criminal organization in order to trick suspects into making confessions to serious crimes, nearly always homicides. The undercover officers essentially orchestrate a chance meeting with the suspect, known operationally as the “target”, and exert their considerable influence and resources to convince him that he is being inducted into a criminal gang. The target is typically a person suspected of having committed a murder in the past, but who has never been charged due to lack of evidence. Over a period of months or weeks the undercover officers attempt to build a relationship with the target based on fear, greed, companionship, or a combination of those or other emotions. The target is given tasks to perform which appear criminal in nature, but which are actually staged crimes in which every participant is an undercover officer. The target is eventually told he must meet with the boss of the gang, the “Mr. Big” after whom the sting is named, in order for a final decision to be made on whether or not the target can join the gang. The target is told that he must confess to the previous murder of which he is suspected in order to join the gang. Sometimes the target confesses readily, other times he protests his innocence, but Mr. Big will not accept exculpatory statements. Often further inducements are offered by Mr. Big, most notably a promise to derail the investigation by using his influence over corrupt justice system participants. If the suspect admits culpability he will be charged with the crime and nearly always convicted at trial. Canadian courts have exercised virtually no control over police tactics in these cases. Defence counsel have argued against the use of the evidence {{on the basis of a}} breach of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms with regard to the right to silence and also with regard to abuse of process. These arguments have been unsuccessful. Defence counsel have also argued unsuccessfully that the statements should be inadmissible under Canadian hearsay law. It has also been argued, equally unsuccessfully, that the <b>undercover</b> <b>operators</b> should be treated as persons-in-authority, and hence that the statements elicited from the targets should have to be proven voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. Canadian judges have also been unwilling to allow the defence to lead expert evidence in these cases to tell the trier of fact about the possibility of false confessions. The ultimate result is that there is no control over police tactics in these stings. There has been one proven wrongful conviction as a result of these stings, that of Kyle Wayne Unger. Other wrongful convictions may come to light. Short of its outright abolition, probably the best way to control the sting and prevent wrongful convictions is to subject the statements to a formal voluntariness inquiry...|$|R
50|$|NDS Inc. Chief of Security John Norris pursued Mullen for {{a decade}} in three {{different}} countries. When Mullen originally fled the United States to Canada in the mid-1990s, Norris launched an investigation that saw an <b>undercover</b> <b>operator</b> (a former Canadian police officer named Don Best) become one of Mullen's sub-dealers and his closest personal friend for over a year. In summer of 2003 when Mullen travelled under another identity to visit his operations in Florida, US federal authorities were waiting {{for him at the}} airport after being tipped off by Canadian investigators working for NDS Inc.|$|E
50|$|McNab {{worked on}} both covert and overt {{operations}} including counter terrorism and drug {{operations in the}} Middle East and Far East, South and Central America and Northern Ireland. McNab trained as a specialist in counter terrorism, prime target elimination, demolitions, weapons, tactics, covert surveillance roles and information gathering in hostile environments, and VIP protection. He worked on cooperative operations with police forces, prison services, anti-drug forces and Western backed guerrilla movements {{as well as on}} conventional special operations. In Northern Ireland, he spent two years working as an <b>undercover</b> <b>operator</b> with 14 Intelligence Company, going on to become an instructor.|$|E
40|$|Looking back: the {{evidence}} {{had been there}} all along, all over the place. The telltales had gone undetected, overlooked. I hadn 2 ̆ 7 t recognized them as parts of the picture. The plot had been so unexpected. I hadn 2 ̆ 7 t been ready for it. Most of those minor incidents had been clues. Once I got wise, I could spot {{it over and over}} again, all over the place, the same 2 ̆ 2 M. O. 2 ̆ 2 applied to every stage of my game. By then it was too late. Its effects were in full control. Even my own mode of operation had felt its muscle. Pulled off by a single <b>undercover</b> <b>operator,</b> it had been an inside job. My whole outfit had been framed systematically, top to bottom, right under my nose. Laying low until the end, the culprit had not shown its hand until the last minute. Coming out on top, unexpectedly, the secret agent had been a classic Sleeper...|$|E
