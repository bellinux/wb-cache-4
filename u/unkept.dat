25|$|After the {{flooding}} of Hurricane Diane, the former wetlands became {{the ownership of}} Walter Beekman from Beekman and Beekman Inc. He kept ownership of the land for only nineteen years before selling the land {{to the town of}} Amenia in 1974 for one dollar. The land remained <b>unkept</b> at that point, until the 1980s, when groups of volunteers (funded by the town) started installing ball fields and park like scenery. In 1983, Beekman Park was open for business as the new local park. In 1985, the local baseball fields started hosting their own games for locals team on the local Don Herring Field. Some of the former lake remains, including a portion of the former dam in the southwestern corner of the park, and Amenia Island Cemetery still stands along New York State Route 343 towards Sharon, Connecticut, but on stable ground. On May 14, 2009, the town of Amenia secured $3,829 (2009 USD) from their recreation fund to help make improvements to Beekman Park, and on June 11, 2009, the money distribution was approved.|$|E
500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of [...] "powersliding" [...] on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and <b>unkept</b> locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien was {{repeatedly}} attacked by both his opponents and supporters {{for failing to}} live up to key election promises, such as eliminating the so-called [...] "golden handshake" [...] by which politicians receive a substantial life-time pension after serving a mere five years in elected office. Other <b>unkept</b> election promises included replacing the GST and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). [...] Some point to the [...] "No" [...] result of the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty as a political victory for Chrétien, while others interpret the extremely slim margin as a near-disaster for which Chrétien, as de facto leader of the [...] "No" [...] campaign, was responsible. However, some argue that his post-referendum efforts at addressing the sovereignty issue, notably through the Clarity Act, will cement his legacy as a staunchly federalist prime minister.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} alteration in {{the wording}} of the Kol Nidre was made by Rashi's son-in-law, Rabbi Meir ben Samuel (early 12th century), who changed the original phrase [...] "from the last Day of Atonement until this one" [...] to [...] "from this Day of Atonement until the next". Thus the dispensation was not a posteriori, and concerned with unfulfilled obligations of the past year, but a priori and having reference to vows one {{might not be able to}} fulfill or might forget to observe during the ensuing year. Meir ben Samuel likewise added the words [...] "we do repent of them all", since real repentance is a condition of dispensation. The reasons assigned for this change were that an [...] "ex post facto" [...] annulment of a vow was meaningless, and that, furthermore, no one might grant to himself a dispensation, which might be given only by a board of three laymen or by a competent judge. Additionally, the Talmudic discussion of annulment of vows spoke of negating vows to be made in the future. Additionally, there was the distinct probability that a person would die with unfulfilled vows having been made since the previous Day of Atonement, so annulling these vows in advance might diminish the weight such <b>unkept</b> vows imposed on him at his death.|$|E

6000|$|There is some {{difference}} of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that difference {{is not a very}} material one.

60|$|At noon the {{following}} day, the weather still being bright and genial, I went to Crux Easton, a hilltop village consisting of some low farm buildings, cottages, and a church not {{much bigger than}} a cottage. A great house probably once existed here, as the hill has a noble avenue of limes, which it wears like a comb or crest. On the lower slope of the hill, the old <b>unkept</b> hedges were richer in colour than in most places, owing to the abundance of the spindle-wood tree, laden with its loose clusters of flame-bright, purple-pink and orange berries.|$|E
60|$|One day {{he saw a}} {{sparrowhawk}} dash {{down upon}} a running partridge and struggle with it on the ground. It was in a grass field, divided from the one he was walking in by a large, <b>unkept</b> hedge without a gap in it to let him through. Presently the hawk rose up with the partridge still violently struggling in its talons, and flew over the hedge to Caleb's side, but was no sooner over than it came down again and the struggle went on once more on the ground. On Caleb running to the spot the hawk flew off, leaving his prey behind. He had grasped it in its sides, driving his sharp claws well in, and the partridge, though unable to fly, was still alive. The shepherd killed {{it and put it}} in his pocket, and enjoyed it very much when he came to eat it.|$|E
60|$|I {{remembered how}} I searched among deep lanes, beyond {{rows and rows}} of ancient hedgerow elms, and how I found its little church and {{thatched}} cottages at last, covered with ivy and roses and creepers, all in a white and pink cloud of apple blossoms. Searching for it had been great fun and finding it a delightful experience; why not have the pleasure once more now that it was May again and the apple orchards in blossom? No sooner had I asked myself the question than I was on my bicycle among those same deep lanes, with the <b>unkept</b> hedges and the great hedgerow elms shutting out a view of the country, searching once more for the village of Clyst Hyden. And as on the former occasion, years ago it seemed, I would not enquire my way of anyone. I had found it then for myself and was determined to do so again, although I had set out with the vaguest idea as to the right direction.|$|E
60|$|The trees, I have said, are few, {{though the}} churchyard is shady, {{where you can}} refresh {{yourself}} beneath its ancient beeches and its one wide-branching yew, or sit on a tomb in the sun when you wish for warmth and brightness. The trees growing by or near the street are mostly ash or beech, with a pine or two, old but not large; and there are small or dwarf yew-, holly-, and thorn-trees. Very little fruit is grown; two or three to half a dozen apple- and damson-trees are called an orchard, and one is sorry for the children. But in late summer and autumn they get their fruit from the hedges. These run up towards the downs {{on either side of}} the village, at right angles with its street; long, <b>unkept</b> hedges, beautiful with scarlet haws and traveller's-joy, rich in bramble and elder berries and purple sloes and nuts--a thousand times more nuts than the little dormice require for their own modest wants.|$|E
60|$|It {{was partly}} in this {{position}} that the fascination lay. Withdrawn from its fellows, with its back to the land, it faced {{the glory of the}} western sky, as if in virginal vision gazing out upon the deep. Doubly withdrawn is it, for that the coast from which it stands apart is itself almost unvisited by Europeans,--an out-of-the-world state, in marked contrast to the shore bordering the Pacific, which is now a curbstone on the great waterway round the earth, and incidentally makes a happy parenthesis of promenade for the hasty globe-trotter. The form, too, of the peninsula came in for a share in its attraction. Its coast line was so coquettishly irregular. If it turned its back on the land, it stretched its hands out to the sea, only to withdraw them again the next moment,--a double invitation. Indeed, there is no happier linking of land to water. The navigator in such parts becomes himself a delightfully amphibious creature, at home in both elements. Should he tire of the one, he can always take to the other. Besides, such features in a coast suggest a certain clean-cut character of profile,--a promise, in Japan at least, rarely <b>unkept.</b>|$|E
60|$|We {{know that}} there cannot be {{progression}} without retrogression, or gain with no corresponding loss; and often on my wheel, when flying along the roads at a reckless rate of very nearly nine miles an hour, I have regretted that time of limitations, galling to me then, when I was compelled to go on foot. I am a walker still, but with other means of getting about I do not feel so native to the earth as formerly. That is a loss. Yet a poorer walker {{it would have been}} hard to find, and on even my most prolonged wanderings the end of each day usually brought extreme fatigue. This, too, although my only companion was slow--slower than the poor proverbial snail or tortoise--and I would leave her half a mile or so behind to force my way through <b>unkept</b> hedges, climb hills, and explore woods and thickets to converse with every bird and shy little beast and scaly creature I could discover. But mark what follows. In the late afternoon I would be back in the road or footpath, satisfied to go slow, then slower still, until--the snail in woman shape would be obliged to slacken her pace to keep me company, and even to stand still at intervals to give me needful rest.|$|E
60|$|The past {{centuries of}} people, {{living in a}} certain way, with certain standards, {{influenced}} by certain emotions, were too strong for him. James was like a foolish bird--a bird born in a cage, without power to attain its freedom. His lust for a free life was futile; he acknowledged with cruel self-contempt that he was weaker than a woman--ineffectual. He could not lead the life of his little circle, purposeless and untrue; and yet he had not power to lead a life of his own. Uncertain, vacillating, torn between {{the old and the}} new, his reason led him; his conscience drew him back. But the ties of his birth and ancestry were too strong; he had not the energy even of the poor tramp, who carries with him his whole fortune, and leaves in the lap of the gods the uncertain future. James envied with all his heart the beggar boy, wandering homeless and penniless, but free. He, at least, had not these inhuman fetters which it was death to suffer and death to cast off; he, indeed, could make the world his servant. Freedom, freedom! If one were only unconscious of captivity, what would it matter? It is the knowledge that kills. And James walked again by the neat, iron railing which enclosed the fields, his head aching with the rigidity and decorum, wishing vainly for just one piece of barren, <b>unkept</b> land to remind him that all the world was not a prison.|$|E
6000|$|But though cannibals, {{it is very}} {{pleasant}} to find that many cowmen love their cows. Walking one afternoon by a high <b>unkept</b> hedge near Southampton Water, I heard loud shouts at intervals issuing from a point some distance ahead, and on arriving at the spot found an old man leaning idly over a gate, apparently concerned about nothing. [...] "What are you shouting about?" [...] I demanded. [...] "Cows," [...] he answered, with a glance across the wide green field dotted with a few big furze and bramble bushes. On its far side half a dozen cows were, quietly grazing. [...] "They came fast enough when I was a-feeding of 'em," [...] he presently added; [...] "but now they has to find for theirselves they don't care how long they keeps me." [...] I was going {{to suggest that it}} would be a considerable saving of time if he went for them, but his air of lazy contentment as he leant on the gate showed that time was of no importance to him. He was a curious-looking old man, in old frayed clothes, broken boots, and a cap too small for him. He had short legs, broad chest, and long arms, and a very big head, long and horselike, with a large shapeless nose and grizzled beard and moustache. His ears, too, were enormous, and stood out from the head like the handles of a rudely shaped terra-cotta vase or jar. The colour of his face, the ears included, suggested burnt clay. But though Nature had made him ugly, he had an agreeable expression, a sweet benign look in his large dark eyes, which attracted me, and I stayed to talk with him.|$|E
6000|$|A sunny {{morning in}} June--a golden day among days that have mostly a neutral tint; a large garden, with no visible houses beyond, but green fields and <b>unkept</b> hedges and great silent trees, oak and ash and elm--could I wish, just now, {{for a more}} congenial resting-place, or even imagine one that comes nearer to my {{conception}} of an earthly paradise? It is true that once I could not drink deeply enough from the sweet and bitter cup of wild nature, and loved nature best, and sought it gladly where it was most savage and solitary. But that was long ago. Now, after years of London life, during which I have laboured like many another [...] "to get a wan pale face," [...] with perhaps a wan pale mind to match, that past wildness would prove too potent and sharp a tonic; unadulterated nature would startle and oppress me with its rude desolate aspect, no longer familiar. This softness of a well-cultivated earth, and unbroken verdure of foliage in many shades, and harmonious grouping and blending of floral hues, best suit my present enervated condition. I had, I imagine, a swarter skin and firmer flesh when I could ride all day over great summer-parched plains, where {{there was not a}} bush that would have afforded shelter to a mannikin, and think that I was having a pleasant journey. The cloudless sky and vertical sun--how intolerable they would now seem, and scorch my brain and fill my shut eyes with dancing flames! At present even this mild June sun is strong enough to make the old mulberry tree on the lawn appear grateful. It is an ancient, rough-barked tree, with wide branches, that droop downwards all round, and rest their terminal leaves on the sward; underneath it is a natural tent, or pavilion, with plenty of space to move about and sling a hammock in. Here, then, I have elected to spend the hottest hours of my one golden day, reading, dreaming, listening at intervals to the fine bird-sounds that have a medicinal and restorative effect on the jarred and wounded sense.|$|E
60|$|The {{spot where}} I {{observed}} this wee feathered fantasy, the tantalizing sprite of the rushes, and where I soon ceased to see, hear, or think about him, {{calls for a}} fuller description. On one side the wooded hill sloped downward to the stream; {{on the other side}} spread the meadows where the rooks came every day to feed, or to sit and stand about motionless, looking like birds cut out of jet, scattered over about half an acre of the grassy, level ground. Stout old pollard willows grew here and there along the banks and were pleasant to see, this being the one man-mutilated thing in nature which, to my mind, not infrequently gains in beauty by the mutilation, so admirably does it fit into and harmonize with the landscape. At one point there was a deep, nearly stagnant pool, separated from the stream by a strip of wet, rushy ground, its still dark surface covered with water-lilies, not yet in bloom. They were just beginning to show their polished buds, shaped like snake's heads, above the broad, oily leaves floating like islands on the surface. The stream itself was, on my side, fringed with bulrushes and other aquatic plants; on the opposite bank there were some large alders lifting their branches above great masses of bramble and rose-briar, all together forming as rich and beautiful a tangle as one could find even in the most luxuriant of the wild, <b>unkept</b> hedges round the village. The briars especially flourished wonderfully at this spot, climbing high and dropping their long, slim branches quite down {{to the surface of the}} water, and in some places forming an arch above the stream. A short distance from this tangle, so abundantly sprinkled with its pale delicate roses, the water was spanned by a small wooden bridge, which no person appeared to use, but which had a use. It formed the one dry clear spot in the midst of all that moist vegetation, and the birds that came from the wood to drink and search for worms and small caterpillars first alighted on the bridge. There they would rest a few moments, take a look round, then fly to some favourite spot where succulent morsels had been picked up on previous visits. Thrushes, blackbirds, sparrows, reed-buntings, chaffinches, tits, wrens, with many other species, succeeded each other all day long; for now they mostly had young to provide for, and it was their busiest time.|$|E

5000|$|Making {{promises}} {{which are}} not kept is a category of political structural abuse. <b>Unkept</b> promises fixate the expectations that people create from such promises. Expectations that create physical arousal states and a physical, emotional, intellectual and behavioural mindset by which to accommodate the fulfillment of those promises.
