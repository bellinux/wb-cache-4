5|$|For the show, Minogue {{collaborated with}} {{creative}} director William Baker and art director Alan MacDonald. Baker and MacDonald had previously {{worked with the}} singer on her KylieFever2002 tour. The musical arrangements were handled by Steve Anderson, while the dance routines were choreographed by Michael Rooney. Display hardware manufacturer Barco was hired to provide 100 square metres large LED displays, which were set <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> behind Minogue. They were used to show animations and high resolution graphics. Minogue wore five different costumes during the 75-minute-long show. Fashion houses like Balenciaga, Chanel, and Helmut Lang designed these costumes. Minogue was backed by 12 dancers and a full-piece band. The seating capacity of the show was restricted to 4000 spectators and the entire staging of the show cost £1 million.|$|E
25|$|Noble {{likes to}} have {{spontaneous}} material related to each specific show, and therefore encourages heckling and has increasingly indulged in the audience giving him gifts during shows. At a gig at the Edinburgh Playhouse during Noble's 2005 Randomist tour, {{a member of the}} audience put his feet <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> and later removed his shoes {{and put them on the}} stage instead. It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.|$|E
500|$|One well-received {{number was}} [...] "Keep It Gay", a song which in {{rehearsal}} {{had been assigned}} to several different performers before ending with Bob. The song was liked in part due to the novelty of its setting: it begins with Bob singing from the light bridge high above the stage; following a blackout the internal play performers take it <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> below, and following another blackout, the performers are seen in their workout clothes, at a rehearsal some weeks later. Hammerstein gave credit for the scene to Mielziner, and suggested that it demonstrated one way in which the book had affected the music.|$|E

500|$|Madonna first {{performed}} the song on her 1987 [...] "Who's That Girl World Tour". She came <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> {{wearing a blue}} dress to sing the song after finishing a performance of [...] "Lucky Star". In a similar setting to the original music video of the song, Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At {{the end of the}} song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. Her dance in the performance (and also some other performances in the tour) was choreographed by Jeffrey Hornaday from Flashdance. Two different performances of the song on the tour were included on two live video releases: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{continued with}} a welcoming video that featured famous chess players {{from around the}} world addressing the participants. Then, there was a performance focusing of the connection between people and chess players, which included a waltz choreography as the centrepiece of the show. It was followed by a graphical show at the elevated chessboard that combined folk and modern dance, and was supported by video art projected on the area around and behind the stage. The show featured traditional carpet patterns and designs, embracing a dance group replaying the game of chaturanga. The next part of the ceremony was the parade of nations with the presentation of flags. Each appearance of a new flag on the screen was accompanied by a percussionist who showed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> playing on nagara with the same flag as his drumhead. The percussionists left the stage under the sound of an adaption of the song [...] "We Are the World".|$|E
500|$|This was {{followed}} by the concert, beginning with [...] "Dress You Up". The performances of [...] "Angel", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Burning Up" [...] were removed from the track list of the video, as Kleinman believed that Madonna's performance was not her best in them. While shooting the tour on May 25, during the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin", a fan suddenly came <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and tried to get hold of Madonna, but was swiftly whisked away by security. Kleinman decided to keep the shot, as he felt that it illustrated the fanaticism which had grown around Madonna, and her popularity. The live performances of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Dress You Up" [...] were released as music video on MTV to promote the video album. Both videos were nominated for [...] "Best Choreography" [...] at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards. However, Madonna lost the award to Prince and The Revolution with their video [...] "Raspberry Beret." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going up slowly. She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on them like a star. For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> wearing a blue, silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom. The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around the stage while singing. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song. She dedicated the song to the Pope, marking her first conflict with the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{himself has}} said after seeing that Clapton hadn't appeared, but that his guitar {{had already been}} set <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> he {{approached}} John Mayall during the interval {{to ask if he}} could play with them. Taylor mentioned that he'd heard their albums and knew some of the songs, and after a moment of deliberation, Mayall agreed. Taylor amended, [...] "I wasn't thinking that this was a great opportunity... I just really wanted to get up on stage and play the guitar." ...|$|E

2500|$|Just as Harris {{appeared}} {{poised to}} join the first ranks of Broadway stars, she stopped appearing on stage after The Apple Tree, except for the off-Broadway first American production of Brecht and Weill's Mahagonny in 1970, in which she {{played the role of}} Jenny, originally created by Lotte Lenya. In the 2002 interview, Harris said, [...] "Who wants to be <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> all the time? It isn't easy. You have to be awfully invested in the fame aspect, and I really never was. What I cared about was the discipline of acting, whether I did well or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|In later interviews, Rekha often {{described}} {{the moment she}} received the Filmfare Award for this role as a turning point, explaining that only then did she start genuinely enjoying her work and seeing it as more than [...] "just a job": [...] "...when I went <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> and received my award for Khoon Bhari Maang... Boom, it hit me! That's the first time I realised the value of being an actor and how much this profession meant to me." [...] In 2011 she further stated, [...] "I felt even more charged to give my best and knew right then, that this was my calling, what I was born to do, {{to make a difference}} in people's lives, through my performances." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “About {{this time}} the whole Carlisle School made a visit to Philadelphia. [...] A meeting was held in a large hall, and Captain Pratt spoke {{of the work of}} the school, and how all the Indian boys and girls were doing. [...] Then John Wanamaker had me come <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> [...] He told the {{audience}} that I was working for him and that I was a Carlisle boy. [...] He stated that I had been promoted from one department to another, every month getting better work and better money, and {{in spite of the fact}} that he employed as many as one thousand people in his establishment, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as he had me. [...] That brought considerable applause, and Captain Pratt was very proud of me.|$|E
50|$|The second Ghostfest {{took place}} on Saturday 12 August and Sunday 13 August. It was once again held in <b>the</b> Cockpit, but <b>on</b> both stages.

2500|$|Minogue first {{performed}} the track on her Intimate and Live concert tour. A mash-up {{of both the}} remix and the original version, [...] "Too Far" [...] {{was used as the}} opening track along with several other tracks on the Impossible Princess album and featured Minogue rising <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> inside a rainbow-colored cone, similar to the artwork of the parent album, wearing black overalls. Like the rest off the costumes on the tour including the performance off [...] "Too Far", it features Minogue with a lot of [...] "princess"-inspired outfits that were created by her and her long-time friend and Fashion designer William Baker. The performance was recorded on 30 June and 1 July at Capitol Theatre in Sydney, and appeared on the related CD and DVD.|$|E
2500|$|His mixed {{feelings}} about the journey stemmed, in Bowie's words, from [...] "wanting to be <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> performing my songs, {{but on the other}} hand not really wanting to be on those buses with all those strange people... So Aladdin Sane was split down the middle." [...] This kind of [...] "schizophrenia", as Bowie described it, was conveyed on the cover by his makeup, where a lightning bolt represents the duality of mind, although he would later tell friends that the [...] "lad insane" [...] of the album's title track was inspired by his brother Terry, who had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Bowie himself came up with the idea of the lightning bolt over his face, but said the teardrop was Brian Duffy's idea: [...] "He [...] put on that afterward, just popped it in there. I thought it was rather sweet." [...] Regarded as one of the most iconic images of Bowie, Mick McCann writing for The Guardian called it [...] "The Mona Lisa of album covers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Going {{along with}} the tour's satirical theme of consumerism, U2 {{announced}} their tour on 12 February 1997 by holding {{a news conference at}} a Kmart discount store in New York City. [...] Hundreds of reporters from record companies, radio stations, television networks, newspapers, and magazines were in attendance at the conference, whose location was not revealed until the night before. Upon their arrival at the store, U2 got <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> assembled in the store's lingerie department, and performed [...] "Holy Joe", a B-side from the [...] "Discothèque" [...] single, which had been released nine days prior. [...] The entire event was broadcast live through various sources on television, radio, and the Internet. [...] Following the performance, the band answered questions for a half hour. [...] It was announced that the beginning of the PopMart Tour was to feature stadium shows in 62 cities throughout North America and Europe, beginning in Whitney, Nevada, on 25 April, and ending in Seattle, Washington, on 12 December. [...] They would tour an additional 12 cities in 1998 throughout Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America. [...] Tickets went on sale for the announced dates several days after the tour's announcement, and were priced at an average of $50 worldwide. [...] Due to the lack of sponsors for the tour, ticket prices were almost 50% higher for this tour than Zoo TV. [...] In markets where the average income was low, tickets were sold for a lower price, which was enough for the band to break even, but not lose any money in the process.|$|E
25|$|There were {{constant}} {{references to}} Ireland in {{the performances of}} some of the international acts with Scissor Sisters's Ana Matronic announcing the numerous counties of Ireland from where herself and her bandmates originated (including County Donegal, County Galway and County Cork), Bloc Party's Kele Okereke hoisting a tricolour <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Main <b>Stage,</b> promptly followed by Pete Doherty mimicking this act on Stage 2/NME and Mika donning a white T-shirt and green bottoms for the occasion (eventually completing the outfit with an orange beret thrown at him {{by a member of the}} audience).|$|R

60|$|It was {{necessary}} to be cautious, however, and to watch the result with ceaseless vigilance. Joyce and the men below had taken the alarm, and the serjeant with his companions were ordered <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> immediately, leaving the negro, alone, to watch the gate. A message was also sent to the females, to give them confidence, and particularly to direct the blacks to arm, and to repair to the loops.|$|E
5000|$|Reacting {{to the bad}} reviews, the show's composer, John Kander, {{commented that}} the show [...] "was the most {{complete}} realization" [...] of his intentions of any production he had done. Lyricist Fred Ebb agreed, asserting that [...] "Every single element of it was exactly as we imagined. <b>Up</b> there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> were two of my best friends, Liza and Chita. It was an overwhelming experience; and when they weren't treated well, {{it was as if}} we had gotten attacked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street.... That show hurt me more than any show I've written....

5000|$|Supporting tours for {{the album}} {{began with a}} series of shows at the P.N. Club in Munich, which had been the site for Supertramp's first public performances.

We used to get people <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bloody <b>stage</b> and it was just chaos, hopping away doing about three encores, but there was meat and potatoes behind it. No more or less people would come to the next gig." [...] This was the last album Roger Hodgson played bass on during his tenure with Supertramp.|$|R
