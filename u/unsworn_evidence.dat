5000|$|At the Glorious Revolution, he {{took his}} family to England {{to be out of}} harm's way, but he {{returned}} to Ireland in 1690 and was made second Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland); he later transferred to the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), then returned to the Exchequer. He regularly attended on the Irish House of Lords; he was knighted in 1692 and sat on a commission to assess the estates of those Jacobites who had fled to France. He was required to explain to the Lords why he had asked a bishop who had asked to give <b>unsworn</b> <b>evidence</b> in court to swear an oath (rather ironic given the number of bishops in his own family tree). He lobbied in 1706 to become Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, but was passed over, supposedly on the grounds of ill health, although he was well enough to go regularly on assize in Ulster.|$|E

40|$|What {{substantive}} criteria do Queensland judicial officers prefer for competence {{tests for}} non-accused child witnesses in criminal proceedings? Are competence tests for sworn and <b>unsworn</b> <b>evidence</b> distinguishable? This paper {{is the second}} reporting a suite of questions concerning competence, {{in a survey of}} Queensland judicial officers. This suite focussed on three general questions of interest: the referability of competence tests to the Queensland legislation; the substantive criteria of competence tests for sworn and unsworn evidence; and the formal framing of competence tests. Two question-types were included - judicial officers signalled, in closed-ended questions, the importance that listed criteria 'should' bear to competence tests, and, in open-ended questions, the questions they 'would' put in competence tests. Question-type seemingly affected some judicial responses. For sworn evidence, a child's understanding of an oath was assigned low importance in closed-ended questions (in two formulations), but high importance in open-ended questions. For <b>unsworn</b> <b>evidence,</b> a child's understanding of a promise was assigned extremely high importance in closed-ended questions (in two formulations), but low importance in open-ended questions. Consonant with law reform endeavours, both empirical and theoretical issues are traversed in this article. No Full Tex...|$|E
