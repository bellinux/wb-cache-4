[...] She did not agree at the time with the speculation of others that her professional rivals had their own self-interest at heart, knowing that with her out of the competition they would have a much better chance at the $5,000 first place prize award.

Not long afterward, she indicated to a reporter that she was [...] "thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time as {{exhibition}} venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the [...] "sophisticated" [...] arthouse picture. Director Abel Ferrara, who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller Killer (1979) and Ms. 45 (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: King of New York (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad Lieutenant (1992), , was financed totally independently. Larry Fessenden's micro-budget monster movies, such as No Telling (1991) and Habit (1997), reframe classic genre subjects—Frankenstein and vampirism, respectively—to explore issues of contemporary relevance. The budget of David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), , was not comfortably A-grade, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: [...] "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick", wrote critic Janet Maslin. Financed, like King of New York, by a consortium of production companies, it was picked <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> distribution by Fine Line Features. This result mirrored the film's scrambling of definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division. Pulp Fiction (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino on a [...] budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines, as James Mottram describes: [...] "With its art house narrative structure, B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Cronenberg, one of {{the leading}} B-movie auteurs of the , had stepped up in {{financial}} grade with Scanners (1980), a $3.5 million production that Time critic Richard Corliss associated with his earlier, low-budget films as well as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978) and John Carpenter's The Fog (1980) as [...] "hip parables of contemporary moral malaise." [...] Cronenberg's crowning achievement in that vein would come {{a decade and a half}} later: Like that of Scanners in 1980, the budget of Crash, $10 million, wasn't comfortably A-grade by 1996, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: [...] "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick," [...] is how Janet Maslin's New York Times review begins. The review ends with an explanation of the film's rating: [...] "Crash has the NC-17 rating (No one under 17 admitted) that it fully deserves. It includes frontal nudity, many sexual encounters and coolly grotesque situations linking sex and violence in graphic, sickening ways." [...] Financed, like King of New York, by a consortium of production companies, it was ultimately picked <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> distribution by Fine Line Features. In more ways than one, this result resonated perfectly with the way the film scrambled definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Psychos {{impact and}} the growing {{popularity}} of horror, major Hollywood studios largely continued to disdain the genre, at least for their own production lines. Along with the output of [...] "off-Hollywood" [...] U.S. concerns like Lewis and Friedman's, distributors brought in more foreign movies to fill the demands of rural drive-ins, lower-end urban theaters, and outright grindhouses. Hammer Films' success with The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and its remake of Dracula (1958) had established the studio as an important supplier of horror movies to the American B market, a positioned it maintained throughout the 1960s. In 1961, American International released a movie clearly influenced by Hammer's characteristically bold visual style and moody pace—Black Sunday was a dubbed horror import from Italy, where it had premiered the previous year as La maschera del demonio. It became the highest grossing film in AIP history. The movie's director was Mario Bava, who would launch the horror subgenre known as giallo with La ragazza che sapeva troppo (The Girl Who Knew Too Much; 1963) and Sei Donne per l’assassino (Blood and Black Lace; 1964). Many gialli, highly stylized films mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence, were picked <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> B-market distribution and would prove influential on American horror films in turn, especially of the slasher type. While in the past, the term B movie had been applied, both in the United States and abroad, almost exclusively to low- and modest-budget American films, the growing Italian exploitation film industry now also became associated with the label (usually styled in Italy as B-movie).|$|E
