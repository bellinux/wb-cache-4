2500|$|Twist-locking {{connectors}} {{were first}} invented by Harvey Hubbell III in 1938 and [...] "Twist-Lock" [...] remains a registered trademark of Hubbell Incorporated, although {{the term is}} used generically to refer to NEMA locking connectors manufactured by any company. Locking connectors use curved blades. Once pushed into the receptacle, the plug is twisted and its now-rotated blades latch into the receptacle. To <b>unlatch</b> the plug, the rotation is reversed. The locking coupling makes for a more reliable connection in commercial and industrial settings, where vibration or incidental impact could disconnect a non-locking connector.|$|E

60|$|There {{they are}} again, the pillars, the pediment, the Temple of Victory and the Erechtheum, {{set on a}} tawny rock cleft with shadows, {{directly}} you <b>unlatch</b> your shutters in the morning and, leaning out, hear the clatter, the clamour, the whip cracking in the street below. There they are.|$|E
60|$|And no wonder. She {{had remembered}} to attire herself becomingly for her {{moonlight}} tryst, but {{had forgotten the}} door key. We stood looking at one another aghast, as, from eternity, I suppose, have all fellow-conspirators in danger of discovery. It was I who first awoke to action. There was but {{one thing to be}} done, and, warning Fanny that I had never before attempted to <b>unlatch</b> the big front door of her mother's house, I set off resolutely down the hill.|$|E

There are nations that will not fling away the empire of earth in order to slight an unknown man and insult a noble woman whose boots they are not fitted to <b>unlatch.</b> There are nations not blinded to Science, not given over hand and foot to effete snobocracies and Degenerate Decadents. In short, mark my words--THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS!" ...|$|E

60|$|The train {{slows down}} for a station. I dangle my legs down in a {{tentative}} way. The train stops. My legs are still dangling. I hear the door <b>unlatch</b> softly. He is all ready for me. Suddenly I spring up and run forward over the roof. This is right over his head, where he lurks inside the door. The train is standing still; the night is quiet, and I take care to make plenty of noise on the metal roof with my feet. I don't know, but my assumption {{is that he is}} now running forward to catch me as I descend at the next platform. But I don't descend there. Halfway along the roof of the coach, I turn, retrace my way softly and quickly to the platform both the shack and I have just abandoned. The coast is clear. I descend to the ground on the off-side of the train and hide in the darkness. Not a soul has seen me.|$|E
60|$|Michael {{accepted}} his disappointment in not immediately meeting them, for from {{the dawn of}} consciousness, the limitations and restrictions of dogs in relation to humans had been hammered into him {{in the form of}} concepts of patience. The patience of waiting, when he wanted to go home and when Steward continued to sit at table and talk and drink beer, was his, as was the patience of the rope around the neck, the fence too high to scale, the narrowed-walled room with the closed door which he could never <b>unlatch</b> but which humans unlatched so easily. So that he permitted himself to be led away by the ship's butcher, who on the Umatilla had the charge of all dog passengers. Immured in a tiny between-decks cubby which was filled mostly with boxes and bales, tied as well by the rope around his neck, he waited from moment to moment for the door to open and admit, realised in the flesh, the resplendent vision of Steward which blazed through the totality of his consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Silently we <b>unlatch</b> the door, {{letting the}} drift fall in, and step abroad {{to face the}} cutting air. Already the stars have lost some of their sparkle, and a dull, leaden mist skirts the horizon. A lurid brazen light in the east proclaims the {{approach}} of day, while the western landscape is dim and spectral still, and clothed in a sombre Tartarian light, like the shadowy realms. They are Infernal sounds only that you hear,--the crowing of cocks, the barking of dogs, the chopping of wood, the lowing of kine, all seem to come from Pluto's barn-yard and beyond the Styx;--not for any melancholy they suggest, but their twilight bustle is too solemn and mysterious for earth. The recent tracks of the fox or otter, in the yard, remind us that each hour of the night is crowded with events, and the primeval nature is still working and making tracks in the snow. Opening the gate, we tread briskly along the lone country road, crunching the dry and crisped snow under our feet, or aroused by the sharp clear creak of the wood-sled, just starting for the distant market, from the early farmer's door, where it has lain the summer long, dreaming amid the chips and stubble; while far through the drifts and powdered windows we see the farmer's early candle, like a paled star, emitting a lonely beam, as if some severe virtue were at its matins there. And {{one by one the}} smokes begin to ascend from the chimneys amidst the trees and snows.|$|E

50|$|The {{left side}} latch on the SAFER unit became {{unlatched}} during an EVA by astronaut Piers Sellers on STS-121 while testing shuttle repair techniques. The latch had been inadvertently bumped {{and moved to}} the <b>unlatch</b> position. As a precaution, Mike Fossum tethered it to him and the spacewalk continued. In subsequent spacewalks, the latches were secured with Kapton tape, a space-rated form of adhesive tape, to prevent the latches from inadvertently opening. A hard cover is being designed for future missions.|$|E
50|$|Holmes {{actually}} went to Nash's {{three times that}} morning. The first time, he forgot to <b>unlatch</b> the patio door; the second time, he did so, but returned to the Wonderland hideout only to find some of the gang members were extremely high on heroin. After the members revived, Holmes was worried that the patio door may have been locked again, so he returned to Nash's a third time, purchased some crack cocaine, ensured the door was unlatched, and notified the gang that the home was ready for invasion.|$|E

Getting back up, Christie ran out the back door, across the rear deck to the back gate, and tried to <b>unlatch</b> the gate. Chand caught up to her, stabbing her in {{the left side of}} the face, causing Christie to collapse on the deck. She was stabbed an additional ten times by Chand, before the knife blade bent 90 degrees and became useless.|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} {{the way in}} which Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> is combining collective action and open access licenses to encourage innovation in markets for specialist academic books. Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> is a not for profit organisation that has been established to help a global community of libraries coordinate their book purchasing activities more effectively and, in so doing, to ensure that books librarians select for their own collections become available for free for anyone in the world to read. The Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> model is an attempt to re-coordinate a market in order to facilitate a transition to digitally appropriate publishing models that include open access. It offers librarians an opportunity to facilitate the open access publication of books that their own readers would value access to. It provides publishers with a stable income stream on titles selected by libraries, as well as an ability to continue selling books to a wider market on their own terms. Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> provides a rich case study for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding how innovations in procurement practices can be used to stimulate more effective, equitable markets for socially valuable products...|$|R
