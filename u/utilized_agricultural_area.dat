At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of <b>utilized</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>area.</b> In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m³. Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical crops, green vegetables, viticulture and wine-making, cotton growing and medicinal plants. In some lands it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, sugar beets, cotton and tobacco. Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits are also important farm products. The Caspian fishing industry is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga. In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.|$|E

40|$|Summer {{pastures}} in the Swiss Alps {{are currently}} affected by land-use changes that cause {{a decrease in}} biodiversity. Although these habitats make up one-third of the whole Swiss <b>agricultural</b> <b>area,</b> direct payments dedicated to support their management are very low. Current political instruments do not support efforts to conserve the biodiversity in these areas, but a vegetation-based approach {{such as the one}} implemented in the permanently <b>utilized</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> is under discussion. However, available studies evaluating the surrogate value of vascular plants for other (particularly animal) taxa have yielded inconsistent results, and very few have been conducted in habitats at high elevations. We investigated the extent to which vascular plants are adequate surrogates for butterfly and grasshopper diversity, examining the congruence of species richness and community similarity in two heterogeneous subalpine pastures in the Swiss Alps. Results at the species richness level (Spearman’s rank correlation) varied widely according to the study site and taxa assessed. In contrast, at the community similarity level (Procrustean randomization tests with Bray–Curtis similarity), congruencies between vascular plant and invertebrate taxa were generally highly significant. We therefore recommend the use of community similarity as a basis for estimating biodiversity patterns. Our results suggest that conservation measures aimed primarily at enhancing the floristic diversity of subalpine grasslands are also likely to benefit butterfly and grasshopper diversity, at least at the local scale...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe sarus crane (Grus antigone antigone) {{is listed}} as “vulnerable” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Sarus cranes are {{distributed}} in the lowlands, but most live outside protected <b>areas,</b> especially in <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> and wetlands of Nepal. The continuous expansion of agricultural land and the reduction of wetland habitats pose the greatest threats to the conservation of the species. We studied the sarus crane in the Rupandehi District of Nepal to understand their population structure, behavior, and current threats. We used the line (i. e., road) transect method from August 2013 to February 2014. The study area contained 147 sarus cranes. Agricultural land and wetland areas contained {{the highest number of}} sarus cranes. Our analysis showed that the population of sarus crane in the area has declined since 2007. Most sarus cranes lived in pairs. A single flock contained 13 cranes at maximum. Sarus crane behavior was not significantly different before and after the breeding seasons. Human–sarus crane conflict began when cranes started <b>utilizing</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> The main threats to the hatching success and survival of sarus cranes in the Rupendehi District are egg theft and the hunting of cranes for meat. The findings of this study establish baseline information on the overall conservation status, habitat availability, and ecological behavior of sarus cranes in the district. We propose regular surveys to monitor sarus crane population levels in the face of multiple anthropogenic threats to their survival...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{classify}} the dairy systems of an Alpine area (Trento Province, Italy) and compare {{them in terms}} of productivity, milk destination, maintenance of livestock biodiversity, land management, and landscape conservation. A sample of 610 dairy farms was surveyed, and data on their structural and management features were collected. Four different farming systems were identified through a non-hierarchical cluster approach: "Original Traditional" (lactating cows that are moved to highland pastures during summer), "Traditional without summer pastures", "Traditional with silages", and "Modern". "Modem" farms accounted for about one fifth of the total and were characterized by the presence of recent buildings with free animals and milking parlors, large herd sizes and high levels of milk production. The feeding strategy on modern farms consisted of total mixed rations based on silage, and Holstein Friesian was the main breed, whereas local and dual-purpose breeds were rare. "Original Traditional" farms were characterized by the presence of old buildings containing tied animals. These farms were small to medium and consisted of Brown Swiss and local breeds such as Rendena and Alpine Grey, which used mainly local forages and summer Alpine pastures. The GIS analyses of the <b>utilized</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> of each farm also showed that only traditional, low-input systems are able to maintain the steepest meadows and highland pastures. These systems guarantee a high sustainability in terms of livestock biodiversity, environmental impact (stocking and manure densities), and landscape protection (contrasting re-afforestation and managing Alpine pasture). The main concerns for economic and technical sustainability of traditional dairy farms are low productivity, land fragmentation and agricultural mechanization. The data analyzed also showed the strong link between these systems and the production of high value, Protected Designation of Origin cheeses is fundamental for reducing their economic handicap when compared with intensive farming systems...|$|R

Based on a newly revised self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) model driven with air-relative-humidity-based two-source (ARTS) E- 0 (PDSIARTS; Yan et al., 2014), spatial and temporal variations of drought were analyzed for 1982 - 2011 in China, which indicates that there was nonsignificant change of drought over this interval but with an extreme drought event happened in 2000 - 2001. However, using air temperature (T-a) -based Thornthwaite potential evaporation (E-P_Th) and Penman-Monteith potential evaporation (E-P_PM) to drive the PDSI model, their corresponding PDSITh and PDSIPM all gave a significant drying trend for 1982 - 2011. This suggests that PDSI model was sensitive to E-P parameterization in China. Annual drought-covered area from agriculture survey was initially adopted to evaluate impact of PDSI drought on agriculture in China during 1982 - 2011. The results indicate that PDSIARTS drought area (defined as PDSIARTS<- 0. 5) correlated well with the agriculture drought-covered area and PDSIARTS successfully detected the extreme agriculture drought in 2000 - 2001 during 1982 - 2011, i. e., climate factors dominated the interannual changes of agriculture drought area, while PDSITh and PDSIPM drought areas had no relationship with the agriculture drought-covered area and overestimated the uptrend of agriculture drought This study highlights the importance of coupling PDSI with drought survey data in evaluating the impact of natural drought on agriculture...|$|R
