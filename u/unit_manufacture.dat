An adaption of these methodologies is thus proposed so that they may be customised for the utilization of the knowledge assets. The primary aim of the work presented in this paper, {{is to be able to}} assess the real value of the organizational intangible assets and the development of performance indicators for these same assets, in order to obtain better levels of operational efficiency in the management of the industrial context within the a <b>unit</b> <b>manufacture.</b> </p...|$|E

50|$|One {{example of}} this {{balancing}} loop {{is a situation where}} a number of <b>units</b> <b>manufactured</b> is increasing (current state), which causes the manufacturing utilization to increase (end eventually exceed capacity). This will make each additional unit of manufacturing more expensive, reducing the growth in <b>units</b> <b>manufacture.</b> One can note that a rubber-banding effect occurs, since the more <b>units</b> are <b>manufactured,</b> the more expensive the manufacturing is. This loop taken in isolation would eventually find a stable state, independently of its beginning state.|$|R
