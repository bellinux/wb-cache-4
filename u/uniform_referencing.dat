30|$|Smoothing {{also has}} {{negative}} effects. Seismicity is usually strongly {{concentrated in the}} neighborhood of faults. Smoothing “redistributes” seismicity rates by imparting them to less active areas outside of faults. When different forecast models are compared, therefore, it is not recommendable to use a reference model with too heavy smoothing. The significant advantage of RI over the NSHM (Fig. 2) may, accordingly, be an artifact of a similar effect, because both PI and RI have much lower degrees of smoothing than the NSHM. This is similar to the advantage of just any forecast model over a <b>uniform</b> <b>reference</b> model: practically any model is expected to lie far below the diagonal in that case. To better assess the effects of smoothing on prospective forecasting, we have created a variety of RI-based models with different smoothing distances.|$|R

40|$|A new nonparametric {{estimator}} for {{the conditional}} hazard rate is proposed, which {{is defined as}} the ratio of local linear estimators for the conditional density and survivor function. The resulting hazard rate estimator is shown to be pointwise consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under appropriate conditions.

In terms of the mean squared error the new estimator is highly competitive in comparison to existing estimators for the conditional hazard rate. Moreover, its smoothing parameters are relatively robust to misspecification of the reference distributions, which facilitates bandwidth selection. Additionally, the new hazard rate estimator is conveniently calculated using standard software for local linear regression. The use of the local linear hazard rate is illustrated in an application to kidney transplant data. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

To achieve high-quality correction results, a new color correction method, based on the theoretical model of multi-view imaging and image restoration, is proposed in this paper. Considering the illumination problem in multi-view imaging, foreground and background regions are separated from images and dominant color extraction is used only for background regions of reference and input images, so that <b>uniform</b> <b>reference</b> surface information is used. Then, color correction is extended to video sequences with a tracking approach. Furthermore, an objective performance evaluation is proposed to evaluate the color correction.
