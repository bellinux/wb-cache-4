40|$|Bilateral single-issue {{negotiation}} is {{studied a}} lot by researchers as a fundamental research issue in agent negotiation. During a negotiation with time constraint, a negotiation decision function is usually predefined by negotiators to express their expectations on negotiation outcomes in different rounds. By combining the negotiation decision function with negotiators 2 ̆ 7 <b>utility</b> <b>functions,</b> offers can be generated accurately and efficiently to satisfy negotiators expectations in each round. However, such a negotiation procedure may not work well when negotiators 2 ̆ 7 <b>utility</b> <b>functions</b> are nonlinear. For example, if negotiators 2 ̆ 7 <b>utility</b> <b>functions</b> are non-monotonic, negotiators may find several offers {{that come with the}} same utility; and if negotiators 2 ̆ 7 <b>utility</b> <b>functions</b> are discrete, negotiators may not find an offer to satisfy their expected utility exactly. In order to solve such a problem caused by nonlinear <b>utility</b> <b>functions,</b> we propose a novel negotiation approach in this paper. Firstly, a 3 D model is introduced to illustrate the relationships among <b>utility</b> <b>functions,</b> time constraints and counter-offers. Then two negotiation mechanisms are proposed to handle two types of nonlinear <b>utility</b> <b>functions</b> respectively, ie. a multiple offers mechanism is introduced to handle non-monotonic <b>utility</b> <b>functions,</b> and an approximating offer mechanism is introduced to handle discrete <b>utility</b> <b>functions.</b> Lastly, a combined negotiation mechanism is proposed to handle nonlinear <b>utility</b> <b>functions</b> in general situations. The experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed approach. By employing the proposed approach, negotiators with nonlinear <b>utility</b> <b>functions</b> can also perform negotiations efficiently...|$|R

The choice of <b>utility</b> <b>function</b> has a large impact on the computational complexity of the resulting single-objective optimization problem.

25|$|In {{decision}} theory, the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem shows that, {{under certain}} axioms of rational behavior, a decision-maker faced with risky (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave {{as if he}} is maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future.

25|$|Economist Bryan Caplan {{argues that}} many Austrians have not {{understood}} valid contributions of modern mainstream economics, {{causing them to}} overstate their differences with it. For example, Murray Rothbard stated that he objected {{to the use of}} cardinal utility in microeconomic theory.

Austrian economist Roger Garrison writes that Austrian macroeconomic theory can be correctly expressed in terms of diagrammatic models.

25|$|The main {{contributions}} of the model were firstly the initial question Ramsey posed on how much savings should be and secondly the method of analysis, the intertemporal maximisation (optimisation) of collective or individual utility by applying techniques of dynamic optimisation. Tjalling C.

25|$|Previously, some economists, such as Carl Menger {{and others}} of the Austrian School, {{maintained}} {{that the value of}} factors of production is the individual contribution of each in the final product, but its value is the value of the last contributed to the final product (the marginal utility before reaching the point Pareto optimal). Thus, Wieser identified a flaw in the theory of imputation as expounded by his teacher, Carl Menger: overvaluation may occur if one is confronted with economies where profits jump (maximums and minimums in his <b>utility</b> <b>function,</b> where its second derivative equals 0). Wieser thus suggested as an alternative the simultaneous solution of a system of industrial equations.|$|E
25|$|In {{decision}} theory, and {{in particular}} in choice under uncertainty, an agent is described as making an optimal choice {{in the context of}} incomplete information. For risk neutral agents, the choice involves using the expected values of uncertain quantities, while for risk averse agents it involves maximizing the expected value of some objective function such as a von Neumann–Morgenstern <b>utility</b> <b>function.</b> One example of using expected value in reaching optimal decisions is the Gordon–Loeb model of information security investment. According to the model, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be {{only a small fraction of}} the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach).|$|E
25|$|A play {{is thus a}} {{path through}} the tree from the root to a {{terminal}} node. At any given non-terminal node belonging to Chance, an outgoing branch is chosen according to the probability distribution. At any rational player's node, the player must choose one of the equivalence classes for the edges, which determines precisely one outgoing edge except (in general) the player doesn't know which one is being followed. (An outside observer knowing every other player's choices up to that point, and the realization of Nature's moves, can determine the edge precisely.) A pure strategy for a player thus consists of a selectionchoosing precisely one class of outgoing edges for every information set (of his). In a game of perfect information, the information sets are singletons. It's less evident how payoffs should be interpreted in games with Chance nodes. It is assumed that each player has a von Neumann–Morgenstern <b>utility</b> <b>function</b> defined for every game outcome; this assumption entails that every rational player will evaluate an a priori random outcome by its expected utility.|$|E

25|$|The {{purchase}} of lottery tickets cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value should not buy lottery tickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility maximization, as the curvature of the <b>utility</b> <b>function</b> can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary value) obtained by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a lottery ticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E
