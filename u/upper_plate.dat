The <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> on the Y-axis was fed the output of a calibrator, allowing it to be adjusted so the beam was centred vertically.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the Hall and ion slip {{currents}} on an incompressible unsteady free convection flow and heat transfer of an upper convected Maxwell fluid between porous parallel plates with Soret and Dufour effects by considering the velocity slip and convective boundary conditions. Assume that there are periodic injection and suction at the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>plates,</b> respectively. The temperature and concentration at the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>plates</b> change periodically with time. The flow field equations are reduced to nonlinear ordinary differential equations by using similarity transformations and a semi-analytical-numerical solution has been obtained by the differential transform method. The velocity components, temperature distribution, and concentration with respect to different fluid and geometric parameters are discussed in detail and presented {{in the form of}} graphs. It is observed that the Biot number increases the temperature and concentration of the fluid. Further, the concentration of the fluid is enhanced whereas the temperature decreases with increasing slip. The present results are compared with the existing literature and are found to be in good agreement...|$|R
25|$|Stripe-patterned polymer films can {{be formed}} on solid {{substrates}} by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, {{and has no}} restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100µm/s. A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed {{at the edge of}} the sliding glass following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1µm, 3.6 and 8.4µm, and 4.3 and 12.7µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100nm. Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2µm, spacing: 6.1µm). However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3µm, spacing: 12.7µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.|$|E

2500|$|This {{earthquake}} occurred {{where the}} Pacific Plate is subducting under the plate beneath northern Honshu. The Pacific plate, which moves {{at a rate}} of 8 to 9cm (3.1 to 3.5 in) per year, dips under Honshu's underlying plate building large amounts of elastic energy. This motion pushes the <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> down until the accumulated stress causes a seismic slip-rupture event. The break caused the sea floor to rise by several metres. A quake of this magnitude usually has a rupture length of at least [...] and generally requires a long, relatively straight fault surface. Because the plate boundary and subduction zone {{in the area of the}} Honshu rupture is not very straight, it is unusual for the magnitude of its earthquake to exceed 8.5Mw; the magnitude of this earthquake was a surprise to some seismologists. The hypocentral region of this earthquake extended from offshore Iwate Prefecture to offshore Ibaraki Prefecture. The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake may have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of [...] and a width of [...] Analysis showed that this earthquake consisted of a set of three events.

2500|$|The {{process begins}} as two continents (different bits of {{continental}} crust), separated across a tract of ocean (and oceanic crust), approach each other, while the oceanic crust is slowly consumed at a subduction zone. The subduction zone {{runs along the}} edge of one of the continents and dips under it, raising volcanic mountain chains at some distance behind it, such as the Andes of South America today. Subduction involves the whole lithosphere, the density of which is largely controlled {{by the nature of the}} crust it carries. [...] Oceanic crust is thin (~6km thick) and dense (about 3.3g/cm³), consisting of basalt, gabbro, and peridotite. Consequently, most oceanic crust is subducted easily at an oceanic trench. In contrast, continental crust is thick (~45km thick) and buoyant, composed mostly of granitic rocks (average density about 2.5g/cm³). Continental crust is subducted with difficulty, but is subducted to depths of 90-150km or more, as evidenced by ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic suites. Normal subduction continues as long as the ocean exists, but the subduction system is disrupted as the continent carried by the downgoing plate enters the trench. Because it contains thick continental crust, this lithosphere is less dense than the underlying asthenospheric mantle and normal subduction is disrupted. The volcanic arc on the <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> is slowly extinguished. Resisting subduction, the crust buckles up and under, raising mountains where a trench used to be. The position of the trench becomes a zone that marks the suture between the two continental terranes. Suture zones are often marked by fragments of the pre-existing oceanic crust and mantle rocks, known as ophiolites.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{forward and}} inverse kinematics {{of a specific}} class of serial-parallel manipulators, known as 2 (6 -UPU) manipulators. This manipulator composed of two modules which consist of elementary manipulators with the parallel structure of Stewart Platform. At first, the Kinematics Model of the hybrid manipulator is obtained. As there is a highly nonlinear relations between joint variables, and position and orientation of the end effectors, the inverse kinematic problem of these manipulators is quite complicated to solve. In this study, wavelet based neural network (WNN) with its inherent learning ability, is used to solve the inverse kinematic problem. Also, proposed wavelet neural network is applied to approximate the paths of mid and <b>upper</b> <b>plates</b> in circle and spiral trajectories. Finally, the results of simulation show high accurate performance of proposed method...|$|R
50|$|Back-arc {{deformation}} is {{a product}} of subduction at convergent plate tectonic boundaries. It initiates and evolves behind the volcanic arc on the overriding plate of a subduction zone. The stresses responsible for the deformation in this region of a subduction zone result from a combination of processes. The absolute motion of the <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> as it moves towards or away from the trench strongly contributes to deformation in the back-arc region. Since the downgoing slab is partly anchored in the viscous layers of the mantle, and therefore its lateral movement is significantly slower than the surface plate, then any motion of the overriding plate will cause extensional or compressional stress in the back-arc region depending on the direction of motion. In addition, mantle convection in the upper mantle wedge caused by the downward movement of the subducted slab causes stress in the <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> and the high heat flow that characterizes back-arcs. The pulling effect of the slab as it goes down into the mantle causes a rollback motion of the trench, which also applies stress on the back-arc region of the <b>upper</b> <b>plate.</b> However, this last process has less of an impact on deformation compared to <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> motion.|$|E
