50|$|Most <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> {{scenarios}} {{happen in}} seawater, not fresh or pure water. Salt, unlike water, readily absorbs neutrons into the sodium-23 and chlorine-35 atoms, which change to radioactive isotopes. Sodium-24 has a half life of about 15 hours, while that of chlorine-36 (which {{has a lower}} absorption cross-section) is 300,000 years; the sodium is therefore the most dangerous contaminant. These are generally the main radioactive contaminants in an underwater blast; others are the usual blend of irradiated minerals, coral, unused nuclear fuel and bomb case components present in surface blast nuclear fallout, carried in suspension or dissolved in the water. Thus plain distillation or evaporating water (clouds, humidity, and precipitation) purifies it of radiation contamination, including the radioactive salt.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first days}} were uneventful. On 15 July, Flamingo {{anchored}} for the night, as was usual practice, {{to the north}} of the minefield. During the ensuing evening hours, strong winds and currents caused herto drag her anchor. She slowly worked southward from her original position. The next morning, when Flamingo weighed anchor to get underway, she discovered that she had drifted into the minefield and had fouled one of the mines in her anchor cable. The mine was trailing just beneath the fantail of the ship and exploded beneath Flamingo′s stern. The <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> badly damaged the rudder, disabled the capstan and generator, and dished in the ships stern plating in several places.

At 08:15 that morning, an {{obsolete}} Aichi D3A [...] "Val" [...] dive bomber dropped unheralded out of the clouds and made straight for the warship. The destroyer managed to evade the suicide plane, and it splashed down nearby her. Somehow, the explosive-laden plane ended up directly beneath Porter before it exploded. Suddenly, the warship was lifted {{out of the water}} and then dropped back again, due to the force of the <b>underwater</b> <b>blast.</b> She lost power and suffered broken steam lines. A number of fires also broke out. For three hours, her crew struggled to put out the fires, repair the damage, and keep the ship afloat. The crew's efforts were in vain; and, 12 minutes after the order to abandon ship went out, William D. Porter heeled over to starboard and sank by the stern. Miraculously, her crew suffered no fatal injuries. The warship's name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 July 1945.|$|E

From the {{perspective}} of reconstruction with explosion overpressure field, the paper presents four indicators, which can obtain the optimal sensor layout scheme and guide sensor layout in practical experiment, combining with the genetic algorithm with global search. Then, a multi-scale model in every subregion of <b>underwater</b> <b>blasting</b> field was established to be used simulation experiments. By Matlab, the variation of these four indicators with different sensor layout, and reconstruction accuracy are analyzed and discussed. Finally, a conclusion has been raised through the analysis and comparison of simulation results, that the program can get a better sensor layout.

40|$|Lighthouses are {{the most}} {{important}} hydraulic structures that should be protected during <b>underwater</b> drilling <b>blasting.</b> Thus, the effect of blasting vibration on lighthouse should be studied. On the basis of the dimensional analysis, we deduced a revised formula for water depth based on Sodev’s empirical formula and established the linear fitting model. During the underwater reef project in the main channel of Shipu Harbor in the Ningbo–Zhoushan Port, the blasting vibration data of the lighthouse near the <b>underwater</b> <b>blasting</b> area were monitored. The undetermined coefficient, resolvable coefficient, and F value of the two formulas were then obtained.

Floods in 1948 undermined the south main pier of the steel structure, causing the design to be changed from a section of earth fill to five additional T-beam concrete approach spans. <b>Underwater</b> <b>blasting</b> was required to remove the south pier for the altered work, resulting in a 673 ft series of concrete approach spans on the south.|$|R
50|$|The nuclear {{explosion}} {{was carried}} out in open ocean outside of Enewetak. This nuclear test codenamed Wahoo, was the first underwater test in the Operation Hardtack series. This test could be considered a continuation of the Wigwam nuclear blast (a deep water nuclear test 500 nautical {{miles off the coast of}} San Diego). Like its predecessor, the Wahoo shot was a scientific program that studied the effects of an underwater nuclear blast on Navy systems. The nuclear device was positioned 500 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean. This deep water test required precise targeting arrays to be set up around the blast location, which presented unique problems for the arrays as the winds, sea currents and tides needed to be within certain limits for the data to be accurate. Testing arrays were placed at depths of 400 to 800 fathoms (2400 to 4800 feet) around the nuclear device. The deep water mooring systems needed for the test proved to be difficult to be put in proper placement leading many analysts to believe the data to be skewed. The target ships to be used for this program consisted of three destroyers, an active submarine, a submarine mockup used in Wigwam tests, and a merchant marine ship. It was predicted that no air blast or thermal effects would be presented from the <b>underwater</b> <b>blast.</b> The fallout from the blast was also predicted to stay within the target array due to the southwest surface winds.|$|E
5000|$|ASROC started {{development}} as the Rocket Assisted Torpedo (RAT) program by the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake {{in the early}} 1950s to develop a surface warship ASW weapon counter to the new post-World War II submarines which ran quieter, at much higher speed and could attack from much longer range with high speed homing torpedoes. In addition, {{the goal was to}} take advantage of modern sonars with a much larger detection range. An extended range torpedo delivered by parachute from the air would allow warships the stand-off capability to attack hostile submarines with very little advance notice to the hostile submarine. The RAT program came in three phases: [...] RAT-A, RAT-B and RAT-C. RAT-A (and its follow-on, RAT-B) were efforts to develop a compact and economical stand-off ASW for smaller warships, but were found to be either unreliable or had too short a range. RAT-C was a program to develop a stand-off ASW weapon that used a nuclear depth charge. This would require a range of at least 8,000 yards to escape potential damage from the <b>underwater</b> <b>blast.</b> Unlike the original RAT program rockets, the RAT-C was considerably larger to accomplish the extended range needed and was to be fitted to larger warships. With the failure of both the RAT-A and RAT-B programs, RAT-C was redesigned from a stand-off nuclear ASW weapon to one that could use not only a nuclear depth charge but also a homing ASW torpedo. To obtain the accuracy needed, the RAT-C rocket launcher had to be redesigned with larger side fins. This program finally combined reliability and accuracy, along with the necessary stand-off range. However, before RAT-C reached initial operational status in 1960 aboard the large US Navy destroyer leader , its name was changed to the present ASROC.|$|E

Further discussion with Captain Alfred Wilkinson Johnson, Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet aboard USS Shawmut, confirmed that near-miss bombs would inflict more damage than direct hits; near-misses would cause an underwater concussive effect against the hull.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of proper {{instrumentations}} and the difficulties in underwater measurements, the studies about water bottom vibration induced by <b>underwater</b> drilling <b>blasting</b> are seldom reported. In order to investigate the propagation and attenuation laws of blasting induced water bottom vibration, a water bottom vibration monitor was developed with consideration of the difficulties in underwater measurements. By means of this equipment, the actual water bottom vibration induced by <b>underwater</b> drilling <b>blasting</b> was measured in a field experiment. It shows that the water bottom vibration monitor could collect vibration signals quite effectively in underwater environments. The followed signal analysis shows that the characteristics of water bottom vibration and land ground vibration induced by the same <b>underwater</b> drilling <b>blasting</b> are quite different due to the different geological environments. The amplitude and frequency band of water bottom vibration both exceed those of land ground vibration. Water bottom vibration is mainly in low-frequency band that induced by blasting impact directly acts on rock.

A project that used a nuclear blast to clear minefields was studied using the Umbrella blast. 120 inert mines were placed at different distances ranging from 1,500 feet to 8,000.

Development of effective personal protection and countermeasures, however, requires knowledge of the currently unknown human tolerance to <b>underwater</b> <b>blast.</b> Current guidelines for prevention of <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> injury are not based on any organized injury risk assessment, human data or experimental data. The goal {{of this study was}} to derive injury risk assessments for <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> using well-characterized human <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> exposures in the open literature. The human injury dataset was compiled using 34 case reports on <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> exposure to 475 personnel, dating as early as 1916. Using severity ratings, computational reconstructions of the blasts, and survival information from a final set of 262 human exposures, injury risk models were developed for both injury severity and risk of fatality as functions of blast impulse and blast peak overpressure. Based on these human data, we found that the 50 % risk of fatality from <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> occurred at 302 ± 16 kPa-ms impulse. Conservatively, there is a 20 % risk of pulmonary injury at a kilometer from a 20 kg charge. From a clinical point of view, this new injury risk model emphasizes the large distances possible for potential pulmonary and gut injuries in water compared with air. This risk value is the first impulse-based fatality risk calculated from human data. The large-scale inconsistency between the blast exposures in the case reports and the guidelines available in the literature prior to this study further underscored the need for this new guideline derived from the unique dataset of actual injuries in this study...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of submerged structures subject to loading by <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> waves {{is governed by}} complex interactions between the moving or deforming structure and the surrounding fluid and these phenomena need to be thoroughly understood in order to design structural components against <b>underwater</b> <b>blast.</b> This thesis has addressed the {{response of}} simple structural systems to blast loading in shallow or deep water environment. Analytical models {{have been developed to}} examine the one-dimensional response of both water-backed and air-backed submerged rigid plates, supported by linear springs and loaded by underwater shock waves. Cavitation phenomena as well as the effect of initial static fluid pressure are explicitly included in the models and their predictions were found in excellent agreement with detailed FE simulations. Then, a novel experimental apparatus has been developed, to reproduce controlled blast loading in initially pressurised liquids. It consists of a transparent water shock tube and allows observing the structural response as well as the propagation of cavitation fronts initiated by fluid-structure interaction in a blast event. This experimental technique was then employed to explore the one-dimensional response of monolithic plates, sandwich panels and double-walled structures subject to loading by underwater shock waves. The performed experiments provide great visual insight into the cavitation process and the experimental measurements were found to be in good agreement with analytical predictions and dynamic FE results. Finally, <b>underwater</b> <b>blast</b> loading of circular elastic plates has been investigated by theoretically modelling the main phenomena of dynamic plate deformation and fluid-structure interaction. In addition, underwater shock experiments have been performed on circular composite plates and the obtained measurements were found in good correlation with the corresponding analytical predictions.

40|$|To {{monitor the}} {{underwater}} sound and pressure waves generated by anthropogenic {{activities such as}} <b>underwater</b> <b>blasting</b> and pile driving, an autonomous system was designed to record underwater acoustic signals. The underwater sound recording device (USR) allows for connections of two hydrophones or other dynamic pressure sensors, filters high frequency noise out of the collected signals, has a gain that can be independently set for each sensor, and allows for 2 h of data collection. Two versions of the USR were created: a submersible model deployable to a maximum depth of 300 m, and a watertight but not fully submersible model. Tests were performed on the USR in the laboratory using a data acquisition system to send single-frequency sinusoidal voltages directly to each component. These tests verified that the device operates as designed and performs as well as larger commercially available data acquisition systems, which are not suited for field use. On average, the designed gain values differed from the actual measured gain values by about 0. 35 dB.
