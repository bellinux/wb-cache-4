50|$|Since even well-engineered IP {{networks}} {{tend to have}} a small residual {{packet loss}} rate caused by low-probability statistical congestion events and amplification of bit errors in the underlying hardware, most professional solutions use some kind of forward error correction to ensure that the encoded video stream can be reconstructed even if a few packets are lost. This is typically applied at the packet level, since the encapsulated video bitstream is typically only designed to tolerate low levels of bit or burst errors, rather than the loss of whole packets.

By presenting {{a solution to}} disagreements between the existing frameworks, we build a causal framework {{that allows us to}} express causal implications of econometric model specifications.

As an example, we apply these concepts to discover fundamental flaws in <b>a</b> <b>resent</b> strand of literature estimating the carbon Kuznetz curve, which postulates that carbon dioxide emissions initially increase with economic growth but that the relationship is eventually reversed.

40|$|The Predominant {{failure modes}} in {{sheet metal parts}} (deep drawing process) are wrinkling, fracture. In many cases these defects may be {{eliminated}} by appropriate control of the blank holding force (BHF). This paper summarizes the results of <b>a</b> <b>resent</b> study on the formability of rectangular or cylindrical parts from Extra Deep Draw (EDD) steels. Wrinkling, fracture limits have been determined and BHF control methods {{have been developed to}} eliminate defects,improve part quality, and increase the draw depth. The prediction and prevention of wrinkling and fracture are extremely important in the design of tooling and process parameters in deep drawing process. Forming process of Extra Deep Draw (EDD) Steel alloy sheets can be investigated by using deep drawing process. When the BHF is 70 - 80 N/mm 2 the steel sheets with a thickness 5 mm can be produced in the cups without any defects such as wrinkling, tearing. A 3 -D explicit-finite element analysis is used to investigate the influence of various BHF schemes on sheet metal formability limits especially wrinkling, and fracture. The role of relevant parameters of each blank holding technique is also investigated.
