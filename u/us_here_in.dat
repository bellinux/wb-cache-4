500|$|Jackson gave a prime-time {{speech at}} the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008. During his speech he {{referenced}} Martin Luther King Jr., stating, [...] "I'm sure that Dr. King is looking down on <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Denver noting {{this is the first}} political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountain top." [...] Jackson said, [...] "I know Barack Obama. I've seen his leadership at work. I've seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois." [...] At the convention, Jackson started what was described as a [...] "hugfest" [...] in an attempt to unite the Illinois Democratic party, which had been squabbling internally. He started by hugging Bobby Rush (who had been upset that Jackson's wife was being positioned for Rush's seat when Rush had been ill earlier in the year) and then he hugged Debbie Halvorson, who as been at odds with him over the proposed airport. He then asked if anyone else was mad at him. At this point Mayor Daley jumped up to hug Jackson. Jackson then said [...] "I'm not going to be satisfied until I see Rod Blagojevich give Mike Madigan a hug." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2017 {{he spoke}} at the Boston Free Speech rally, a {{gathering}} which drew large counter-protests and whose speakers included right-wing extremists. Ayyadurai later disputed how the event was characterized, tweeting that the [...] "establishment" [...] wanted to block attendance and media coverage, and sought a [...] "Race War to divide us". In his remarks, he said that [...] "all of <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> many ways, are true patriots because, {{in spite of that}} noise out there, we're here to stand up for something very fundamental, which is called free speech." ...|$|E
2500|$|While President Obama {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} the decision, stating [...] "I think all of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the United States were surprised, disappointed and angry about the release", the U.S. government was aware that a release was possible. The deputy head of the U.S. embassy in London, Frank LeBaron, {{wrote in a letter}} to the Scottish first minister Alex Salmond that the U.S. believed al-Megrahi should remain in prison for his role in downing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988, and continued: [...] "Nevertheless, if Scottish authorities come to the conclusion that Megrahi must be released from Scottish custody, the U.S. position is that conditional release on compassionate grounds would be a far preferable alternative to prisoner transfer, which we strongly oppose." [...] This same letter stressed the importance to the United States of America of a 3-months prognosis, despite it not being a legal requirement in Scotland: [...] "any such release should only come after the results of independent and comprehensive medical exams clearly establishing that Megrahi's life expectancy is less than three months".|$|E

2500|$|McKinney gained {{national}} attention for remarks she made following the 2001 US attacks, {{charging that the}} United States had advance knowledge of the attacks and that US President George W. Bush may have been aware and allowed them to happen, allegedly due to his father's business interests: [...] "It is known that President Bush's father, through The Carlyle Group, had–at {{the time of the}} attacks–joint business interests with the bin Laden construction company and many defense industry holdings, the stocks of which have soared since September 11." [...] In the month that followed the attacks, when New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani refused to cash a $10 million check written by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in light of the Prince's suggestion that the attacks were an indication that the United States [...] "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause," [...] McKinney published an open letter to the Saudi Prince. She expressed her disappointment at Giuliani's action and stated, [...] "Let me say that there are {{a growing number of people}} in the United States who recognize, like you, that U.S. policy in the Middle East needs serious examination...Your Royal Highness, many of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the United States have long been concerned about reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that reveal a pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by Israeli security forces in situations where Palestinian demonstrators were unarmed and posed no threat of death or serious injury to the security forces or to others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{my faith}} and my troth," [...] quoth Robin at last, drawing a deep breath, [...] "lad, thou art--Thou must not leave our company, Allan! Wilt thou not stay with <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the sweet green forest? Truly, I do feel my heart go out toward thee with great love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{certainly}} a good actor, Baron," [...] he declared. [...] "Even your German {{has become a}} little English. Sit down and join us in a glass of beer.

60|$|I must say, however, {{that the}} reason why this decree, or order, {{whichever}} it may be called, has been made, was to the end that men and women, who had large families of children, might be induced to join <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Jamestown, {{as if we had}} not already mouths enough to feed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Naturally perhaps not," [...] Matteo laughed; [...] "but {{you see it}} {{has become}} a second nature to <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Venice. But seriously I admit that the present state of things has grown to be a scandal, and that the doings of some of our class ought to be put down with a strong hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come; that's not fair," [...] said Graham. [...] "Don't import Cologne {{in order}} to crush <b>us</b> <b>here</b> down <b>in</b> our little English villages. You never saw the choir of Cologne bright with holly berries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, thank you, captain," [...] replied Stanley; [...] "and don't forget <b>us</b> out <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> this lonely place, {{when you}} drink {{the health of}} absent friends at Christmas time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{almost as}} well kill us as turn <b>us</b> adrift <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the wilderness, without food or {{the means of}} {{procuring}} it," [...] remonstrated Fred. [...] "Is it not so, Tom?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Wrong as {{we think}} slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is because that much {{is due to the}} {{necessity}} arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> these free States? ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{the doctors}} had gone she turned to Victor, saying: [...] "There is nothing {{for us to do}} now but to wait.

6000|$|... "'How do you do, my dear sister-in-law?' {{said the}} ex-hermit. 'I do not wonder you are {{surprised}} to see <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> and <b>in</b> order to relieve your mind I will instantly explain the state of affairs.' Whereupon he explained them.|$|R

"Did the Spirits of {{the divine}} Pharaoh your father, and of Mermes my lord, bring <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the Boat of Ra {{that we should be}} devoured by wild animals, like lost sheep in the desert?"

6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{the great}} man said hurriedly, in subdued tones, {{as if the whole}} thing had been a stolen, breathless interview. [...] "Exactly.

60|$|I {{hope that}} your {{asthmatic}} tendencies {{may not be}} strong just now; but Townshend's account of the premature winter at Lausanne is not encouraging, and with <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> England all such disorders have been aggravated this autumn.

5000|$|The President's patient {{devotion and}} loving {{attention}} was {{the talk of}} the capital. [...] "President McKinley has made it pretty hard for the rest of <b>us</b> husbands <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Washington," [...] remarked Senator Mark Hanna.|$|R

He's {{saved the}} {{situation}} for <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the valley. Every rancher I know is praisin' him high. An' he sure treated Neuman square.

6000|$|... "Do it, Jackson!" [...] {{his friend}} conjured him. [...] "May cost you {{something}} more, but it 'll {{be worth the}} money.

6000|$|... "Then," [...] she commented, [...] "we have to {{face the}} situation, and it's not an {{encouraging}} one. Our joint earnings just keep <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> decency--we won't say comfort--and they're evidently to be subject to a big reduction.

6000|$|... "Wouldn't it be great, now," [...] she murmured, dreamily, half to herself, [...] "if that Las Vegas cowboy {{would happen}} somehow to come, {{and then an}} {{earthquake}} would shut <b>us</b> up <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this Paradise valley so we'd never get out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{give you}} my honour, Mr Christian," [...] he said, [...] "never {{to think of what}} has passed this day if you will desist. To cast <b>us</b> adrift <b>here</b> <b>in</b> an open boat is to consign us to destruction. Think of my wife and family!" ...|$|R
