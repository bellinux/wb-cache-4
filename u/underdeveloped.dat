5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in <b>underdeveloped</b> countries perpetuates its <b>underdeveloped</b> state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in <b>underdeveloped</b> countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance should be given to promoting exports.|$|E
5|$|Dika oil, from Irvingia gabonensis seeds, {{native to}} West Africa. Used to make margarine, soap and pharmaceuticals, {{where is it}} being {{examined}} as a tablet lubricant. Largely <b>underdeveloped.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a large {{population}} implies a large market. Though <b>underdeveloped</b> countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than <b>underdeveloped</b> countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E
5|$|Facilities {{for wine}} {{tourists}} in Oregon are considered <b>underdeveloped</b> compared to wine regions in California, especially premium growing regions like the Napa Valley AVA. Only 5% of overnight leisure trips {{in the state}} involve visits to wineries, a much smaller figure than comparable Californian growing regions, which range from 10% to 25%.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{birds are}} {{distinguished}} by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin and throat, and absent or <b>underdeveloped</b> head plumes, often just {{a scattering of}} yellow feathers. The crest is fully developed in birds aged three to four years, {{a year or two}} before breeding age.|$|E
5|$|Infrastructure {{development}} in Sarawak is {{overseen by the}} Ministry of Infrastructure Development and Transportation, successor to the Ministry of Infrastructure Development and Communications (MIDCom) after it was renamed in 2016. Despite this ministerial oversight, infrastructure in Sarawak remains relatively <b>underdeveloped</b> compared to Peninsular Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commercial}} {{areas are}} growing rapidly, agriculture remains {{a foundation of}} the economy in the rural areas of the southern part of El Hatillo. The business sector remains mostly <b>underdeveloped,</b> causing heavy employee movement {{in and out of the}} municipality – a problem that has made the transportation infrastructure of El Hatillo very congested.|$|E
5|$|Despite improvements, {{several aspects}} of the {{transport}} sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making by the central authorities. The demand for transport infrastructure and services was rising, but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people. The <b>underdeveloped</b> Soviet road network, in a chain reaction, led to a growing demand for public transport. The nation's merchant fleet {{was one of the}} largest in the world.|$|E
5|$|For example, in most <b>underdeveloped</b> economies, the {{technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the <b>underdeveloped</b> country.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an <b>underdeveloped</b> economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{emphasised}} that Keynesian theory shouldn't {{be applied}} to <b>underdeveloped</b> countries because they don't face a lack of effective demand {{in the way that}} developed countries do. Their problem is to do with a lack of real purchasing power due to low productivity levels. Thus, merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause inflationary pressure.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{stressed}} productivity as {{the primary}} determinant {{of the size of}} the market. An increase in productivity (defined as the output per unit input) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy. As a response, consumption also rises. Hence, <b>underdeveloped</b> economies should aim to raise their productivity levels in all sectors of the economy, in particular agriculture and industry.|$|E
5|$|People {{from the}} {{overpopulated}} western highlands and the <b>underdeveloped</b> north {{are moving to}} the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment. Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations {{in the south and}} east. Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Five-Year Plan is {{subordinate}} to the Ten Year Socio-economic Development Strategy (2001–2010) which aims to continue comprehensive reform and achieve fast, sustainable growth rates. The main goal of the Ten Year Plan is to lift Vietnam out of the category of <b>underdeveloped</b> countries and to reach {{the status of a}} modern-industrial nation by 2012. The Eighth Five-Year Plan, while approved by the Congress, had to earn the approval of the National Assembly before being implemented.|$|E
5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any <b>underdeveloped</b> country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.|$|E
5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue to the rear floor of the mouth is called the plica sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an <b>underdeveloped</b> {{structure}} consisting of only a tiny outgrowth {{on the floor of the}} mouth. The point where the plica sublingualis attaches to the rear floor of the mouth marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticisms of}} the film were that its {{characters}} were <b>underdeveloped,</b> its script was crowded, and it was overlong. However, the special effects, chemistry between Stone and Garfield, Dane DeHaan's performance, the action scenes, and Hans Zimmer's musical score were met with high praise. Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon/Electro was met with mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|The show's co-creators, Fawcett and Graeme Manson, {{along with}} Maslany {{and her hair}} and makeup artists, {{developed}} the character of Tony {{over a period of}} six months after deciding that the inclusion of a transgender character would fit well with the show's themes of identity, gender and sexuality. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews: critics praised Maslany's performance but found Tony's character <b>underdeveloped</b> and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{condition}} of Argentina, {{as a country}} which had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal, has inspired a wealth of literature and analyses on the causes of this progressive decline. The Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets {{is said to have}} remarked that there were four types of countries: the developed, the <b>underdeveloped,</b> Japan and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{had large}} {{nostrils}} and a fleshy snout, Nigersaurus had an <b>underdeveloped</b> olfactory region of its brain and thus {{did not have}} an advanced sense of smell. Its brain-to-body-mass ratio was average for a reptile, and smaller than those of ornithischians and non-coelurosaurian theropods. The cerebrum comprised about 30% of the brain volume, as in many other dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Walsingham's cousin Edward Denny {{fought in}} Ireland during the {{rebellion}} of the Earl of Desmond {{and was one}} of the English settlers granted land in Munster confiscated from Desmond. Walsingham's stepson Christopher Carleill commanded the garrisons at Coleraine and Carrickfergus. Walsingham thought Irish farmland was <b>underdeveloped</b> and hoped that plantation would improve the productivity of estates. Tensions between the native Irish and the English settlers had lasting effects on the history of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and <b>underdeveloped</b> countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|According to Nurkse, <b>underdeveloped</b> {{countries}} lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance {{printmaker}} {{who made}} important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement), meant {{to teach the}} subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of perspective in Underweysung der Messung are <b>underdeveloped</b> and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion) in 1528.|$|E
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an <b>underdeveloped</b> country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his National Letter of Intent signing with Michigan Wolverines basketball, ESPN.com and Scout.com ranked McGary as the number two player in the United States high school class of 2012, while Rivals.com ranked him as the number three prospect. He was not only the {{consensus}} top power forward recruit in the nation, but also the top big man according to most sources at the time. After his signing, however, McGary fell down in the rankings as his <b>underdeveloped</b> offensive skills became apparent.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore shape, the species is readily identified {{with the use of}} a microscope because of its setae. Setae are a kind of unusual cystidia unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the hymenium. In shape, the setae are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (<b>underdeveloped</b> cystidia) can be found in the species, but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{if such a}} {{strategy}} of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} <b>underdeveloped</b> country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E
5|$|Lightning has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her cold personality, which {{was compared to}} that of Final Fantasy VIIs protagonist Cloud Strife. She was criticized for her relative absence in XIII-2. Her role in Lightning Returns had a mixed reception: some critics saw her as <b>underdeveloped</b> and unlikable, while others found her better developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by video game publications, of the best characters in the Final Fantasy series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by Famitsu, Square Enix, and other organizations.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of <b>underdeveloped,</b> altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.|$|E
5|$|North Korea's lack {{of large}} airstrips and {{aircraft}} meant it conducted only minimal air resupply, mostly critical items being imported from China. Other than this, however, aircraft played almost {{no role in}} North Korean logistics. The North Koreans were also not able to effectively use sea transport. Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam {{could be used for}} the transport of some troops and supplies, but they remained far too <b>underdeveloped</b> to support any large-scale logistical movements, and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate with large numbers of ships.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} <b>underdeveloped</b> {{characters}} despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk {{found it hard to}} piece together the relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and {{relatively}} <b>underdeveloped)</b> or precocial (mostly furred, {{eyes open and}} fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest {{a few days after}} they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{nowadays}} {{sparsely populated}} {{as the result}} of urbanization after World War II. Many of the dwellings now remain shut, while abandonment of the traditional rural economy has affected the cultural landscape. Epirus, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, {{is considered one of the}} most <b>underdeveloped</b> regions in Greece. Tourism constitutes the principal source of revenue for the local economy, although it has a highly seasonal character. Intense development in terms of accommodation and tourism infrastructure occurred in the 1980s, mainly through state initiatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} in the games have been the basis of several pieces of merchandise produced by Square Enix, such as statues, action figures, apparel, and jewelry. They {{have been subject to}} mostly positive reviews; most observers favorably compared the characters to those in the previous games and praised the voice acting, however some critics have stated that the plot line of the characters have been confusing when introduced. In XIII-2, the shift to new or secondary characters and the change in importance and story role of the previous game's main cast grated with some reviewers, while others applauded the new characters' development and interactions. In Lightning Returns, the characters' stories were often criticized for being <b>underdeveloped,</b> or simply included for the sake of ending their stories.|$|E
