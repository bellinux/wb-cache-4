The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
40|$|Aims Genetically {{influenced}} {{aspects of}} adolescent behaviour {{can play a}} role in alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> peer affiliation. We explored the correlations between friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescent own <b>use</b> with a genetically sensitive design. Design Genetic and environmental factors were estimated on adolescent reports of their friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> their own <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. The correlations between the genetic and environmental factors that influence friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> were also estimated. Participants A total of 862 twin pairs aged 11 – 17 years sampled from the UK population-based Cardiff Study of All Wales and North-west of England Twins (CaStANET). Measurements Data on adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> <b>and</b> the alcohol <b>use</b> of their three best friends were obtained using self-report questionnaires. Findings A significant genetic influence was found on adolescent friends' alcohol use (about 30 %). Significant correlations of 0. 60 and 0. 70 were found between the genetic influences on friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' own <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. Common environmental influences were almost completely correlated for friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> (0. 91 <b>and</b> 0. 94). Conclusions There is considerable overlap in the common environmental and genetic factors that contribute to the relationship between adolescents' own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> that of their friends. These findings contribute to understanding of the mechanisms by which friends' alcohol use influences adolescent drinking behaviour...|$|R

5|$|The Continental {{leaders of}} the church {{immediately}} after 1066 justified the Conquest by denigrating the pre-Conquest state of the Anglo-Saxon church. Newcomers such as Lanfranc, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, {{had no interest in}} saints venerated by the Anglo-Saxons, and his Constitutiones for Christ Church, Canterbury, show no debt to the Regularis Concordia. However, Anglo-Norman monks soon turned the Anglo-Saxon hagiographical tradition to their own <b>uses,</b> <b>and</b> saints venerated by the Anglo-Saxons regained respect. Monasteries' land and privileges were defended by appealing to pre-Conquest charters, and fabricating fraudulent ones if necessary. In the next generation two historians of mixed parentage, Eadmer and William of Malmesbury, saw a pattern of an early Northumbrian peak followed by decline until a revival in the tenth century, and a further decline which reached its nadir {{on the eve of the}} Conquest. This scheme, which saw both the tenth century and the post-Conquest as peaks of monastic excellence preceded by periods of decline, satisfied both Norman propaganda and Anglo-Saxon pride, but in Gransden's view it unfairly denigrates the achievements of the periods of so-called decline.|$|E
