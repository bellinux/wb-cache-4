40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of many {{alliance}}s is to deter attacks on members of the alliance by potentially antagonistic states. Yet some alliances can increase the probability of conflict that may be initiated by alliance members. Cognizant of that possibility, states that wish to sustain peace may nevertheless intentionally form alliance commitments with revisionist leaders of other states. Faced with the partially conflicting goals of deterring antagonistic states {{while at the same}} time restraining allies, leaders often include in alliance treaties conditions that oblige allies to provide military assistance only if a member of the alliance is attacked by a state outside the alliance. However, other treaties may contain unconditional obligations to come to the defense of members of the alliance. Such alliances tend to arise from situations where some members of the alliance feel that their alliance partners need to have the flexibility even to engage in provocative behavior in order to deter the target of the alliance. Our analysis of alliance formation processes in the context of priorities that compete with each other provides a basis for two hypotheses. The first is that revisionist states with <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitments</b> from members of their alliance to come to their defense are more likely to initiate militarized conflict than states without such <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitments.</b> The second hypothesis is that revisionist states in alliances whose treaties stipulate that commitments to defend are conditional will be less likely to initiate militarized conflict than such states with allies who are committed to come to thei...|$|R

While Rooney acknowledges that hospitals may need to charge more than Medicare will pay, he contends that authoritative research shows that Medicare plus 25 percent is the reasonable amount for hospitals to charge…. 'Nationally, 35 percent of Hispanics are uninsured; 22 percent of African-Americans are uninsured; and 11 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians are uninsured. So when you’re doubling, tripling, multiplying the price by five times, you’re doing it mainly to minority people,' Rooney says. 'I consider that racial discrimination.' NUVO goes on to report: “Rooney believes that people need tools to defend themselves. ‘They need to know how to deal with the hospital and the evidence is if they deal with the hospital correctly almost all the time the hospital will forgive the bill … The hospital is only entitled to collect a reasonable fee. There is case law exactly on this subject. When they enter the hospital, if they sign an <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitment</b> it’s generally not binding because they’re under duress.’ Rooney has made helping the uninsured a focus of the Fairness Foundation. The foundation has allied itself with lawyers willing to represent people in disputes over hospital bills and has set up a toll free number that people call for help: 800-742-3441. Rooney emphasizes that talking people through the process of dealing with hospitals requires patience, stamina and verbal skills. The Fairness Foundation, he says, is equipped to not only give people useful information but to talk them through what they need to do. ‘A sick person is not in a position to adequately defend themselves,’ Rooney says. ‘But that doesn’t mean they can’t be defended.’" ...|$|E

40|$|To decarbonize {{the power}} sector {{policy-makers}} need {{to commit to}} long-term credible rules for climate and energy policy. Otherwise, time-inconsistent policy-making will impair investments into low-carbon technologies. However, the future benefits and costs of decarbonization are subject to substantial uncertainties. Thus, {{there may also be}} societal gains from allowing policy-makers the discretion to adjust the policies as new information becomes available. We examine how this trade-off between policy commitment and discretion affects the optimal intertemporal design of policies to support the deployment of renewable energy sources. Using a dynamic partial equilibrium model of the power sector, we show that commitment to state-contingent renewable subsidies outperforms both <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitment</b> and discretion. The choice between the practically more feasible approaches of <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitment</b> and discretion is analytically ambiguous. A numerical illustration with na assumptions suggests that policy discretion may outperform <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitment</b> in terms of welfare.

40|$|When {{mentoring}} programs are well-designed and well-implemented, {{young people can}} experience positive gains {{in a number of}} social, emotional, behavioral, and educational areas. While some of the processes underlying mentoring relationships have been explored, the voices and perspectives of participants themselves have thus far been largely excluded from the mentoring literature. The lack of participant voice in mentoring research suggests that an important source of empirical and interpretive information is unavailable to the field in the process of designing, implementing, and researching {{mentoring programs}}. This study used interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) to explore how youth participants in the Friends of the Children (FOTC) mentoring program experience and understand their long-term mentoring relationships. This study used an innovative approach to IPA that combines traditional phenomenological techniques with poetry writing as a key interpretive tool to explore the interplay between the content and meaning of participants 2 ̆ 7 experiences. IPA methods were used to collect and analyze interview data from 12 FOTC participants {{who had been in the}} program for more than ten years and who had the same mentor for at least the last four years. Participants were selected purposively to maximize the potential depth and richness of the data. The study included several elements to ensure trustworthiness, including a reflexivity journal, an audit trail, and member checking. Findings suggest that for the participants in this study, long-term mentoring relationships meant: 1) <b>unconditional</b> support and <b>commitment,</b> 2) consistent and reliable help in difficult situations, 3) the chance to develop and appreciate one 2 ̆ 7 s own identity, and 4) a path to expanded opportunities in many facets of life. Subthemes within each category are described and interpreted.

We exemplify {{the usefulness of}} our compiler by providing two (constant-round) instantiations of ideal straight-line extractable commitment based on (malicious) PUFs [36] and stateless tamper-proof hardware tokens [26], therefore achieving the first unconditionally UC-secure commitment with malicious PUFs and stateless tokens, respectively. Our constructions are secure for adversaries creating arbitrarily malicious stateful PUFs/tokens. Previous results with malicious PUFs used either computational assumptions to achieve UC-secure commitments or were unconditionally secure {{but only in the}} indistinguishability sense [36]. Similarly, with stateless tokens, UC-secure commitments are known only under computational assumptions [13, 24, 15], while the (not UC) <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitment</b> scheme of [23] is secure only in a weaker model in which the adversary is not allowed to create stateful tokens. Besides allowing us to prove feasibility of unconditional UC-security with (malicious) PUFs and stateless tokens, our compiler can be instantiated with any ideal straight-line extractable commitment scheme, thus allowing the use of various setup assumptions which may better fit the application or the technology available...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} initial {{evidence that}} “devoted actors” who are unconditionally {{committed to a}} sacred cause, {{as well as to}} their comrades, willingly make costly sacrifices, including fighting and dying. Although American military analysts since WWII tend to attribute fighting spirit to leadership and the bond of comradeship in combat as a manifestation of rational self-interest, evidence also suggests that sacrifice for a cause in ways independent, or all out of proportion, from the reasonable likelihood of success may be critical. Here, we show the first empirical evidence that sacred values (as when land or law becomes holy or hallowed) and identity fusion (when personal and group identities collapse into a unique identity to generate a collective sense of invincibility and special destiny) can interact to produce willingness to make costly sacrifices for a primary reference group: by looking at the relative strength of the sacred values of Sharia versus Democracy among potential foreign fighter volunteers from Morocco.

40|$|The Catholic Church's stated teachings on the {{interpretation}} of scripture provide a mandate for exegetes to interpret the biblical text {{in light of the}} historical-critical method, including attention to its literary genres, so as to yield findings that can {{contribute to the development of}} doctrine. With particular reference to myth, Catholic exegetes have adopted an understanding of the genre as the symbolic expression of limitations and possibilities that characterize the human experience, rather than a reconstruction, even in figurative terms, of specific historical events involving particular personages. In view of these hermeneutical considerations, this thesis proposes that the Church's presentation of the doctrine of Satan should be emancipated from a historicized interpretation that appeals to mythical narratives as though they affirm the existence and historical misdeeds of Satan as a particular ontological being. The myths that give rise to the doctrine of Satan have long explored possibilities in the relationship between the Creator and free-willed creatures. As such, the doctrine can be developed so as to express the possibility that a person might irrevocably reject God's invitation to friendship, and hence experience the condition traditionally referred to as 'hell', yet still be sustained by God's <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitment</b> to being...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the massive}} amount of {{attention}} paid to quality management in privately owned manufacturing and services firms and publicly owned organisations, few scholars have attempted to examine the application and outcomes of various quality-driven change initiatives {{in the context of}} voluntary sector organisations. This paper reports on the application of quality management programmes in terms of logic of adoption, implementation decisions and the resultant performance outcomes in a sample of voluntary sector organisations. Using a multiple case study design of three firms, the findings largely support the view that initiating quality-oriented change programmes poses a unique challenge to the management on two fronts: first, management logic and understanding for adopting quality initiatives, and the ability of the management to appreciate the synergetic relationship between efficiency gains and legitimacy concerns so that a continuous learning environment will follow. Drawing on insights from institutional theory literature, we shed light on the complexities inherent in the sector that necessitate a reappraisal of the logic of quality initiatives adoption, which in turn create a dilemma and indeed build resistance for the management to embody an <b>unconditional</b> <b>commitment</b> to the strategic importance of quality.
