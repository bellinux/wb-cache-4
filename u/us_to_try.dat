[...] Hoeppel offered to enter the Democratic primary {{in exchange for a}} payment of several hundred dollars plus the promise of a civil service job once the Republican was elected. After consulting with his aides, Nixon turned him down. Subsequently, Hoeppel filed as a Prohibition Party candidate. Voorhis was privy to these events through an informant close to the former representative, and was convinced that Roy Day had arranged to pay Hoeppel's filing fee. [...] The congressman feared that Hoeppel would serve as a stalking horse for Nixon, sparing the Republican from any [...] "mudslinging". [...] Voorhis responded to Hoeppel's filing with a letter to his campaign manager, Baldwin Park realtor Jack Long, stating that [...] "it would be worthwhile for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> our level best to beat him in the Prohibition primary by a write-in campaign".|$|E
2500|$|Talking about Chris Taylor's production, Rossen stated, [...] "Part of his {{strength}} {{is that he}} pushes us. [...] He enables <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> stranger stuff; he pushes us to that side of ourselves. [...] He's always thinking of the whole palette, I feel, whereas Ed and I might be more worried about a melody or a lyric." [...] The album was mixed by Michael Brauer.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, Ed Droste {{described}} Shields as Grizzly Bear's [...] "most verbose album" [...] yet, noting, [...] "It's funny, because I {{think back}} to a song like [...] "Colorado", where I was basically singing ten words {{over and over again}} for five minutes straight – and that's it. There's nothing on this album like that. There's a lot more there, verbally, and it's definitely emotionally charged." [...] Bassist and producer, Chris Taylor stated, [...] "For this record, it was really important to <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and make sure that lyrics had a weight to them and at least some sense of a narrative, even if it was loose. There were lyrics in previous albums that seemed to have no meaning whatsoever. And that always really annoyed me. We agreed it'd be really important and awesome if we could just try and make all the lyrics tell something. [...] I was definitely able to use lyrics as a frame to how I would let the arrangements build and then fall away." ...|$|E

In the following January he was equally successful and, to fulfill his obligations to write music for Catania—a condition of his scholarship—he sent a Messa di gloria which was performed the following October. His involvement in Zingarelli's class took place over the 1822/23 school year. By January 1824, after passing examinations where he did very well, resulted in his being given the title of primo maestrino, a post which required him to tutor younger students, allowed him to have a room of his own in the Collegio, and also allowed him visits to the opera on Thursdays and Sundays, where he saw his first opera by Rossini, Semiramide. While Weinstock gives an account of how he was [...] "clearly captivated by the music of Rossini... he put Rossini on a pedestal", he relates that, returning from the performance Bellini was unusually quiet and then [...] "suddenly exclaimed to his companions, 'Do you know what I think? After Semiramide, it's futile for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and achieve anything' [...] " ...|$|E
