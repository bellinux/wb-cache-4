He criticized Sam Fisher's new voice actor, who he thought failed to replicate Ironside's charm. Ben Reeves praised the story's plot twists and sympathetic characters. On the Joystiq blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative <b>urgency</b> <b>and</b> engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending. Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character. Eurogamer Bramwell also criticized the game's lack of character development.|$|E
5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of <b>urgency</b> <b>and</b> the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E

5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the <b>urgency</b> <b>and</b> significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E

30|$|Lung {{cancer is}} very common, {{accounting}} for 17 % and 9 % of all cancers {{in men and}} women, respectively [1]. Furthermore, lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer, representing 19 % of all cancer-related deaths. The disease course in lung cancer is generally characterised by high morbidity and complications, {{some of which are}} acute and potentially life-threatening. An oncological emergency can be defined as an acute, potentially life-threatening condition in a cancer patient, either as a direct or indirect effect of the underlying malignancy or secondary to its treatment, requiring rapid intervention to avoid death or severe morbidity. <b>Urgencies</b> <b>and</b> emergencies differ in the severity of the consequences of a delay in treatment. Oncological emergencies can occur {{at any time during the}} course of a malignancy and can be the initial manifestation in some patients [2]. The causes of oncological <b>urgencies</b> <b>and</b> emergencies are myriad. While metabolic, infectious and haematological emergencies are primarily diagnosed by the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, thoracic, neurological and musculoskeletal emergencies often require imaging studies. The aim of this pictorial review is to identify <b>and</b> discuss these <b>urgencies</b> <b>and</b> emergencies in which radiologists play an important role and can have a significant impact on patient management and prognosis. The contribution of imaging in <b>urgencies</b> <b>and</b> emergencies goes beyond making the initial diagnosis, as imaging can also play a role in the planning of treatment and follow-up after treatment.|$|R

30|$|Lung cancer {{patients}} often experience potentially life-threatening medical <b>urgencies</b> <b>and</b> emergencies, {{which may be}} a direct or indirect result of the underlying malignancy. This pictorial review addresses the most common thoracic, neurological and musculoskeletal medical emergencies in lung {{cancer patients}}, including superior vena cava syndrome, pulmonary embolism, spontaneous pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, massive haemoptysis, central airway obstruction, oesophagorespiratory fistula, malignant spinal cord compression, carcinomatous meningitis, cerebral herniation and pathological fracture. Emphasis is placed on imaging findings, the role of different imaging techniques and a brief discussion of epidemiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic options.

25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Kenneth Frampton's Modern Architecture: A Critical History (first edition 1980) {{there has been a}} keen consciousness of the role of criticism within architectural theory. Whilst referencing Derrida as a philosophical influence, deconstructivism can also be seen as having as much a basis in critical theory as the other major offshoot of postmodernism, critical regionalism. The two aspects of critical theory, <b>urgency</b> <b>and</b> analysis, are found in deconstructivism. There is a tendency to re-examine and critique other works or precedents in deconstructivism, and also a tendency to set aesthetic issues in the foreground. An example of this is the Wexner Center. Critical Theory, however, had at its core a critique of capitalism and its excess, and from that respect many of the works of the Deconstructivists would fail in that regard if only they are made for an elite and are, as objects, highly expensive, despite whatever critique they may claim to impart on the conventions of design.|$|E
25|$|This {{could be}} a reason why {{environmental}} Kuznets curves {{have been found to}} be applicable to only certain types of pollutants. Yandle et al. argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater <b>urgency</b> <b>and</b> response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a tragedy of the commons where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and for no one to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in a country like the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{has urged}} India to decriminalise {{homosexuality}} by {{saying it would}} help the fight against HIV/AIDS by allowing intervention programmes, much like the successful ones in China and Brazil. Jeffrey O'Malley, director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on HIV/AIDS, has stated countries which protect {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) have double the rate of coverage of HIV prevention services as much as 60%. According to him, inappropriate criminalisation hinders universal access to essential HIV, health and social services. Later talking to The Hindu in November 2008, he added concerns that the then in power United Progressive Alliance government was in a difficult position in regards to amending Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code because of the then upcoming elections, as such changes could be misrepresented. He further emphasised the need to change the laws, sensitise the police and judiciary. According to him, after removal of discriminatory laws, marginalised groups would have better access to treatment and prevention facilities like condoms. He warned of the <b>urgency</b> <b>and</b> stated that India had succeeded in checking the spread of AIDS through commercial sex workers but transmission through gay sex, and injectable-drug users was still an area of concern in the country.|$|E
40|$|Severe acute {{arterial}} hypertension is usually defined as ‘hypertensive crisis’, although ‘hypertensive emergencies’ or ‘hypertensive urgencies’, {{as suggested by}} the Joint National Committee and the European Society of Hypertension, have completely different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

25|$|The {{expanded}} 30th anniversary {{edition of}} the 1965 official book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, was notable for its exclusion {{of most of the}} evidence against the map's authenticity, concentrating instead on vindications by George Painter, and Thomas Cahill with colleague Bruce Kusko (in which they claimed specifically that they had not analyzed the loose particles they took from the map {{at the time of their}} PIXE research), but it did reprint a remarkable essay written in 1989 by the original book dealer Laurence Witten. He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of <b>urgency,</b> <b>and</b> to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon's money. He replied that he had no idea where the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay it all back because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli's recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.|$|E
