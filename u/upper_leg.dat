5|$|Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent {{from central}} and southeastern Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1903, it {{is larger than}} its close relative, the living Hypogeomys antimena, which occurs further west, but otherwise similar. Average length of the femur (<b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> bone) is 72.1mm, compared to 63.8mm in H.antimena. One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar, it survived to at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating. Little is known of its ecology, but it may have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid-adapted plants.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, van Grunsven {{sustained}} a fracture of a bone in her <b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> {{in a fall}} from a horse in training, and required surgery. A metal plate was embedded in her leg to immobilize the bone during the healing process, and van Grunsven recovered, winning the 2003 Dutch Dressage Championships in June. In September, she underwent a second surgery to have the plate removed. In 2004, {{she became the first}} Dutch rider to win the CHIO Aachen dressage competition, a top international competition.|$|E
5|$|Thescelosaurus {{would have}} browsed {{in the first}} meter or so from the ground, feeding selectively, with food held in the mouth by cheeks while chewing. Thescelosaurus was {{probably}} slower than other hypsilophodonts, because of its heavier build and leg structure. Compared to them, it had unusual hindlimbs, because the <b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> was longer than the shin, the opposite of Hypsilophodon and running animals in general. One specimen {{is known to have}} had a bone pathology, with the long bones of the right foot fused at their tops, hindering swift movement.|$|E

5|$|At 10:23, {{the judge}} raised a {{security}} alarm. Judicial officers, {{and a federal}} police officer {{who was in the}} court building testifying in an unrelated case, arrived at the scene; however, during the ongoing commotion the police officer mistook Okaz for the attacker and shot him in the <b>upper</b> <b>leg.</b> Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was the assailant. While under arrest, Wiens resisted and begged the police officer to shoot him dead. Okaz, critically wounded in the stabbing attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries. El-Sherbini died in the court building at 11:07, succumbing to her injuries.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis was {{described}} in 1903 by Guillaume Grandidier from subfossil material collected in the cave of Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar. The Hypogeomys material {{was similar to the}} living Hypogeomys antimena, but distinct enough for Grandidier to recognize it as a separate species, different in size and some morphological details. Grandidier described another subfossil Hypogeomys species in 1912, H.boulei, but the material that species was based on was later identified as the enigmatic mammal Plesiorycteropus. In 1946, Charles Lamberton illustrated another femur (<b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> bone) of H.australis; the origin and current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown. In 1996, Steven Goodman and Daniel Rakotondravony reviewed the distribution of Hypogeomys and confirmed that H.australis is a distinct species. H.australis and H.antimena are classified together within the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter. The ears mostly lack hair and {{end in a}} rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is thin for most of its length, ends in an angular tip, and has a flange at the medial side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and are attached to the <b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus aelleni is a small, brown Miniopterus species. The head may be {{slightly}} lighter in color than the body. Some {{hairs on the}} underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus griveaudi is similar in color, but M.manavi is darker and M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis are lighter. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, the base is narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, the sides of the tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the <b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus brachytragos is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with short}} and {{relatively}} thin fur. The fur of the upperparts is dark brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus mahafaliensis is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is short and has a broad base, sometimes with a crest at the side. It ends in a pointed to slightly rounded tip, which is covered with hairs that are not readily visible to the unaided eye. The short tragus easily distinguishes M.brachytragos from other Malagasy Miniopterus. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the <b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side. M.manavi and M.mahafaliensis also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with long}} and dense fur. The fur of the upperparts is brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray tips.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{protocol}} for diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) {{of the complete}} <b>upper</b> <b>legs</b> and to demonstrate feasibility of detection of subclinical sports-related muscle changes in athletes after strenuous exercise, which remain undetected by using conventional T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with fat suppression. Materials and Methods: The research {{was approved by the}} institutional ethics committee review board, and the volunteers provided written consent before the study. Five male amateur long-distance runners underwent an MR examination (DTI, T 1 -weighted MR imaging, and T 2 -weighted MR imaging with fat suppression) of both <b>upper</b> <b>legs</b> 1 week before, 2 days after, and 3 weeks after they participated in a marathon. The tensor eigenvalues (lambda(1), lambda(2), and lambda(3)), the mean diffusivity, and the fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the DTI data. Data per muscle from the three time-points were compared by using a two-way mixed-design analysis of variance with a Bonferroni posthoc test. Results: The DTI protocol allowed imaging of both complete <b>upper</b> <b>legs</b> with adequate signal-to-noise ratio and within a 20 -minute imaging time. After the marathon, T 2 -weighted MR imaging revealed grade 1 muscle strains in nine of the 180 investigated muscles. The three eigenvalues, mean diffusivity, and FA were significantly increased (P <. 05) in the biceps femoris muscle 2 days after running. Mean diffusivity and eigenvalues lambda(1) and lambda(2) were significantly (P <. 05) increased in the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles 2 days after the marathon. Conclusion: A feasible method for DTI measurements of the <b>upper</b> <b>legs</b> was developed that fully included frequently injured muscles, such as hamstrings, in one single imaging session. This study also revealed changes in DTI parameters that over time were not revealed by qualitative T 2 -weighted MR imaging with fat suppression. (C) RSNA, 201...|$|R
5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the <b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E

He swore the National Socialist {{oath of allegiance}} on 21 April 1936. Flight training began on Monday, 7 August 1936 at Gatow. His first flight was in a Heinkel He 72 Kadet D-EYZA single engine biplane. Lent logged his first solo flight on 15 September 1936 in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz. By this time, Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his logbook. In conjunction with flight training, the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars and during one of these training exercises, Lent {{was involved in a}} road accident, breaking his <b>upper</b> <b>leg</b> badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months. This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937, after taking his commission examination, he was promoted to Fähnrich. On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A/B License. He earned his wings on 15 November 1937. On 1 February 1938, he was promoted to Oberfähnrich (first ensign), and on 1 March 1938 to Leutnant. By this time, he had made 434 flights in eight different types of aircraft and had accumulated 112 hours and 48 minutes flying time, mostly in daylight flights, in single engine training aircraft.|$|E
