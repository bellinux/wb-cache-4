40|$|First-principles {{calculations}} employing density functional theory (DFT) {{were performed}} on the energetic materials PETN, HMX, RDX, nitromethane, and a recently discovered material, nitrate ester 1 (NEST- 1). The aims {{of the study were}} to accurately predict the isothermal equation of state for each material, improve the description of these molecular crystals in DFT by introducing a correction for dispersion interactions, and perform <b>uniaxial</b> <b>compressions</b> to investigate physical properties that might contribute to anisotropic sensitivity. For each system, hydrostatic-compression simulations were performed. Important properties calculated from the simulations such as the equilibrium structure, isothermal equation of state, and bulk moduli were compared with available experimental data to assess the agreement of the calculation method. The largest contribution to the error was believed to be caused by a poor description of van der Waals (vdW) interactions within the DFT formalism. An empirical van der Waals correction to DFT was added to VASP to increase agreement with experiment. The average agreement of the calculated unit-cell volumes for six energetic crystals improved from approximately 9 % to 2 %, and the isothermal EOS showed improvement for PETN, HMX, RDX, and nitromethane. A comparison was made between DFT results with and without the vdW correction to identify possible advantages and limitations. ï»¿ <b>Uniaxial</b> <b>compressions</b> perpendicular to seven low-index crystallographic planes {{were performed on}} PETN, HMX, RDX, nitromethane, and NEST- 1. The principal stresses, shear stresses, and band gaps for each direction were compared with available experimental information on shock-induced sensitivity to determine possible correlations between physical properties and sensitivity. The results for PETN, the only system for which the anisotropic sensitivity has been thoroughly investigated by experiment, indicated a possible correlation between maximum shear stress and sensitivity. The <b>uniaxial</b> <b>compressions</b> that corresponded to the greatest maximum shear stresses in HMX, RDX, solid nitromethane, and NEST- 1 were identified and predicted as directions with possibly greater sensitivity.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{deformation}} {{and failure}} mechanisms in polycrystalline ceramics are investigated through constitutive modeling and numerical simulation. Two ceramics are studied: silicon carbide (SiC, hexagonal crystal structure) and aluminum oxynitride (AlON, cubic crystal structure). Three dimensional finite element simulations incorporate nonlinear anisotropic elasticity for behavior of single crystals within polycrystalline aggregates, cohesive zone models for intergranular fracture, and contact interactions among fractured interfaces. Boundary conditions considered include <b>uniaxial</b> strain <b>compression,</b> <b>uniaxial</b> stress <b>compression,</b> and shear with varying confinement, all at high loading rates. Results for both materials demonstrate shear-induced dilatation and increasing shear strength with increasing confining pressure. Failure statistics for unconfined loading exhibit a smaller Weibull modulus (corresponding to greater scatter in peak failure strength) in AlON than in SiC, likely {{a result of}} lower prescribed cohesive fracture strength and greater elastic anisotropy in the former. In both materials, the predicted Weibull modulus tends to decrease with {{an increasing number of}} grains contained in the simulated microstructure...|$|R

The particle rotations are quantitatively characterized, for <b>uniaxial</b> tension, <b>compression,</b> torsion, and notch-tension test specimens strained to different strain levels. The particle rotations are monitored by measuring the morphological orientation distribution function of the particles. Significant particle rotations occur under all loading conditions. The morphological orientation distribution function evolves with plastic strain under <b>uniaxial</b> tension, <b>compression,</b> and torsion. The particles tend to align themselves in the direction parallel to applied (or induced) tensile stress for deformation under tension and compression.
