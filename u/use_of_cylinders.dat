40|$|Invention {{of oxygen}} {{cylinder}} {{was one of}} the most important developments in the field of medical practice. Oxygen and other gases were compressed and stored at high pressure in seamless containers constructed from hand-forged steel in 1880. Materials technology has continued to evolve and now medical gas cylinders are generally made of steel alloys or aluminum. The filling pressure as well as capacity has increased considerably while at the same time the weight of cylinders has reduced. Today oxygen cylinder of equivalent size holds a third more oxygen but weighs about 20 kg less. The cylinders are of varying sizes and are color coded. They are tested at regular intervals by the manufacturer using hydraulic, impact, and tensile tests. The top end of the cylinder is fitted with a valve with a variety of number and markings stamped on it. Common valve types include: Pin index valve, bull nose, hand wheel and integral valve. The type of valve varies with cylinder size. Small cylinders have a pin index valve while large have a bull nose type. Safety features in the cylinder are: Color coding, pin index, pressure relief device, Bodok seal, and label attached etc., Safety rules and guidelines must be followed during storage, installation and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> to ensure safety of patients, hospital personnel and the environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} {{testing procedure}} of concrete compression strength {{is by the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> or cubes, tested at an age of 28 days. According to the PBI 1971 -NI- 2 Code for Reinforced Concrete (Peraturan Beton Bertulang Indonesia) the specimens are 150 x 150 x 150 mm in size, while SNI uses the 150 x 300 mm cylinders. These two approaches results in a different characterizing of concrete compression strength. Cubes give a K value, and cylinders results in a f’c value. In practice, the concrete industries frequently make us of non-standardized molts. Cubes ranging from 100 x 100 x 100 mm to 200 x 200 x 200 mm are detected, while cylinders can have various dimensions, especially when originating from onthe- field sample taking with a core-drill. The question then arises, how the dimension and specimens shape is influencing the measured compressive strength. This research work was conducted to give a better understanding {{to the influence of}} variations in both dimension and shape to the standard specimens described by the code. For experimental use, cylinders of 110 x 220 mm were tested and compared to standard cylinders, and cubes 100 x 100 x 100 mm were compared to standard cubes. The test results were also evaluated against former research results. Generally, it can be concluded that the measured compression strength of cubes increase as a function of size decrease. For cylinders however, the opposite hold, and the compression strength of the smaller cylinders tent to be lower then the standard specimens. Shape correlation between cylinder and cube showed that compression strength values of cubes were higher than cylinders strength values.

Zeitschrift fuer Physikalische Chemie, Stoechiometrie und Verwandtschaftslehre (1894), 15, 65 - 78; SciFinder (Chemical Abstracts Service: Columbus, OH); [URL] (accessed July 8, 2010). Many metals, when {{heated to}} {{temperatures}} considerably below their melting points, exhibit properties {{characteristic of the}} liquid state. For examination in this respect, the metals were turned into cylinders with ends as perfectly plane as possible, and placed end to end in an iron holder, pressure being applied by a screw. They were heated in this condition in a hot air bath, filled, if necessary, with an indifferent gas. Cylinders of aluminium, bismuth, cadmium, copper, tin, gold, lead, zinc, antimony, and platinum were employed, {{and in the first}} experiment two cylinders of the same metal were used. The temperature was kept for from 4 to 8 hours at from 200 ° to 400 °, and it was found that, except in the case of antimony and platinum, the cylinders had alloyed so perfectly that they could be turned with one end fixed in a lathe, whilst if broken in a vice the fracture did not take place along the original surface of separation. Pairs of different metals were next employed, usually copper or lead with some of the other metals, with the result that, at the junction, an alloy of considerable thickness was formed, 18 mm. in the case of zinc and copper, and 15 mm. in the case of cadmium and copper. In the case of lead and tin, a cavity in the end of one metal was filled with mica, so that contact only took place at the edge. An alloy was formed to the thickness of 15 mm., of which 9 mm. were in the tin and 6 mm. in the lead. By the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> of copper and zinc, in which, owing to a central cavity, contact only took place at the edges, {{it was found that the}} surface of the copper above the cavity was coloured by a yellow alloy resembling that formed when copper is subjected to the action of zinc vapour, and which was not due to diffusion from the edges (see also Abstracts, 1893, ii, 168). For the explanation of these results, which are most marked with soft and non-crystalline metals, the author points out the assumption suffices, that the molecules of solids, like those of fluids, do not all move with the same velocity.

40|$|The peer-reviewed {{publications}} {{contained within}} this thesis describe {{studies that have}} {{contributed significantly to the}} understanding of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for Australian Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. My personal contribution to each of these studies ranged from the initial development of the hypotheses and design and execution of the investigations, submission of research grants applications to fund the studies through to preparation of the manuscripts for publication. When LTOT was first introduced into Australia I was fortunate to meet the key experts in LTOT including Professors Tom Petty, Nick Anthonisen, David Flenley, Pierre Levi-Valensi and Peter Howard. At that time all were involved in randomised controlled trials of oxygen therapy. (1, 2), 3). I also visited several oxygen concentrator and oxygen supply companies in the USA and UK. It was during these visits that I became convinced that the concentrator provided a more economical and efficient method of LTOT delivery. In 1980, an oxygen concentrator was imported to Australia by the spouse of one of our patients suffering from emphysema who was receiving long term oxygen via cylinders In 1982, two oxygen concentrators were donated to FMC by two different manufacturers (DeVilbis and Marx) based in the USA. These instruments were trialled on a male and female patient receiving LTOT in the Southern Adelaide metropolitan area. The initial acceptance of this device by these patients led to a submission to the South Australian Department of Health for a grant to purchase 40 units. Funds were finally obtained for the purchase of 34 concentrators by FMC and these were rolled out to the then existing patients who were receiving LTOT in 1984. Up to this point in time the only published guidelines or recommendations for LTOT came from the American College of Chest Physicians in 1973 (3) and the American Thoracic Society in 1977 (4). In 1982, the staff of the Respiratory Unit, FMC held a workshop where it was agreed that patients' would be assessed for home oxygen therapy using the 1977 American Thoracic Society Guideline. The late Professor Ann Woolcock presented a paper during a 1983 symposium titled "Long Term Oxygen Therapy: A World View" during a 1983 symposium held in Toronto, Canada where she estimated that at that time 2, 100 patients were receiving oxygen in New South Wales for an average of 1 hour per day. She further reported that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> ranged from 1 cylinder a year to 14 cylinders per week. Physicians were reported to have been conservative in their approach to oxygen therapy and that only 50 people were on long term oxygen therapy in New South Wales. Presumably the vast majority of these patients were receiving intermittent oxygen therapy. Woolcock mentioned that oxygen concentrators were available but provided no specific detail of their use in Australia(5). The first Australian guideline for the provision of domiciliary long-term oxygen therapy appeared in 1985. This guideline was developed {{at the request of the}} Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand. 6). In the same year I published my first paper relating to the provision of oxygen therapy via an oxygen concentrator based on our initial experiences with this technology(7). In the following year I published a paper documenting the analysis of the costs for providing home oxygen therapy. I also reported how Cost-Centre Management led to the introduction of practical measures for improved clinical decision making and improved expenditure control resulting in substantial cost savings(8). This publication led to a paper reporting the rationalization of the supply of home oxygen in the Hunter region of New South Wales. (9). This paper also reported the one to five year survival rates for their patients. At that time only between 5 and 12 % of patients were receiving LTOT oxygen via an oxygen concentrator. At best, oxygen therapy is cumbersome with the patient 'tethered' to the oxygen source that, in the past, limited the movement of the patient due to the size and weight of the oxygen cylinders. Oxygen concentrators provided a partial answer to these problems. The introduction of this new technology led to ongoing evaluation of the impact on patient care and acceptance of the intervention and whether the expected outcomes increased survival and quality of life, were achieved(10). In 1991 I published the first detailed Australian data on survival for patients receiving home oxygen therapy. The results of this study indicated that the mortality rate for COPD with respiratory failure at 1 year was twice the rate reported by the Medical Research Council Working Party and the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy multicentre trials. This was in spite of the baseline physiological parameters for our patients being similar to the patients in these benchmark studies. I was later able to show that survival of our long term oxygen patients was no better than the control group of the original MRC study(11 - 13). The second significant observation was that females survived longer than males(14). In 1992 a further paper was published and reported that in spite of strict prescription criteria and the introduction of a cost-saving new technology oxygen concentrators, the budget for this intervention remained under pressure. This was largely due to a rapidly increasing demand from eligible patients(10). A further analysis of the longitudinal data resulted in a report of an association between home oxygen therapy with a reduction in respiratory admissions and bed days(15). At this time there was a relative paucity of information about the trends of mortality in COPD in Australia. To further understand the burden of disease (COPD) and changing trends in mortality over time a research project was undertaken that indicating that the mortality of females from COPD was increasing whilst it was decreasing in males(16). The relatively poor survival outcomes for our home oxygen patients prompted further attempts to understand the costs and benefits in terms of quality of life and the evaluation of two generic health related quality of life questionnaires available at that time (1996). The results of the study suggested that the sole use of the SF- 36 as a health outcome measure in COPD patients might fail to provide information about the mental domains of their quality of life. Decreased cognitive function, anxiety and depression were shown in Australian COPD patients(17). A series of papers published in Europe describing the observations made on Australian home oxygen patients were published between 1996 and 2000 at the request of the International Oxygen Club. The membership of this club included Professors Tom Petty, David Flenley, Pierre Levi-Valensi, Peter Howard, Heinrich Matthys and Roland Keller(11, 18, 19, 20). Further attempts to rationally allocate resources in the management of COPD in the acute care setting were reported in 1999 using Program Budgeting and Marginal Analysis. (21). I undertook a systematic Cochrane Review of the five randomized controlled trials of the use of home or long term oxygen therapy in COPD demonstrating that this intervention improved survival in a selected group of severely hypoxaemic COPD patients (22). However, this intervention does not appear to provide any benefit for patients with moderate hypoxaemia or nocturnal desaturation. (20) This review has been translated into several languages and is cited as the basis of many of the more recent guidelines regarding LTOT. More recently a NH&MRC funded study report was published reviewing the impact of evidence based clinical practice concerning LTOT. This report resulted in several peer reviewed papers being published where we explored the relationship between the evidence and the observed outcomes in terms of both survival and quality of life(13, 23, 24). Finally, we conducted a study of the relative survival of our patients compared to those patients with similar characteristics in France. We demonstrated that our patients' relative survival was less than their French counterparts(25). At the time of publication this was only the second paper to be ever-published using relative survival analysis in COPD and the first in Australia. This difference is hard to explain by the level of severity, number of pack years or level of lung function impairment. Other possible factors contributing to the excess mortality in South Australian COPD patients need to be investigated. Thesis (Ph. D.)
