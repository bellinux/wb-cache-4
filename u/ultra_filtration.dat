50|$|Ultrafiltered milk (UF milk), {{also known}} as diafiltered milk, is a subclassification of milk protein {{concentrate}} that is produced by passing milk under pressure through a thin, porous membrane to separate the components of milk according to their size. Specifically, <b>ultra</b> <b>filtration</b> allows the smaller lactose, water, mineral, and vitamin molecules {{to pass through the}} membrane, while the larger protein and fat molecule (key components for making cheese) are retained and concentrated. (Depending on the intended use of the UF milk product, the fat in whole milk may be removed before filtration.) The removal of water and lactose reduces the volume of milk, and thereby lowers its transportation and storage costs. Ultrafiltration makes cheese manufacturing more efficient and can benefit consumers if cost savings are passed on. However, U.S. milk producers are concerned that imported UF milk may displace domestically produced milk used to make cheese.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the {{population}} and domestic industrialization activities have resulted in wastewater production; one of the significant harmful impacts towards the environment. Textile industries have been recognized to be among the largest water consumers amid the industries, as well as hazardous wastewater generators. Furthermore, as a result of regional cultural preferences, popular particular textile industries like batik, in South East Asian regions especially in Malaysia, discharge untreated wastewaters, which contain mainly wax, resin, dyes and fixing agents (sodium silicates) directly to the environment. Accordingly, this study has been conducted to investigate the application of hybrid membrane filtration to treat batik wastewaters. This study consists of the combination of two main treatments namely; the baffle separation tank pre-treatment followed by <b>ultra</b> and nano <b>filtration</b> membranes. The former was applied to remove all undesired physical contaminants from batik wastewaters before the main conventional treatment technique – the hybrid membrane treatment – for removing chemical and physical contaminants from different simulated batik wastewaters. Single and multi-premixed textile fibre reactive dyes namely Remazol turquoise blue 15, Remazol red 194, Remazol yellow 14, Reactive orange 16 and Reactive black 5 with invariant value concentration (16 mg/L), constant value of paraffin wax and resin (7. 7 g/L) and sodium silicate (1 g/L) were used. The performance of the hybrid system was evaluated based on wax and heavy metal removal efficiency (%) and rejection of dyes and sodium silicate using COD, pH and conductivity as the indicator parameters. Membrane flux and fouling behaviour in both <b>ultra</b> and nano <b>filtration</b> were investigated. The membrane surface was observed using FESEM technique. Moreover, HPLC tests were used to help verify the achieved results from other analytical methods. The results showed that wax removal efficiency achieved in all the samples from pre-treatment and UF stages was more than 99 %. Complete dye rejection in all dye solution samples was achieved. The sodium silicate rejection rate in both single and mixture dye samples were in the range of 45 % - 60 %. Concentration of heavy metals and COD values in the permeates declined significantly (reached almost total rejection) as compared to the feed solution. The comparison of pH and conductivity values between the feed and permeate samples after each treatment cycle represented distinct decline changes, which were in agreement with the other achieved results (range between 7. 2 and 7. 7; and < 90. 3 S/cm respectively). The achieved results concluded that the presented hybrid membrane treatment technique leads to a higher efficiency rate while remarkably reducing the operational processing time.

40|$|Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} solid malignancy among males in economically developed countries and the third leading {{cause of cancer death}} in males. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing has increased PCa detection. However, one of the main drawbacks has been its low specificity causing over diagnosis and overtreatment. This emphasizes the need for additional markers, preferably non-invasive, to identify men at high risk of clinically significant PCa. Therefore this study investigates known and new biomarkers in two urinary fractions. Methods: Urine samples were collected before and after digital rectal examination (DRE) from men who were selected for prostate biopsies based on elevated serum PSA levels (≥ 3 ng/mL) and/or abnormal DRE. Two urinary fractions, exosomes and celpellets, were isolated by <b>ultra</b> centrifugation and <b>filtration.</b> After RNA extraction and whole transcript amplification the expression level of several biomarkers were measured by real-time PCR (q-PCR) : PCA 3, TMPRSS 2 -ERG, PSA, HPRT and three recently discovered biomarkers: NGPCBM 19, NGPCBM 8, and NGPCBM 14. The quantity of these biomarkers was compared between samples taken before and after DRE, and their diagnostic performance was analysed in both urinary fractions. Results: 31 patients (14 positive, 16 negative, 1 without biopsies) were included. Five celpellets were excluded because of deposits and 13 (10 pre-, 3 post DRE) because the samples were non-evaluable. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) in biomarker expression were found between samples taken before and after DRE for PSA, HPRT, PCA 3 and NGPCBM 14 in celpellets and additionally for NGPCBM 8 in the exosomes. ROC-curves showed a good diagnostic performance of the biomarkers in the celpellets after DRE (AUC 0. 616 - 0. 835). In the exosomes, PSA and HPRT showed an inverse correlation (AUC 0. 279 and 0. 135) with positive biopsy outcomes, the other biomarkers showed no diagnostic correlation (AUC 0. 464 - 0. 577). Conclusion: All biomarkers can be measured in the exosomes and performing a DRE is essential. The diagnostic performance of these biomarkers in the exosomes is different from the celpellet, thus their diagnostic contribution remains unknown. But because exosomes have different advantages over celpellets, it makes them an interesting candidate for future biomarker research. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{filtering}} {{properties of}} membranes in the <b>ultra</b> and nano <b>filtration</b> range cannot only {{be derived from}} a pure sieving effect. With decreasing membrane pore size the surface charge of the membranes and the charge d. {{become more and more}} important with regard to its retention and selectivity. Typical parameters like permeate flux and retention of salt ions, particles or mols. are governed by a so-called effective pore diam. depending on the surface charge and the thickness of the electrochem. double layer on the pore walls. Fouling mechanisms, i. e., cake forming and pore blocking, which cause a permeate flux decline in the filtration process are also strongly influenced by the surface charge of the membrane. In the case of liq. satd. oxide ceramic membranes, a surface charge results from dissocd. surface groups and adsorbed charge-detg. ions. Ceramic ultrafiltration membranes made of TiO 2, ZrO 2,. alpha. - and. gamma. -Al 2 O 3 were investigated by streaming potential measurements. For these measurements an Electrokinetic Analyzer EKA from Anton Paar, Austria, was used. The membranes were characterized by a tangential flow method, i. e., an electrolyte soln. is forced through a narrow slit formed by the surfaces of two similar membranes which are positioned facing one another. In this way the dependence of the surface charge on the pH was shown. Using the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation the surface charge d. can be expressed by the. zeta. -potential. The permeate fluxes of polyethylenimine solns. and dextrane solns. through the membranes in a dead-end filtration process at different pH-values were investigated by means of a filtration testing device. The pH values chosen for these expts. result either in a high pos., a high neg. or in a net zero charge of the appropriate membrane material. The abs. permeate flux and its drop with increasing filtering time strongly depend on the charge conditions of the membrane surface and the charge of the particles, mols. or ions in the feed soln. Improved filtering conditions can be achieved if the membrane and the content of the feed soln. show a similar charge, since the electrostatic repulsion decelerates the formation of a flux reducing fouling layer on the membrane surface...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a control {{strategy}} is formulated that minimizes the costs {{for a single}} chemical cleaning of a dead-end <b>ultra</b> <b>filtration</b> membrane. From the process model, the performance index and the constraints it can be derived that dynamic optimization {{will lead to a}} ‘maximum effort control problem’, in which the controls (cleaning flow and cleaning agent concentration) are either zero or maximum. The change from maximum to zero is called the switching point. This switching point depends on the overall cleaning time and the requested cleaning effectiveness. From the calculated optimal control strategy it follows that cleaning time can be significantly reduced, compared to conventional cleaning. ...|$|E
40|$|This Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) study compares {{two types}} of {{drinking}} water technologies; Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) technology and <b>Ultra</b> <b>Filtration</b> technology. The selected plant for this study has both types of technologies in use. Collected data are from the usage of electricity and chemicals used in the water treatment process. The Eco-Indicator 99 was chosen to indicate extent of damage from collected inventories. From the result of impact assessment conducted, {{it is found that}} Ultrafiltration technology contributes higher impact to all three categories of damages; damage to environmental quality, damage to human health and damage to source when this technology is compared to DAF technology.
