The Falcons drove into Tech territory, but the Hokies' defense forced the Falcons to punt near midfield, and Tech took over at 12:23 in the quarter at its 24-yard line after a short return. As had Air Force, Tech picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> first downs. But like Air Force, the opposition's defense forced a punt near midfield. Following the punt, Air Force took over at its 20-yard line with 9:09 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they would}} win the 1947–48 Sheffield Shield Western Australia were its weakest team (Tasmania was not yet included) and {{isolated}} {{from the rest of}} Australia, so they provided an easy start for the MCC's round of state matches. The WACA Ground would not see a Test match until the 1970-71 Ashes series. George Robinson won the toss for the home side and batted. Herbert Rigg (34) and Allan Edwards (43) made their first class debuts and added 76 for the first wicket. David Watt (85) and Morgan Herbet (53) made 118 for the fifth wicket as Peter Smith (4/132) and Doug Wright (4/55) trundled their way through the batting order. Bill Voce (2/75) picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> late wickets and Western Australia were out for 366 on the second morning. Gibb and Washbrook opened again, but it was Jack Ikin (66) and Joe Hardstaff (53) who made the early runs, followed by Wally Hammond's 208. This was Hammond's 36th double hundred, overtaking Don Bradman's record and this early indication of good form gave the Australians some worries (Bradman retook the record in 1947-48). He added 71 with Norman Yardley (31) and 149 with Smith (46) as the MCC made 477 in 478 minutes. Due to the rain this only left 46 minutes for the WA second innings and they made a safe 48/1. 19,500 people watched the game with £1,809 in receipts.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Gophers {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball on a chilly {{afternoon}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The stout Badgers defense would get right to work forcing a three–and–out. Wisconsin's first offensive play was a 49-yard run by RB James White down to the Minnesota 12-yard line. The Gopher defense would hold up and force Wisconsin to kick a 31-yard field goal by K Jack Russell. Minnesota would then punt again after only three offensive plays. Wisconsin moved the ball to about midfield but were forced to punt. The Golden Gophers took over at their own 4-yard line and picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> first downs but once again had to punt. The Badgers then had their own three–and–out and punting the ball back to the Gophers who took over right aroung midfield as the first quarter came to a close. On the first play of the second quarter, Minnesota QB Philip Nelson threw a 9-yard pass to WR Maxx Williams but the ball the stripped by Badgers S Nate Hammon and recovered by LB Derek Landisch at the Badgers 32-yard line. Three plays later, Wisconsin QB Joel Stave threw and interception to Gophers CB Aaron Hill who returned it 39 yards for a touchdown. Wisconsin would move the ball into Minnesota territory but were forced to punt it back to Minnesota. The Golden Gophers were putting together a nice drive but on third down and 11 from the Wisconsin 36-yard line, LB Brendan Kelly hit the Gophers QB Nelson and forced a fumble that was recovered by Badgers LB Chris Borland. Five plays later, Wisconsin was {{in the end zone}} with a 1-yard touchdown run by James White. The Badgers defense moved the Gophers offense back and forced a three–and–out. The Badgers then used a 12 play drive and got down to the Minnesota 2-yard line but were forced to kick a 20-yard field goal by Jack Russell. The Gophers would take a knee to close out the half, Wisconsin led 13–7.|$|E

In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.|$|E

He recorded in his diary in 1830 that [...] "it is best I have not married because I have not noisy Children and can have nice Books, and Pictures etc". He suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life, and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout, although he was popular with fellow artists and students. Etty rarely socialised, preferring to concentrate on his painting; when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes, he indignantly replied that [...] "it fills <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours in the evening, I should be at a loss how else to employ".|$|E

2500|$|On October 6, 1990, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] was {{recorded}} in a studio in New York accompanied by a live orchestra because the songwriters preferred to have all performers and musicians record together opposed to separating the singers from the instrumentalists. On {{the day of her}} scheduled recording session, Lansbury's flight was delayed due to a bomb threat, which prompted an emergency landing in Las Vegas. Unaware of her whereabouts for several hours, the filmmakers had begun making plans to reschedule the session until Lansbury finally telephoned the studio once she arrived safely in New York. At the behest of one of the directors, Lansbury recorded a demo of the song for them to use in the event that no other actress was available to sing it on her behalf, or no character other than Mrs. Potts was deemed suitable. Ultimately, Lansbury recorded her version in one take, which wound up being used in the final film. Producer Don Hahn recalled that the actress simply [...] "sang 'Beauty and the Beast' from beginning to end and just nailed it. We picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> lines here and there, but essentially that one take is what we used for the movie." [...] Lansbury's performance moved everyone who was present in the recording studio at the time to tears. Meanwhile, the actress credits recording the song with ultimately helping her gain further perspective on Mrs. Potts' role in the film.|$|E
