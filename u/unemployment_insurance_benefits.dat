Beginning in 1973, NAPO presented its first research document on hunger and food costs to the Federal Parliament. It continued, from this first campaign, to address poverty-related issues whether advocating for better health care, higher <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits,</b> fairer taxation, family benefits, recognition of homelessness and women's poverty, and/or the fundamental human rights {{of people living in}} poverty.

40|$|OF <b>UNEMPLOYMENT</b> <b>INSURANCE</b> <b>BENEFIT</b> ADEQUACY Traditionally {{studies of}} <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> {{adequacy}} {{have relied on}} an expenditure survey. This is expensive, yields small samples, and presumes that the analyst knows which categories of expenditure are necessary. This paper uses an existing large data set, and an agnostic approach. Labor supply are equations are estimated on PSID data using an estimator which accounts for rationing in the labor market. The results are used to compute labor market constraint compensation for comparison to payments under UI systems of representative states. The results suggest that payments which meet the accepted standard of adequacy would usually slightly overcompensate individuals. ...|$|R
30|$|The Benefit Duration Index {{captures the}} level of {{benefits}} available in later years of a spell relative to those available in the first year. This index measures how much the benefit decreases along with unemployment spell. The index is calculated as 0.6 *brr 23 /brr 1 + 0.4 *brr 45 /brr 1, where brr 1 refers to benefits of the first year, brr 23 the second and the third years, and brr 45 the fourth and the fifth years. This index takes 0 if the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> ends at or within 52 weeks of an unemployment spell and takes a positive value if the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> continues after 52 weeks. In 2005, the US marked 0.20, France marked 0.50, and Japan marked 0.00.|$|R

25|$|In addition, St-Laurent modernized and {{established}} new social and industrial policies {{for the country}} during {{his time in the}} prime minister's office. Amongst these measures included the universalization of old-age pensions for all Canadians aged seventy and above (1951), the introduction of old age assistance for needy Canadians aged sixty-five and above (1951), the introduction of allowances for the blind (1951) and the disabled (1954), amendments to the National Housing Act (1954) which provided federal government financing to non-profit organisations as well as the provinces for the renovation or construction of hostels or housing for students, the disabled, the elderly, and families on low incomes, and unemployment assistance (1956) for unemployed employables on welfare who had exhausted (or did not qualify for) <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits.</b> During his last term as Prime Minister, St-Laurent's government used $100million in death taxes to establish the Canada Council to support research in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.|$|E
25|$|SPD governments also {{introduced}} <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits</b> for all workers (in 1918), {{trade union recognition}} and an eight-hour workday, while municipalities that came under SPD control or influence expanded educational and job-training opportunities and set up health clinics. Off the shop floor, Social Democratic workers {{took advantage of the}} adult education halls, public libraries, swimming pools, schools, and low-income apartments built by municipalities during the Weimar years, while considerable wage increases won for the majority of workers by the Free Trade Unions between 1924 and 1928 helped to narrow the gap between unskilled and skilled workers. A number of reforms were also made in education, as characterised by the introduction of the four-year common primary school. Educational opportunities were further widened by the promotion of adult education and culture. The SPD also played an active and exemplary {{role in the development of}} local politics in thousands of towns and communities during this period. In 1923, the SPD Minister of Finance, Rudolf Hilferding, laid much of the groundwork for the stabilization of the German currency.|$|E

30|$|Using {{data from}} the ‘Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services’, Black et al. (2003) find a sharp {{increase}} in early exits from <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt, after benefit recipients had been informed about their programme participation. Similarly, using data from Denmark, Graversen and van Ours (2008) find that being assigned to a mandatory activation programme increases job finding rates of newly unemployed. Using data from three experiments in Sweden, Hägglund (2011) provides evidence on increased exit rates from <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt due to programme assignment in Jämtland, where a broad group of <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> recipients was targeted. In contrast, he does not find well-determined threat effects in Uppsala and Östergötland, where locally specific groups were targeted. To the best of our knowledge, only one study for Germany is based on experimental data. Büttner (2008) observes that an announcement of training programme participation increases exit rates from unemployment for women looking for part-time employment and unemployed persons aged between 20 and 27  years.|$|R

30|$|An <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> {{was created}} in 2002 in Estonia {{as a type of}} {{compulsory}} insurance based on the principle of solidarity; the first benefits were paid out at the beginning of 2003. The <b>benefits</b> provided are: <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit,</b> benefit for collective termination of employment contracts, and benefit for employer’s insolvency. For the employee, as the insured party, the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> contribution rate is between 0.5 and 2.0 percent and for the employer it is 0.25 to 1 percent of the wages paid to the employee. From 2006 to 2008, the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> contribution rate was 0.6 percent for employees and 0.3 percent for employers. On 1 August 2009, <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums in Estonia increased to 2.8 % of wages for employees and to 1.4 % of the payroll for employers. The increase was explained as being necessary for the <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> Fund to cover the growing costs caused by the continuing recession and by new redundancy regulations that had raised unemployment levels and the number of benefit recipients. From January 2013 the contributions were lowered again: the employer pays 2 % and the employee 1 %.|$|R
