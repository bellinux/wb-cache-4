40|$|International {{evidence}} {{suggests that there are}} substantial socio-economic inequalities in the delivery of specialist health services, even in the UK and other high-income countries with publicly funded health systems (Goddard and Smith 2001, Dixon et al. 2003, Van Doorslaer, Koolman and Jones 2004, Van Doorslaer et al. 2000). Studies of total hip replacement in the English NHS have yielded particularly striking examples, given that hip replacement is such a common, effective and longestablished health technology. Administrative data show that people living in deprived areas are less likely to receive hip replacement (Chaturvedi and Ben-Shlomo 1995, Dixon et al. 2004) while survey data suggest they {{may be more likely to}} need it (Milner et al. 2004). However, previous studies have not examined change in inequality over time. This paper presents evidence on the change in socio-economic inequality in small area use of elective total hip replacement in the English NHS, comparing 1991 with 2001. This was a period of important large-scale health care reform in England, involving at least two significant reforms that might potentially have influenced socio-economic inequality in health care delivery: (1) the introduction and subsequent abolition of the Conservative “internal market” 1991 - 7, and (2) the introduction in 1995 of a revised NHS resource allocation formula designed to reduce geographical inequalities in health care delivery. Two datasets, for 1991 and 2001, were assembled from routine NHS data sources: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) on hospital utilisation in England and the corresponding decennial National Censuses in 1991 and 2001. Both datasets contain information on over 8, 000 electoral wards in England (over 95 % of the total). To improve comparability, a common geography of frozen 1991 wards was adopted. The Townsend deprivation score was employed as an indicator of socio-economic status. Inequality was analysed in two ways. First, for comparability with previous small area studies of hip replacement, by using simple range measures based on indirectly age-sex standardised <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratios</b> (SURs) by deprivation quintile groups. Second, using concentration indices of deprivationrelated inequality in use based on indirectly age-sex standardised <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratios</b> for each individual small area. Each SUR is the observed use divided by the expected use, if each age and sex group in the study population had the same rates of use as the national population. ...|$|R
40|$|Vierendeel {{mechanism}} is always critical in steel beams with single large web openings. While {{the depth of}} web openings controls both the shear and the flexural failures of the perforated sections, it is {{the length of the}} web openings that governs the 'Vierendeel' mechanism which in turn depends on the local shear and moment capacities of the tee sections above and below the web opening. A comprehensive finite element investigation on steel beams with web openings of various shapes and sizes was reported in a complementary paper, and the primary structural characteristics of those steel beams were presented in detail. Comparison on the global moment-shear interaction curves of those steel beams shows that they are similar to each other in shape, and thus, it is possible to develop a generalised moment-shear interaction curve to assess the load capacities of all steel beams with web openings of various shapes and sizes. As the global shear forces cause both shear failure and 'Vierendeel' mechanism in perforated sections, the effect of local 'Vierendeel' moments acting onto the tee-sections above and below the web openings may be incorporated through a reduction to the global shear capacities of the perforated sections. A global coupled shear capacity is thus established and its values for web openings of various shapes and sizes are obtained directly from the finite element investigation. Details of the design method are fully presented in this paper. Moreover, an indicative parameter, the 'Vierendeel' parameter, is established to assess the performance of 'Vierendeel' mechanism in perforated sections. Through comparison among the moment and the shear <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratios,</b> m and v, and the 'Vierendeel' parameter, v i, the critical modes of failure in perforated sections under different moment-shear ratios may be readily assessed.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, air traffic {{facilitates}} {{the movement of}} people and goods all over the world, enabling economic growth and development. Despite the impact air traffic has on industries and systems all over the world, the aviation industry {{is influenced by the}} same factors as well. Energy prices, the economic situation, population growth and other aspects do impact airline businesses, as the most recent economic downturn illustrates perfectly. The world we live in over a couple of decades may vary in many aspects and it is impos- sible to predict all the factors, decisions and actions that will shape it in the future. The understanding of world as one global system, its dependencies and dynamics can never be perfect, and is limited by our knowledge. Now and in the future. Despite the ability to make perfect forecasts how the world will look like in the future, scenarios can help to define how factors will act so a variety of future pathways can be explored. In order to help airline businesses and organisation, such as the IATA, formulating and validating strategies, this work focuses on the development of a framework that enables the forma- tion and validation of scenarios that are based on dynamics, dependencies and relations of the global system. Based on a system dynamics approach, a Integrated Assessment Model is developed based on proven concepts of socio-economic and climatological modelling. This model will form the basis for the other models that will be added to calculate the demand for passenger kilometers, irrespective of the transport mode. Based on pricing and time expenditures of a journey by a transport mode, a distribution of passenger kilometers per transport mode is calculated. An Air Transport Model is used to mimic airline operations based on three types of aircraft. In this model, the transport demand, expressed in RPKs, is used to drive the demand for flights. Depending on the <b>utilisation</b> capacity <b>ratio,</b> an airline is able to cope with the demand. Above capacity <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratios,</b> the airline has to delay flights or order new assets (aircraft or runways) in order to accommodate the transport demand. Under some situations, this might leed to higher airfares or higher time expenditures per flight, which affect the balance of transport kilometers in respect to the other transport mode. Based on the performed amount of flights and RPKs, the Air Transport Model calculated essential KPIs, which are used to express the performance of the airline businesses. A Value Operations Methodology is used to validate the performance for both economic and non-economic aspects of an airline. By this methodology, several aircraft options and airline strategies can be validated under different socio-economic scenarios. Eventually helping airlines to improve their short-term as well as long-term strategical decisions. Air Transport OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{society has}} become reliant on battery powered {{electronic}} {{devices such as}} cell phones and laptop computers. The standard way of recharging these devices is by connecting to a reticulated electricity supply. In situations with no electricity supply some other recharging method is required. Such a possibility is a small, portable, generator based on fuel cell technology, specifically mini-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFC). MT-SOFCs have been developed since the 1990 s but there is limited analysis, discussion or research on developing and constructing a portable generator based on MT-SOFC technology. Such a generator, running on a portable gas supply, requires combining the key aspects of cell performance, a heating and fuel reforming system, and cell manifolds. Cell design, fuel type, fuel flow rate, current-collection method and operating temperature all greatly affected MT-SOFCs performance. Segmenting the cathode significantly increased the power output. Maximum power density from an electrolyte supported MT-SOFC was 140 mW/cm 2. The partial oxidation reactor (POR) developed provided the required heat to maintain the MT-SOFCs at an operating temperature suitable for generating electricity. The exhaust gas from the POR was a suitable fuel for MT-SOFCs, having sufficient carbon monoxide and hydrogen to generate electricity. Various manifold materials were evaluated including solid metal blocks and folded sheet metal. It was found that manifolds made from easily worked alumina fibre board decreased the thermal stresses and therefore the fracture rate of the MT-SOFCs. The final prototype developed comprised a partial oxidation reactor and MT-SOFCs mounted in alumina fibre board manifolds within a well-insulated enclosure, which could be run on LPG. Calculated efficiency of the final prototype was 4 %. If all the carbon monoxide and hydrogen produced by the partial oxidation reactor were converted to electrical energy, efficiency would increase to 39 %. Under ideal conditions, efficiency would be 78 %. Efficiency of the prototype can be improved by increasing the fuel and oxygen <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratios,</b> ensuring heat from the exhaust gases is transferred to the incoming gases, and improving the methods for collecting current at both the anode and cathode...|$|R
40|$|An {{overdraft}} is a lending instrument, usually {{offered by}} banks, {{that for a}} predetermined period allows the borrower to overdraw his account up to a predetermined limit. The timing and size of withdrawals is {{at the discretion of}} the borrower except, of course, when the credit limit is reached. Lending by Australian banks is predominantly by overdrafts and some attention has been focussed in the past on explaining the behaviour of overdraft advances. Individual demands for credit can therefore be characterised as censored (that is, subject to an upper limit). In practice there are only aggregate data for advances by overdrafts, which creeates difficulties for estimating the behavioural parameters for the demand for advances by overdraft. This paper develops a theory of aggregation of a group of individual demands that are each censored. A measure of credit rationing can also be derived from the approach. The approach is implemented using Australian data for three classes of business borrowers. The results support the view that the observed aggregate quantity of advances by overdraft is determined by both supply and demand factors. This finding is consistent with earlier work by researchers using Australian data. The significance of the present results lies in the attention paid to aggregation and the implications this has for the specification of the estimating equations. A second benefit of the approach is that it permits direct estimation of the distribution of rationed credit demands. The correctly aggregated equation specifies the observed stock of advances as a weighted average of constrained and unconstrained demands for credit, where the weights are interpreted as the probability that an individual borrower faces a binding credit limit. In that limited sense the probability measure, which varies over time, indicates the likelihood and distribution of credit rationing in the overdraft sector. These estimated probabilities are calculated for the three classes of business borrowers (agriculture, commerce and manufacturing) and are similar to the overdraft <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratios</b> in these sectors, which are independent measure of tightness in credit markets. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: As adult {{specialist}} inpatient hospice {{provision in}} the United Kingdom has matured, interest in the question of 'access' to care has grown. The evidence base on geographic accessibility is limited. This study examines whether geographic and socio-demographic accessibility to, and utilisation of, specialist inpatient hospices is equitable. Methods: A selective literature review critically examines the evidence on access to specialist inpatient hospices and specialist palliative care services. Inequalities in the availability of specialist inpatient hospices across the United Kingdom are summarised, analysed and mapped using a geographic information system. The geographic supply of, and demand for, adult specialist inpatient hospices across England and Wales are mapped by small area, and related to levels of deprivation. Specialist inpatient hospice accessibility scores are derived using a Newtonian distance decay model that analyses drive times between 189 inpatient hospices and 34, 378 small areas. Inequities in access to specialist inpatient hospices are mapped. The utilisation of specialist inpatient hospices, across England, is examined {{for a variety of}} patient groups. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, undertaken on 378, 482 adult cancer death records, models whether access, deprivation, age, gender and region influence the likelihood of dying in a specialist inpatient hospice. Results: A complex interaction of geographic, socio-demographic, healthcare system, clinical need, personal, cultural, societal and political factors impacts on the accessibility and utilisation of specialist inpatient hospices. Widespread regional variations in the geographic availability of specialist inpatient hospices are revealed. The highest levels of geographic access to adult specialist inpatient hospices are found within major urban conurbations, where cancer patients may potentially access alternative hospices with high bed numbers. Local examples of inequitable access are observed within neighbourhoods of many cities and towns, and across rural fringe counties. Over 6 % of adults live at least 30 minutes from a specialist inpatient hospice. Once effects attributable to other variables are accounted for, significant gradients are shown, nationally, by decile of accessibility, relative level of affluence or deprivation, and age, in the likelihood of dying in a specialist inpatient hospice. Notable geographical 'distance decay' effects are clear within the most inaccessible and accessible areas. For 80 % of patients, a gradual gradient in utilisation, by decile of accessibility, is shown, though patients from the most accessible decile of areas are 2. 79 times more likely to die in a specialist inpatient hospice than are those from least accessible areas. There is evidence of 'inverse care' effects, whereby patients with potentially greater levels of need, show lower <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratios.</b> Patients from the most affluent decile of areas are 1. 38 times more likely to die in a specialist inpatient hospice than are those from the poorest areas. The youngest decile banding of patients are 3. 86 times more likely to die in a specialist inpatient hospice than the most elderly banding. Implications: Inequitable geographic access has implications for the establishment of future specialist inpatient hospices and integrated models of specialist palliative care.

Pea seeds also contained non-nutritive compounds such as α-galactosides (4 g/ 100 g), phytic acid (0. 4 g/ 100 g) and trypsin inhibitor activity (2 TIU/mg). Extrusion cooking caused a slight increase of protein and fat content, whilst it reduced dietary fibre, thiamine and α-galactosides, and led to negligible trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) levels. The protein quality of pea measured by biological indexes (net protein <b>utilisation,</b> net protein <b>ratio,</b> relative net protein ratio, true protein digestibility and biological value) was not affected by extrusion treatments.

In Experiment 1 two sorghum varieties (MP, JM) were evaluated and three sorghums (HP, Tiger, HFQ) in Experiment 2; the two experiments were separate but very similar. The five sorghums were extensively characterised and all five diets contained 620 g/kg sorghum and were formulated to be nutritionally equivalent. In both studies, each dietary treatment was offered to six replicate cages (6 birds per cage) for a combined total of 540 male Ross 308 chicks. The effects of sodium metabisulphite on growth performance, nutrient utilisation, apparent digestibility coefficients of starch and protein (N) and starch and protein digestive dynamics were determined. Sodium metabisulphite significantly enhanced energy utilisation. Across both experiments, 3. 50 g/kg sodium metabisulphite increased AME on a dry matter basis by 0. 34 MJ {{from an average of}} 11. 97 – 12. 31 MJ/kg and similarly increased N-corrected AME by 0. 42 MJ from 11. 43 to 11. 85 MJ/kg.

MethodsTo determine inter-day reliability, 15 female netballers were assessed for stiffness twice within 1 week using unilateral hopping (vertical stiffness), free oscillations of the calf, and myometry of various muscles of the triceps surae. To establish convergent construct validity, stiffness was compared to static and dynamic strength measurements. ResultsTest–retest stiffness results revealed that vertical stiffness produced moderate to high reliability results and myometry presented moderate to very high reliability. In contrast, the free oscillation technique displayed low to moderate reliability. Vertical stiffness demonstrated a significant correlation with rate of force development during a squat jump, whilst myometer stiffness measurements from 3 sites in the lower limb revealed significant correlations with isometric rate of force development.

N-acetylaspartate, a marker of neuronal mitochondrial activity related to ATP, {{is reported to be}} lower in patients with TBI than healthy controls, and the ratio of N-acetylaspartate/creatine at early time points may correlate with clinical outcome. ¹H MRS acquired with shorter echo-times produces a more complex spectrum, allowing detection of a wider range of metabolites. ³¹P MRS detects high energy phosphate species, which are the end-products of cellular respiration: adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine. ATP is the principal form of chemical energy in living organisms, and phosphocreatine (PCr) is regarded as a readily mobilised reserve for its replenishment during periods of high <b>utilisation.</b> The <b>ratios</b> of high energy phosphates are thought to represent a balance between energy generation, reserve and use in the brain Additionally, the chemical shift difference between Pi and PCr enables calculation of intracellular pH. ¹³C MRS detects the ¹³C-isotope of carbon in brain metabolites. As the natural abundance of ¹³C is low (1. 1 %), ¹³C MRS is typically performed following administration of ¹³C-enriched substrates which permits tracking of the metabolic fate of the infused ¹³C in the brain over time, and calculation of metabolic rates in a range of biochemical pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glutamate-glutamine cycling. The advent of new hyperpolarization techniques to transiently boost signal in ¹³C-enriched MRS in-vivo studies shows promise in this field and further developments are expected.

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the tolerance, survivability and performance of weaner rabbits fed varying levels of actellic dust. The pathological effects of the pesticide on the animals were also appraised. A uniform diet was compounded from ingredients certified to be apparently pesticide residue-free. This diet was partitioned into 5 sub-diets. The first partition A had no residue, serving as control while B, C, D and E had 0. 01, 0. 02, 0. 03 and 0. 04 % inclusion of the actellic dust, respectively. A total of 20 rabbits of mixed breeds and sexes were used in the experiment. The animals were balanced for breed, sex and weight in a completely randomized design experiment. Four animals each were placed on each treatment diets for 45 days which were preceded by 3 weeks of acclimatization. Data on feed intake and weight gain were collected on weekly basis. Data on blood volume and organ weight were also obtained {{at the end of the}} study. Feed intake reduced with progressive inclusion of actellic dust. The average daily feed intakes were 71. 40 g (A), 66. 04 g (B) 64. 82 g (C), 67. 56 g (D) and 63. 79 g (E) though not significantly different (P> 0. 05) Weight gain however increased with increase dosage of the animals with treatment E having the highest gain and significantly higher (p 0. 05) than the control.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the possibility that tandem inclusions of a reducing agent and a protease may advantage chicken-meat production and to ascertain if the established benefits of including sodium metabisulphite in sorghum-based diets extend to wheat-based diets. The study comprised a 2  ×  2  ×  2 factorial array of treatments in which either nutritionally iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic wheat- or sorghum-based diets, without and with sodium metabisulphite (2. 75  g/kg), without and with protease (1, 000 units/kg) were offered to broiler chickens from 7 to 28 days post–hatch. The effects of dietary treatments on growth performance, nutrient utilisation, protein (N) and starch digestibility coefficients and digestive dynamics were determined. A preliminary investigation into the effects of two treatments on concentrations of free amino acids and glucose in the portal circulation was conducted. There was significant feed grain by sodium metabisulphite interactions (P =  0. 03 to 0. 005) for parameters of nutrient <b>utilisation</b> (AME, ME:GE <b>ratios,</b> N retention, AMEn). For example, sodium metabisulphite inclusions in sorghum-based diets enhanced AME by 0. 18  MJ (12. 47 versus 12. 29  MJ/kg) but depressed AME by 0. 43  MJ (11. 88 versus 12. 31  MJ/kg) in wheat-based diets. There was a linear relationship between starch:protein disappearance rate ratios in the distal ileum with weight gain (r = − 0. 484; P =  0. 0012) indicating that condensed ratios (or absorption of more protein relative to starch) advantaged growth performance. Concentrations of free amino acids in the portal circulation or the post-enteral availability of certain amino acids, including the branched-chain amino acids, methionine, phenylalanine and threonine, were significantly correlated to FCR. For example, threonine concentrations were negatively correlated to FCR (r = − 0. 773; P =  0. 005). Finally, tandem inclusions of sodium metabisulphite and protease in sorghum-based diets may hold merit but it appears that the established ‘energy sparing’ effects of sodium metabisulphite inclusions in sorghum-based diets are not duplicated in wheat-based diets...|$|R
40|$|To {{transmit}} power through an electricity transmission or distribution network is by either {{overhead power lines}} or power cables. Overhead lines are the initial and usual option as cost can be greatly reduced. Cables are more reliable as they are less impacted by weather and other environmental influences than overhead lines. They also take up less space than the alternative option. The continued growth of consumer electricity use in Queensland, has led electricity service providers in subjecting {{a substantial amount of}} existing assets to a high <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratio,</b> even into overload to cope with the demand. Until system augmentation and further capital works are implemented to introduce greater capacity to their network, technical and engineering staffs are tasked to manipulate this network while attempting to maintaining electricity supply and reducing risk to safety and plant. To achieve the higher utilisation of assets, the method of dynamic rating of plant enables the electricity utility the ability to provide consumers both new and old with supply until further capital and system augmentation works are carried out. This project is aimed at developing a model {{that can be used in}} reality to assist in the ability to employ dynamic ratings of cables taking into account the varying parameters that dictate the current capability of power cables...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{aesthetic}} and structural advantages, tubular space truss structures are enjoying increasing popularity in modern bridge construction. The use of cast steel nodes for the joints between the circular hollow section members is also becoming increasingly popular. The fatigue design of such joints however requires additional knowledge {{with respect to}} their fatigue resistance. The present work deals with the global fatigue behaviour of cast steel nodes used in longitudinal truss girders of steel-concrete composite bridges. The global fatigue behaviour of cast steel nodes in a truss girder is quantified on the basis of experimental investigations. The relative influence of the resistance of the cast steel node and the resistance of the welds is analysed as a function of various parameters. An economically optimal fatigue design consists of adapting the fatigue resistance of the cast node to that of the welds. The experimental results show very clearly that the fatigue behaviour is governed by the welds in all tested configurations. Their fatigue behaviour is therefore investigated in a research program conducted simultaneously. The present work concentrates on the adaptation of the resistance of the cast steel nodes to that of the welds. Consequently, allowable initial casting defect sizes must be defined {{as a function of the}} required fatigue resistance of the welds. Using a numerical boundary element model, they are calculated for cast steel nodes in a typical steel-concrete composite bridge. The results show that brittle failure of a node containing cracks does not occur. A crack depth equal to 90 % of the wall thickness at the crack location is therefore chosen as the failure criterion, assuming that a through-thickness crack is unacceptable. Varying between 28 and 88 % of the wall thickness, the resulting allowable initial casting defect sizes are very large. Aiming at a general application for steel-concrete composite bridges, the results of the numerical investigations are represented by an approximate formula for the stress intensity factor based on a constant correction factor. This approximation results in a considerable simplification of the procedure for the fatigue design of cast steel nodes established for the aforementioned typical composite bridge. The approximate formula is used to perform a parametric study. The influences of the <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratio</b> under traffic and fatigue loads, the cast steel fracture toughness and yield strength and the node dimensions on the defect size are described. Assuming a fracture toughness likely to be encountered in practice and a mean <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratio</b> of the node as well as a range of node dimensions, the allowable initial casting defect sizes are quantified. The present work shows that the fatigue resistance of the welded joints needs to be improved substantially in order to benefit from the high fatigue resistance of the cast nodes. Weld details including a backing ring offer a higher fatigue resistance than those without. Using the proposed design concept, allowable initial defect sizes in cast steel nodes can be estimated as a function of the required fatigue resistance...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} {{survivability}} in general multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) multi-layered optical networks and proposed a novel mixed shared protection algorithm (MSPA) {{based on the}} integrated layered graph (ILG) to tolerate single-fibre link failure. The ILG is composed of one virtual topology layer (VTL), corresponding to IP/MPLS layer; multiple wavelength-plane layers (WPLs), corresponding to the wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical layer; and some virtual links that connect the VTL to each WPL in order {{to solve the problem}} on routing, wavelength assignment and low-speed traffic grooming. For every connection request, the MSPA first computes a single-hop or multi-hop label switching path (LSP) pair, involving a working LSP and a physical link-disjoint backup LSP in the VTL. If the LSP pair is not found in the VTL, the MSPA computes the new LSP pair in the WPL. Conversely, if the new LSP pair is not detected in the WPL, the MSPA computes the hybrid multi-hop LSP pair in the ILG. In the MSPA, if the two working LSPs are in physical link-disjoint, their corresponding backup LSPs can share the backup bandwidth. In addition, theworking LSPs and the backup LSPs can also share the same mixed ofwavelength, in which the different bandwidths can be assigned to different working and backup LSPs. Simulation results show that, compared to previous algorithm, the MSPA can obtain a better bandwidth <b>utilisation</b> <b>ratio</b> (BUR) with a lower blocking probability.

The effects of health insurance on the utilisation of allied {{health services}} {{has not yet been}} established despite health insurance frequently being identified as a factor promoting utilisation of medical and hospital services among people with chronic disease. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to establish the effects of health insurance on the utilisation of allied health services by people with chronic disease. Medline (Ovid Medline 1948 to Present with Daily Update), EMBASE (1980 to 1 April 2011), CINAHL, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to 12 April 2011 inclusive. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published in English, randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental trials, quantitative observational studies and included people with one or more chronic diseases using allied health services and health insurance. A full-text review was performed independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were conducted. One hundred and fifty-eight citations were retrieved and seven articles were included in the meta-analyses. The pooled odds ratio (95 % CI) of having insurance (versus no insurance) on the utilisation of allied health services among people with chronic disease was 1. 33 (1. 16 - 1. 52; P < 0. 001). There was a significant effect of insurance on the utilisation of non-physiotherapy services, pooled odds ratio (95 % CI) 4. 80 (1. 46 - 15. 79; P = 0. 01) but having insurance compared with insurance of a lesser coverage was not significantly associated with an increase in physiotherapy <b>utilisation,</b> pooled odds <b>ratio</b> (95 % CI) 1. 53 (0. 81 - 2. 91; P = 0. 19). The presence of co-morbidity or functional limitation and higher levels of education increased utilisation whereas gender, race, marital status and income had a limited and variable effect, according to the study population. The review was limited by the considerable heterogeneity in the research questions being asked, sample sizes, study methodology (including allied health service), insurance type and dependent variables analysed. The presence of health insurance was generally associated with increased utilisation of allied health services; however, this varied depending on the population, provider type and insurance product...|$|R

Percentage mortality of 25 was also recorded from treatment with the highest dose. The results therefore show that weaner rabbits can tolerate the presence of actellic dust in feed up to 0. 03 %. At this dose, the acttellic dust does not have adverse effects on growth performance. Higher concentration of 0. 04 % can result in manifestation of toxicity symptoms and sometimes death, such values are rarely naturally present in feeds. However, animals which are able to tolerate high values hardly manifest poor performances...|$|R
40|$|Increasing energy {{consumption}} in Australian transport sector, rapidly depleting amount of Australian oil reserves, {{and the environmental}} concerns that arise from the associated greenhouse gas emissions produced by the combustion of large amount of fossil fuels during transport activities have increased the interest in using renewable transport fuels, especially ethanol and biodiesel, as replacements for petrol and diesel fuels, respectively, in the transport sector. In Western Australia, {{there is a potential}} for replacing diesel fuel consumed in its transport sector by biodiesel produced from rapeseed (canola) grown as one of the break crops between cereal crops. Apart from the availability of raw material, sustainable biodiesel production from rapeseed needs to be analysed from, among other factors, its energy efficiency, which can be determined from the energy ratio of the overall biodiesel production process, defined as the ratio of energy output from biodiesel to the total primary energy consumed during rapeseed growing and processing into biodiesel. In this study, the energy ratio of biodiesel production from rapeseed in Western Australia is evaluated through an energy balance analysis, considering typical Western Australian rapeseed growing practices and rapeseed processing parameters. The energy ratio is then used to evaluate the land, water, and labour requirements of a large scale biodiesel production to analyse its feasibility as a replacement for fossil diesel fuel consumption in Western Australian transport sector. The energy ratio and feasibility of the biodiesel production process are then compared to those of ethanol production from mallee in Western Australia since both biofuels are produced as alternative transport fuels and an assessment is therefore needed to decide which fuel is more feasible to produce, considering the competition for limited resources, e. g. arable land, during their production. Without by-products <b>utilisation,</b> the energy <b>ratio</b> of biodiesel production from rapeseed is found to be less than 1, indicating a negative energy return. The most significant improvement to the energy ratio is achieved when all by-products are utilised, resulting in an energy ratio of 1. 70. A feasibility analysis using the net energy approach with an energy ratio of 1. 70 shows that the land and labour requirements of a large scale biodiesel production are the major constraints to its realisation as an alternative to diesel fuel in Western Australian transport sector. Replacement of a significant fraction of diesel fuel consumption in the transport sector would cause severe competition for arable land with production of other crops. The net biodiesel production rate is also lower than that required to maintain the current transport activities that are supported by diesel fuel produced by Western Australian energy sector. Feasibility analysis of large scale ethanol production shows, on the other hand, that there is potential to replace approximately 15 % of the total petrol fuel consumption in Western Australian transport sector with ethanol produced from mallee grown in Western Australian wheatbelt to tackle dryland salinity problem. The net ethanol production rate would also be sufficient to maintain the current transport activities that are supported by petrol fuel produced by Western Australian energy sector. The feasibility of the large scale ethanol production is, however, dependent on the availability of sufficient water, and hence rainfall, to maintain a consistent mallee yield per hectare of agricultural area. The results of energy balance and feasibility analyses in this study imply that wide implementation of rapeseed-based biodiesel in Western Australia is unsustainable. Possible future implementation should be directed at smaller and more specific targets and should be supported by development of key strategies in both rapeseed growing and rapeseed processing stages aimed at increasing rapeseed yield and reducing main energy input contributors to improve the energy ratio and productivity of the whole production process. The results also show that ethanol production from mallee grown in Western Australian wheatbelt to tackle dryland salinity problem provides an option for a large scale biofuel production to play significant role in future energy security in Western Australian transport sector...|$|R
