In particular, vos Savant defended herself vigorously. Morgan et al. complained in their response to vos Savant (1991c) that vos Savant still had not actually responded to their own main point. Later in their response to Hogbin and Nijdam (2011), they did agree that it was natural to suppose that the host chooses a door to open completely at random, when {{he does have a}} choice, and hence that the conditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., conditional given the situation the player is in when he has to make his choice) has the same value, , as the <b>unconditional</b> <b>probability</b> of winning by switching (i.e., averaged over all possible situations). This equality was already emphasized by Bell (1992), who suggested that Morgan et al.'s mathematically involved solution would only appeal to statisticians, whereas the equivalence of the conditional and unconditional solutions in the case of symmetry was intuitively obvious.|$|E

The sample version of the total odds estimator is shown to coincide with a maximum-likelihood estimator known from the literature.

Instead of linear regression-based models, we consider the possibility that the true data generating process may come from two different distributions, and we employ the Markov Switching approach to analyse this. From the results of the two-state Markov Switching model, we define State 1 as the efficient state and State 2 as the inefficient one. Only the 30 -day forward rate is able to differentiate between the two states. Based on the <b>unconditional</b> <b>probabilities</b> from the Markov switching model, we also find that the 30 -day forward rate has a 70 % probability in the efficient state, which indicates that 70 % of all speculators fully extract information when predicting future spot rates, while 30 % of all investors do not. ...|$|R

This probabilistic logic has a concrete syntax and a complete inference procedure, and it handles conditional as well as <b>unconditional</b> <b>probabilities.</b> It synthesizes Nilsson’s probabilistic logic and Frisch and Haddawy’s anytime inference procedure with Wilson and Moral’s logic of gambles. Two distinct semantics can be used for our probabilistic logic: (1) the measure–theoretic semantics used by the prior logics already mentioned and also by the more expressive logic of Fagin, Halpern, and Meggido and (2) a behavioral semantics. Under the measure–theoretic semantics, sentences of our probabilistic logic are interpreted as assertions about a probability distribution over interpretations of the underlying logic. Under the behavioral semantics, these sentences are interpreted only as asserting the acceptability of gambles, and this suggests different directions for generalization...|$|R
