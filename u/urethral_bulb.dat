50|$|The artery of {{bulb of penis}} (artery of the <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> or bulbourethral artery) is a short artery {{of large}} caliber which arises from the {{internal}} pudendal artery between the two layers of fascia (the superior and inferior) of the urogenital diaphragm. It passes medialward, pierces the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm and gives off branches which ramify in the bulb of the urethra and in the posterior part of the corpus spongiosum.|$|E
5000|$|The hinder {{part of the}} <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> lies in {{apposition}} {{with the}} inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, but its upper portion diverges somewhat from this fascia: the anterior wall of the membranous urethra is thus prolonged for a short distance {{in front of the}} urogenital diaphragm; it measures about 2 cm in length, while the posterior wall which is between the two fasciæ of the diaphragm is only 1.25 cm long. The anatomical variation in membranous urethral length measurements in men have been reported to range from 0.5 cm to 34.3 cm.|$|E
40|$|The {{proximal}} <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> in men is enlarged, {{surrounds the}} bulbous urethra, and extends dorsally towards the perineum. During intercourse engorgement takes place {{due to increased}} blood flow through the corpus spongiosum. Antegrade ejaculation is facilitated by contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscles during climax. Micturition during sexual stimulation is functionally inhibited. Supporting the bulb may indirectly facilitate continence in a certain subset of patients with postprostatectomy incontinence. During physical activity with increased abdominal pressure, reflex contraction of the pelvic floor muscles {{as well as the}} bulbospongiosus muscles occurs to support sphincter function and limit urinary incontinence. Operations to the prostate may weaken urinary sphincter function. It is hypothesized that the distal urinary sphincter may be supported indirectly by placing a hammock underneath the <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb.</b> During moments of physical stress the “cushion” of blood within the supported corpus spongiosum helps to increase the zone of coaptation within the sphincteric (membranous) urethra. This may lead to urinary continence in patients treated by a transobturator repositioning sling in patients with postprostatectomy incontinence. This paper describes the possible role of the <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> in male urinary continence, including its function after retroluminal sling placement (AdVance, AdVance XP® Male Sling System, Minnetonka, USA) ...|$|E
40|$|Retrourethral transobturator sling {{is a new}} {{functional}} {{treatment of}} stress urinary incontinence after prostatectomy with reported success rate of 54 to 80 % and a failure rate of 20 to 45 %. Objective: Aim {{of the study was}} to retrospectively analyze morphologic changes visible on MRI after sling procedure in continent patients compared with the incontinent ones, in order to detect possible factors explaining the different clinicoutcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: 21 male patients treated with the Advance ® sling, were enrolled: 13 / 21 had clinical recovery, while 8 / 21 had persistent incontinence. The procedure outcome was defined as cured patients (0 - 1 security pad) or incontinent ones (> 2 pads). The MRI protocol performed with a 3 T system included: 3 D T 2 w sequence (CUBE) and a high temporal resolution Fiesta for dynamic sequence. On the T 2 w sequence, we measured the length of the <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> posterior to the sling (LB) and the distance of the sling from a line bisecting the pubic symphysis (LBPS). The bladder neck activity was evaluated with dynamic sequence. Results were analyzed with two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Results and Limitations: In the 8 incontinent patients the length of the <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> posterior to the sling was 10 mm (range 10 - 28 mm) (p< 0. 0002). The sling was located posterior to the LBPS in 7 / 8 incontinent patients (4. 4 - 12. 6 mm) and almost coincident with it in 8 / 13 continent patients (p= 0. 0549). On the dynamic study, during the Valsalva manoeuvre all incontinent patients showed urine leakage. Conclusions: The failure of RTS, still poorly understood, can be related to inappropriate indications; based on our results, an incorrect sling placement seems to be another cause of failure. In particular, the LB posterior to the sling seems to be strongly correlated with continence...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} adult case of Cowper's syringocele. A 19 -year-old male {{presented}} with the chief complaint of persistent post-voiding dribbling 5 months after onset. Urethroscopy demonstrated a thin membrane with a small orifice on the ventral aspect distal to the external sphincter. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a restiform shadow {{on the left side}} of the corpus spongiosum. Retrograde urethrogram showed filling of diverticulum-like structure in the region of <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> terminating in the urogenital diaphragm. Considering the results mentioned above, we diagnosed the patient with Cowper's syringocele. Transurethral unroofing of the Cowper's syringocele was performed with a cold knife, and the excessive tissue on the edge of syringocele was electroresected to avoid recurrence. His post-voiding dribbling resolved completely after the procedure and has not recurred in 13 months postoperatively. Cowper's syringocele is typically diagnosed presenting with hematuria, urinary tract infection, and disuria in male infants and children. Adult cases of Cowper's syringocele are rare, and only 32 cases including the present case have been reported. Proper awareness of this entity and careful evaluation are important if patients present with persistent adult-onset voiding dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Most mammals exhibit {{seasonal}} {{variation in the}} reproductive capacity of one or both sexes. While the female southern hairy-nosed wombat Lasiorhinus latifrons is a known seasonal breeder, the extent of seasonality in the male has not been documented. To examine this, gross body measurements including scrotal diameter and {{the dimensions of the}} accessory gland bulge were recorded and male reproductive tracts were examined between 1993 and 2000. Testes, epididymides and accessory glands from all males were dissected free of connective tissue and weighed. In addition, matched semen samples were collected over four time points in 2000 corresponding to the breeding season (September), immediately post-breeding season (November), during the non-breeding season (January), and immediately before the onset of the next breeding season (June) as determined from female reproductive status. Semen was collected by electro-ejaculation and analysed for volume, sperm number and motility characteristics. Ejaculate volume, total ejaculate sperm number, percentage motile sperm, and the sperm motility rating and index were all significantly elevated in September and significantly lower in November and January. This correlated with a significant increase in body weight, peri-cloacal gland width, and the weights of the prostate, Cowper 2 ̆ 7 s glands, <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> and crus penis. The data confirm that male reproduction in the southern hairy-nosed wombat, like that of the female, is highly seasonal with a peak in reproductive capacity occurring in August-September and a reduction by November...|$|E
40|$|Context: Penile {{allotransplantation}} {{might be}} a viable option for patients who need penile reconstruction. Aims: A successful autotransplantation rat model {{is the first step}} toward proceeding for allotransplantation. We herein evaluate autotransplantation following transaction of the rat penis just distal to the <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb.</b> Settings and Design: Experimental animal study. Materials and Methods: Five Sprague-Dawely rats weighing 520 g (SD 19) were used. Utilizing a magnification of 6 - 40, transection and immediate anastomosis of the tunica albuginea, urethra, dorsal vein and nerves were carried out. Vesicostomy was made to divert urine. The glandular skin was sutured to the perineum and the abdominal wall was closed in layers. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistics. Results: Average surgery time was 8 h. The first two rats had no vesicostomy and died in the first postoperative day from retention. Three rats tolerated well the procedure and survived to the end point. One rat was sacrificed at day 10 and histopathology showed 30 - 50 % necrosis of the implanted penis. Another rat was sacrificed at day 20 and showed normal cavernous tissue. The fifth rat was sacrificed 3 months postoperatively and showed evidence of moderate corporal fibrosis. Urethral fistula and necrosis of corpus spongiosum, dorsal nerve necrosis and dorsal vein occurred in all animals. Conclusions: Penile autotransplantation in rats is feasible and provides the basis for evaluation of the corpora cavernosa in an allotransplantation model. Long-term urethral continuity and dorsal neurovascular bundle survival in this model is difficult to establish...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} morphologic changes visible on {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) after sling procedure in continent patients and to compare MRI findings with the incontinent ones, to detect possible factors explaining the different clinical outcomes. Methods Twenty-seven male patients who were treated with Advance sling for urinary stress incontinence after prostate surgery were enrolled: 16 had clinical recovery, whereas 11 had persistent incontinence. Patients after sling were defined as continent if used 0 - 1 dry "security pad" or incontinent > 1 pad. Magnetic Resonance examinations were performed with a 3 Tesla system and included 3 -dimensional T 2 -weighted sequence. Three readers performed a qualitative (representation of the bulb and indentation of the sling) and a quantitative analysis (length of the bulb posterior to the sling and distance of the sling from a line bisecting the pubic symphysis). Results The sling was clearly recognizable in all 16 continent patients but only in 2 of 11 incontinent ones. The length of the bulb posterior to the sling was > 10 mm (range, 10 - 28) in all continent patients and in 2 of the incontinent ones. The sling was coincident with a line drawn through the long axis of the pubic bone in 9 of 16 continent patients. A statistically significant association was found between MRI qualitative findings and continence status (P <. 0001). Conclusion On {{the basis of our}} MRI results, the position of the sling and, in particular, the length of the <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> posterior to the sling seem to be correlated with continence and must be considered in case of treatment failure...|$|E
40|$|Changes in semen {{quality and}} {{morphology}} {{of the male}} reproductive tract were studied throughout {{the year in the}} highly promiscuous tammar wallaby. Body size, semen quality and gross morphology of the reproductive organs were assessed in adult males each month from January to November. The mean weight of males was similar in most periods sampled, but males were slightly heavier in the minor (P < 0. 05) than the non-breeding season. Since body weight was correlated with weights of the testes, epididymides and accessory sex glands, organ weights were adjusted for body weight in subsequent analyses. In the major breeding season (late January/early February), when most females go through a brief, highly synchronized oestrus, the testes, prostate, Cowper's glands, crus penis and <b>urethral</b> <b>bulb</b> were heaviest, volume and coagulation of ejaculates were greatest, and sperm motility had increased. Semen samples collected by electroejaculation at this time contained low numbers of spermatozoa, possibly as a result of dilution and entrapment by the seminal coagulum or depletion of epididymal stores during intense multiple mating activity. In the non-breeding season (late May–July), when mating does not normally occur in the wild, there was a significant decrease in the relative weight of nearly all male reproductive organs and a decline in most semen parameters. In the minor breeding season (September–November), when pubertal females undergo their first oestrus and mating, the weights of testes, epididymides and most accessory sex glands had significantly increased similar to those of males in the major breeding season. The total number and motility of ejaculated spermatozoa were highest during this period, but the volume and coagulation of ejaculates and weight of the prostate had only increased to levels that were intermediate between the major and non-breeding seasons. Ejaculate volume was strongly correlated with prostate weight, and % motile spermatozoa was strongly correlated with epididymis weight. Semen quality thus varied seasonally with changes in androgen dependent reproductive organs in the male tammar wallaby and appeared to be influenced by the seasonal timing of oestrus in females. Semen quality may also improve in response to {{an increase in the number}} of available oestrous females...|$|E
