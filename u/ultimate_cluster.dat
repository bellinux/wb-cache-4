This band is the <b>ultimate</b> <b>cluster</b> of clusters. This belt is The Universe. Our Galaxy is but one, and {{perhaps one of the most}} inconsiderable, of the clusters which go to the constitution of this ultimate, Universal belt or band. The appearance of this cluster of clusters, to our eyes, as a belt or band, is altogether a perspective phænomenon of the same character as that which causes us to behold our own individual and roughly-spherical cluster, the Galaxy, under guise also of a belt, traversing the Heavens at right angles to the Universal one. The shape of the all-inclusive cluster is, of course generally, that of each individual cluster which it includes. Just as the scattered stars which, on looking from the Galaxy, we see in the general sky, are, in fact, but a portion of that Galaxy itself, and as closely intermingled with it as any of the telescopic points in what seems the densest portion of its mass—so are the scattered “nebulæ” which, on casting our eyes from the Universal belt, we perceive at all points of the firmament—so, I say, are these scattered “nebulæ” to be understood as only perspectively scattered, and as part and parcel of the one supreme and Universal sphere.|$|E

The package vardpoor was developed with the objective to modernise the sample error estimation in sample surveys. Sampling errors can be estimated for household, agricultural and business surveys using the package. The main advantage of the proposed package is its simplicity and flexibility.

Sampling error estimation mechanism, calculation of the domain-specific study variables, variable linearization, calculation of regression residual, and variance estimation with the <b>ultimate</b> <b>cluster</b> method, variance estimation of the simple random sampling is briefly explained in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Nationally {{representative}} {{samples of}} large populations often have complex design features {{for a variety}} of reasons (e. g., cost efficiency). For purposes of estimating sampling variances based on complex multi-stage sample designs involving stratification and cluster sampling, the sampling error codes provided by survey organizations in public use survey data files often assume “ultimate cluster selection ” of individuals from primary sampling units (PSUs). “Ultimate clusters ” are the ultimate aggregate samples of individual population elements that are selected from PSUs (Wolter, 2007, p. 33), possibly based on multiple stages of sample selection (e. g., counties as PSUs, area segments within counties, households within area segments, and individuals within households). The sample selection method that is often assumed for variance estimation in practice (possibly within strata) is a single-stage, with-replacement selection of <b>ultimate</b> <b>clusters</b> from all hypothetical <b>ultimate</b> <b>clusters</b> defined by a multi-stage design, where all units within the <b>ultimate</b> <b>clusters</b> are measured (i. e., there is no subsampling within the <b>clusters,</b> and the <b>ultimate</b> <b>clusters</b> are what are really being sampled in a single stage of selection) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new document clustering method based on frequent co-occurring words. We first employ the Singular Value Decomposition, and then group the words into clusters called word representatives as substitution of the corresponding {{words in the}} original documents. Next, we extract the frequent word representative sets by Apriori. Subsequently, each document is designated to a basic unit described by the frequent word representative set, from which {{we can get the}} <b>ultimate</b> <b>clusters</b> by hierarchical clustering. The major advantage of our method is that it can produce the cluster description by the frequent word representatives and then by the corresponding words in the clustering process without any extra works. Compared with the state-of-the-art UPGMA method on benchmark datasets, our method has better performance in terms of the entropy and cluster purity...|$|R

Intrusion {{detection}} system (IDS) {{is an important}} component of computer network security, while clustering analysis is a common unsupervised anomaly detection method. However, it is difficult for the single clustering algorithm to get the great effective detection, and the data of intrusion attacks is anomalistic normally. This paper presents an unsupervised anomaly {{detection system}} based on the clustering ensemble. The system is based on the multiple runs of K-means to accumulate evidence to avoid the false classification of anomalistic data; then using single-link to construct the hierarchical clustering tree to get the <b>ultimate</b> <b>clustering</b> result to solve the above problems. Finally, the KDD 99 CUP test data is used to show that this system is greatly effective.

40|$|Regression estimators {{are often}} used in survey {{sampling}} for point estimation. We propose a new regression estimator based upon the optimal estimator proposed by Berger et al., (2003). The proposed estimator {{can be used for}} stratified two-stage sampling designs when the sampling fraction is negligible and the primary sampling units (PSU) are selected with unequal probabilities. For example, this is the case for self-weighted two-stage designs. We assume that we have auxiliary variables available for the secondary sampling units (SSU) and the primary sampling units (PSU). We propose to use an <b>ultimate</b> <b>cluster</b> approach to estimate the regression coefficient of the regression estimator. Estevao and Särndal (2006) proposed a regression estimator for two-stage sampling. This estimator will be compared with the proposed estimator through a simulation study. We will show that the proposed estimator is more accurate that the Estevao and Särndal (2006) estimator when the strata are homogeneous. <br/...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} some clique-based methods for social network {{clustering}}. The quality of clustering result {{is measured by}} a novel clique-based index, which is innovated from the modularity index proposed in [Newman 2006]. We design an effective algorithm based on recursive bipartition {{in order to maximize}} the objective function of the proposed index. Noting the optimization of the objective function is NP-hard when the network size or the parameter space is large, we relax the problem via an implicitly restarted Lanczos method from numerical algebra. One of the contributions of our method is that the proposed index of each community in the clustering result is higher than a predefined threshold, $p$, which is completely controlled by users. However, when the threshold is unknown or not given, we implement a tree-based strategy and propose a localized clustering algorithm which considers a localized threshold for each subnetwork to maximize the overall clique score of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>clustering</b> result. Finally, we exploit simulation experiments based on the stochastic block model to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithms, numerically and graphically...|$|R

40|$|Various {{data mining}} {{approaches}} {{are currently being}} used to analyse data within different domains. Among all these approaches, clustering {{is one of the}} most-used approaches, which is typically adopted in order to group data based on their similarities. The data in various systems such as finance, healthcare, and business, are stored as time-series. Clustering such complex data can discover patterns which have valuable information. Time-series clustering is not only useful as an exploratory technique but also as a subroutine in more complex data mining algorithms. As a result, time-series clustering (as a part of temporal data mining research) has attracted increasing interest for use in various areas such as medicine, biology, finance, economics, and in the Web. Several studies which focus on time-series clustering have been conducted in said areas. Many of these studies focus on the time complexity of time-series clustering in large datasets and utilize dimensionality reduction approaches and conventional clustering algorithms to address the problem. However, {{as is the case in}} many systems, conventional clustering approaches are not practical for time-series data because they are essentially designed for static data and not for time-series data, which leads to poor clustering accuracy. Adequate clustering approaches for time-series are therefore lacking. In this thesis, the problem of the low quality in existing works is taken into account, and a new multi-step clustering model is proposed. This model facilitates the accurate clustering of time-series datasets and is designed specifically for very large time-series datasets. It overcomes the limitations of conventional clustering algorithms in dealing with time-series data. In the first step of the model, data is pre-processed, represented by symbolic aggregate approximation, and grouped approximately by a novel approach. Then, the groups are refined in the second step by using an accurate clustering method, and a representative is defined for each cluster. Finally, the representatives are merged to construct the <b>ultimate</b> <b>clusters.</b> The model is then extended as an interactive model where the results garnered by the user increase in accuracy over time. In this work, the accurate clustering based on shape similarity is performed. It is shown that clustering of time-series does not need to calculate the exact distances/similarity between all time-series in a dataset; instead, by using prototypes of similar time-series, accurate clusters can be obtained. To evaluate its accuracy, the proposed model is tested extensively by using published time-series datasets from diverse domains. This model is more accurate than any existing work and is also scalable (on large datasets) due to the use of multi-resolution of time-series in different levels of clustering. Moreover, it provides a clear understanding of the domains by its ability to generate hierarchical and arbitrary shape clusters of time-series data...|$|R
40|$|Dispersion of {{powdered}} solids in viscous liquids {{is the result}} of the interaction between a complex flow and incompletely understood phenomena - rupture and erosion of solids - occurring at agglomerate length scales. Breakup of solid clusters in nonhomogeneous flows is studied by dynamic modeling. Complex how behavior is simulated by means of a chaotic flow; breakup is characterized by the 'fragmentation number', F alpha, which is the ratio of deforming viscous forces to resisting cohesive forces. A condition for rupture, F alpha > F alpha(sep), developed using a two fragment model cast in terms of a microstructural vector model, is presented. Clusters rupture and erode causing the population to evolve in space and time; conditions based on the magnitude of F alpha determine whether or not rupture occurs, and the probability of erosion. Results are analyzed by means of fragmentation theory. It is shown that the polydispersity is not constant, that the cluster size distribution resulting from dispersion is not self-similar, and that erosion in a nonhomogeneous flow leads to a wider size distribution than predicted by mean-field approaches. It is shown as well that regardless of the mixing, that the mass fraction of <b>ultimate</b> size <b>clusters</b> can be predicted by a polynomial relation derived via fragmentation theory and that the overall rates of erosion in both poorly mixed or well mixed flows can be described by a power law.

40|$|One of the <b>ultimate</b> {{goals of}} <b>cluster</b> {{analysis}} {{is not only}} to reveal structure but also to understand it. Most clustering methods focus only on the grouping aspect and do not provide a descriptive model with which the population underlying the data can be described or with which statistical inference such as predictions can be made. Linear manifold clustering seeks to identify groups of points that lie on lower dimensional linear manifolds. In this paper we present a non-parametric density es-timation modeling technique by which data that lies in a mixture of linear manifolds can be described and with which statistical inference can based on. The efficacy of this technique is demonstrated by a target recognition experiment, where image pixels represented by high-dimensional feature vectors are classified with an error rate close to 0. 1 using a probabilistic classifier constructed from mixture models of linear manifolds.

PRISM would have two instruments: (1) an imager with a 3. 5 m mirror (cooled to 4 K for high performance in the far-infrared [...] -that is, in the Wien part of the CMB blackbody spectrum), and (2) an Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) somewhat like the COBE FIRAS instrument but over three orders of magnitude more sensitive. Highlights of the new science (beyond the obvious target of B-modes from gravity waves generated during inflation) made possible by these two instruments working in tandem include: (1) the <b>ultimate</b> galaxy <b>cluster</b> survey gathering 10 e 6 clusters extending to large redshift and measuring their peculiar velocities and temperatures (through the kSZ effect and relativistic corrections to the classic y-distortion spectrum, respectively) (2) a detailed investigation into the nature of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) consisting of at present unresolved dusty high-z galaxies, where most of the star formation in the universe took place, (3) searching for distortions from the perfect CMB blackbody spectrum, which will probe a large number of otherwise inaccessible effects (e. g., energy release through decaying dark matter, the primordial power spectrum on very small scales where measurements today are impossible due to erasure from Silk damping and contamination from non-linear cascading of power from larger length scales).

40|$|PRISM (Polarized Radiation Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) was {{proposed}} to ESA in May 2013 as a large-class mission for investigating {{within the framework}} of the ESA Cosmic Vision program a set of important scientific questions that require high res- olution, high sensitivity, full-sky observations of the sky emission at wavelengths ranging from millimeter-wave to the far-infrared. PRISM’s main objective is to explore the distant universe, probing cosmic history from very early times until now as well as the structures, distribution of matter, and velocity flows throughout our Hubble volume. PRISM will survey the full sky in a large number of frequency bands in both intensity and polarization and will measure the absolute spectrum of sky emission more than three orders of magnitude bet- ter than COBE FIRAS. The data obtained will allow us to precisely measure the absolute sky brightness and polarization of all the components of the sky emission in the observed frequency range, separating the primordial and extragalactic components cleanly from the galactic and zodiacal light emissions. The aim of this Extended White Paper is to provide a more detailed overview of the highlights of the new science that will be made possible by PRISM, which include: (1) the <b>ultimate</b> galaxy <b>cluster</b> survey using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) e↵ect, detecting approximately 106 clusters extending to large redshift, including a char- acterization of the gas temperature of the brightest ones (through the relativistic corrections to the classic SZ template) as well as a peculiar velocity survey using the kinetic SZ e↵ect that comprises our entire Hubble volume; (2) a detailed characterization of the properties and evolution of dusty galaxies, where the most of the star formation in the universe took place, the faintest population of which constitute the di↵use CIB (Cosmic Infrared Background); (3) a characterization of the B modes from primordial gravity waves generated during inflation and from gravitational lensing, as well as the ultimate search for primordial non-Gaussianity using CMB polarization, which is less contaminated by foregrounds on small scales than thetemperature anisotropies; (4) a search for distortions from a perfect blackbody spectrum, which include some nearly certain signals and others that are more speculative but more informative; and (5) a study of the role of the magnetic field in star formation and its inter- action with other components of the interstellar medium of our Galaxy.
