Parsons, an art {{historian}} and one of Warren's past companions, took responsibility for selling the cup and approached the New York collector Walter Baker, however Baker was hesitant to proceed. In February 1953 it was posted by Thomas to Walter Baker, however US Customs impounded the box requiring a decision from Washington to admit it as pornography, it was refused entry to the <b>US</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> basis and took until October 1954 {{to be returned to}} the UK, by which time Thomas had died. After this event, a number of museums declined to buy it. Thomas' widow sold the cup to the dealer John K. Hewett. Hewett offered the cup to Denys Haynes, Keeper of the Greek and Roman department at the British Museum who then sought an opinion from his friend Lord Crawford, a trustee of the museum. However the decision went no further as they thought that they would never persuade the museum's trustees who were chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E

While Ocasek and Orr split vocal duties on past albums, Ocasek sings lead on all the tracks from Move Like This. In a Rolling Stone interview, Ocasek said, [...] "I was aware that on half of the new songs, Ben would have done better than I did. But we never wanted anybody from the outside." [...] Orr was given special thanks in the liner notes: [...] "Ben, your spirit was with <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> one." ...|$|E

500|$|When conceiving {{ideas for}} The Last of Us, Druckmann used {{a concept that}} he created {{as a student at}} Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the {{gameplay}} of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based The Last of <b>Us</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl Ellie. Druckmann wrote The Last of Us with the intention of having the story [...] "rooted firmly within reality", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous [...] "light and loose" [...] feeling. [...] "It needed to go a little darker [...] to explore a sadder theme," [...] he explained. Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to [...] "talk to [...] in the same language". The game was released on June 14, 2013 to critical acclaim, with particular praise directed towards Druckmann's work on the story. He earned numerous awards for his work on the game, including a BAFTA, a DICE Award, a Game Developers Choice Award, a Golden Joystick Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award.|$|E

2500|$|These {{discussions were}} {{reported}} to the House of Commons by Thorneycroft, leading to a storm of protest. Air Commodore Sir Arthur Vere Harvey pointed out that while Skybolt had suffered five test failures, Polaris had thirteen failures in its development. He went on to state [...] "that some of <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> side, {{who want to see}} Britain retain a nuclear deterrent, are highly suspicious of some of the American motives... and say that the British people are tired of being pushed around". Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond asked: [...] "Does not this mark the absolute failure of the policy of the independent deterrent? Is it not the case that everybody else in the world knew this, except the Conservative Party in this country?

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{perceptions}} on who Mohamed Bouazizi was. After his self-immolation, Bouazizi’s image flooded social media {{which lead to}} worldwide discourse. This complicated how Bouazizi was seen, [...] "Mohamed Bouazizi is not our hero. He's your hero," [...] said local Tunisian Arabic Nader Ncibi. There are accusations that social media diluted what Bouazizi stood for. Naafil Harshani, an activist that grew up with Bouazizi, said, [...] "what was important to Mohamed was putting {{food on the table}} and football. He {{had nothing to do with}} politics and wanted nothing to do with politics." [...] Mohamed Bouazizi did not plan to start a revolution, but it is undeniable that it preceded his anger towards not being able to sell his fruit. [...] "There are many stories on who Mohamed was and who Mohamed wasn't," [...] said Zahra Shwabli, a Hay Al Noor primary school teacher, [...] "It is important for <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> day to remember what Mohamed Bouazizi stood for: the dignity of all Tunisians.

2500|$|On 7 December 2010, it was {{revealed}} that several other cast members had joined the project, including Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Sylvester McCoy as Radagast the Brown, Mikael Persbrandt as Beorn, William Kircher as Bifur, Ken Stott as Balin and Jed Brophy as Nori. Blanchett was the first returning cast member from The Lord of the Rings film trilogy to be cast in the films, even though her character does not appear in the novel. On her casting, Jackson said, [...] "Cate {{is one of my favorite}} actors to work with and I couldn't be more thrilled to have her reprise the role she so beautifully brought to life in the earlier films." [...] McCoy, the former Doctor Who star, who appeared alongside McKellen in a Royal Shakespeare Company's King Lear, was confirmed to be in negotiations to play a major role as a [...] "wizard" [...] in October 2010, leading to speculation he could appear as Radagast the Brown. During the production of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, McCoy had been contacted about playing the role of Bilbo and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Ian Holm. On the casting of Persbrandt, Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "The role of Beorn is an iconic one and Mikael was our first choice for the part. Since seeing him read for the role we can't imagine anyone else playing this character." [...] On the casting of Stott, Jackson commented [...] "Fran and I have long been fans of Ken's work and are excited he will be joining <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> journey." [...] The casting of Brophy came after his collaboration with Jackson on several films, including Braindead, Heavenly Creatures, and all three Lord of the Rings films as various creatures.|$|E
