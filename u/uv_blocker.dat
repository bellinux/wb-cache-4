In this research, using a new in vitro method designed to overcome the shortage of material associated to many studies dealing with natural products, we show that the three major compounds isolated from the lichen Vulpicida pinastri, vulpinic acid, pinastric acid and usnic acid, were <b>UV</b> <b>blocker</b> agents. Antioxidant assays evidenced superoxide anion scavenging activity. Combination {{of the most promising}} compounds against UVB and UVB radiations, usnic acid, vulpinic acid and pinastric acid, increased the photoprotective activity. At the same time, they were found not cytotoxic on keratinocyte cell lines and photostable in the UVA and UVB ranges.

40|$|One of {{the best}} ways how hosts may defend their clutch against brood {{parasitism}} is recognition and rejection of parasitic eggs. It has been documented that ability to percept UV light in birds affects their behaviour. By using a spectrophotometer we found that Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) eggs and Common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) eggs differ mainly in brightness but also in UV hue. We investigated the influence of birds' UV vision on recognition and rejection of parasitic eggs. Therefore we performed three experiments to reveal the role of eggshell UV reflectance on egg rejection in this host. In the first experiment, we parasitized clutches with artificial white eggs differing only in UV reflectance (UV- and UV+). In the other two, we experimentally reduced UV reflectance from conspecific and host own eggs. We used a UV light blocker, which did not influence the reflectance shape in the other parts of spectra. As a control we used a group of conspecific and own eggs coated in Vaseline, which did not affect eggshell reflectance. In each experiment, we monitored host response to parasitic eggs. Because the Reed Warbler's eggs reflect UV radiation themselves, we expected that white UV- eggs would be rejected as well as the eggs coated in <b>UV</b> <b>blocker</b> at a higher rate than white UV+ eggs and [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} types of colloidal lipid particles are presented and compared as innovative carrier systems. Lipid nanoparticles produced with a solid matrix such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) were established as UV protection system. NLC are nanoparticles with a solid matrix made either from a solid lipid (SLN) or a blend of a solid lipid with a liquid lipid (oil) (NLC). Both particle types are solid up to temperatures up to 50 - 60 °C. The particles themselves act as <b>UV</b> <b>blocker</b> due to their particulate character. Incorporation of molecular sunscreens into the matrix of the particles leads to a synergistic effect of molecular sunscreen and the UV scattering. That means the total content of molecular sunscreens in the formulation can be reduced while maintaining the protection level compared to emulsions with molecular sunscreens. In general incorporation of sunscreens into lipid carriers proves the UV blocking effect whereas the increase at the different wavelengths depends obviously also {{on the nature of}} the lipid matrix. High crystallinity improves UV blocking effect. The dissertation describes the screening for an optimal lipid for sunscreen incorporation, preparation of NLC with increasing amount of sunscreens, their physical characterization by DSC and sizing methods and UV-blocking ability. It was possible to load NLC with up to 70 % with molecular sunscreen, perfectly to obtain high SPF with this novel UV protection system. A scaling up into the industrial scale is easily possible for SLN and NLC systems. The increased loading capacity of NLC offers the possibility of incorporating actives which could not be formulated before. The promising results of SLN and NLC make them high potential versatile carrier systems for topical application in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations. </p...|$|E
25|$|Titanium dioxide {{is found}} in the {{majority}} of physical sunscreens because of its high refractive index, its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Nano-scaled (particle size of 30–40nm) titanium dioxide particles are primarily used in sun screen lotion because they scatter visible light less than titanium dioxide pigments while still providing UV protection. Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral <b>UV</b> <b>blockers</b> are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals.|$|R

The rheology of the suspension was adjusted so that the formulations {{could be used to}} coat different glass and polymer substrates and foils using wet chemical deposition techniques such as spin coating, dip coating, spray coating and web coating. The optical properties (transmission, reflection, absorption) showed that the layers transmitted more than 87 % in the visible range, acted as infrared (IR) -shielding coatings for (λ > 1. 5 µm, and effectively reduced the intensity of solar light (Air Mass (AM) 1. 5 Global solar spectrum). At the same time, the layers acted as <b>UV</b> <b>blockers</b> for wavelengths less than 400 nm, protecting the polymer substrates and foils from degradation when exposed to UV irradiation. The layers exhibited a high conductivity (σ∼ 1100 Sm- 1) which made them useful for electrostatic and antistatic purposes as well as for devices that require a transparent conducting coating with sheet resistance higher than a few kΩ. Furthermore, the layers showed excellent adhesion on all substrates and high resistance against abrasion and weathering degradation, results that are quite promising with respect to their outdoor use...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{reflectance}} {{has been}} implicated in mate selection. Yet, in some bird species the plumage of young varies in UV reflectance already in the nest and long before mate choice and sexual selection come into play. Most birds molt the juvenile body plumage before reaching sexual maturity, and thus, some conspicuous traits of the juvenile body plumage may rather have evolved by natural selection, possibly via predation or parental preference. This second hypothesis is largely untested and predicts a differential allocation of food between fledging and total independence, which is a time period of 2 - 3 weeks where offspring mortality is also highest. Here, we test the prediction that parents use the individual variation in UV reflectance among fledglings for differential food allocation. We manipulated UV reflectance of the plumage of fledgling great tits Parus major by treating chest and cheek feathers with a lotion that either {{did or did not}} contain <b>UV</b> <b>blockers</b> and then recorded food allocation by parents in an outdoor design simulating postfledging conditions. The visible spectrum was minimally affected by this treatment. Females were found to feed UV-reflecting offspring preferentially, whereas males had no preference.

40|$|The {{impetus for}} this study was to provide release {{estimates}} that can serve to improve predictions of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) exposure for risk assessment. We determined the likely release of ENMs from personal care products (PCPs) through a consumer survey on use and disposal habits, and research on the types and quantities of ENMs in PCPs. Our estimates show that in the US zinc oxide (ZnO), with 1, 800 - 2, 100 mt yr - 1, and titanium dioxide (TiO 2), with 870 - 1, 000 mt yr - 1, represent 94 % of ENMs released into the environment or landfills from the use of PCPs. Around 36 - 43 % of ENMs from PCPs were estimated to end up in landfills, 24 - 36 % released to soils, 0. 7 - 0. 8 % to air, and 28 - 32 % to water bodies. ENMs in sunscreen represent around 81 - 82 % of total release, from ZnO and TiO 2 as <b>UV</b> <b>blockers,</b> followed by facial moisturizer (7. 5 %), foundation (5. 7 %), and hair coloring products (3. 1 %). Daily care products such as body wash, shampoo, and conditioner had by far the highest per capita and total use, but contributed little to the ENM release estimates as these products generally contain little or no ENMs. However, if ENMs are incorporated into these daily care products, this may substantially increase ENM release. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media...|$|R

To access the final edited and published work see[URL] weighted average (TWA) passive sampling with thin film solid: phase micro extraction (TF-SPME) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for collection, identification, and quantification of benzophenone- 1, benzophenone- 2, benzophenone- 3, benzophenone- 4, 2 -phenylbenzimidazole- 5 -sulfonic acid, octocrylene, octylmethoxycinnamate, butylmethoxydibenzgylmethane, triclocarban and triclosan in the aquatic environment. Two types of TF-SPME passive samplers, including a retracted thin film device using a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) coating, and an open-bed configuration with an, octadecyl silica-based (C 18) coating, were evaluated in an aqueous standard generation system. Laboratory calibration {{results indicated that the}} thin film retracted device using HLB coating is suitable to determine TWA concentrations of polar analytes in water, with an uptake that was linear up to 70 days. In open bed form, a one-calibrant kinetic calibration technique was accomplished by loading benzophenone 3 -d(5) as calibrant on the C 18 coating to quantify all nonpolar compounds. The experimental results showed that the one-calibrant kinetic calibration technique can be used for determination of classes of compounds in cases where deuterated counterparts are either not available or expensive. The developed passive samplers were deployed in wastewater-dominated reaches of the Grand River (Kitchener, ON) to verify their feasibility for determination of TWA concentrations in on-site applications. Field trials, results indicated that these devices are suitable for long-term and short-term monitoring of compounds varying in polarity, such as <b>UV</b> <b>blockers</b> and biocide compounds in water, and the data were in good agreement with literature data.

40|$|The {{protein quality}} control {{system is a}} complex network that {{promotes}} the folding and trafficking of newly synthesized proteins and regulates the degradation of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates. Failure of the quality control system to maintain protein homeostasis (or proteostasis) characterizes the cellular pathogenesis {{of a number of}} human diseases. In particular, this study focuses on lysosomal storage disorders, a group of inherited metabolic diseases characterized by deficiencies in specific lysosomal hydrolytic activities that result from mutations in genes encoding for lysosomal proteins and consequent buildup of lysosomal storage material. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop cell engineering strategies to modulate cellular quality control machineries that control protein folding, processing, and degradation to restore cellular homeostasis under conditions of proteotoxic stress. Specifically, this study aims to manipulate the lysosome-autophagy system to enhance folding and processing of lysosomal enzymes as well as to enhance the cellular clearance capacity. To achieve this goal, I investigated the role of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and function, in regulating lysosomal proteostasis and autophagic clearance. Specifically, chemical and genetic modulation of TFEB was found to enhance folding, trafficking and activity of unstable, degradation-prone lysosomal enzymes in in vitro models of lysosomal storage disorders. Moreover, pharmacologic activation of autophagy achieved by treating cells with 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin was found to enhance autophagic clearance of storage material specifically by activating TFEB. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction and activation of autophagic clearance, I tested the impact of polystyrene nanoparticles of different size and surface charge on the lysosome-autophagy system with the ultimate goal to link the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials with the specific nature of the autophagic response activated upon nanomaterial uptake into cells. Efficient autophagic clearance was found to depend highly on the surface charge. Specifically, cell exposure to polystyrene nanoparticles presenting neutral or negative surface charge results in activation of autophagic clearance, whereas cell exposure to polystyrene nanoparticles presenting cationic surface charge results in impairment of lysosomal function and blockage of autophagic flux. Ceria nanoparticles (or nanoceria) are widely used in a variety of applications including as <b>UV</b> <b>blockers</b> and catalysts in industrial processes. Recent studies also revealed that ceria nanoparticles present antioxidant properties, suggesting a potential role of nanoceria in a variety of biomedical applications. In this study, I investigated the impact of ceria nanoparticles stabilized by organic surface coatings on the lysosome-autophagy system, Ceria nanoparticles were found to activate the lysosome-autophagy system and enhance autophagic clearance. In summary, this work provides proof-of-principle demonstration of chemical and biological strategies to activate the lysosome-autophagy system for restoring lysosomal proteostasis and enhancing autophagic clearance in model systems of diseases characterized by deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes activities and aberrant accumulation of undegraded lysosomal substrates. These findings lay the foundation for the development of nanotherapeutics for the treatment of diseases associated with inefficient autophagic clearance...|$|R
40|$|The visual {{biology of}} Hawaiian reef fishes was {{explored}} by examining their eyes for spectral sensitivity of their visual pigments and for transmission of {{light through the}} ocular media to the retina. The spectral absorption curves for the visual pigments of 38 species of Hawaiian fish were recorded using microspectrophotometry. The peak absorption wavelength (lambda(max)) of the rods varied from 477 - 502 nm and the lambda(max) of individual species conformed closely to values for the same species previously reported using a whole retina extraction procedure. The visual pigments of single cone photoreceptors were categorized, dependent on their lambda(max) -values, as ultraviolet (347 - 376 nm), violet (398 - 431 nm) or blue (439 - 498 nm) sensitive cones. Eight species possessed ultraviolet-sensitive cones and 14 species violet-sensitive cones. Thus, 47 % of the species examined displayed photosensitivity to the short-wavelength region of the spectrum. Both identical and nonidentical paired and double cones were found with blue sensitivity or green absorption peaks (> 500 nm). Spectrophotometry of the lens, cornea, and humors for 195 species from 49 families found that the spectral composition of the light transmitted to the retina was most often limited by the lens (73 % of species examined). Except for two unusual species with humor-limited eyes, Acanthocybium solandri (Scombridae) and the priacanthid fish, Heteropriacanthus cruentatus, the remainder had corneal-limited eyes. The wavelength at which 50 % of the light was blocked (T 50) was classified according to a system modified from Douglas and McGuigan (1989) as Type I, T 50 < = 355 nm, (32 species); Type IIa, 355 < T 50 < = 380 nm (30 species); Type IIb, 380 < T 50 405 nm (84 species). Possession of UV-transmitting ocular media follows both taxonomic and functional lines and, if {{the ecology of the}} species is considered, is correlated with the short-wavelength visual pigments found in the species. Three types of short-wavelength vision in fishes are hypothesized: UV-sensitive, UV-specialized, and violet-specialized. UV-sensitive eyes lack <b>UV</b> <b>blockers</b> (Type I and IIa) and can sense UV light with the secondary absorption peak or beta peak of their longer wavelength visual pigments but do not possess specialized UV receptor cells and, therefore, probably lack UV hue discrimination. UV-specialized eyes allow transmission of UV light to the retina (Type I and IIa) and also possess UV-sensitive cone receptors with peak absorption between 300 and 400 nm. Given the appropriate perceptual mechanisms, these species could possess true UV-color vision and hue discrimination. Violet-specialized eyes extend into Type IIb eyes and possess violet-sensitive cone cells. UV-sensitive eyes are found throughout the fishes from at least two species of sharks to modern bony fishes. Eyes with specialized short-wavelength sensitivity are common in tropical reef fishes and must be taken into consideration when performing research involving the visual perception systems of these fishes. Because most glass and plastics are UV-opaque, great care must be taken to ensure that aquarium dividers, specimen holding containers, etc., are UV-transparent or at least to report the types of materials in use...|$|R
40|$|Hosts of obligate avian brood parasites use {{visual cues}} to {{distinguish}} between their own eggs {{and those of the}} parasite. Despite major differences between human and bird vision, most previous studies on cuckoo egg mimicry estimated color matching based on human color vision. Undetected by humans, ultraviolet reflectance (UVR) may play a previously ignored role for rejection behavior in avian brood parasite systems. We explored this possibility by manipulating UVR of great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius eggs and assessing the response of magpie Pica pica hosts. We coated cuckoo eggs with an ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> light <b>blocker</b> that reduced UVR but left the human visible reflectance (400 – 700 nm) unaltered. The first control treatment also coated the eggs but did not alter their reflectance. A second control group of cuckoo eggs was maintained uncoated to control for handling effects on magpie discrimination. We artificially parasitized a third of a breeding magpie population with each type of experi-mental egg and studied the rejection of cuckoo eggs. We failed to find significant differences between rejection rate of cuckoo eggs with and without reduced reflectance in the UV region. Our results indicate that artificial reduction of UVR of cuckoo eggs does not affect the probability of ejection by magpie hosts. Key words: avian brood parasitism, egg discrimination, egg mimicry, great spotted cuckoo, magpie, ultraviolet vision. [Behav Ecol 17 : 310 – 314 (2006) ] Avian brood parasitism constitutes a well-studied exampleof the coevolutionary process (Rothstein, 1990). Brood parasite offspring receive parental care from unrelated hosts, and parasitized hosts usually experience a reduced reproduc-tive output (Payne, 1997; Røkaft et al., 1990). Therefore, brood parasitism selection pressure favors the evolution of host defenses, which, in turn, select for cuckoo counterdefense...|$|R
