[...] The valley itself is an alluvial basin. [...] Its <b>underlying</b> <b>strata</b> were formed by Pliocene and Pleistocene lava flows covered by Holocene sedimentary deposits.

2500|$|The {{existence}} of angular unconformities had been noted by Nicolas Steno and by French geologists including Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, who interpreted {{them in terms}} of Neptunism as [...] "primary formations". Hutton wanted to examine such formations himself to see [...] "particular marks" [...] {{of the relationship between the}} rock layers. On the 1787 trip to the Isle of Arran he found his first example of Hutton's Unconformity to the north of Newton Point near Lochranza, but the limited view meant that the condition of the <b>underlying</b> <b>strata</b> was not clear enough for him, and he incorrectly thought that the strata were conformable at a depth below the exposed outcrop.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927, the Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini ordered Guido Ucelli {{to drain}} the lake and recover the ships. With {{the help of the}} Regia Marina, the Italian Army, industry, and private individuals, an ancient Roman underground water conduit linking the lake to farms outside the crater was reactivated. After connecting the conduit to a floating pumping platform, on 20 October 1928, the lake level began dropping. By 28 March 1929, the water level had dropped , and the first ship (prima nave) broke the surface. By 10 June 1931, the prima nave had been recovered and the second ship (seconda nave) was exposed. By this time the water level had dropped more than [...] with over 40 million cubic meters of water removed. As a result of the weight reduction, on 21 August 1931, 500,000 cubic meters of mud erupted from the <b>underlying</b> <b>strata</b> causing [...] of the lake floor to subside. Work ceased and, while the risks of continuing the project were debated, the lake began refilling. As the seconda nave had already partially dried out, the submersion caused considerable damage. On 10 November 1931, the Minister of Public Works ordered the project and all research abandoned.|$|E

Spangles and specks are found; but the greater part of the dust is granular, increasing to 'shotty gold.' The natives divide the noble ore into 'dust-gold' and 'mountain-gold.' The latter would consist of nuggets, 'lobs,' or pépites, and of crystals varying in size from a pin's head to a pea. The form is a cube modified to an octahedron and a rhombic dodecahedron. These rich finds are usually the produce of pockets or 'jewellers' shops.'

Keratinocytes migrating from the <b>underlying</b> <b>stratum</b> spinosum become known as granular cells in this layer. These cells contain keratohyalin granules, which are filled with histidine- and cysteine-rich proteins that appear to bind the keratin filaments together.Therefore, the main function of keratohyalin granules is to bind intermediate keratin filaments together.|$|R
30|$|In {{the mining}} of the 4 # Coal Seam, one {{may affect the}} safety of mining is the Quaternary aquifer. The <b>underlying</b> <b>stratum</b> of the Quaternary aquifer is the Neogene red clay, in which the water-conducted {{fissures}} cannot strongly develop.

50|$|As rivers {{flow across}} the landscape, they {{generally}} increase in size, merging with other rivers. The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system. These systems take on four general patterns: dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis.

Drainage systems have four primary components: drainage basin, alluvial valley, delta plain, and receiving basin. Some geomorphic examples of fluvial landforms are alluvial fans, oxbow lakes, and fluvial terraces.|$|R
50|$|Biostratigraphically the interglacial was dated in the {{so-called}} Uhlenberg Profile from a pollen stratigraphy perspective. Its assignment to MIS 23 or 25 is uncertain, because it would give an age of about 900,000 to 940,000 years. There are however indications that the Uhlenberg Profile may still be placed within the Pliocene, and it would thus not correlate with the Danube-Gunz interglacial. Also uncertain is its association with the North German classification because of {{its position in the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>stratum</b> of the Gunz it could correspond to the Bavelian or the Waalian interglacial.|$|R

30|$|Several {{decades of}} strife in Afghanistan have caused {{shortages}} {{of the energy}} required to improve living conditions. Food, clothing, shelter, heat, sanitation, and industry, in general, depend {{on the availability of}} energy. The presence of petroleum resources has long been known in Afghanistan, but these resources have been exploited to only a limited extent. Improving living and economic conditions in Afghanistan requires increasing the availability of energy, particularly by exploitation of Afghanistan’s petroleum resources. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} estimate the amount of oil produced by waterflooding technique in the Angut oilfield. The waterflooding technique has been widely used in petroleum reservoirs where the pressure is insufficient to push oil to the surface, and then inject water into the <b>underlying</b> <b>stratum.</b> The Buckley–Leverett theory is applied to the Angut reservoir which is now under exploration by the joint Afghanistan and Chinese “China National Petroleum International Watan Ltd.” (CNPCIW) group (Petzet 2016; Carstens 2009).|$|R

40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} for conservative solute diffusion in one-dimensional double-layered porous media {{are presented in}} this paper. These solutions are applicable to various combinations of fixed solute concentration and zero-flux boundary conditions (BC) applied {{at each end of}} a finite one-dimensional domain and can consider arbitrary initial solute concentration distributions throughout the media. Several analytical solutions based on several initial and BCs are presented based on typical contaminant transport problems found in geoenvironmental engineering including (1) leachate diffusion in a compacted clay liner (CCL) and an underlying stratum; (2) contaminant removal from soil layers; and (3) contaminant diffusion in a capping layer and underlying contaminated sediments. The analytical solutions are verified against numerical solutions from a finite-element method based model. Problems related to leachate transport in a CCL and an <b>underlying</b> <b>stratum</b> of a landfill and contaminant transport through a capping layer over contaminated sediments are then investigated, and the suitable definition of the average degree of diffusion is considered...|$|R
