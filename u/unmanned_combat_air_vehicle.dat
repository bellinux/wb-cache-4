2500|$|De Forest was a vocal {{critic of}} many of the {{developments}} in the entertainment side of the radio industry. In 1940 he sent an open letter to the National Association of Broadcasters in which he demanded: [...] "What have you done with my child, the radio broadcast? You have debased this child, dressed him in rags of ragtime, tatters of jive and boogie-woogie." [...] That same year, de Forest and early TV engineer Ulises Armand Sanabria presented the concept of a primitive <b>unmanned</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> using a television camera and a jam-resistant radio control in a Popular Mechanics issue. In 1950 his autobiography, Father of Radio, was published, although it sold poorly.|$|E

40|$|Conceptual {{aircraft}} design is characterised by {{the requirement to}} analyse {{a large number of}} configurations rapidly and cost effectively. For unusual configurations such as those typified by <b>unmanned</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles</b> (UCAVs) adequately predicting their aerodynamic characteristics through existing empirical methods is fraught with uncertainty. By utilising rapid and low cost experimental tools such as the water tunnel and subscale flight testing it is proposed that the required aerodynamic characteristics can rapidly be acquired with sufficient fidelity for the conceptual design phase. Furthermore, the initial design predictions can to some extent be validated using flight-derived aerodynamic data from subscale flight testing...|$|R

50|$|In August 2003, Air International {{reported}} {{that the goal of}} integrating air- and ground-search radars on a single airframe was abandoned.

Instead the USAF decided to plan two separate E-10 fleets to be integrated with the proposed space-based radar system, air- and space-based ELINT/SIGINT assets, and space-based IMINT satellites. It would have been the central command authority for all air, land, and sea forces in a combat theater.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{future of}} <b>air</b> <b>combat</b> relies on humans {{controlling}} large teams of <b>unmanned</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles</b> (UCAVs) within a dynamic battle environment. Under the DARPA Mixed Initiative Control of Automata (MICA) program, {{we have been}} challenged to design a system that empowers a human operator to control teams of up to thirty UCAVs. To address these challenges we are designing an interaction system that defines and provides adequate situation and automation awareness without overloading human operators {{to the point where}} their performance degrades gracelessly. The proposed mixed initiative system is situated within a complex and highly dynamic information space that could easily overload the multi-tasking human operators. Dozens of system parameters could be updated thousands of time...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} on <b>Unmanned</b> <b>Combat</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (UCAVs) are two-fold: first to control the flow by inserting leading-edge and cross-flow slots and analysing the viscous flow development over the outer panels of a flying-wing configuration to maximise the performance of the elevons control surfaces; second to predict high-lift performance particularly the maximum-lift characteristics. This is demonstrated using a variety of inviscid Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Euler, and viscous CFD Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methods. The computational results are validated against experiment measured in a wind tunnel. Two flying-wing planforms are considered based around a generic 40 ̊ edge-aligned configuration. The VLM predicts a linear variation of lift and pitching moment with incidence angle, and substantially under-predicts the induced drag.
