The NAF duly prepared a design for a Mark VII catapult that {{would be able to}} launch a fifty-ton PBB-1 at a speed of 130 miles per hour. The catapult would be installed so that the flying boat could be lifted onto it with a large crane or hydraulic jacks. However, in the summer of 1942, while development of the Mk.VII catapult was still ongoing, the Navy cancelled the project because it considered JATO assistance at takeoff more practical.|$|E

The wing was redesigned internally with increased fuel capacity and a 100lb increase in maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) to 2,650lb; After another 30 112s were built, Rockwell offered an option for increased fuel capacity (68 <b>US</b> <b>gallon</b> vs. 48 gallon standard tanks).|$|E
25|$|In general, marine aquariums {{have more}} complex {{filtration}} requirements than most freshwater aquariums.

25|$|In 2001, the United States Navy left western Vieques, {{which had}} been used as an {{ammunition}} depot. Now the United States Fish and Wildlife Service controls 3,100 acres (13km²) of this land — {{about half of the}} formerly owned military property. Over the course of U.S. Navy occupancy, nearly 22 million pounds (10,000 tonnes) of military and industrial waste, such as oils, solvents, lubricants, lead paint, acid and 55 <b>US</b> <b>gallon</b> (200 L) drums, were deposited on the western portion of the island.

25|$|The {{addition}} of the 85 <b>U.S</b> <b>gallon</b> (322 l) fuselage fuel tank, coupled with the reduction in area of the new rear fuselage, exacerbated the handling problems already experienced with the B/C series when fitted with the tank, {{and led to the}} same fillet being added to -B, -C and initial -D-series versions in the field, to be quickly standardized as a normal rear-fuselage airframe component on later production blocks of the -D version. P-51Ds without fuselage fuel tanks were fitted with either the SCR-522-A or SCR-274-N Command Radio sets and SCR-695-A, or SCR-515 radio transmitters, as well as an AN/APS-13 rear-warning set; P-51Ds and Ks with fuselage tanks used the SCR-522-A and AN/APS-13 only.|$|E
25|$|Because ethanol {{contains}} {{close to}} 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs {{have a lower}} mileage per gallon than gasoline. However, this lower energy content does not translate directly into a 34% reduction in miles per <b>U.S.</b> <b>gallon,</b> {{because there are many}} other variables that affect the performance of a particular fuel in a particular engine, though for E85 the effect becomes significant. E85 will produce lower mileage than gasoline, and actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle. Based on EPA EPA-rated mileage for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline. When making price comparisons it has to be considered that E85 has octane rating of about 104 and {{could be used as a}} substitute for premium gasoline.|$|E

25|$|Industrial {{agriculture}} {{also produces}} undesirable environmental effects. Large scale growing operations of commodity crops {{rely on the}} use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Modified corn is a greedy plant that consumes more fertilizer that any other crop. Without either of these, the soil alone could not have supported the large number of hybrid corn plants that helped America’s food industry explode. The production of both synthetic pesticides and fertilizers requires the use of natural gas and petroleum. Currently, it is relatively inexpensive to produce fertilizers and pesticides in this fashion, since the product is efficient and can be produced in huge quantities. Petrochemical fertilizers are preferred over sustainable options (manure) for these reasons. Fossil fuels are also crucial for transportation of product, manufacturing, and for running tractors and harvesting equipment. It is estimated that every bushel of corn requires the equivalent of between one quarter and one third of a <b>U.S.</b> <b>gallon</b> of petroleum to grow (37 to 50 liters per metric ton). For every acre of corn, about 50 U.S. gallons of petroleum are needed (470 L/ha). The use of fossil fuel in farming is standard; without this relatively affordable and convenient fuel source aiding in the fertilization, pest resistance, harvesting and manufacturing corn crops would not meet a high enough yield to satisfy the needs of the farmer or the demands of the consumer.|$|E
25|$|Imperial {{units are}} still used in {{ordinary}} conversation. Today, Canadians typically use {{a mix of}} metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. However, {{the use of the}} metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per hundredweight (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening. Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units, although initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the Prairie Provinces. The size of most apartments, condominiums and houses continues to be described in square feet rather than square metres, and carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot. Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per 100km and statute miles per imperial gallon, leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per <b>US</b> <b>gallon</b> (neither country specifies which gallon is used). Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length (feet), train height (feet), capacity (tons), speed (mph), and trackage (miles).|$|E
