40|$|The study, {{focused on}} the European Union law, deals with the puzzling {{relationship}} between the prohibition of every discrimination founded on sex in employment (and social) matters (art. 157 TFEU, secondary EU law, and art. 23 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights) and the faculty, now recognized to the Member States by primary European law (art. 157 par. 4 TFEU, art. 23, par. 2 of the EU Charter) to provide the <b>under-represented</b> <b>sex</b> with special (compensatory) advantages. The question discussed in the essay is whether the case law of the European Court of Justice deems these "positive actions" as a normative exception to the prohibition of every discrimination (therefore of restrictive interpretation) or as a normative expression of the general principle of equality. At present the case law suggests an holistic approach. The equality principle, in that vein, is structured not only in a negative, but in a positive dimension too. The unwritten European Union law recognizes a substantial or "true" meaning of the equality, whose fulfilment is entrusted to the national (or European) legislator. However the negative dimension of the principle mandates a careful delimitation of the special privilege attributed to the <b>under-represented</b> <b>sex,</b> and may conveniently force (by virtue of the substantial strand of the equality) its extension to the disadvantaged person of the opposite sex...|$|E
40|$|Background : As {{the number}} of people with {{diabetes}} is increasing rapidly worldwide, a more thorough understanding of the psychosocial aspects of living with this condition has become an important health care priority. While our knowledge has grown substantially {{over the past two decades}} with respect to the physical, emotional and social difficulties that people with diabetes may encounter, many important issues remain to be elucidated. Under the umbrella of the Diabetes MILES (Management and Impact for Long-term Empowerment and Success) Study International Collaborative, Diabetes MILES – The Netherlands aims to examine how Dutch adults with diabetes manage their condition and how it affects their lives. Topics of special interest in Diabetes MILES - The Netherlands include subtypes of depression, Type D personality, mindfulness, sleep and sexual functioning. Methods/design : Diabetes MILES – The Netherlands was designed as a national online observational study among adults with diabetes. In addition to a main set of self-report measures, the survey consisted of five complementary modules to which participants were allocated randomly. From September to October 2011, a total of 3, 960 individuals with diabetes (40 % type 1, 53 % type 2) completed the battery of questionnaires covering a broad range of topics, including general health, self-management, emotional well-being and contact with health care providers. People with self-reported type 1 diabetes (specifically those on insulin pump therapy) were over-represented, as were those using insulin among respondents with self-reported type 2 diabetes. People from ethnic minorities were <b>under-represented.</b> The <b>sex</b> distribution was fairly equal in the total sample, participants spanned a broad age range (19 – 90 years), and diabetes duration ranged from recent diagnosis to living with the condition for over fifty years. Discussion : The Diabetes MILES Study enables detailed investigation of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes and an opportunity to put these findings in an international context. With several papers planned resulting from a pooled Australian-Dutch dataset and data collections planned in other countries, the Diabetes MILES Study International Collaborative will contribute substantially to identifying potentially unmet needs of those living with diabetes and to inform clinical research and care across the globe. <br /...|$|R
