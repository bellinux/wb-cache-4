50|$|Since 1991 {{when the}} {{original}} Australian UNAMIC contingent provided the communications network between the four Cambodian factions' military headquarters and the UNAMIC headquarters, {{the task of the}} Australians mushroomed under its <b>UNTAC</b> <b>mandate.</b> To achieve those tasks, the FCU based its RHQ in Phnom Penh (Pteah Kangaroo), along with the headquarters of its administrative squadron and 1 Sig Sqn (Pteah Australii). 2 Sig Sqn was based in the northern provincial capital of Battambang. The FCU was spread across 56 locations throughout Cambodia and was the only unit to serve in Cambodia to see more action than any other UN unit. Other major FCU locations included Siem Reap, Kampong Som, Banteay Meanchey, Khu, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Pailin and Sisophon.|$|E

50|$|Tributes {{were paid}} to the former King Norodom Sihanouk for helping to {{achieving}} peace, stability and genuine national reconciliation in the country. The Council recalled that in the Paris Agreements the transitional period would end when the elected Constituent Assembly approved a constitution and transformed itself into a legislative assembly and government. It also noted {{the request of the}} Cambodian interim joint administration to maintain <b>UNTAC's</b> <b>mandate</b> until a new government had been formed.|$|R

It emphasised {{the need for the}} elections to be held in a neutral political environment, requesting the UNTAC radio broadcast utility be established without delay with access to all Cambodian territory, also encouraging the Secretary-General and Special Representative {{to make use of the}} possibilities offered by <b>UNTAC's</b> <b>mandate,</b> including measures to improve the effectiveness of the civil police in resolving growing problems relating to the maintenance of law and order. The establishment of Radio UNTAC increasingly affected the political mood in the country.|$|R

On 10 November 1991 45 Australian Army personnel flew to Cambodia {{as part of}} Australias advanced party to UNAMIC. The advanced party established an Australian HQ and provided basic radio communications to the 4 military factions headquarters. Australia contributed a 65-strong communications unit to its precursor, the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC). The Australians (under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Russell Stuart) {{were among the first}} UN troops in Cambodia, to provide communications support to UNAMIC which was tasked to set in motion the peace process and pave the way for the deployment of <b>UNTAC.</b> UNAMIC's <b>mandate</b> ended in March 1992 and was absorbed into UNTAC at its establishment in United Nations Security Council Resolution 745.|$|R
500|$|On 23 October 1991, the Cambodian {{factions of}} the Supreme National Council, along with Vietnam and 15 member {{nations of the}} International Peace Conference on Cambodia, signed the Paris Peace Agreement. For the Cambodian people, two decades of {{continuous}} warfare and 13 years of civil war seemed to be over, although an atmosphere of uneasiness amongst {{the leaders of the}} Cambodian factions remained. In order to include the Khmer Rouge in the agreement, the major powers agreed to avoid using the word [...] "genocide" [...] to describe the actions of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea in the period between 1975 and 1979. As a result, Hun Sen criticised the Paris Agreement as being far from perfect, as it failed to remind the Cambodian people of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge regime. Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement established the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), in accordance with the UN Security Council’s Resolution 745, and gave <b>UNTAC</b> a broad <b>mandate</b> to supervise main policies and administration works until a Cambodian government was democratically elected.|$|R
