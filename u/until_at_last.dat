25|$|In early 1800, Régénérée left Rochefort with Africaine {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} to Alexandria. At the Action of 19 February 1801, HMS Phoebe, under Captain Robert Barlow, captured Africaine east of Gibraltar. However, Régénérée managed to complete her mission, sailing into Alexandria on 2 March, having eluded the British blockade. The day {{before she had}} passed through the British fleet answering signals and without arousing any suspicion, <b>until</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> she hoisted the French flag as she headed into the harbor.|$|E
25|$|In 1570–1571, Famagusta was {{the last}} stronghold in Venetian Cyprus to hold out against the Turks under Mustafa Pasha. It {{resisted}} a siege of thirteen months and a terrible bombardment, <b>until</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> the garrison surrendered. The Ottoman forces had lost 50,000 men, including Mustafa Pasha's son. Although the surrender terms had stipulated that the Venetian forces be allowed to return home, the Venetian commander, Marco Antonio Bragadin, was flayed alive, his lieutenant Tiepolo was hanged, and many other Christians were killed.|$|E
25|$|Retreating across Westchester County, Haslet's men won {{a victory}} over a corps of Loyalists at Mamaroneck, New York. At White Plains, on October 28, 1776, the Delaware Regiment again fought with Colonel William Smallwood's Marylanders, {{reinforcing}} militia placed on the strategic Chatterton's Hill. The local militia fled under the British attack, but Haslet and Smallwood fought on <b>until,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> they too yielded the ground. The Battle of White Plains was another British victory, {{but because of the}} difficulty in taking Chatterton's Hill, the price was great and the reward to the British was little.|$|E

The oxen {{seemed to have}} scented the water from afar, for they {{gradually}} became more animated, and quickened their pace of their own accord, <b>until</b> they <b>at</b> <b>last</b> broke into a run. Peterkin and I soon outstripped our party, and quite enjoyed the gallop.|$|R

25|$|Hetoum I (r. 1226–1270) made an {{alliance}} with the Mongols, sending his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in person. The Mongols then assisted with the defense of Cilicia from the Mamluks of Egypt, until the Mongols themselves converted to Islam. When Levon V died (1342), John of Lusignan was crowned king as Gosdantin IV; {{but he and his}} successors alienated the native Armenians by attempting to make them conform to the Roman Church, and by giving all posts of honor to Latins, <b>until</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> the kingdom, falling prey to internal dissensions, succumbed in 1375 to the attacks of the Egyptian Mamluks.|$|E
25|$|At first, Shui Ta only appears when Shen Teh is in a {{particularly}} desperate situation, but as {{the action of the}} play develops, Shen Teh becomes unable {{to keep up with the}} demands made on her and is overwhelmed by the promises she makes to others. Therefore, she is compelled to call on her cousin's services for longer periods <b>until</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> her true personality seems to be consumed by her cousin's severity. Where Shen Teh is soft, compassionate, and vulnerable, Shui Ta is unemotional and pragmatic, even vicious; it seems that only Shui Ta is made to survive in the world in which they live. In what seems no time at all, he has built her humble shop into a full-scale tobacco factory with many employees.|$|E
25|$|Merge sort takes {{advantage}} of the ease of merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list. It starts by comparing every two elements (i.e., 1 with 2, then 3 with 4...) and swapping them if the first should come after the second. It then merges each of the resulting lists of two into lists of four, then merges those lists of four, and so on; <b>until</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> two lists are merged into the final sorted list. Of the algorithms described here, this is the first that scales well to very large lists, because its worst-case running time is O(n log n). It is also easily applied to lists, not only arrays, as it only requires sequential access, not random access. However, it has additional O(n) space complexity, and involves a large number of copies in simple implementations.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, Berkeley, California banned CFC food containers. The {{following}} year, Suffolk County, New York {{became the}} first U.S. locality to ban polystyrene. However, legal challenges by the Society of the Plastics Industry kept it from going into effect <b>until</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> it was delayed when the Republican and Conservative parties became {{a majority of the}} county legislature. In the meantime, Berkeley {{became the first}} city to ban all foam food containers. As of 2006, about one hundred localities in the United States including Portland, Oregon and San Francisco currently have some sort of ban on polystyrene foam in restaurants. For instance, in 2007 Oakland, California required restaurants to switch to disposable food containers that will biodegrade if added to food compost. In 2013, San Jose became reportedly the largest city in the country to ban polystyrene foam food containers. Some communities have implemented wide polystyrene bans, such as Freeport, Maine, which did so in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Abbo {{named one}} of Edmund's killers as Hinguar, who can {{probably}} be identified with Ivarr inn beinlausi (Ivar the Boneless), son of Ragnar Lodbrok. After describing the horrific manner of Edmund's death, the Passio continued the story. [...] His severed head was thrown into the wood. As Edmund's followers went seeking, calling out [...] "Where are you, friend?" [...] the head answered, [...] "Here, here, here," [...] <b>until</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> they found it, clasped between a wolf's paws, protected from other animals and uneaten. The villagers then praised God and the wolf that served him. It walked tamely beside them, before vanishing back into the forest.|$|E
500|$|In 1789 and 1790 {{there had}} been a spate of highway and house robberies. Gangs of armed men had entered houses {{in the middle of the}} night and taken away all they could carry. Armed patrols were placed around the {{neighbourhood}} to little effect <b>until,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> a man named James Macnamara was arrested with three others for burglary at the Dog and Partridge Inn on Stretford Road. Macnamara was tried at Lancaster Assizes and sentenced to be hanged on Kersal Moor as a warning to other criminals. A large number of people came to watch the execution but, as Joseph Aston said in his Metrical Records of Manchester [...] "no one could suppose that the example had any use... as several persons had their pockets picked within sight of the gallows and the following night a house was broken into and robbed in Manchester".|$|E

500|$|Among the {{distinguishing}} features of Andriamanelo's reign was {{the expansion of}} his territory around the sacred hill of Alasora through a military campaign against the Vazimba to push these legendary, primitive first settlers of Madagascar toward {{the west of the}} island. After Andriamanelo had successfully expanded his kingdom to include Alasora to the south and Merimanjaka to the north, the continued presence of a Vazimba stronghold at Analamanga (located between the two halves of his realm and effectively separating them) posed too great a threat to the unity of his kingdom to allow the situation to stand. He resolved to capture Analamanga and drive the Vazimba from his territory, an ambition partially realized during his reign. Popular legend attributes Andriamanelo's military successes to several innovations, including the discovery of iron smelting and propagation of the iron-tipped spear [...] against the Vazimba who fought with weapons of clay. He also fortified his capital at Alasora by creating hadivory (dry moats), hadifetsy (defensive trenches) and vavahady (town gates protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier), thereby rendering the town more resistant to Vazimba attacks. However, his attempt to establish Merina dominance in the central Highlands was thwarted when he proved unable to seize Analamanga; this Vazimba stronghold would not fall <b>until</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> conquered by Andriamanelo's grandson, Andrianjaka.|$|E
