25|$|Emmet {{finds himself}} in the human world as a Lego minifigure unable to move. The events of the story are being played out by a little boy named Finn on his father's {{expansive}} Lego set in their basement. His father—"the Man Upstairs"—comes {{home from work and}} chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together (causing Lord Business' forces to regain the upper hand as a result). Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his perfectionism. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that he is special and has the power to change everything. Finn reconciles with his father, which plays out as Business having a change of heart, capping the Kragle, and <b>ungluing</b> his victims with mineral spirits. Emmet is hailed as a hero, and begins a relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.|$|E

5000|$|Wizards {{released}} a humor-themed Magic expansion set, <b>Unglued,</b> on 7 August 1998. Much of the set's humor came from meta-humor references {{at the game}} itself and its mechanics.

Because {{of the success of}} the set, designers began work on an <b>Unglued</b> sequel, named <b>Unglued</b> 2: The Obligatory Sequel.

50|$|In January 1999, Taylor {{began making}} guitars with a patented, bolt-on neck {{they called the}} NT (new technology) neck. It differs from other guitar necks by using one {{continuous}} piece of wood {{all the way to}} the 19th fret to support the fretboard. More common practice in guitar neck construction is to support the fretboard up to the fourteenth fret, and glue the unsupported portion to the soundboard. The NT neck fits into a pocket on the top of the guitar body, achieving the desired angle with small shims. Guitars sometimes require a neck angle realignment (neck reset). Taylor's system achieves this by changing the shims to adjust the neck angle. Prior to 1999, Taylor Guitars had a simpler bolt-on neck design. Those necks can also be adjusted without the more complex process of <b>ungluing</b> the neck joint.|$|E

5000|$|Lazzarini’s {{installation}} [...] "skulls" [...] {{was first}} {{exhibited in the}} Whitney Museum of American Art in the 2001 exhibition, [...] "Bitsreams," [...] and brought the artist into wider public visibility. The installation {{was made up of}} four sculptural variations based on a specific human skull, each mounted to one wall at eye level in an offset square room measuring fifteen by fifteen feet. Bathed in diffused fluorescent light, the shadows within the room heightened the works “image aspect” where “the walls of the gallery become a kind of uninflected visual field against which the form of each object is defined.” [...] The experience presented a new type of embodied viewing wherein “You feel the space around you begin to ripple, to bubble, to infold, as if it were becoming unstuck from the fixed coordinates of its three-dimensional extension. You soon become disoriented, as this <b>ungluing</b> of space becomes more intense.” [...] The intensification of the works' figure/ground relationships was brought to a new level with the installation of [...] "guns and knives" [...] at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut, which marked the first time that Lazzarini altered the physical space of the gallery to heighten the viewer's sense of disorientation.|$|E

She is an expert on Balkan, East European, and post-Soviet affairs, on intervention in civil wars, and on postconflict reconstruction. She's the author of two books, Balkan Tragedy: Chaos and Dissolution after the Cold War (Brookings Institution Press, 1995), and Socialist Unemployment: The Political Economy of Yugoslavia (Princeton Univ.

It is intellectual discourse at a high level.". Previously she was a Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, University of London, and a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution (1990-99).

5000|$|Each Ospedali Grandi {{usually had}} an {{orchestra}} {{of at least}} thirty to forty elements, all females (La Pietà's orchestra counted up to sixty) and competed with each other by hiring the best musicians in the city, promoting high quality concerts, and through such activities provided countless commissions for violin and other instruments makers {{to provide for the}} maintenance and repair of such instruments. These artisans were named [...] "liuter del loco".The office of [...] "liuter del loco" [...] guaranteed a constant flow of income: curating the instruments of an entire orchestra was a burdensome activity which required the work of more than one person; instruments had to be picked up, continuously repaired because of breakage and <b>ungluing</b> from use, and sometimes instruments had to be built. The responsible violin maker also had to supply strings for the entire orchestra, keep an accounting book detailing all operations, and issue semi-annual or annual invoices. These invoices, or ‘policies’ as they were called at the time, were handwritten by the appointed violin maker and had to be approved by the [...] "maestre del coro" [...] or the maestro di cappella - who would usually be granted a discount - before being paid by the hospital administration.

We have performed simulations with stress-free {{top and bottom}} boundaries for several values of Taylor number (5 ≤ Ta ≤ 50) near the instability onset. We observe a single homoclinic <b>ungluing</b> bifurcation, marked by the spontaneous breaking of a larger limit cycle into two limit cycles with the variation of the reduced Rayleigh number r for smaller values of Ta (< 25). A pair of homoclinic bifurcations, instead of one bifurcation, is observed with variation of r for slightly higher values of Ta (25 ≤ Ta ≤ 50) in the same fluid dynamical system. The variation of the bifurcation threshold with Ta is also investigated. We have also constructed a low-dimensional model which qualitatively captures {{the dynamics of the}} system near the homoclinic bifurcations for low rotation rates. The model is used to study the unfolding of bifurcations and the variation of the homoclinic bifurcation threshold with Pr. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

40|$|We {{study in}} great detail a system of three first-order {{ordinary}} differential equations describing the behaviour of a nuclear spin generator (NSG). This system, not much referred to in literature, displays a large variety of behaviours, both regular and chaotic. Existence of periodic solutions is proved for certain ranges of parameters. Stability criteria for periodic solutions are given. The system is shown here to have a codimension-two bifurcation point: a Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation point. Chaotic behaviours arise from (i) period-doubling bifurcations, (ii) intermittency route, and (iii) homoclinic bifurcations. The gluing of strange attractors and their <b>ungluing,</b> with periodic and chaotic behaviours in the intervening parametric range, not reported earlier for any chaotic system, are shown to occur for the NSG system. Also, in certain parameteric intervals, coexisting attractors and coexisting strange attractors are found to occur.
