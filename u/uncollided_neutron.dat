40|$|A {{measurement}} of the <b>uncollided</b> <b>neutron</b> flux passing through a sample containing a stochastic mixture of tungsten and sulfur grains has been performed using neutron resonance transmission analysis in the 3 - 200 eV energy region. The impact of the heterogeneous characteristic of the sample is shown based on {{a comparison of the}} measurement with a calculated transmission spectrum of a homogeneous sample, which was verified by a measurement with a homogeneous metallic disc. By using a single strong resonance of tungsten, the particle self-shielding factor between 0. 2 - 0. 9 was directly measured. The experimental data have been compared with model calculations using the Markovian Levermore-Pomraning model. The measured transmission has been used to determine the effective characteristic chord length and volume fraction of the tungsten grains within the sample. JRC.

40|$|An exact {{solution}} to the monoenergetic Boltzmann equation is obtained for {{the case of a}} plane isotropic burst of neutrons introduced at the interface separating two adjacent, dissimilar, semi-infinite media. The method of solution used is to remove the time dependence by a Laplace transformation, solve the transformed equation by the normal mode expansion method, and then invert to recover the time dependence. The general result is expressed as a sum of definite, multiple integrals, one of which contains the <b>uncollided</b> wave of <b>neutrons</b> originating at the source plane. It is possible to obtain a simplified form for the solution at the interface, and certain numerical calculations are made there. The interface flux in two adjacent moderators is calculated and plotted as a function of time for several moderator materials. For each case it is found that the flux decay curve has an asymptotic slope given accurately by diffusion theory. Furthermore, the interface current is observed to change directions when the scattering and absorption cross sections of the two moderator materials are related in a certain manner. More specifically, the reflection process in two adjacent moderators appears to depend initially on the scattering properties and for long times on the absorption properties of the media. This analysis contains both the single infinite and semi-infinite medium problems as special cases. The results in these two special cases provide a check on the accuracy of the general solution since they agree with solutions of these problems obtained by separate analyses. ...|$|R
