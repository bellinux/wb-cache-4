Although it does not classify utility definition, colours or symbols, the Malaysian standard does specify an accuracy ±10 cm for both horizontal and vertical readings. The Standard is supported by the Malaysian government but is not backed by an Association or governing body.|$|E

40|$|Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) {{is one of}} the trenchless technologies; {{widely used}} for {{subsurface}} utility detection and mapping. However, in the context of subsurface <b>utility</b> <b>mapping,</b> constraints of achieving specific accuracy requirements so far have not been addressed by each system manufacturer and users. This research investigates the utilization of GPR for subsurface <b>utility</b> <b>mapping,</b> with the following specific objectives: (i) to design and built a calibration site for analysing locational and detectability accuracies of GPR; (ii) to examine and analyse the effects of GPR data acquisition approaches to the locational and detectability accuracies; (iii) to characterize GPR backscatter for recognition of utility’s material based on digital image processing techniques for retrieving the uniqueness of backscatters from respective utilities, and (iv) to examine and model GPR backscatters constraints for detecting and mapping stacked subsurface utilities in both vertical and horizontal orientations. Dual frequencies (250 and 700 MHz) GPR system was used in this study, experimented in both lab controlled and in-situ environments with settings of the system and scene parameters. Optimum values obtained in the lab for both system and scene parameters were then adopted for acquisition of data from in-situ measurement and also used in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) numerical modelling for validating the results of the study. Results of this study contributed three main findings: (i) the GPR locational and detectability accuracies for subsurface <b>utility</b> <b>mapping</b> are directly proportional to the data acquisition scanning techniques, where the ‘along-pipe’ scanning, which is rarely practised in the industry, yields the best locational and detectability accuracies, confirming to Quality Level A utility data; (ii) GPR backscatters with appropriate treatment can yield unique backscatter signature for recognition of utility’s material, hence, opening a platform for new valuable addition to the GPR application for utility’s material recognition besides utility detection and localization of buried utility; and (iii) the locational and detectability error trend and constraints of GPR measurements within crowded subsurface utility infrastructures yield a “best practice” procedure for determining the safe buffer zone for maintenance works; very crucial aspects in installation of new utility infrastructure and detecting aging utility...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{tools for}} {{estimating}} utilities use clinical trial data from general health status models, {{such as the}} 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36). A disease-specific model may be more appropriate. The objective {{of this study was}} to apply a disease-specific <b>utility</b> <b>mapping</b> function for schizophrenia to data from a large, 1 -year, open-label study of long-acting risperidone and to compare its performance with an SF- 36 -based <b>utility</b> <b>mapping</b> function. Methods Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder by DSM-IV criteria received 25, 50, or 75 mg long-acting risperidone every 2 weeks for 12 months. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and SF- 36 were used to assess efficacy and health-related quality of life. Movement disorder severity was measured using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS); data concerning other common adverse effects (orthostatic hypotension, weight gain) were collected. Transforms were applied to estimate utilities. Results A total of 474 patients completed the study. Long-acting risperidone treatment was associated with a utility gain of 0. 051 using the disease-specific function. The estimated gain using an SF- 36 -based mapping function was smaller: 0. 0285. Estimates of gains were only weakly correlated (r = 0. 2). Because of differences in scaling and variance, the requisite sample size for a randomized trial to confirm observed effects is much smaller for the disease-specific mapping function (156 versus 672 total subjects). Conclusion Application of a disease-specific mapping function was feasible. Differences in scaling and precision suggest the clinically based mapping function has greater power than the SF- 36 -based measure to detect differences in utility. </p...|$|E

40|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) {{is widely}} used in subsurface <b>utility</b> <b>mapping</b> for extracting the position (x, y) and depth (z) information of the utility.

40|$|Keeping {{track of}} {{underground}} utilities through maps or real physical signs {{is essential for}} their maintenance and quick repairs, whenever required, without causing much obstruction to day to day life. It is not uncommon that maps are misplaced or real physical signs are destroyed. In such situations, digging and excavation becomes unavoidable during repair works. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) {{is one of the}} non invasive methods which now are being applied for detection, ranging and characterization of subsurface buried objects. GPR employs radar pulses, sends them into ground, then get back scattered energy from dielectric discontinuities in the subsurface. Frequency of antennae determine their capacity to detect and resolve the buried objects (depth of penetration is worth a mention). Hence, 400 MHz and 200 MHz frequency antennae are generally used for <b>utility</b> <b>mapping</b> at shallow depths up to 4 to 5 meters. GPR response to buried objects is very much dependent upon buried object locations, their constituents, their surroundings and antennae properties. It is very crucial to have a database of GPR responses corresponding to various influencing factors over their ranges of variability either by experimental or simulation studies. In the present work, an attempt has been made t...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{evaluation}} {{conducted in}} terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) provides information that decision makers find useful {{in many parts of}} the world. Ideally, clinical studies designed to assess the effectiveness of health technologies would include outcome measures that are directly linked to health utility to calculate QALYs. Often this does not happen, and even when it does, clinical studies may be insufficient for a cost-utility assessment. Mapping can solve this problem. It uses an additional data set to estimate the relationship between outcomes measured in clinical studies and health utility. This bridges the evidence gap between available evidence on the effect of a health technology in one metric and the requirement for decision makers to express it in a different one (QALYs). In 2014, ISPOR established a Good Practices for Outcome Research Task Force for mapping studies. This task force report provides recommendations to analysts undertaking mapping studies, those that use the results in cost-utility analysis, and those that need to critically review such studies. The recommendations cover all areas of mapping practice: the selection of data sets for the mapping estimation, model selection and performance assessment, reporting standards, and the use of results including the appropriate reflection of variability and uncertainty. This report is unique because it takes an international perspective, is comprehensive in its coverage of the aspects of mapping practice, and reflects the current state of the art.

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{can provide}} centimetre-level {{positioning}} accuracy in “open-sky” environments. However, GPS coordinates become unavailable in difficult urban, suburban and rural environments because the GPS signals may be partly or completely blocked by trees and buildings. Applications such as underground asset mapping or locating unexploded ordnances require a “seamless” precise navigation capability even under trees and across all terrain. In {{the case of}} buried utilities (pipes, cables, conduits, etc.), the need to know “what is buried where ” is well recognised for both maintenance and planning purposes. Lack of accurate geolocation knowledge can result in unexpected costs and serious property damage. In order to ultimately produce a 3 D model of buried infrastructure, {{it is necessary to}} develop “non-contact ” mapping-of-the-underground systems and associated high accuracy urban navigation. In an attempt to address the demands for high accuracy navigation to support man-portable, groundpenetrating imaging systems, this paper describes an integrated system based on the “triple-integration” of GPS, inertial navigation systems (INS) and the recently developed RF-based navigation system “Locata”. Although traditional GPS/INS integrated systems can bridge relatively short GPS gaps, its capability is heavily dependent on the accuracy (and ultimately the cost) of the INS. The Locata system can broadcast strong time-synchronised ranging signals over an area where GPS satellite geometry is poor or the signal availability is limited. This paper describes preliminary results from the triple-integration of GPS/INS/Locata, and discusses its suitability for the navigation demands of underground <b>utility</b> <b>mapping</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Mobile mapping {{has been}} the subject of {{significant}} research and development by several research teams over the past decade. A mobile mapping system consists mainly of a moving platform, navigation sensors, and mapping sensors. The mobile platform may be a land vehicle, a vessel, or an aircraft. Generally, the navigation sensors, such as GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers, vehicle wheel sensors, and INS (Inertial Navigation System), provide both the track of the vehicle and positional and orientational information of the mapping sensors. Objects to be surveyed are sensed directly by mapping sensors, for instance CCD (Charge Coupled Device) cameras, laser rangers, and radar sensors. Since the orientation parameters of the mapping sensors are estimated directly by the navigation sensors, complicated computations such as photogrammetric triangulation are greatly simplified or avoided. Spatial information of the objects is extracted directly from the georeferenced mapping sensor data by integrating navigation sensor data. Mobile mapping technology has evolved to a stage which allows mapping and GIS industries to apply it in order to obtain high flexibility in data acquisition, more information with less time and effort, and high productivity. In addition, a successful extension of this technology to helicopter- borne and airborne systems will provide a powerful tool for large scale and medium scale spatial data acquisition and database updating. This paper provides a systematic introduction to the use of mobile mapping technology for spatial data acquisition. Issues related to the basic principle, data processing, automation, achievable accuracies and a break down of errors are given.
