5|$|The {{trial judge}} failed {{to conduct a}} voir dire {{sufficient}} to impanel an <b>unbiased</b> jury and improperly failed to excuse several jurors for cause.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, best linear <b>unbiased</b> {{prediction}} (BLUP) {{techniques used}} to estimate the genetic merit of stud cattle (for example, estimated breeding values (EBVs) and expected progeny differences (EPDs)) will be incorrect because they assume that no dominant genes contribute to modelled traits.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013 Bayern was the first club to give {{financial}} support to the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation. The foundation researches the living environment LGBT people, and developed an education concept to facilitate <b>unbiased</b> dealing with LGBT themes in football.|$|E
5|$|The unbiasedness {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} given conditions of rational expectations and risk neutrality, the {{forward exchange rate}} is an <b>unbiased</b> predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Without introducing a foreign exchange risk premium (due to the assumption of risk neutrality), the following equation illustrates the unbiasedness hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a wave of}} {{political}} reforms in the late 1990s, Antara began to produce its reporting independently {{of the government and}} was reorganized as a state-owned enterprise in 2007. However, media scholars argue that a lengthy relationship with the government makes it difficult for the agency to become an <b>unbiased</b> news organization. Antara celebrated its 75th anniversary on 13December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified ahead of time as required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an <b>unbiased,</b> court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E
5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an <b>unbiased</b> predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E
5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme. The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging it {{made it hard to}} find an <b>unbiased</b> jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front of}} County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because of the nature of the evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E
5|$|No chronicler {{for this}} period is entirely {{trustworthy}} or <b>unbiased,</b> often because their accounts were written {{to support a}} particular cause, {{but it is clear}} that most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of Edward. The Polychronicon, Vita Edwardi Secundi, Vita et Mors Edwardi Secundi and the Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon for example all condemned the King's personality, habits and choice of companions. Other records from his reign show criticism of Edward by his contemporaries, including the Church and members of his own household. Political songs were written about him, complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government. Later in the 14th century, some chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker and Thomas Ringstead, rehabilitated Edward, presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint, although this tradition died out in later years.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an <b>unbiased</b> predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|In its {{simplest}} form, the bound {{states that}} the variance of any <b>unbiased</b> estimator {{is at least as}} high as the inverse of the Fisher information. An <b>unbiased</b> estimator which achieves this lower bound is said to be (fully) efficient. Such a solution achieves the lowest possible mean squared error among all <b>unbiased</b> methods, and is therefore the minimum variance <b>unbiased</b> (MVU) estimator. However, in some cases, no <b>unbiased</b> technique exists which achieves the bound. This may occur even when an MVU estimator exists.|$|E
25|$|Sky News {{operates}} under United Kingdom broadcasting regulations {{which require}} impartial, <b>unbiased</b> coverage {{and prevent the}} channel from being encrypted in the UK. The channel is viewed by some in the media establishment as an impartial and <b>unbiased</b> provider of news.|$|E
25|$|An <b>unbiased</b> {{random walk}} (in {{any number of}} dimensions) {{is an example of}} a martingale.|$|E
25|$|Between two {{estimator}}s {{of a given}} parameter, the {{one with}} lower mean squared error {{is said to be}} more efficient. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be <b>unbiased</b> if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically <b>unbiased</b> if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter.|$|E
25|$|This {{estimator}} is <b>unbiased</b> up to {{the terms}} of order n−1, and is called the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimator}} can be <b>unbiased</b> but not consistent. For example, for an iid sample {x,..., x} {{one can use}} T(X) = x as the estimator of {{the mean}} E. Note that here the sampling distribution of T {{is the same as}} the underlying distribution (for any n, as it ignores all points but the first), so E = E and it is <b>unbiased,</b> but it does not converge to any value.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} distribution for total distance {{covered in a}} random walk (biased or <b>unbiased)</b> will tend toward a normal distribution.|$|E
25|$|Since each {{observation}} has expectation λ so {{does this}} sample mean. Therefore, the maximum likelihood estimate is an <b>unbiased</b> estimator of λ. It {{is also an}} efficient estimator, i.e. its estimation variance achieves the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB). Hence it is minimum-variance <b>unbiased.</b> Also it can be proved that the sum (and hence the sample mean {{as it is a}} one-to-one function of the sum) is a complete and sufficient statistic for λ.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{condition}} that the errors are uncorrelated with the predictor variables, LLSQ yields <b>unbiased</b> estimates, but even under that condition NLLSQ estimates are generally biased.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the term}} n−1 is called Bessel's correction, and it is also used in sample {{covariance}} and the sample standard deviation (the square root of variance). The square root is a concave function and thus introduces negative bias (by Jensen's inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) is biased. The <b>unbiased</b> estimation of standard deviation is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term n−1.5 yields an almost <b>unbiased</b> estimator.|$|E
25|$|However, if a {{sequence}} of estimators is <b>unbiased</b> and converges to a value, then it is consistent, as it must converge to the correct value.|$|E
25|$|Rounding to {{the nearest}} integer with a {{probability}} dependent on the proximity as follows is called stochastic rounding and will give an <b>unbiased</b> result on average.|$|E
25|$|Consider now a {{function}} of the unknown parameter: an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include sample mean, <b>unbiased</b> sample variance and sample covariance.|$|E
25|$|The {{statistical}} {{relationship between}} the error terms and the regressors {{plays an important role}} in determining whether an estimation procedure has desirable sampling properties such as being <b>unbiased</b> and consistent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>unbiased</b> sample {{variance}} is a U-statistic for the function ƒ(y1,y2) =(y1−y2)2/2, {{meaning that it}} is obtained by averaging a 2-sample statistic over 2-element subsets of the population.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a close}} {{connection}} between the description of quantum states {{in terms of the}} Wigner function and a method of quantum states reconstruction in terms of mutually <b>unbiased</b> bases.|$|E
25|$|If both {{endpoints}} are unknown, {{then the}} mid-range is an <b>unbiased</b> (and hence UMVU) estimator of {{the midpoint of}} the interval (here equivalently the population median, average, or mid-range).|$|E
25|$|OSS Watch {{is not an}} {{advocacy}} group. Instead it seeks to provide rounded and <b>unbiased</b> advice and guidance, both for organisations selecting software solutions, and for those creating software.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, the TMRCA {{estimated}} from {{a relatively}} small sample of viral genetic sequences is an asymptotically <b>unbiased</b> estimate for {{the time that the}} viral population was founded in the host population.|$|E
25|$|If the {{assumption}} of normality is replaced by assumptions of homoscedasticity and uncorrelatedness of errors, and if one still assumes zero mean, then the Gauss–Markov theorem entails that the solution is the minimal <b>unbiased</b> estimator.|$|E
25|$|The Rao–Blackwell theorem, {{a result}} which yields {{a process for}} finding the best {{possible}} <b>unbiased</b> estimator (in the sense of having minimal mean squared error). The MLE is often a good starting place for the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} sex marking for Esperanto nouns is {{frequently}} criticised for being asymmetric and male biased. In contrast Novial has one symmetric, <b>unbiased</b> system for both nouns and pronouns which marks either male, female, epicene or inanimate.|$|E
25|$|In a {{deep and}} liquid market, supply and demand would be {{expected}} to balance out at a price which represents an <b>unbiased</b> expectation of the future price of the actual asset and so be given by the simple relationship.|$|E
25|$|Though non-parametric, L-estimators are {{frequently}} used for parameter estimation, {{as indicated by}} the name, though they must often be adjusted to yield an <b>unbiased</b> consistent estimator. The choice of L-estimator and adjustment depend on the distribution whose parameter is being estimated.|$|E
25|$|Karen Mercury's {{historical}} fiction The Four Quarters of the World (Medallion Press, 2006) depicts {{the rise and}} fall of Tewodros as seen through the eyes of his European captives, using primary sources from eyewitnesses to create an <b>unbiased</b> portrait of the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|The Cramér–Rao bound {{can also}} be used to bound the {{variance}} of biased estimators of given bias. In some cases, a biased approach can result in both a variance and a mean squared error that are below the <b>unbiased</b> Cramér–Rao lower bound; see estimator bias.|$|E
