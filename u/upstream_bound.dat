40|$|Positive {{control of}} the {{wild-type}} Klebsiella pneumoniae nifH promoter by the NifA protein requires that NifA is bound at the upstream activator sequence (UAS). By introducing base substitutions at - 15 to - 17 in the RNA polymerase recognition sequence of the nifH promoter, positive control by a form of NifA unable to bind to the UAS was greatly increased {{when compared to the}} wild-type promoter. Transcriptional activation still required the rpoN encoded sigma factor and was initiated at the same nucleotide as in the wild-type promoter. Mutations at - 15 to - 17 suppressed the requirement that the UAS should be located on the correct face of the DNA helix with respect to the RNA polymerase recognition sequence in order that titration of NifA and efficient activation occur. This result supports the suggestion that <b>upstream</b> <b>bound</b> NifA interacts with the RNA polymerase-RpoN complex. To examine the minimal carboxy terminal sequences required for the positive control function of NifA a series of carboxy terminal deletions were constructed. Efficient positive control at a UAS-independent promoter was only observed in deletions which did not extend beyond the proposed boundary separating the carboxy terminal NifA DNA-binding domain from its central domain...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} mechanisms {{used by the}} HCMV IE proteins {{to activate}} transcription. We {{have shown that the}} IEPs act as promiscuous co-activators of transcription. IEP 86 shows preferences in activating simple promoters by associating with multiple <b>upstream</b> <b>bound</b> factors. IEP 72 synergizes with IEP 86 without directly interacting with these factors. These mechanisms are conserved in the activation of complex viral and cellular promoters by the IEPs. The IEPs bridge to the basal complex by multiple interactions with TFIID, in a TAF-like fashion. IEP 72 and IEP 86 expressed during viral infection co-purify with TFIID over phosphocellulose, and co-immunoprecipitate with TFIID. IEP 72 and IEP 86 contact hTAFII 130 simultaneously, and simultaneous contact is required to fully rescue the ts transcriptional defect in TAFII 250 in the BHK- 21 cell line, ts 13. The IEPs do not rescue the defect in cell cycle progression in these cells. This effect is correlated with the inability of the IEPs to down-regulate the promoter of the cell cycle inhibitor p 21 /WAF 1 /CIP 1. Regardless of the inability to rescue the cell cycle defect, IEP expression in ts 13 cells at the non-permissive temperature rescues the cells from apoptosis, and this effect is independent of transcriptional activation. The promiscuous activity of the IEPs is thus due to their ability to co-activate transcription in a TAF-like fashion. We have taken the approach of studying protein-protein interactions between the IEPs and cellular proteins {{in order to understand the}} observed activities of the IEPs. The thesis has been guided by our lab 2 ̆ 7 s previous investigations into the functions of SV 40 large T antigen, and we have found that the IEPs are qualitatively very similar in mechanism to large T. However, the IEPs have not been independently correlated with transformation in any model system, so the comparison of the IEPs with T antigen also provides an opportunity to contrast the similarities between the mechanisms of the proteins with differences in their effects on host cell metabolism. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) early gene product, large T antigen, promiscuously {{activates}} simple promoters containing a TATA box or initiator element {{and at least}} one upstream transcription factor binding site. Previous studies have suggested that promoter activation requires that large T antigen interact with both the basal transcription complex and the <b>upstream</b> <b>bound</b> factor, a mechanism of activation similar to that proposed for TBP-associated factors (TAFs). This study shows genetic and biochemical evidence suggesting that large T antigen performs a TAF-like function. In the ts 13 cell line, large T antigen can rescue the temperature sensitive (ts) defect in TAFII 250. Large T antigen also co-purified and co-immunoprecipitated with purified TFIID from SV 40 -infected α 3 cells. These data lead us to believe that transcriptional activation of promoters by large T antigen results from its performing a TAF-like function in a complex with TFIID. ^ We investigated whether T antigen affected steps in preinitiation complex assembly. In in vitro complex assembly assays we found that T antigen stabilizes the formation of the TBP-TFIIA complex on the promoter. Stabilization is highly sensitive to the specific sequence context of the TATA element and correlates with T antigen 2 ̆ 7 s ability or inability to activate promoters containing these TATA elements. ^ TBP is common to the basal transcription complexes of all three RNA polymerases. Large T antigen can interact with the TBP-TAFII, complexes, TFIID (Damania and Alwine, 1996), and with the TBP-TAFI complex, SL 1 (Zhai et al., 1997). In both cases these interactions are critical for transcriptional activation, therefore we investigated whether large T antigen can affect polymerase III transcription. Large T antigen activated the TATA-containing pol III promoter, U 6, but not the TATA-less VAI promoter. Mutants of large T antigen that could not activate polymerase II promoters also failed to activate the U 6 promoter. Large T antigen interacted with the pol III transcription factor TFIIIB (hBRF), as well as with two polymerase III specific TAFs. Hence, large T antigen interacts with the TBP-containing basal complexes in the pol I, II and III transcription machineries and uses this common mechanism to activate transcription in the cell. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{replaced}} the required TATA {{element of a}} yeast gal-his 3 promoter by a binding site for GCN 4, a protein that normally activates transcription when <b>bound</b> <b>upstream</b> of a TATA element. Surprisingly, GCN 4 efficiently activates his 3 transcription from wild-type initiation sites, though in a pattern associated with constitutive his 3 transcription rather than GCN 4 upstream activation through a TATA element. Transcriptional stimulation by GCN 4 requires both the DNA-binding domain and the acidic activation function but is not affected by changing the spacing or helical relationship between the GCN 4 binding site and the mRNA start sites. GCN 4 is not sufficient for this TATA-independent activation; a sequence in the gal fragment distinct from the GAL 4 binding sites is also required. Thus, GCN 4 functions both when <b>bound</b> <b>upstream</b> of a TATA element and also when bound at {{the position of a}} TATA element. In the latter case, we suggest the possibility that GCN 4 might be able to stimulate transcription by an alternate mechanism that does not involve a conventional TATA-binding transcription factor...|$|R

40|$|The {{simian virus}} 40 large T antigen is a {{promiscuous}} transcriptional activator of many viral and cellular promoters. We {{show that the}} promoter structure necessary for T antigen-mediated transcriptional activation is very simple. A TATA or initiator element is required, {{in addition to an}} upstream factor-binding site, which can be quite variable. We found that promoters containing an SP 1 -, ATF-, AP 1 -, or TEF-I-binding site, in conjunction with a TATA element, can all be activated in the presence of T antigen. In addition, preference for specific TATA elements was indicated. Promoters containing the HSP 70 TATA element functioned better than those with the adenovirus E 2 TATA element, while promoters containing the simian virus 40 (SV 40) early TATA element failed to be activated. In addition, simple promoters containing the initiator element from the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene could be activated by T antigen. The SV 40 late promoter, a primary target for T antigen transcriptional activation, conforms to this simple promoter structure. The region from which most late transcripts initiate contains a cluster of initiator-like elements (SV 40 nucleotides [nt] 250 to 335) forming an initiator region (IR). This lies downstream of the previously described octamer-TEF element (SV 40 nt 199 to 218) which contains the TEF-I-binding sites shown to be necessary for T antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the late promoter. We show that a simple late promoter made up of IR sequences and octamer-TEF element-containing sequences is transcriptionally activated by T antigen. These experiments also showed that specific sequences in the IR, SV 40 nt 272 to 294, are particularly important for late promoter activation. Previous findings (M. C. Gruda, J. M. Zablotny, J. H. Xiao, I. Davidson, and J. C. Alwine, Mol. Cell. Biol. 13 : 961 - 969, 1993) suggested that T antigen could mediate transcriptional activation through interaction with the TATA-binding protein, as well as <b>upstream</b> <b>bound</b> transcription factors. Our present data are predicted by this model and suggest that at least one mechanism by which the T antigen manifests promiscuous transcriptional activation is its ability to interact with numerous transcription factors in a simple promoter context...|$|E

In order to advance the available time of infiltration screen, we place a slit dam to displace the traditional check dam.

Complexes at P 1 were studied by exploiting a P 2 - mutant and complexes at P 2 were studied with a P 1 -mutant. We have identified the precise location of alpha binding in both binary RNA polymerase-galP 1 and RNA polymerase-P 2 complexes from the effects of deletion of the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit: alpha binds to different sites at the upstream end of each complex. Transcription initiation at galP 1 can be activated by the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). Addition of CRP to the RNA polymerase-galP 1 complex displaces the C-terminal domain of alpha, which then binds to a different site upstream of CRP in the ternary CRP-RNA polymerase-galP 1 complex. Thus, the C-terminal domain of alpha can occupy three different sites at the gal operon regulatory region. We have also examined the effect of disrupting the Activating Region of CRP on interactions between CRP and the C-terminal domain of alpha in ternary CRP-RNA polymerase-galP 1 complexes. Footprinting experiments show that these substitutions interfere with the contact between CRP and alpha but do not affect the position of alpha binding to its site <b>upstream</b> of <b>bound</b> CRP...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a coarse-grained, particle-based spatial simulator, suited for large signal transduction models.

The particles diffuse inside the cellular compartment and the colliding complexes stochastically interact according to a rule-based scheme. Since rules operate over molecular motifs (instead of full complexes), the rule set compactly describes a combinatorial or even infinite number of reactions.

In this report, we investigate the mechanism of Fis-dependent activation of transcription. We show that stimulation of rrnB P 1 transcription by Fis can occur on linear DNA templates and does not require DNA upstream of the promoter-proximal Fis site I. Mutants of Fis defective for Hin-mediated recombination have been isolated previously and have defined an N-terminal domain required for DNA inversion by Hin {{in addition to the}} C-terminal domain which is required for DNA binding. Several of these mutants were found to be defective in stimulation of rrnB P 1 transcription in vivo and in vitro. Activation-defective mutants fall into three classes: those that fail to bind to the upstream activation region, those that bind but fail to bend the DNA normally, and those that bind and bend but still fail to activate transcription. We conclude that it is unlikely that Fis functions by simply bringing <b>upstream</b> sequences or <b>bound</b> factors into the proximity of RNA polymerase to activate transcription. Rather, the data are most easily interpreted in terms of transcription activation by direct interactions between Fis and RNA polymerase, requiring precise positioning of the two proteins facilitated by bending of the DNA binding site...|$|R
40|$|YY 1 is a C 2 H 2 -type {{zinc finger}} {{transcription}} factor {{that is a}} member of the human GLI-Kruppel family of proteins. YY 1 represses transcription when <b>bound</b> <b>upstream</b> of transcription initiation sites. The repression can be relieved by adenovirus E 1 A and activation of target genes occurs. We have mapped the repression domain of YY 1 to the C-terminal region, overlapping Its DNA binding domain. We have also Identified an activation domain within the first 69 amlno acids of YY 1. The YY 1 C-terminal region is involved in physical Interactions with E 1 A and is functionally necessary for YY 1 to respond to E 1 A. This suggests that relief of YY 1 repression by E 1 A involves YY 1 -E 1 A physical interactions. Although not involved in Interactions with E 1 A, the N-terminal activation domain is also necessary for YY 1 to respond to E 1 A. Presumably, under repressing conditions, the activa-tion domain Is masked by the conformation of YY 1, but is released upon binding of E 1 A and is required to subsequently activate transcription. Consistent with this hypothesis, an ATF- 2 -YY 1 chimeric protein containing the activation domain of ATF- 2 and the C-terminal two-thirds of YY 1 is still a potent repressor. Unlike the mutant YY 1 lacking its own N-terminal activation domain, the chimeric protein is fully respon-sive to E 1 A...|$|R
40|$|Pax 7 {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of {{skeletal muscle}} stem cells and is required along with Pax 3 to generate skeletal muscle precursors. We have identified a collection of genes induced by either Pax 3 or Pax 7 in C 2 C 12 muscle cells. Two notable Pax 3 / 7 targets are the inhibitory helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) 2 and Id 3, {{both of which are}} coordinately expressed with Pax 7 in quiescent satellite cells and are induced in quiescent C 2 C 12 myogenic cells after ectopic expression of either Pax 3 or Pax 7. Ectopic Pax 7 activates expression of a luciferase reporter driven by the Id 3 promoter, and maximal induction of this reporter requires a conserved Pax 7 binding site located upstream of the Id 3 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that Pax 7 is <b>bound</b> <b>upstream</b> of the Id 3 promoter in quiescent satellite cells. In addition, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Pax 7 expression in cultured satellite cells coordinately decreased both Id 2 and Id 3 expression. Together, these findings indicate that Id 3 is a direct transcriptional target for Pax 7 in quiescent satellite cells, and they suggest that Pax 7 acts to block premature differentiation of quiescent satellite cells by inducing the expression of Id 2 and Id 3, which in turn may act to block either the precocious induction of myogenic basic (b) HLH proteins, the activity of myogenic bHLH proteins, or both...|$|R
40|$|Bedforms {{related to}} Froude-supercritical flow, such as cyclic steps, are {{increasingly}} frequently observed in contemporary fluvial and marine sedimentary systems. However, {{the number of}} observations of sedimentary structures formed by supercritical flow bedforms remains limited. The low number of observations might be caused by poor constrains on criteria to recognise these associated deposits. This study provides a detailed quantification on the mechanics of a fluvial cyclic step system, and their depositional signature. A computational fluid-dynamics model is employed to acquire a depth-resolved image of a cyclic step system. New insights into the mechanics of cyclic steps shows that: (i) the hydraulic jump is, in itself, erosional; (ii) there are periods over which the flow is supercritical throughout {{and there is no}} hydraulic jump, which plays {{a significant role in the}} morphodynamic behaviour of cyclic steps; and (iii) that the depositional signature of cyclic steps varies with rate of aggradation. Previous work has shown that strongly aggradational cyclic steps, where most of the deposited sediment is not reworked, create packages of backsets, <b>bound</b> <b>upstream</b> and downstream by erosive surfaces. Here the modelling work is focussed on less aggradational conditions and more transportational systems. The depositional signature in such systems is dominated by an amalgamation of concave-up erosional surfaces and low-angle foresets and backsets creating lenticular bodies. The difference between highly aggradational cyclic steps and low aggradation steps can be visible in outcrop both by the amount of erosional surfaces, as well as the ratio of foreset to backset, with backsets being indicative of more aggradation...|$|R
40|$|Sequencing of a cellulosome-integrating {{gene cluster}} in Acetivibrio cellulolyticus was completed. The cluster {{contains}} four tandem scaffoldin genes (scaA, scaB, scaC, and scaD) <b>bounded</b> <b>upstream</b> and downstream, respectively, by a presumed cellobiose phosphorylase and a nucleotide methylase. The sequences and properties of scaA, scaB, and scaC were reported previously, {{and those of}} scaD are reported here. The scaD gene encodes an 852 -residue polypeptide that includes a signal peptide, three cohesins, and a C-terminal S-layer homology (SLH) module. The calculated molecular weight of the mature ScaD is 88, 960; a 67 -residue linker segment separates cohesins 1 and 2, and two � 30 -residue linkers separate cohesin 2 from 3 and cohesin 3 from the SLH module. The presence of an SLH module in ScaD indicates its role as an anchoring protein. The first two ScaD cohesins can be classified as type II, similar to the four cohesins of ScaB. Surprisingly, the third ScaD cohesin belongs to the type I cohesins, like the seven ScaA cohesins. ScaD is the first scaffoldin to be described that contains divergent types of cohesins as integral parts of the polypeptide chain. The recognition properties among selected recombinant cohesins and dockerins from the different scaffoldins of the gene cluster were investigated by affinity blotting. The {{results indicated that the}} divergent types of ScaD cohesins also differ in their preference of dockerins. ScaD thus plays a dual role, both as a primary scaffoldin, capable of direct incorporation of a single dockerin-borne enzyme, and as a secondary scaffoldin that anchors the major primar...|$|R
40|$|Restriction-like {{endonuclease}} (RLE) bearing non-LTR retrotransposons are site-specific {{elements that}} integrate into the genome through a target primed reverse transcription mechanism (TPRT). R 2 elements {{have been used}} as a model system for investigating non-LTR retrotransposon integration. We previously demonstrated that R 2 retrotransposons require two subunits of the element-encoded multifunctional protein to integrate—one subunit <b>bound</b> <b>upstream</b> of the insertion site and one bound downstream. R 2 elements have been phylogenetically categorized into four clades: R 2 -A, B, C and D, that diverged from a common ancestor more than 850 million years ago. All R 2 elements target the same sequence within 28 S rDNA. The amino-terminal domain of R 2 Bm, an R 2 -D clade element, contains a single zinc finger and a Myb motif that are responsible for binding R 2 protein downstream of the insertion site. Target site recognition is of interest as it {{is the first step in}} the integration reaction and may help elucidate evolutionary history and integration mechanism. The amino-terminal domain of R 2 -A clade members contains three zinc fingers and a Myb motif. We show here that R 2 Lp, an R 2 -A clade member, uses its amino-terminal DNA binding motifs to bind upstream of the insertion site. Because the R 2 -A and R 2 -D clade elements recognize 28 S rDNA differently, we conclude the A- and D-clades represent independent targeting events to the 28 S site. Our results also indicate a certain plasticity of insertional mechanics exists between the two clades...|$|R
40|$|DNA-binding assays using {{mobility}} shift {{polyacrylamide gel}} electrophoresis revealed {{the presence of a}} protein that specifically bound to a restriction fragment - 288 to - 191 bp upstream from the transcriptional start point of strR, a regulatory gene for streptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus. The binding site corresponded to an upstream activation sequence predicted from the results of in vivo promoter assays. The binding was greatly enhanced by 5 mM Mg 2 +. This binding was detected with the protein source only from the wild-type strain and not from an A-factor-deficient mutant strain. The exogenous supplementation of A-factor to the A-factor-deficient mutant strain caused the appearance of the protein in the DNA-binding assay. A synthetic nucleotide 52 bp in length (region from - 293 to - 242), which was synthesized on the basis of data obtained from both retardation assays with dissected DNA fragments and in vivo promoter assays, was retarded by the A-factor-dependent protein. In addition to this A-factor-dependent protein, at least three proteins with different recognition site affinities capable of binding to the upstream region of the strR promoter were detected. The binding of one of these proteins to both sides of the <b>upstream</b> activation sequence <b>bound</b> by the A-factor-dependent protein was completely abolished in the presence of ATP and Mg 2 + in the incubation mixture. The region bound by these proteins showed anomalous electrophoretic mobility, like that of a bent DNA molecule, which is probably caused by the presence of many blocks consisting of A and T. The region bound by these proteins was found to be transcribed in the orientation opposite to that of strR...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{historic}} flooding in 2011 affected the geomorphic adjustments created by dam regulation along the approximately 120 km free flowing {{reach of the}} Upper Missouri River <b>bounded</b> <b>upstream</b> by the Garrison Dam (1953) and downstream by Lake Oahe Reservoir (1959) near the City of Bismarck, ND, USA. The largest flood since dam regulation occurred in 2011. Flood releases from the Garrison Dam began in May 2011 and lasted until October, peaking with a flow of more than 4200 m 3 s- 1. Channel cross-section data and aerial imagery {{before and after the}} flood were compared with historic rates of channel change to assess the relative impact of the flood on the river morphology. Results indicate that the 2011 flood maintained trends in island area with the loss of islands in the reach just below the dam and an increase in island area downstream. Channel capacity changes varied along the Garrison Segment {{as a result of the}} flood. The thalweg, which has been stable since the mid- 1970 s, did not migrate. And channel morphology, as defined by a newly developed shoaling metric, which quantifies the degree of channel braiding, indicates significant longitudinal variability in response to the flood. These results show that the 2011 flood exacerbates some geomorphic trends caused by the dam while reversing others. We conclude that the presence of dams has created an alternate geomorphic and related ecological stable state, which does not revert towards pre-dam conditions in response to the flood of record. This suggests that management of sediment transport dynamics as well as flow modification is necessary to restore the Garrison Segment of the Upper Missouri River towards pre-dam conditions and help create or maintain habitat for endangered species...|$|R
40|$|In {{quiescent}} cells, cdc 2 mRNA {{is almost}} undetectable. Stimulation of cells to reenter the cell cycle results in induction of cdc 2 expression, {{beginning at the}} G 1 -to-S transition and reaching maximum levels during late S and G 2 phases. To investigate cdc 2 transcriptional regulation throughout cell cycle progression, we monitored protein-DNA interactions by in vivo footprinting along 800 bp of the human cdc 2 promoter in quiescent fibroblasts and at different time points following serum stimulation. We found 11 in vivo protein-binding sites, but no protein binding was observed at a high-affinity E 2 F site {{that had previously been}} implicated in cdc 2 regulation. Nine of the identified in vivo binding sites (among them were two inverted CCAAT boxes, two Sp 1 sites, and one ets- 2 site) bind transcription factors constitutively throughout the cell cycle. However, at two elements located at positions - 60 and - 20 relative to the transcription start site, the binding pattern changes significantly as the cells are entering S phase. A G 0 - and G 1 -specific protein complex disappears at the - 20 element at the beginning of S phase. This sequence deviates at one base position from known E 2 F consensus binding sites. We found that the major E 2 F activity in human fibroblasts contains E 2 F- 4 and p 130. The - 20 element of the cdc 2 gene specifically interacts with a subset of E 2 F- 4 -p 130 complexes present in G 0 cells but does not interact with S-phase-specific E 2 F complexes. Transient-transfection experiments with wild-type and mutant cdc 2 promoter constructs indicate that the - 20 element is involved in suppressing cdc 2 activity in quiescent cells. We suggest that the presence of the p 130 -E 2 F- 4 complex in G 0 /G 1 blocks access of components of the basal transcription machinery or prevents transaction by the constitutively <b>bound</b> <b>upstream</b> activator proteins...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{dendritic}} cells (cDCs) are {{a critical}} component of the immune system due to their roles in the maintenance of immune tolerance and the induction of adaptive immune responses. However, distinguishing cDCs from other myeloid populations is complicated by the lack of highly specific cDC markers. For example, high expression of the integrin CD 11 c is used to define cDCs, but this marker is also expressed at lower levels by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocyte and macrophage subsets, and some lymphocytes. Similarly, the use of the CD 11 c promoter to drive the expression of different reporters in cDCs likewise affects these additional populations. To identify a novel and more specific cDC marker, I compared the gene expression profiles of differentiated cDCs, committed cDC precursors (pre-DCs), monocytes, and myeloid progenitor populations by gene array. Enriching cDCspecific genes identified an uncharacterized zinc finger transcription factor that I call zDC (Zbtb 46, Btbd 4). This factor is expressed by cDCs but not other myeloid or lymphoid immune populations. The characterization of zDC expression and function involved three major directions. (1) To exploit cDC-specific expression of zDC, I produced zDC-DTR knock-in mice that express diptheria toxin receptor (DTR) regulated by the zDC locus. Consistent with zDC expression, DTR expression is limited to cDCs among hematopoietic cells and diptheria toxin (DT) injection depletes cDCs but not other populations. (2) To identify the target genes occupied and regulated by zDC, I performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) on zDC from steady state cDCs. zDC <b>bound</b> <b>upstream</b> of the transcription start sites of over 1, 000 genes at sequence-specific motifs. (3) To interrogate zDC function, I generated zDC-deficient mice by knocking out the second exon of the zDC locus. cDC development is unimpaired in zDCâ€“/â€“ mice, but steady state zDC-deficient cDCs upregulated zDC target genes identified by ChIP-seq in addition to maturation gene pathways. This steady state maturation results in impaired peripheral tolerance as well as enhanced skin-draining lymph node vascularization. Therefore, the zinc finger transcription factor zDC uniquely defines the cDC lineage and serves as a transcriptional repressor which maintains cDC quiescence in the steady state...|$|R
40|$|The human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) major immediate-early (IE) proteins IEP 86 (IE 2 (579 aa)) and IEP 72 (IE 1 (491 aa)) can transcriptionally activate {{a variety}} of simple promoters containing a TATA element and one upstream transcription factor binding site. In our previous studies, transcriptional activation was shown to correlate with IEP 86 binding to both the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and the transcription factor <b>bound</b> <b>upstream.</b> IEP 72 often synergistically affects the activation by IEP 86, although it has not previously been shown to directly interact in vitro with IEP 86, TBP, or transcription factors (e. g., Sp 1 and Tef- 1) bound by IEP 86. We report biochemical and genetic evidence suggesting that the major IE proteins may perform a function {{similar to that of}} the TBP-associated factors (TAFs) which make up TFIID. Consistent with this model, we found that the major IE proteins interact with a number of TAFs. In vitro, IEP 86 bound with drosophila TAF(II) 110 (dTAF(II) 110) and human TAF(II) 130 (hTAF(II) 130), while IEP 72 bound dTAF(II) 40, dTAF(II) 110, and hTAF(II) 130. Regions on major IE proteins which mediate binding have been defined. In addition, our data indicate that both IEP 72 and IEP 86 can bind simultaneously to hTAF(II) 130, suggesting that this TAF may provide bridging interactions between the two proteins for transcriptional activation and synergy. In agreement, a transcriptional activation mutant of IEP 72 is unable to participate in bridging. Confirmation that these in vitro interactions were relevant was provided by data showing that both IEP 72 and IEP 86 copurify with TFIID and coimmunoprecipitate with purified TFIID derived from infected cell nuclei. To further support a TAF-like function of the IE proteins, we have found that the IE proteins expressed from the intact major IE gene, and to a lesser extent IEP 86 alone, can rescue the temperature-sensitive (ts) transcriptional defect in TAF(II) 250 in the BHK- 21 cell line ts 13. Analyses of mutations in the major IE region show that IEP 86 is essential for rescue and that IEP 72 augments its effect, and that mutations which affect TAF interactions are debilitated in rescue. Our data, showing that the IE proteins can bind with TFIID and rescue a ts transcriptional defect in TAF(II) 250, support the model that the IE proteins perform a TAF-like function as components of TFIID...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the classification and evaluation of various numerical schemes that are available for computing solutions for fluid-flow problems, and secondly, with the development of an improved numerical discretisation scheme of the finite-volume type for solving steady-state differential equations for recirculating flows with and without sources. In an effort to evaluate the performance of the various numerical schemes available, some standard test cases were used. The relative merits of the schemes were assessed by means of one-dimensional laminar flows and two-dimensional laminar and turbulent flows, with and without sources. Furthermore, Taylor series expansion analysis was also utilised to examine the limitations that were present. The outcome of this first part of the work was a set of conclusions, concerning the accuracy of the numerous schemes tests, vis-a-vis their stability, ease of implementation, and computational costs. It is hoped that these conclusions can be used by `computational fluid-dynamics' practitioners in deciding on an optimum choice of scheme for their particular problem. From the understanding gained during {{the first part of the}} study, and in an effort to combine the attributes of a successful discretisation scheme, eg positive coefficients. conservation and the elimination of 'false-diffusion', a new flow-oriented finite-volume numerical scheme was devised and applied to several test cases in order to evaluate its performance. The novel approach in formulating the new CUPID* scheme (for Corner UPw^nDing) underlines the idea of focussing attention at the control-volume corners rather than at the control-volume cell-faces. In two-dimensions, this leads to an eight neighbour influence for the central grid point value, depending on the flow-directions at the corners of the control-volume. In the formulation of the new scheme, false-diffusion is considered from a pragmatic perspective, with emphasis on physics rather than on strict mathematical considerations such as the order of discretisation, etc. The accuracy of the UPSTREAM scheme (for JJPwind in STREAMIines) indicates that although it is formally only first-order accurate, it considerably reduces 'false-diffusion'. Scalar transport calculations (without sources) show that the <b>UPSTREAM</b> scheme predicts <b>bounded</b> solutions which are more accurate than the upwind-difference scheme and the unbounded skew-upstream-difference scheme. Furthermore, for laminar and turbulent flow calculations, improved results are obtained when compared with the performances of the other schemes. The advantage of the UPSTREAM-difference scheme is that all the influence coefficients are always positive and thus the coefficient matrices are suitable for iterative solution procedures. Finally, the stability and convergence characteristics are similar to those of the upwind-difference scheme, eg converged solutions are guaranteed. What cannot be guaranteed, however, is the conservatism of the scheme and it is recommended that future work should be directed towards improving that disadvantage...|$|R
