Human monocyte-derived Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells that took up lucifer yellow or fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran exclusively migrated in response to 6 Ckine/secondary lymphoid chemokine, and matured, as evidenced {{by an increase in}} CD 54 and CD 86 expression and potent stimulatory activity in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Exposing Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells to 20 – 40 mJ per cm 2 of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> reduced their endocytic activity in fluid phase pinocytosis (measured by uptake of lucifer yellow) and in receptor-mediated endocytosis (measured by uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran).

Because <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> induces photoproducts in cellular DNA, the potential role of ultraviolet B radiation-induced DNA damage in this system was assessed. For this purpose, cells from a normal donor were compared with cells from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum from complementation groups C and D. Xeroderma pigmentosum cells are defective in the removal of ultraviolet B radiation-induced DNA lesions, and thus lower <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> doses are required to retain equivalent numbers of DNA photoproducts at a given time point after irradiation. In the present study, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> inhibited interferon γ-induced ICAM- 1 mRNA expression in primary human skin fibroblasts in a manner identical to that previously observed for keratinocytes. Comparative studies employing normal versus xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts revealed that in xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts, two- to threefold lower <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> doses were required to achieve inhibition equivalent to that observed in normal fibroblasts. In irradiated normal cells, inhibition of interferon γ-induced ICAM- 1 mRNA expression was transient and restored 12 h after <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure.

Further, we found that wavelengths in the ultraviolet A region of the solar spectrum (320 – 400 nm), devoid of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B,</b> were equally effective in activating immune suppression as <b>ultraviolet</b> A + <b>B</b> <b>radiation.</b> Here {{we report on the}} mechanisms involved. Maximal immune suppression was found when mice were exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation 7 – 9 d post immunization. No immune suppression was found in ultraviolet-irradiated mice injected with monoclonal anti-interleukin- 10 antibody, or mice exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation and injected with recombinant interleukin- 12.

Using a transgenic mouse line, which expresses the human elastin promoter, linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase reporter gene, in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner, we investigated the effects of ultraviolet A radiation and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> on human elastin promoter activity in vivo and in vitro. Irradiation of mice with a single dose of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> (491. 4 mJ/cm 2) resulted in an increase up to 8. 5 -fold in promoter activity, whereas a more modest increase of 1. 8 -fold was measured with ultraviolet A radiation (38. 2 J/cm 2).

40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} demonstrated that <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> impairs contact hypersensitivity induction in ultraviolet B susceptible mice through a tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent mechanism, involving calcitonin gene related peptide and cutaneous mast cells. This {{study was designed}} to test directly whether mast cells are the source of tumor necrosis factor-α, to account for the ultra-violet B-susceptible phenotype. As dermal mast cells seem to release tumor necrosis factor-α following exposure to ultraviolet B, we investigated whether tumor necrosis factor-α released by mast cells could mediate impairment of contact hypersensitivity {{in a manner similar to}} that found with <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> treatment. First, we loaded Fcε receptors of mast cells of ultraviolet B-susceptible (C 3 H/HeN), ultraviolet B-resistant (C 3 H/HeJ), and mast-cell deficient (Sl/Sld) mice by intradermal injections of anti-dinitrophenyl immunoglobulin E antibodies. Twenty-four hours later, dinitrophenyl was injected intravenously, and within 30 min oxazolone was painted on injected skin sites. Contact hypersen-sitivity induction was impaired in ultraviolet B-susceptible mice, but not in ultraviolet B-resistant or Sl/Sld mice, and treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies was able to reverse this impairment of contact hypersensitivity. Second, we have found that <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> did not impair contact hypersensitivity induction when haptens were painted on irradiated skin of mast cell deficient mice. As <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> impairs contact hypersensitivity induction through a tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent mechanism, we conclude that <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> triggers the prompt release of tumor necrosis factor-α from dermal mast cells, and that mast cell-derived tumor necrosis factor-α interferes with generation of the hapten-specific signal required for contact hypersensitivity induction.

40|$|Ultraviolet {{irradiation}} {{represents a}} well-established treatment modality for inflammatory skin diseases. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the mechanisms of ultraviolet B radiation-induced keratinocyte insensitivity towards interferon-γ. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> temporarily inhibits the interferon-γ-induced activation of primary keratinocyte and HaCaT cells as measured by reduced intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (CD 54) and HLA-DR upregulation. Western blot experiments have suggested that this is mediated by the ultraviolet B radiation-induced inhibition of signal transduction and transcription factor- 1 phosphorylation. Neither interleukin- 10 neutralization nor interleukin- 10 addition had any effect on the ultraviolet B radiation-induced inhibition of interferon-γ induced intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression. Furthermore, the supernatant from ultraviolet B-irradiated cells failed to inhibit the interferon-γ-induced CD 54 and HLA-DR upregulation in nonradiated HaCaT cells. Moreover, irradiated cells from whom the supernatant was withdrawn 4 h after irradiation still showed a diminished interferon-γ-induced response after 24 h. Thus, not soluble but intracellular factors might be involved in the ultraviolet B radiation-induced inhibition of interferon-γ-induced keratinocyte activation. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of members of suppressors of cytokine-signaling (SOCS) molecules using real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found a fast and strong upregulation of SOCS 1 and SOCS 3 but not of SOCS 2 after <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation.</b> Similarly, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> induced the expression of these particular SOCS molecules in lesional psoriatic skin.

40|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> {{has been}} shown to {{generate}} cutaneous inflammation in part through inducing oxidative stress and cytokine production in human keratinocytes. Amongst the proinflammatory cytokines synthesized in response to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> is the potent chemoattractant interleukin- 8. Though the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) is synthesized in response to oxidative stress, and keratinocytes express PAF receptors linked to cytokine biosynthesis, it is not known whether PAF is involved in ultraviolet-B-induced epidermal cell cytokine production. These studies examined the role of the PAF system in ultraviolet-B-induced epidermal cell interleukin- 8 biosynthesis using a novel model system created by retroviral-mediated transduction of the PAF-receptor-negative human epidermal cell line KB with the human PAF receptor. Treatment of PAF-receptor-expressing KB cells with the metabolically stable PAF receptor agonist carbamoyl-PAF resulted in increased interleukin- 8 mRNA and protein, indicating that activation of the epidermal PAF receptor was linked to interleukin- 8 production. Ultraviolet B irradiation of PAF-receptor-expressing KB cells resulted in significant increases in both interleukin- 8 mRNA and protein in comparison to ultraviolet-B-treated control KB cells. Pretreatment with PAF receptor antagonists inhibited both carbamoyl-PAF-induced and ultraviolet-B-induced interleukin- 8 production in the PAF-receptor-positive cells, but not in control KB cells. Similarly, treatment of the PAF-receptor-expressing primary cultures of human keratinocytes or the human epidermal cell line A- 431 with carbamoyl-PAF or <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> resulted in interleukin- 8 production that was partially inhibited by PAF receptor antagonists.

40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide {{has been}} shown to {{modulate}} inflammatory and immune responses in various systems. Recent studies in our laboratory and colleagues have shown that intracutaneously injected calcitonin gene-related peptide impairs the induction of contact hypersensitivity in mice, and participates in the pathogenesis of failed contact hypersensitivity induction after acute, low-dose <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation.</b> In this study we investigated the ability of calcitonin gene-related peptide to induce tolerance in normal and mast cell deficient mice and we examined the extent to which calcitonin gene-related peptide contributes to the tolerance induced by acute, low-dose <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation.</b> Calcitonin gene-related peptide was injected intradermally followed by application of 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene to the injected skin surface. Tolerance was assessed by re-exposing the mice 2 wk later to a second, sensitizing dose of 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene on uninjected skin. We found that calcitonin gene-related peptide induced tolerance to 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene in both normal and mast cell deficient mice. Calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced tolerance was blocked by intradermal injection of a calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist [CGRP-(8 - 37) ] that selectively blocks the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. Tolerance was also abolished by intraperitoneally injected anti-interleukin- 10, but not anti-tumor necrosis factor α, antibodies. When 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene was painted on skin into which splenic dendritic cells pretreated with calcitonin gene-related peptide had been injected, tolerance was observed. Calcitonin gene-related peptide- treated dendritic cells mixed with anti-interleukin- 10 antibody prior to intradermal injection failed to promote tolerance. Finally, injection of CGRP-(8 - 37) into skin that was subsequently exposed to acute, low-dose <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> partially prevented tolerance induced by local application of 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene. These results indicate that calcitonin gene-related peptide has the capacity to promote cutaneous tolerance through an interleukin- 10 -dependent mechanism.

The concomitant presence of endothelin- 1, basic fibroblast growth factor, and α-melanotropin significantly potentiated CREB phosphorylation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether repeated topical treatment with benzoyl peroxide, a source of free radicals, produced the same cutaneous effects as chronic <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation.</b> Three concentrations of benzoyl peroxide (0. 1, 1. 5, 5. 0 % wt/wt) and three cumulative fluences of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> (0. 9, 2. 2, 5. 1 J per cm 2) used alone and in all combinations along with appropriate controls. Female SKH 1 (hr/hr) albino hairless mice were treated 5 d per wk for 12 wk. Extracellular matrix molecules and histologic parameters were assessed. <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> induced a fluence-dependent and time-dependent increase in skin-fold thickness. Fluence dependence was seen for epidermal thickness, sunburn cell numbers, dermal thickness, glycosaminoglycan content, mast cell numbers, and skin-fold thickness. Benzoyl peroxide treatment alone caused less marked increases in epidermal and dermal measures compared with ultraviolet B under the conditions used. A benzoyl peroxide concentration-dependent increase was only observed for elastin content, although the highest concentration of benzoyl peroxide increased epidermal thickness and glycosaminoglycan content. A synergistic interaction between ultraviolet B and benzoyl peroxide was not found. These results indicate that repeated administration of benzoyl peroxide produces skin changes in the hairless mouse that qualitatively resemble those produced by ultraviolet B and suggest that common mechanisms may be involved. In addition, any potential synergistic effect of ultraviolet B and benzoyl peroxide was below the level of detection used in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of ancient people worshipped {{the sun and}} viewed it as a health - bringing deity. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} century therapeutic benefits of sunlight exposure were beginning to be understood {{and by the end of}} the nineteenth century the importance of ultraviolet radiation was being realized. Danish physician Niels Finsen, whom many regard as the father of ultraviolet phototherapy, also stressed that it was ultraviolet radiation in the solar spectrum which cause sunburn. We now recognize that the small portion of ultraviolet radiation which reaches the earth's surface is not necessarily therapeutic, but in fact could be harmful to humans. There are numerous accounts of the harmful effects of UV radiation to the skin and the eye as a whole. These effects may be caused by either acute or chronic exposure to UV radiation. For example, some acute effects of UV-B radiation include conjunctivitis and photokeratitis. "Snow blindness" and "arc welders eye" are further examples of acute ultraviolet damage specifically to the surface of the cornea. On the other hand, chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation is thought to be responsible for pterygia, climatic droplet keratopathy Hill and Maske (1989), cancers of the external eye, cataracts and various types of retinal diseases. The present study is an extension of ongoing studies on ultraviolet radiation damage to the cornea in the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital. Their specific interest lies in the causes and treatment of climatic droplet keratopathy. The aims of the present study are: 1) Establish a possible role of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> in human corneal diseases such as climatic droplet keratopathy and pterygium using the rabbit as an animal model. 2) Determine by means of SEM the initial effects and subsequent recovery of the epithelium after a 3 -hour dose of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation.</b> We refer to this study as "acute" response to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation.</b> 3) To try and confirm the effects observed by SEM with ultrastructural studies using TEM. 4) In addition, we are also looking at the possible effects after exposing rabbit cornea to a daily dose of low level <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation,</b> over a long period of time. We refer to this as chronic exposure to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation.</b> It is hoped that by exposing rabbits to ultraviolet light, principally <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation,</b> diseases similar to those found in humans could be simulated and disease progression studied. People are generally exposed to substantial amounts of UV radiation for a very long time. Since people generally live longer they will be exposed to an ever-increasing amount of solar UV radiation and subsequently, there is an increasing risk of developing corneal diseases. The possible threat to the ozone is also a real possibility and could lead to increased levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth's surface. This will require a greater understanding of the very nature of corneal damage due to acute and chronic exposure. This study focusses mainly on the acute response to UV-B radiation since most studies have investigated effects of prolonged exposure to UV light. Accordingly, much less is known about acute exposure. Many people suffering from acute UV B radiation effects probably never visit the ophthalmologist or wait for a couple of days. This could also contribute to the fact that effects of short-term damage is not well documented...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of cancer research is to identify environmental and host factors that contribute to the malignant state. Human skin cancers are among the few tumor types for which the predominant environmental carcinogen is known. Ultraviolet light, a component of sunlight, is an important cause of skin cancer in humans. In humans and mice, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> induces systematic and local immunosuppression. A consequence of that is inappropriate immune surveillance of somatic tissues for evidence of malignantly transformed cells. The impairment of contact hypersensitivity, as it develops early and correlates well with tumor frequency in various mouse strains, has been used for over 15 y as a model of immunologic events occurring in photocarcinogenesis. In mice, as well as in humans, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>radiation</b> induced impairment of contact hypersensitivity is not uniform in all individuals; some individuals are susceptible to the deleterious effects of ultraviolet B, whereas others are resistant to ultraviolet B. We have defined the genetic locus responsible for ultraviolet B susceptibility and resistance in mice within the Bat 5 and H- 2 D segment of the mouse chromosome 1...|$|E

40|$|Vitamin D {{is formed}} in the skin from 7 -dehydrocho-lesterol after {{activation}} induced by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> (UVB) <b>radiation</b> (290 – 315 nm). Vitamin D is the precursor of the hormone 1, 25 (OH) 2 D, which is formed in 2 hy-droxylation reactions, first to 25 -hydroxyvitamin D, hereafter abreviatd 25 (OH) D, in the liver and then to 1. 25 (OH) 2 D in the kidneys or target organs [1]. Vita-min D regulates the calcium and phosphate balance, as well as bone mineralization [2], and vitamin D defi-ciency leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which causes rickets in children and osteoporosis and osteo-malacia in adults [3, 4]. Vitamin D status is determined by measuring the serum concentration of 25 (OH) D, the major circulating form of the hormone [5]. The emerging consensus i...|$|R
40|$|Basal cell carcinoma, {{the most}} {{frequent}} skin cancer in humans, is often linked to chronic sun exposure. In psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients, basal cell carcinomas may occur even more frequently; however, the exact etiology and mechanisms of tumorigenesis in psoriatic patients are unclear because psoralen and ultraviolet A {{is not only a}} carcinogen but also an immunosuppressor and because psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients often have other (co) carcinogenic risk factors (e. g, therapeutic exposure to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B,</b> X-ray <b>radiation,</b> arsenic, tar, and/or chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate). In this study, we analyzed the DNA of 13 basal cell carcinomas from five psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients for mutations of the p 53 tumor suppressor gene. DNA sequencing revealed a total of 11 mis-sense, two non-sense, and four silent mutations in seven of the 13 basal cell carcinomas (54...|$|R
