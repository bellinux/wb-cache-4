50|$|The Lapland bunting (Calcarius lapponicus) is {{also known}} as <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur,</b> and is {{considered}} under longspurs, and also placed in a separate family Calcariidae.|$|R
50|$|The food {{habits of}} the <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur</b> are quite simple: mostly seeds in winter and {{arthropods}} in the summer, {{when they are in}} activity.|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{currently}} {{affects the}} whole globe. Especially tundra and alpine areas {{are expected to}} change in the coming decades, affecting the species which today inhabits these areas. The <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur</b> Calcarius lapponicus is a common passerine bird breeding in such habitats. It has shown a considerable population decline all over Fennoscandia during the last decades. The reason for this decline is suggested to be caused by habitat changes at the breeding ground. Since {{little is known about the}} <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur’s</b> diet in the declining populations, I analyzed the stomach content of 39 individuals sampled in early June at Hardangervidda, southern Norway. Seeds dominated the diet, and from this I predicted that the birds would establish their territories in areas rich in seed producing plants as found in the stomach analysis. I also predicted that the longspur did not establish territories in areas dominated by lichens, but that they were found in areas influenced by shrubs. I compared the vegetation within 17 <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur</b> territories at Hardangervidda in the early part of the breeding season and compared it with vegetation samples in areas with no territories. Contrary to expected, I found that the <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs</b> did not establish their territory in a specific plant community. Furthermore, I found no support for the hypothesis that the longspurs avoided lichen dominated areas, but the birds did favor the presence of shrubs like Salix sp. and/or Betula nana. My results might suggest that the territories do not serve as an exclusive food reservoir in terms of seeds for the <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractClimate {{change is}} causing rapid shifts in {{temperature}} while also increasing the frequency, duration, {{and intensity of}} extreme weather. In the northern hemisphere, the spring of 2013 was characterized as extreme due to record high snow cover and low temperatures. Studies that describe the effects of extreme weather on phenology across taxa are limited while morphological and physiological responses remain poorly understood. Stress physiology, as measured through baseline and stress-induced concentrations of cortisol or corticosterone, has often been studied to understand how organisms respond to environmental stressors. We compared body condition and stress physiology of two long-distance migrants breeding in low arctic Alaska – the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) and <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur</b> (Calcarius lapponicus) – in 2013, an extreme weather year, with three more typical years (2011, 2012, and 2014). The extended snow cover in spring 2013 caused measureable changes in phenology, body condition and physiology.

Although our research team has banded more than 50 000 birds of both species over the past 30 years across the latitudinal range of both species, we have never observed such a hybrid. While these Arctic-breeding species overlap spatially and temporally during wintering, migration, and breeding, longspurs and buntings have distinct sexual characters and breed in different ecological niches, which may account for the reproductive isolation or low rates of hybridization of these species.

Of the six species within the family, the snow bunting and <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur</b> are found both in both North America and Eurasia; the other four species are found only in North America.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 Successful {{breeding}} in the Arctic requires precisely timed {{changes in}} reproductive behavior and physiology, and usually only one reproductive attempt per year is possible. Hormone and behavior patterns of Arctic breeders may therefore {{be different from}} those seen in lower-latitude species with longer breeding seasons. During 1991 - 1996, I investigated relationships of hormones and breeding behavior in an Alaskan population of <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs</b> (Calcarius lapponicus), socially monogamous passerine birds that breed only in the Arctic. Male <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs</b> had a very high, brief peak of circulating testosterone (T) {{for the first few}} days on the breeding grounds, during which they performed aerial song displays over a "territory" with indistinct boundaries, and were not aggressive toward simulated territorial intrusions (STIs). T then fell to intermediate levels as males guarded their mates for approximately one week, singing less and exhibiting high aggression to STIs. Finally, T, song, and aggression declined to low levels during incubation. I investigated these patterns further by implanting free-living birds with hormones (controls received empty implants). During mate-guarding, males with implants of testosterone blockers (ATD and flutamide) had decreased aggression and normal song. However, during incubation, T-implanted males had increased song and normal (low) aggression. Parental care of T-implanted males was initially low, but recovered to near-normal levels as nestlings grew. All experimental groups had normal nestling growth and normal nest success. Finally, estradiol-implanted females did not show changes in sexual behavior, nest-building or parental care, but did tend to beg more from their mates. Overall, <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs</b> have some hormone-behavior patterns that seem different from those seen in lower-latitude species, namely: (1) Males may have two functional levels of testosterone: at intermediate levels of T, aggression is T-dependent and song is T-independent, but very high levels of T stimulate increases in song. (2) Neither sex is very responsive to reproductive hormones after the young hatch. These patterns {{may be related to the}} Laplands' very brief courtship, brief reproductive opportunities, and the need to concentrate on parental care of their single brood...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Teshekpuk Lake Special Area in the National Petroleum Reserve – Alaska (NPR-A) {{currently}} has no long-term protection from oil development. In this study, we provide novel information on nest density, productivity, and habitat use at Teshekpuk {{relative to a}} developed oilfield site at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, to assess the importance of Teshekpuk for tundra-nesting birds and to provide recommendations regarding potential oil development. Mean annual nest density of all bird species combined was significantly higher at Teshekpuk than at Prudhoe Bay and was higher than any of five other sites with comparable data on the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain. Nest densities were significantly higher at Teshekpuk than at Prudhoe Bay for <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs</b> (Calcarius lapponicus) and long-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus), although those for semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) were higher at Prudhoe Bay. Total shorebird nest densities at Teshekpuk were among the highest of any sites in the region. At Teshekpuk, shorebirds nested preferentially in wet and emergent habitats, including flooded low-center polygons, non-patterned tundra, and Carex aquatilis-dominated habitats. Therefore, we recommend that future oil infrastructure placement in this region avoid these habitats. Using data collected at Teshekpuk and Prudhoe Bay from 2005 to 2008, we modeled nest survivorship for 11 shorebird species and for <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs.</b> For longspurs, the best-supported models based on AICc values indicated that nest survival was always higher at Teshekpuk, {{but it was also}} higher elsewhere in years of high lemming abundance and later in the nesting season.

40|$|Arctic {{weather in}} spring is {{unpredictable}} {{and can also}} be extreme, so Arctic-breeding birds must be flexible in their breeding {{to deal with such}} variability. Unpredictability in weather conditions will only intensify with climate change and this in turn could affect reproductive capability of migratory birds. Adjustments to coping strategies are therefore crucial, so here we examined the plasticity of the adrenocorticotropic stress response in two Arctic songbird species—the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) and <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur</b> (Calcarius lapponicus) —breeding in northwest Greenland. Across the breeding season, the stress response was strongest at arrival and least robust during molt in male snow buntings. Snow bunting females had higher baseline but similar stressinduced corticosterone levels compared to males. Modification of the stress response was not due to adrenal insensitivity, but likely regulated at the anterior pituitary gland. Compared to independent nestlings and adult snow buntings, parental-dependent chicks had a more robust stress response. For <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs,</b> baseline corticosterone was highest at arrival in both male and females, and arriving males displayed a higher stress response compared to arriving females. Comparison of male corticosterone profiles collected at arrival in Greenland (76 °N) and Alaska (67 – 71 °N;) reveal that both species have higher stress responses at the more northern location. Flexibility in the stress response may be typical for birds nesting at the leading edges of their range and this ability will become more relevant as global climate change results in major shifts of breeding habitat and phenology for migratory birds...|$|R

Various studies have shown impacts of seismic lines on vegetation, but the effects on bird abundance in the Arctic are poorly known. We evaluated the impact of new (0. 5 – 1. 5 years old) and old (10 – 35 years old) visible seismic lines within the sanctuary on the abundance of breeding passerines (savannah sparrow, Passerculus sandwichensis; <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspur,</b> Calcarius lapponicus; common redpoll, Carduelis flammea; American tree sparrow, Spizella arborea; and red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus) in upland tundra, low-centre polygon, and sedge/willow habitats. Along new seismic lines, effects on abundance were not statistically significant for most groups of birds, although the trend in most habitats was for more birds on reference transects than on seismic lines. Significant impacts were found for passerines grouped in upland tundra and for savannah sparrow in sedge/willow. The latter effect (possibly due to standing water along the line) was not significant the following year. Along old seismic lines, abundance of passerines was lower than on reference transects in upland tundra and low-centre polygon habitat, except for <b>Lapland</b> <b>longspurs</b> in upland tundra. Lines created 10 – 30 years ago have persistent vegetative changes and this appears to have reduced bird abundance. Although we did not plot individual territories, birds were seen crossing the seismic lines and sometimes perched on them, suggesting that they were not avoiding the lines altogether.
