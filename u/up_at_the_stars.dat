500|$|After {{their return}} to Indianapolis, Augustus' health worsens. He is taken to the ICU and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time {{together}} for anything, since he [...] "gave me a forever within the numbered days." [...] Augustus dies eight days later and Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. He tells her that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral {{to make up for}} the spoiled trip. Van Houten tells her that the novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. He gives Hazel a piece of paper which she crumples up asking him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads his words accepting his death and about his love for her. She lies on her back on her lawn looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> smiling as she remembers Augustus and says: [...] "Okay." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{religious}} or spiritual views, Seeger replied: [...] "I feel most spiritual when Iâ€™m out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> [...] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I open my eyes I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something I'm listening to God.".

5000|$|Lautens died on February 1, 1992, after {{suffering}} a massive heart attack {{at his home in}} downtown Toronto. Upon news of Lautens' death, thousands of readers turned <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> offices, lining <b>up</b> for three days to sign books of condolence. Lincoln Alexander remarked: [...] "He was a great guy ... So full of light, so full of humor. My close friend. His smile and humor will be sorely missed." ...|$|R

2500|$|Adams {{claimed that}} the title came from a 1971 {{incident}} while he was hitchhiking around Europe {{as a young man}} with a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe book: while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself, and only remembered himself telling the story. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of [...] "hitch-hiking around the galaxy" [...] to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E

60|$|Thus, in my insufferable pain, I spoke aloud; {{alone in}} that solitary place, a {{bleeding}} fugitive in the dark night, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> I cursed the Author of my being and called on Him {{to take back the}} abhorred gift of life.|$|E
6000|$|He sat {{near the}} tiller gazing <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> dreamily for some time; {{then he looked}} round the horizon, then glanced at the compass and up at the sails, which hung idly from the yards, after which he began to mutter to himself in low grumbling tones-- ...|$|E

60|$|There {{is nothing}} that prepares one so well for the {{enjoyment}} of rest, both mental and physical, as a long-protracted period of excitement and anxiety, followed up by bodily fatigue. Excitement alone banishes rest; but, united with severe physical exertion, it prepares for it. At least, courteous reader, this is our experience, and certainly this was the experience of our three hunters as they lay on their backs beneath {{the branches of a}} willow bush, and gazed serenely <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> twinkling <b>stars,</b> two days after their escape from the Indian village.|$|R
6000|$|It was deliciously {{fresh and}} weirdly {{still in the}} street, and as I looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> glowing <b>stars</b> and down <b>the</b> long, empty street my mind revolted.

6000|$|As {{he reached}} the cold, crisp, deliciously {{rarefied}} air outside, {{he took off his}} hat and involuntarily looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> blazing thick in the deep-blue midnight sky.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a black hole}} accreting spherically from the surrounding medium. If accretion produces a luminosity close to the Eddington limit the hole acquires a net charge so that electrons and ions can fall with the same velocity. The condition for the electrostatic field to {{be large enough to}} break the vacuum near the hole horizon translates into an upper limit for the hole mass, M âˆ¼ 6. 6 Ã— 10 20 g. The astrophysical conditions under which this phaenomenon can take place are rather extreme, but in principle they could be met by a mini black hole residing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of a star. Subject headings: Accretion, accretion disks â€” black hole physics 1. Charging a Black Hole by Accretion Let us {{consider a}} star of mass M which undergoes spherical accretion and assume, for simplicity, that the accreting material is ionized hydrogen. If the accretion luminosity is L, the infalling electrons experience a radiative force FR = ÏƒTL 4 Ï€cr 2 (1) where ÏƒT is the Thomson cross section. Since the radiation drag acting on the protons is a factor (me/mp) 2 smaller, electrons and protons are subject to different accelerations, so an electrostatic field is built <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> surface in order to equalize the two flows. As first discussed by â€“ 2...|$|R
60|$|He {{changed his}} {{position}} to a vertical one. He glanced <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> quiet <b>stars,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time emptying his lungs of air. With swift, vigorous propulsion of hands and feet, {{he lifted his}} shoulders and half his chest out of water. This was to gain impetus for the descent. Then he let himself go and sank without movement, a white statue, into the sea. He breathed in the water deeply, deliberately, after {{the manner of a}} man taking an anaesthetic. When he strangled, quite involuntarily his arms and legs clawed the water and drove him up to the surface and into the clear sight of <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R

60|$|The Pathfinder was too unpractised, however, {{to enter}} into distinctions of this kind, and his humble nature was {{encouraged}} by the directness and strength of the words he had just heard.

60|$|And if Mr Clennam {{was one of}} our visitors, and we {{were dancing}} to {{delightful}} music, and were all as gay and light-hearted as ever we could be!

60|$|Then {{as a man}} in a dream he beheld her weeping. There was in her the {{unconsciousness}} of a {{child and}} the passion of a woman. He gazed out into the dark shadows and <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> white <b>stars,</b> and then <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bowed head with its mass of glinting hair. But her agitation was no longer strange to him. A few gentle and kind words had proved her undoing. He knew then that whatever her life was, no kindness or sympathy entered it. Presently she recovered, and sat as before, only whiter of face it seemed, and with something tragic in her dark eyes. She was growing cold and still again, aloof, more like those other Mormon women.|$|R

But he was Augustus Melmotte, and he must bear his burdens, whatever they were, to the end. He could reach no place so distant but that he would be known and traced.|$|R
