5|$|All in all, the Soviet period saw a {{significant}} increase in population (799,000 in 1970 vs. 15,000 in 1913), although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the railroads and the sea coast. Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> were used for deer herding. In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.|$|E

5|$|The Sami peoples {{were subject}} to forced collectivization, {{with more than half}} of their {{reindeer}} herds collectivized in 1928–1930. In addition, the traditional Sami herding practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding. Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices, this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero, which became the cultural center of the Sami people in Russia. Those Sami resisting the collectivization {{were subject to}} forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin's death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas,</b> although some herd reindeer across much of the region.|$|E

25|$|A local urban {{legend has}} it that a fire once broke out in one of the unincorporated areas near an Anaheim city fire station, and that firemen on duty {{witnessed}} the fire but allowed the structure to burn since it was not within their jurisdiction.

25|$|The role of {{the public}} {{is a major factor}} for the {{effective}} prevention of eutrophication. In order for a policy to have any effect, the public must be aware of their contribution to the problem, and ways in which they can reduce their effects.

Flood flows in urban environments have been studied relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events.

Numerous recreational sites, both public and private, exist within the creek's watershed.|$|E

40|$|In Beijing, some crop {{field is}} similar to <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> in {{spectral}} space of ETM+ image, {{and this is an}} obstacle to extract <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> of Beijing from ETM+ image. Furthermore, classical texture such as variance can not improve the seperability of such two landcovers. This article proposed a skewness based framework to extract the profile of <b>urbanized</b> <b>area,</b> while skewness was seldom applied in optical images. Firstly, skewness image was generated from the panchromatic image of ETM+, and it was smoothened using low-pass filter. Secondly, skewness and spectral information, from multi-spectral bands, were combined to fully utilized both texture and spectral information. Finally, morphological operation and DEM data were employed to perfect the classification result. Through visual interpretation, the extracted <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> is accurate in large scale, so the “profile ” of urban was obtained. At last, accuracy assessment showed that accuracy of the skewness based classification was 10 % higher than traditional approaches. 1...|$|R

25|$|Railway {{tracks are}} laid upon land owned or leased by the railway company. Owing to the {{desirability}} of maintaining modest grades, rails will often be laid in circuitous routes in hilly or mountainous terrain. Route length and grade requirements can be reduced {{by the use of}} alternating cuttings, bridges and tunnels – all of which can greatly increase the capital expenditures required to develop a right of way, while significantly reducing operating costs and allowing higher speeds on longer radius curves. In densely <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas,</b> railways are sometimes laid in tunnels to minimize the effects on existing properties.|$|E
25|$|During the Age of Enlightenment and in {{the early}} nineteenth century, England was the place where {{vegetarian}} ideas were more welcome than anywhere else in Europe, and the English vegetarians were particularly enthusiastic about the practical implementation of their principles. In England, vegetarianism was strongest in the northern and middle regions, specifically <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas.</b> As vegetarianism spread across the country, more working-class people began to identify as vegetarians, though still a small number in comparison to the number of meat eaters in the country. Though there were established groups all across England, the movement failed to gain popular support and was drowned out by other, more exciting, struggles of the late-nineteenth century.|$|E

As of the 2016 Canadian Census, there are 837,130 people of Filipino descent living in Canada, most living in <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas.</b> This number is growing yearly due to Canada's more liberal immigration laws to compensate for their low population growth. Filipino Canadians are the third-largest Asian Canadian group in the nation after the Indian and Chinese communities. They are also the largest Southeast Asian group in the country. Between the 2011 National Household Survey and the 2016 Census, the Filipino community in Canada grew from 662,605 to 837,130, a growth of about 26%, compared {{to the rest of}} Canada which grew by 5% in the same time period.|$|E
