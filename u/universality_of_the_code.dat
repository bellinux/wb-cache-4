40|$|Sixty-one codons specify 20 {{amino acids}} {{offering}} cells many options for encoding a polypeptide sequence. Two new studies (Cannarozzi et al, 2010, Tuller et al., 2010) now foster {{the idea that}} patterns of codon usage can control ribosome speed, fine-tuning translation to increase <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> protein synthesis. Just about every molecular biologist, intentionally or not, has conducted experiments on <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> codon usage during translation. For example, to prepare a protein of interest, a foreign gene might be expressed in a heterologous host like the bacterium Escherichia coli, but disappointingly either no protein is produced or the resulting product is inactive.

Bibliography: leaves 109 - 114. viii, 114 l illusAn 8 s {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) species, {{isolated}} from rabbit reticulocytes, has been purified by salt fractionation and analyzed for characteristics of an information-carrying, messenger RNA. This RNA in reticulocytes {{is restricted to}} polyribosome complexes which are active in hemoglobin synthesis and has a base composition similar to that expected of a messenger RNA for rabbit globin. This RNA species has been assayed for the ability to support and direct protein synthesis in bacterial extracts. The 8 s RNA from reticulocyte polyribosomes is translated when only N-acetyl-valyl- tRNA is present as an initiation residue. Both rabbit globin polypeptide chains have N-terminal valine residues. The protein produced in bacterial extracts directed by this RNA is identical to rabbit globin by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, carboxymethyl-Sephadex C 50, paper electrophoresis and gel-filtration on Sephadex G 75. The protein product combines with added hemin and the resultant complex is indistinguishable from native rabbit hemoglobin by the above criteria. <b>The</b> profile <b>of</b> tryptic peptides from chromatography on Dowex 50 x 2 indicates the product is N-acetyl globin. <b>The</b> implications <b>of</b> these results concerning <b>the</b> <b>universality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic <b>code</b> and <b>of</b> protein biosynthetic mechanisms at a macromolecular level are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{established}} in aminoacylation reactions whereby amino acids are joined to tRNAs bearing the anticodons {{of the genetic}} code. Paradoxically, while the code is universal there are many examples of species-specific aminoacylations, where a tRNA from one taxonomic domain cannot be acylated by a synthetase from another. Here we consider an example where a human, but not a bacterial, tRNA synthetase charges its cognate eukaryotic tRNA and where the bacterial, but not the human, enzyme charges the cognate bacterial tRNA. While the bacterial enzyme has less than 10 % sequence identity with the human enzyme, transplantation of a 39 amino acid peptide from the human into the bacterial enzyme enabled the latter to charge its eukaryotic tRNA counterpart in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, substitution of the corresponding peptide of the bacterial enzyme for that of the human enabled the human enzyme to charge bacterial tRNA. This peptide element discriminates a base pair difference in the respective tRNA acceptor stems. Thus, functionally important co-adaptations of a synthetase to its tRNA act as small modular units that can be moved across taxonomic domains and thereby preserve the <b>universality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>code...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background It {{is common}} belief that all {{cellular}} life forms on earth {{have a common}} origin. This view is supported by <b>the</b> <b>universality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic <b>code</b> and <b>the</b> universal conservation <b>of</b> multiple genes, particularly those that encode key components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> translation system. A remarkable recent study claims to provide a formal, homology independent test <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universal Common Ancestry hypothesis by comparing <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> a common-ancestry model and a multiple-ancestry model to predict sequences of universally conserved proteins. Results We devised a computational experiment on a concatenated alignment of universally conserved proteins which shows that <b>the</b> purported demonstration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal common ancestry is a trivial consequence of significant sequence similarity between the analyzed proteins. The nature and origin of this similarity are irrelevant for <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> "common ancestry" <b>of</b> by <b>the</b> model-comparison approach. Thus, homology (common origin) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compared proteins remains an inference from sequence similarity rather than an independent property demonstrated by the likelihood analysis. Conclusion A formal demonstration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universal Common Ancestry hypothesis has not been achieved and {{is unlikely to be}} feasible in principle. Nevertheless, the evidence in support of this hypothesis provided by comparative genomics is overwhelming.

30|$|<b>The</b> details <b>of</b> BP {{decoding}} algorithm and the EXIT {{analysis for}} single-user LDPC codes {{can be found}} in[17, 19]. In EXIT analysis, <b>the</b> analytical computation <b>of</b> mutual information is feasible only if the outgoing LLRs from the nodes in the factor graph have a Gaussian (or Gaussian-mixture) distribution[19]. When the channel is binary-input AWGN (BiAWGN) channel, the outgoing LLR values are Gaussian distributed[14]. For other types <b>of</b> channels, <b>the</b> Gaussian approximation <b>of</b> LLRs {{is known to be}} a good approximation, due to <b>the</b> <b>universality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LDPC <b>codes</b> (a code designed for one type of channel performs well on a another type <b>of</b> a channel)[15]. <b>The</b> analytical expressions for iterative mutual information updates through CBV nodes and PCF nodes in EXIT analysis is well known[17]. In particular, the mutual information update through a CBV node stems from the message update through that variable node and the central limit theorem. That is, since an outgoing message of a given node has the mean equal to <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> means of incoming messages to that node, given a reasonably high node degree, the outgoing message is approximately Gaussian. The mutual information update for a PCF node on the other hand relies on the deterministic relationship between the PCF node and the CBV nodes connected to it, as defined by the parity check equations. As a result, the mutual information update for a PCF node can be computed by simply using duality relationship that it has with a CBV node[20].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>The</b> (almost) <b>universality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic <b>code</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{intriguing}} properties of cellular life. Nevertheless, several variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard genetic <b>code</b> have been observed, which differ {{in one or}} several of 64 codon assignments and occur mainly in mitochondrial genomes and in nuclear genomes of some bacterial and eukaryotic parasites. These variants are usually considered to be <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> non-adaptive evolution. It {{has been shown that}} <b>the</b> standard genetic <b>code</b> is preferential to randomly assembled codes for its ability to reduce <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> errors in protein translation. Results Using a genotype-to-phenotype mapping based on a quantitative model of protein folding, we compare <b>the</b> standard genetic <b>code</b> to seven of its naturally occurring variants with respect to the fitness loss associated to mistranslation and mutation. These fitness losses are computed through computer simulations of protein evolution with mutations that are either neutral or lethal, and different mutation biases, which influence the balance between unfolding and misfolding stability. We show that <b>the</b> alternative <b>codes</b> may produce significantly different mutation and translation loads, particularly for genomes evolving with a rather large mutation bias. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alternative genetic <b>codes</b> are found to be disadvantageous to <b>the</b> standard <b>code,</b> in agreement with the view that <b>the</b> change <b>of</b> genetic <b>code</b> is a mutationally driven event. Nevertheless, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studied alternative genetic codes is predicted to be preferable to <b>the</b> standard <b>code</b> for a broad range of mutation biases. Conclusions Our results show that, with one exception, <b>the</b> standard genetic <b>code</b> is generally better able to reduce the translation load than the naturally occurring variants studied here. Besides this exception, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other alternative genetic codes are predicted to be better adapted for extreme mutation biases. Hence, <b>the</b> fixation <b>of</b> alternative genetic codes might be a neutral or nearly-neutral event in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases, but adaptation cannot be excluded for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studied cases. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to find general {{principles}} governing the behaviour of biological systems, {{with a particular}} emphasis in the communicational (social) aspect of these systems. Communication between biological entities {{plays a major role}} in their evolution, enabling them to exchange information about their environment and thereby improving their chances of survival. Communication also plays a pivotal role in the organisation of populations of organisms, clearly observed in social insects, but present also at least in bacteria, plants, fungi, animals and humans. It is also theorised that the genetic code is a by-product of the establishment of an innovation-sharing protocol between primitive cells [Vetsigian et al., 2006]. This thesis is mainly concerned with identifying necessary conditions for the emergence of communicational codes, and the problems that arise with their establishment. For this purpose, we introduce an information-theoretic framework where species maximise their growth rate by following a Kelly-gambling strategy to bet on environmental conditions. Information theory provides a powerful tool for abstracting away mechanisms and for focusing on hard limits of a system's dynamics which cannot be circumvented. We begin by exploring the relation between information exchange and limited resources. We show that a transition from cooperation to antagonism in the exchange of environmental information follows from a change in the availability of resources, from abundant to scarce. We then assume a non-competitive scenario with abundance of resources, where conflicts in a population occur only at a communicational (informational) level, rather than on the physical level, such as competing for (physical) resources. However, traditional Shannon communication is non-semantic, as opposed to the semantic communication observed in biological systems, which is necessary for capturing conflicts in communication. In the traditional use of information theory, it is assumed that every organism knows how to " the information offered by other organisms. However, this assumes that one" which other organisms one observes, and thus which code they use. In our model, however, we wish to preclude that: namely, we will do away with the assumption that the identity of the organisms who send the messages and those who receive them is known, and the resulting usable information is therefore influenced by the <b>universality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>code</b> used and by which organisms an organism is " to. We introduce a model which captures semantic communication in information-theoretic terms, where organisms talk to each other in a communication network. We show that, for particular population structures, when organisms cannot identify which other organisms they talk to, the adoption of a universal code emerges as a solution for full interpretation of the shared information. However, the evolution and establishment of universal codes for communication introduces vulnerabilities: organisms can be exploited by parasites. We de ne two types of parasites whose strategies have different levels of complexity and study the co-evolution of a host (the population) and a parasite by optimising their respective objective functions in stages. First, we consider a disruptive parasite (a troll) that inflicts harm in a host by minimising a population's mutual understanding, and then a more complex parasite, which manipulates the members of the population via their codes (the puppetmaster). We show emergent characterisations of both parasites, as well as which host configurations are robust against parasites and show adaptive properties. This thesis introduces a framework which allows the study of informational properties in the host-parasite co-evolution, where the rules of the parasite's habitat, the host, are the outcome of an evolutionary process, and where these very same rules are those that allow the parasite to exploit the host...|$|E
