40|$|Background—Patients who {{complain}} of constipation {{can be divided}} into those who have lost the natural call to stool, but develop abdominal discomfort after several days without a bowel movement (no urge); and those who experience a constant sensation of incomplete evacuation (urge).  Aims—To determine whether the two groups differ in symptoms, colonic transit, and perceptual responses to controlled rectal distension.  Methods—Forty four patients with constipation were evaluated with a bowel symptom questionnaire, colonic transit (radiopaque markers), and rectal balloon distension. Stool (S) and discomfort (D) thresholds to slow ramp (40 ml/min) and rapid phasic distension (870 ml/min) were determined with an electronic distension device. Fifteen healthy controls were also studied.  Results—All patients had Rome positive irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); 17 were no urge and 27 <b>urge.</b> <b>Mean</b> D threshold to phasic rectal distensions was 28 (3) mm Hg in no urge, 27 (3) mm Hg in urge (NS), but higher in the control group (46 (2) mm Hg; p< 0. 01). Sixty seven per cent of no urge and 69 % of urge were hypersensitive for D. Slow ramp distension thresholds were higher in no urge (S: 26 (3); D: 45 (4) mm Hg) compared with urge (S: 16 (2); D: 31 (3) mm Hg; p< 0. 01), or with controls (S: 15 (1); D: 30 (3); p< 0. 01).  Conclusions—Hyposensitivity to slow rectal distension is found in patients with IBS {{who complain}} of constipation and have lost the call to stool even though their sensitivity to phasic distension is increased. ...|$|R

40|$|Natural language—spoken and signed—is a {{multichannel}} phenomenon, involving facial {{and body}} expression, and voice and visual intonation {{that is often}} used {{in the service of}} a social urge to communicate meaning. Given that iconicity seems easier and less abstract than making arbitrary connections between sound and meaning, iconicity and gesture have often been invoked in the origin of language alongside the urge to convey meaning. To get a fresh perspective, we critically distinguish the origin of a system capable of evolution from the subsequent evolution that system becomes capable of. Human language arose on a substrate of a system already capable of Darwinian evolution; the genetically supported uniquely human ability to learn a language reflects a key contact point between Darwinian evolution and language. Though implemented in brains generated by DNA symbols coding for protein meaning, the second higher-level symbol-using system of language now operates in a world mostly decoupled from Darwinian evolutionary constraints. Examination of Darwinian evolution of vocal learning in other animals suggests that the initial fixation of a key prerequisite to language into the human genome may actually have required initially side-stepping not only iconicity, but the <b>urge</b> to <b>mean</b> itself.

Using validated 13 C octanoic and lactose-[13 C] ureide breath tests gastric half-emptying time and oro-cecal transit time for a meal were measured in 12 volunteers. The tests were repeated in randomized order: during isobaric balloon distension and during sham distension. Isobaric rectal distension was applied using a polyethylene bag connected to a barostat. Intraballoon pressure was kept just below the threshold for the <b>urge</b> sensation. <b>Mean</b> gastric half-emptying time during rectal distension (92. 3 +/- 5. 1 min) was significantly higher than during sham distension (78. 8 +/- 4 min; P = 0. 015).

40|$|Background: Patients {{with chronic}} {{constipation}} have loss of or diminished urge sensation. The underlying cortical processing for the alteration of urge sensation is unknown. We postulated {{there might be}} abnormal or diminished cortical processing in patients with constipation. Aim: to investigate cortical processing in patients with functional constipation. Methods: Patients with functional constipation (n= 19) and normal healthy subjects (n= 13) were recruited. The rectal compliance in both group was determined using barostat. The <b>mean</b> <b>urge</b> sensation of the normal subjects were calculated and then the subliminal, liminal and supraliminal pressures were determined. Patients were required to press a button indicating urge or strong sensation. Functional MRI based on the Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) effect carried out in a 3 T MRI System was performed for both groups with the barostat connected. The distention paradigm consisted of subliminal, liminal and supraliminal pressures interleaved with rest period. The software SPM 99 was used for data analysis. Results: There {{was no difference in}} sex (p= 0. 6), age (p= 0. 15) or rectal compliace (6. 6 ± 3. 7 vs 6. 0 ± 1. 6 ml/mmHg, p= 0. 064) in the constipated and control groups. The <b>mean</b> <b>urge</b> sensation of the healthy subjects was 30 mmHg, therefore the subliminal, liminal, and supraliminal pressures were 15 mmHg, 30 mmHg, and 45 mmHg, respectively. The cortical areas represented at subliminal and supraliminal pressures were similar in both groups. However, the volume of cortical activity at parietal lobe and precuneus was lower in constipated subjects at liminal pressure (P< 0. 003). There was frontal and limbic lobe activation in the normal subjects at urge sensation but not in constipated subjects (p< 0. 0034).

Of those treated with implantation 96 (63. 2 %) had urge incontinence, 25 (16. 4 %) had urgency frequency and 31 (20. 4 %) had retention. Voiding diaries were collected annually for 5 years. Clinical success was defined as 50 % or greater improvement from baseline in primary voiding diary variable(s). RESULTS: Data for all implanted cases were reported. For patients with <b>urge</b> incontinence <b>mean</b> leaking episodes per day decreased from 9. 6 +/- 6. 0 to 3. 9 +/- 4. 0 at 5 years. For patients with urgency frequency mean voids per day decreased from 19. 3 +/- 7. 0 to 14. 8 +/- 7. 6, and mean volume voided per void increased from 92. 3 +/- 52. 8 to 165. 2 +/- 147. 7 ml. For patients with retention the mean volume per catheterization decreased from 379. 9 +/- 183. 8 to 109. 2 +/- 184. 3 ml, and {{the mean number of}} catheterizations decreased from 5. 3 +/- 2. 8 to 1. 9 +/- 2. 8.

To this end, we examined the role of BE among different body positions in Taiwanese people with constipation. MethodsFourteen Taiwanese adults (age range, 19 – 61 years), including six healthy volunteers (4 male, 2 female) and eight patients with chronic constipation (1 male, 7 female) underwent solid-state anorectal manometry and BE. The demographic data of all individuals were recorded at enrollment. ResultsCompared to healthy volunteers, patients with chronic constipation had a numerically lower threshold for mean resting pressure (p =  0. 052), squeeze pressure, maximal squeeze pressure, and lower threshold volumes for urge, but higher threshold pressures for compliance. Successful BE seemed to be associated with lower mean resting pressure (p =  0. 061), lower mean threshold volumes for <b>urge,</b> and higher <b>mean</b> maximal squeeze pressure for compliance. Although patients with chronic constipation had a numerically lower successful rate of rectal BE than healthy controls, the differences did not reach statistical significance.

This study administered three readiness rulers and aimed to identify subtypes of gamblers accessing a national web-based counselling service based on these rulers. METHODS: Participants were 1204 gamblers (99. 4 % problem gamblers) who accessed a single session of web-based counselling in Australia. Measures included three readiness rulers (importance, readiness and confidence to resist an urge to gamble), demographics and the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). RESULTS: Gamblers reported high importance of change [mean = 9. 2, standard deviation (SD)  = 1. 51] and readiness to change (mean = 8. 86, SD = 1. 84), but lower confidence to resist an <b>urge</b> to gamble (<b>mean</b> = 3. 93, SD = 2. 44) compared with importance and readiness. The statistical fit indices of a latent class analysis identified a four-class model. Subtype 1 was characterized by a very high readiness to change and very low confidence to resist an urge to gamble (n = 662, 55. 0 %) and subtype 2 reported high readiness and low confidence (n = 358, 29. 7 %). Subtype 3 reported moderate ratings on all three rulers (n = 139, 11. 6 %) and subtype 4 reported high importance of change but low readiness and confidence (n = 45, 3. 7 %).

40|$|Objective The goal of {{this study}} was to define the utility of urinary {{incontinence}} in women using the Standard Gamble, the gold standard method for determining health state utilities, based on a diagnosis obtained from multichannel urodynamic testing, the gold standard in clinical diagnosis. Background Health state utility values are important in many areas of medical research. The values are used in cost-utility analysis, decision analysis and health related quality of life studies. To date, studies that have estimated the utility of urinary incontinence in women have relied on values from generic health related quality of life questionnaires such as the ED- 5 Q and Health Utilities Index or from expert opinion. The utility of urinary incontinence in these studies appears to be unintuitivelylow, at 0. 71 to 0. 82, with perfect health represented by 1. 0. The utility of health states that are much more debilitating, for example cancer (0. 82), is higher than urinary incontinence. These studies have relied on patient self-diagnosis of incontinence. Additionally, they have considered all types of urinary incontinence together. Intuitively, one would think that quality of life would be affected differently with different types (stress, urge, mixed) and differing severity of incontinence. Methods All adult female patients who underwent urodynamic testing at Brigham and Women’s Hospital were prospectively recruited. Diagnosis of type of incontinence was made by attending physician interpretation of the urodynamic study. No exclusion criteria. Patients completed three validated questionnaires: Sandvik Severity Index - A validated two question symptom specific instrument to evaluate urinary incontinence EQ- 5 D -A five-domain generic quality of life questionnaire. Answers are converted into a utility value. Visual Analog Scale - Vertical line from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health). Patient rates own perception of health on line. The Standard Gamble technique was used in a standard format to determine each patient’s utility value for their health state. Patient is asked to choose between life in current health state and varying risks of immediate painless death. Gold Standard method to determine patients utility preference for their health state. Results This pilot study of 28 patients demonstrated a significant difference in utility value derived from the Standard Gamble and the generic health-related quality of life instruments. There were 21 patients with stress urinary incontinence, 6 patients with urge urinary incontinence and 1 patient with mixed urinary incontinence. Mean Sandvik score was higher in <b>Urge</b> Incontinence subgroup. <b>Mean</b> Utility from Standard Gamble was lower in Urge Incontinence group.

40|$|Background: Void Frequency (VF) has {{recently}} been determined as a valid and reliable marker of 24 -hr hydration status when void urgency is controlled (i. e., urinating at “first urge”). Limitations for real world applicability of this technique are apparent because individuals often void at varying urge levels throughout the day. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if urgency affects the validity of void number as a marker of hydration status. We hypothesized that void urgency would not affect the validity of void number as a way to assess hydration status. Methodology: Participants included 18 females and 13 males (Age= 239 yrs, BMI= 25. 14. 1 kg/m 2). Participants visited the lab 5 times; one familiarization visit and 4 experimental trials. The 4 randomized and counter-balanced experimental trials included: euhydrated ad libitum urge trial (EA), dehydrated ad libitum urge trial (DA), euhydrated first urge trial (E 1) and dehydrated first urge trial (D 1), where urgency was measured with a 0 - 4 scale (0 = no sensation, 1 =first sensation, 2 = first urge to void, 3 = strong urge and 4 = uncomfortable <b>urge).</b> Ad libitum <b>means</b> individuals urinated “at free will”, while first urge meant individuals urinated at a “ 2 ” on the scale indicting the first urge to void. During the dehydrated trials, fluid intake was restricted to 500 mL per 24 -hour period, while euhydrated trials encouraged fluid consumption. Regardless of the trial, participants were asked to collect their voids in medical grade urine containers and record the time of day, urgency, and thirst level while marking a line indicating the level of urine in the container. Lab analysis included measuring urine color, urine specific gravity (USG), and osmolality (OSM). Results: Urinary values for the E 1 trial were: OSM= 451 165 mosm/kg, USG= 1. 012. 004, void number= 73. Urinary values for the EA trial were: OSM= 429187 mosm/kg, USG= 1. 011. 004, void number= 73. Urinary values for the D 1 trial were: OSM= 878133 mosm/kg, USG= 1. 023. 003, void number= 42. Urinary values for the DA trial were: OSM= 895 143 mosm/kg, USG= 1. 024. 003, void number= 41. Urinary values between the first urge and ad libitum trials were not significantly different from each other independent of hydration status (p 3 ̆e. 05). By using a two-way ANOVA test it was determined that hydration status affects void number (p-value 3 ̆c. 001), however there was no effect of ad libitum urgency or first urge urgency on void number (p-value =. 50. Additionally, there was no interaction between hydration status and urge to void instructions on void number (p-value=. 73) Conclusion: These findings suggest that void urgency does not ultimately affect the validity of void number as a way to assess hydration status. Therefore, individuals can be instructed to urinate at any level of urgency and the number of times they void in 24 h is still a valid indicator of hydration status...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to examine the {{perceptions}} of a sample of graduate teachers (B. Ed. Hons.) in primary schools of beginning teaching. It consists of a questionnaire survey of 57 teachers in he first year of teaching (1986 - 1987) and case studies, based on interviews, documents and questionnaires, of 10 teachers during their first four years of teaching (1986 - 1990). The study begins with a brief outline of its purpose and methods (Introduction) and an account of influences an teachers and teacher training from 1970 - 1990 to place it in context (Chapter 1.). Part 1. (Ch. 2 - 6) gives details of the survey. Data analysis Shows that the training course was seen as helpful by more teachers than any in-service support, although this was still a minority. Teachers were at different developmental stages and the majority received little inservice support and found evaluation of teaching difficult. Certain 'beliefs', for example a belief in group teaching, were widely held. In Part 2. (Ch. 7 - 10) methods of data collection and analysis for 10 case studies are given. A synthesis of data {{in the form of a}} life history was sent to each subject for verification at the end of four years. Theoretical frameworks adopted from Fuller (1969). Lacey (1977) and Berlak and Berlak (1981) were used in analysis of life histories to form case studies, allowing themes to emerge. Comparison of the case studies in an analytic survey suggests that new teachers enter teaching with an 'ideal' but find adjustment necessary to the reality of being a class teacher. In the first year of teaching student teaching practice is seen as unrealistic, giving insufficient experience in teaching basic skills, class organisation and long-term planning. Years 2 - 4 mark a period of professional growth, when teachers appear to learn more effectively from their teaching experience, placing theory in a practical context. Although it appears that the theoretical base of the ideal of teaching may have been imperfectly conceptualised as a student, the ideal is retained. Once teachers begin to 'know the Job' they look for further intellectual stimulus and career challenge and this nay occur in the second or third year of teaching. In Chapter 11. the influence of personal theory disposition an the development of theory-practice relationships is considered and related to theories associated with teacher learning. Conclusions from the study and implications for initial training, teacher development and further research are discussed. The importance of extended school experience with opportunity for reflection and analysis of teaching is argued. Training for mentors is <b>urged</b> as a <b>means</b> of pronoting collaborative enquiry between mentor, student/new teacher, and college tutor, establishing continuity between training and induction and stimulating whole school development. The need for attention to student teachers' individual learning needs, and to their acquisition of the broad range of competencies required for classroom teaching and for reflective analysis and further professional development, is also stressed. A brief conclusion points to the compromise entailed in drawing generalisations whilst attempting to preserve the individual teacher's 'voice'...|$|R
40|$|PROGEFIA (Programme General de Formation en Information Agricole/General Programme for Training in Agricultural Information) is an {{innovation}} in agricultural information training, which involves a pooling of all available resources and {{which aims to}} improve North-South and South-South cooperation. PROGEFIA {{is based on the}} voluntary participation of the prime movers in the development of agricultural information systems in developing countries. It came into being because of a common wish to overcome the inadequate training of librarians and agricultural documentalists - a need which was identified during an international meeting on training in agricultural information in Rome in June 1988. This gathering asked CTA to draw up a strategy for a training programme for librarians and agricultural documentalists. which could serve as a basis for a united plan of action. The strategy was discussed by experts in this field who met at Libreville, Gabon, at the end of December 1989. Their brief was to see how the results and recommendations of the Rome meeting could be translated into action and to identify the most urgent needs in the developing countries for training in agricultural information. The second objective of the Libreville symposium was to study how best to match supply to demand for training and how to set up PROGEFIA in as short a time as possible and finally, to consider how it might develop in the short and medium term. Agricultural infommation is a necessary component of any plan for the improvement of agricultural productivity. At present national and regional information services can only make a very limited contribution to solving development problems and, for this reason, the symposium made agricultural information training a top priority in the development of national and regional infrastructures. All interested institutions (agricultural, agricultural information science, professional associations) were invited to set up the administrative mechanisms, both nationally and regionally, which would permit their participation in PROGEFIA and to identify in detail their needs in the field of training so that PROGEFIA could start working on its objectives immediately. Given the importance of the subject in the policies of the developing ACP countries, the symposium also recommended that information science colleges or courses should include Agricultural Information Training programmes in their regular training or higher training syllabuses. Any such new direction must require the academic authorities to give their syllabuses the weight of Universities of Development'. Pittsburgh University has unique experience in the field of agricultural information training and has offered to share this with developing countries. Therefore the symposium <b>urged</b> that the <b>means</b> whereby this cooperation between Pittsburgh and the countries of the South could be made operative should be initiated. PROGEFIA has a very real chance of success because of the considerable interest shown by bilateral and muItilateral cooperation agencies, by professional associations such as IAALD (International Association of Agricultural Librarians and Documentalists), and also because of CTA's role in coordinating the programme. CTA is also cooperating with EIB (Ecole Internationale de Bordeaux) to organize a course on information management by documentary micro-computing. This will consist of two workshops held six months apart, each lasting four weeks, which will allow the participants to put their knowledge into practice in the field and to acquire the practical experience which is crucial to any approach to database management. PROGEFIA therefore offers an innovative approach which will restructure the availability of training to the real needs of those seeking it. However, its success - which must be based on synergy and combined action - will demand a great deal of energy and commitmentinternational meeting on training in agricultural information in Rome in June 1988...|$|R
40|$|The Democratic state central {{committee}} decided {{yesterday that the}} party 2 ̆ 7 s 1982 U. S. Senate candidate will be chosen at a convention in Roanoke June 4 - 5. The June 4 - 5 date means the Democrats will be choosing their Senate nominee the same weekend as state Republicans and will mark {{the first time in}} modern Virginia political history that the two parties have held conventions at the same time. But few members of the Democratic committee [...] its dominant mood was euphoric because of the party 2 ̆ 7 s sweep of the three statewide offices last month [...] expressed concern about the conflict of dates with the Republicans who will stage their convention in Richmond. The euphoria also was reflected in the standing ovations and cheers that greeted Gov. -elect Charles S. Robb and his running mates, Lt. Gov. -elect Richard J. Davis and Attorney General-elect Gerald L. Baliles. Each made a short thank-you speech and envisioned the leadership Democrats, who had not elected a governor since 1965, would provide Virginia. And the euphoria was reflected when James S. Cremins, a Richmond railroad lawyer who is state party treasurer and who ordinarily speaks in conservative tones, gave not a financial report, but a rousing post-election pep talk. Democrats, Cremins said, are a 2 ̆ 2 vital force 2 ̆ 2 again. But the euphoria was coupled with uncertainty over whom the 1982 Democratic Senate nominee will be and whether {{he will be able to}} maintain the party as Cremins 2 ̆ 7 vital force. Not surprisingly, committee members talked in small groups of prospective candidates; some of whom were present at yesterday 2 ̆ 7 s meeting. Among those there who have been mentioned as possible candidates were former Attorney General Andrew P. Miller, a narrow loser in 1978 to Sen. John W. Warner, and state Sens. Hunter B. Andrews of Hampton and Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. of Fairfax. And Del. Owen B. Pickett of Virginia Beach was there in his role as state party chairman. But the man who emerged as the favorite of many of the committee members was one who was not there [...] former Sen. William B. Spong Jr., who is dean of the College of William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s Marshall-Wythe law school and who has not returned phone calls from reporters wanting to ask if he would consider running. Spong was the winner of an unscientific, informal poll of committee members who were asked to name their top three choices for Senate nomination. Votes were weighted on a 3 - 2 - 1 point basis and Spong had 137 points. Trailing him were Miller (118), Andrews (95), and Pickett (81). Spong served one term in the Senate and was defeated in 1972 by former Sen. William L. Scott, in part because of poor campaign organization and because he was victim of one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s first negative media advertising campaigns. A possible Spong candidacy reportedly also received warm support at a Friday night meeting of a broad range of white and black party leaders. The meeting drew national committeemen, state party officers, General Assembly members and at least two congressional district chairmen, Angus H. Macaulay of the 3 rd and Robert Crouch of the 5 th. There also were expressions of backing for Pickett, who was viewed as a man who would be able, as Robb did, to command support from the state 2 ̆ 7 s financial establishment. One source denied that the meeting had been designed to launch a stop-Miller movement. But another source said that some at the meeting talked of Miller, who also was a narrow loser to Henry Howell in the divisive 1977 gubernatorial primary, as a 2 ̆ 2 man who has had his chances. 2 ̆ 2 Crouch acted as official spokesperson for those who attended the meeting. His only comment on what was discussed was 2 ̆ 2 we talked about everybody who has been mentioned by the Great Mentioner. 2 ̆ 2 Crouch said the group will meet again in January, with its goal being to achieve party unity behind what it perceives the strongest. A search for party unity was the reason Democrats, who traditionally have chosen candidates in a primary, will name their 1982 Senate candidate at a convention. The Democrats 2 ̆ 7 first convention to name a Senate candidate in more than three decades was in 1978 when Miller was nominated. In voting to hold the 1982 convention in Roanoke, the {{central committee}} endorsed a recommendation by the Democratic steering committee, which met yesterday morning. A proposal by a smattering of Northern Virginia central committee members to hold a primary was rejected by a voice vote. The steering committee briefly considered a May 21 - 22 convention, but abandoned that idea because, one of its members said later, 2 ̆ 2 almost every college and high school in Virginia is holding graduation that weekend. 2 ̆ 2 In other action, the central committee approved the addition of a representative of the Democratic Black Caucus to the policy-making steering committee. The move was <b>urged</b> as a <b>means</b> of recognizing the overwhelming black support for Robb, Davis and Baliles...|$|R
