40|$|Large {{amounts of}} digital data must be {{analyzed}} and integrated to generate mineral potential maps, {{which can be}} used for exploration targeting. The quality of the mineral potential maps is dependent {{on the quality of the}} data used as inputs, with higher quality inputs producing higher quality outputs. In mineral exploration, particularly in regions with little to no exploration history, datasets are often incomplete at the scale of investigation with data missing due to incomplete mapping or the unavailability of data over certain areas. It is not always clear that datasets are incomplete, and this study examines how mineral potential mapping results may differ in this context. Different methods of mineral potential mapping provide different ways of dealing with analyzing and integrating incomplete data. This study examines the weights of evidence (WofE), evidential belief function and fuzzy logic methods of mineral potential mapping using incomplete data from the Carajás mineral province, Brazil to target for orogenic gold mineralization. Results demonstrate that WofE is the best one able to predict the location of known mineralization within the study area when either complete or <b>unacknowledged</b> incomplete <b>data</b> are used. It is suggested that this is due to the use of Bayes' rule, which can account for "missing data. " The results indicate the effectiveness of WofE for mineral potential mapping with incomplete data...|$|R

The purpose of this qualitative study was to refine and extend the definition of "mentoring" and to examine the reasons for unacknowledged mentoring by secretaries. Using the constant comparative method of data analysis, the material obtained through in-depth personal interviews was analyzed. The sample consisted of 19 purposively selected participants who described mentoring-type behaviors during an initial survey. All participants were employees of a large aerospace corporation in northwestern Illinois. Data collected led to three major findings. First, mentoring did occur from lower-status secretaries to supervisors of higher status. Second, the contextual confinements of low status, sexism, low respect for the secretarial class, and communication problems made secretarial mentoring unique and different from traditional mentoring, and may partially explain why lower-status mentoring was generally unacknowledged. Third, secretarial mentoring occurred primarily for self-interest of the mentor, countering the assumption in the literature that mentors are altruistic in nature. Study findings are summarized holistically through the construction of a model in which mentoring by a person of lower status than the mentee is viewed as an alternative and sometimes complementary system to traditional mentoring in which the mentor has higher status than the mentee. The functions performed by both types of mentors were similar. However, there were three major differences. From the literature reviewed, higher-status mentors appeared to operate from a teaching posture, were primarily altruistic in their orientation, and were generally acknowledged. Lower-status mentors, in this study, appeared to operate from a learning posture, were primarily interested in their own advancement, and were generally <b>unacknowledged.</b> The <b>data</b> collected in this study suggest that mentoring is being conducted by persons who have lower status than the mentee. Accordingly, a definition of mentoring is offered that does not imply elevated status for either the mentor or mentee: Mentoring is the process of sharing values and accumulated knowledge in order to help both the mentor and mentee grow personally and professionally. Implications for modifying organizational practices and policies, and suggestions for collective actions by individuals within those organizations, are included.

40|$|Abstract — TCP and UDP are the {{dominant}} transport protocols today, with TCP being preferred {{because of the}} lack of fairness mechanisms in UDP. Some time-dependent applications with small bandwidth requirements, however, occationally suffer from unnecessarily high latency due to TCP retransmission mechanisms that are optimized for high-throughput streams. Examples of such thin-stream applications are Internet telephony and multiplayer games. For such interactive applications, the high delays can be devastating to the experience of the service. To address the latency issues, we explored application-transparent, sender-side modifications. We investigated whether it is possible to bundle <b>unacknowledged</b> <b>data</b> to preempt the experience of packet loss and improve the perceived latency in time-dependent systems. We implemented and tested this idea in Linux. Our results show that we can reduce the application latency by trading it against bandwidth. Index Terms — Retransmission latency, thin streams. I...|$|E

In terms of signal reception, directional antennas have shown considerable improvement {{in the performance of}} all aspects over omni-directional antennas, especially over dense networks with heavy traffic load. In addition, we have found that transmitting multicast packets directionally to known neighboring group members or forwarders can help reduce the average end-to-end packet delay and increase the overall throughput. However, directional transmission of <b>unacknowledged</b> <b>data</b> transfers may result in lower performance in terms of packet delivery ratio than omni-directional transmission in any carrier sensing MAC protocols under moderate load due to the effect from the hidden terminal problem. Both analytical results and simulation results, as well as an acknowledgment mechanism to improve the successful delivery rate of multicast data packets, are presented. I...|$|E
40|$|Sensys Networks ’ VDS 240 vehicle {{detection}} {{system is a}} wireless sensor network composed {{of a collection of}} 3 ” by 3 ” by 2 ” sensor nodes put {{in the center of a}} lane and a 6 ” by 4 ” by 4 ” access point (AP) box placed 15 ’ high on the side of the road. A node measures changes in the earth’s magnetic field induced by a vehicle, processes the measurements to detect the vehicle, and transfers the processed data via radio to the AP. The AP combines data from the nodes into information for the local controller or the Traffic Management Center (TMC). An AP communicates via radio directly with up to 96 nodes within a range of 150 ’; a Repeater extends the range to 1000 ’. This range makes it suitable to deploy VDS 240 networks for traffic counts, stop-bar and advance detection, and measurement of queue lengths on ramps and at intersections, as well as parking guidance and enforcement. VDS 240 is self-calibrating, IP-addressable and remotely monitored. Data are not lost because <b>unacknowledged</b> <b>data</b> packets are retransmitted. The accuracy of VDS 240 for vehicle counts, speed and occupancy is comparable to that of welltuned loops. Because the nodes report individual vehicle events, the AP also calculates individual vehicle lengths, speeds and inter-vehicle headways—measurements that can be used for new traffic applications. In July 2007, VDS 240 systems were deployed in arterials and freeways in several cities and states, and 30 customer trials were underway in the U. S., Australia, Europe and South Africa...|$|E
40|$|In this section, {{we present}} an {{alternating}} bit protocol with a sender and a receiver {{processes that are}} subject to message loss faults. Using the synthesis method presented in [1], we synthesize an alternating bit protocol that is nonmasking faulttolerant; i. e., when faults occur the program guarantees recovery to its invariant. However, during recovery, the nonmasking fault-tolerant protocol may temporarily violate it safety specification. The alternating bit protocol (ABP). The fault-intolerant program consists of two processes: a sender and a receiver. The sender reads from an infinite input stream of data packets and sends the newly read packet to the receiver. The receiver copies each received packet into an infinite output stream. When the sender sends a data packet, it waits for an acknowledgement from the receiver before it sends the next packet. Also, when the receiver receives a new data packet, it sends an acknowledgment bit back to the sender. A one-bit message header suffices to identify the data packet currently being sent since at every moment there exists at most one <b>unacknowledged</b> <b>data</b> packet. Using this identifier bit, the sender (respectively, the receiver) does not need count {{the total number of}} packets sent (respectively, received). Both processes have read/write access to a send channel and a receive channel. The send channel is represented by an integer variable cs and the variable cr models the receive channel. The domain of cs (respectively, cr) is {− 1, 0, 1 }, where 0 and 1 represent the value of the data bit in the channel and- 1 represents an empty channel. Since we are only concerned about the synchronization between the sender and the receiver, we do not explicitly consider the actual data being sent. Thus, w...|$|E
40|$|A Networked Control System (NCS) is a feedback-driven {{control system}} wherein the control loops are closed through a {{real-time}} network. Control and feedback signals in an NCS are exchanged among the system’s {{components in the}} form of information packets via the network. Nowadays, wireless technologies such as IEEE 802. 11 are being introduced to modern NCSs as they offer better scalability, larger bandwidth and lower costs. However, this type of network is not designed for NCSs because it introduces a large amount of dropped data, and unpredictable and long transmission latencies due to the characteristics of wireless channels, which are not acceptable for real-time control systems. Real-time control is a class of time-critical application which requires lossless data transmission, small and deterministic delays and jitter. For a real-time control system, network-introduced problems may degrade the system’s performance significantly or even cause system instability. It is therefore important to develop solutions to satisfy real-time requirements in terms of delays, jitter and data losses, and guarantee high levels of performance for time-critical communications in Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs). To improve or even guarantee real-time performance in wireless control systems, this thesis presents several network layout strategies and a new transport layer protocol. Firstly, real-time performances in regard to data transmission delays and reliability of IEEE 802. 11 b-based UDP/IP NCSs are evaluated through simulations. After analysis of the simulation results, some network layout strategies are presented to achieve relatively small and deterministic network-introduced latencies and reduce data loss rates. These are effective in providing better network performance without performance degradation of other services. After the investigation into the layout strategies, the thesis presents a new transport protocol which is more effcient than UDP and TCP for guaranteeing reliable and time-critical communications in WNCSs. From the networking perspective, introducing appropriate communication schemes, modifying existing network protocols and devising new protocols, have been the most effective and popular ways to improve or even guarantee real-time performance to a certain extent. Most previously proposed schemes and protocols were designed for real-time multimedia communication and they are not suitable for real-time control systems. Therefore, devising a new network protocol that is able to satisfy real-time requirements in WNCSs is the main objective of this research project. The Conditional Retransmission Enabled Transport Protocol (CRETP) is a new network protocol presented in this thesis. Retransmitting <b>unacknowledged</b> <b>data</b> packets is effective in compensating for data losses. However, every data packet in realtime control systems has a deadline and data is assumed invalid or even harmful when its deadline expires. CRETP performs data retransmission only in the case that data is still valid, which guarantees data timeliness and saves memory and network resources. A trade-off between delivery reliability, transmission latency and network resources can be achieved by the conditional retransmission mechanism. Evaluation of protocol performance was conducted through extensive simulations. Comparative studies between CRETP, UDP and TCP were also performed. These results showed that CRETP significantly: 1). improved reliability of communication, 2). guaranteed validity of received data, 3). reduced transmission latency to an acceptable value, and 4). made delays relatively deterministic and predictable. Furthermore, CRETP achieved the best overall performance in comparative studies which makes it the most suitable transport protocol among the three for real-time communications in a WNCS...|$|E
