40|$|Abstract—Upper wind data is {{the basic}} data for {{meteorological}} services and military supporting missions, and balloon-tracing method is {{the most commonly used}} method in meteorological operation. In this paper a balloon-tracing and wind measuring method bases on inertial navigation systems (INS) is proposed accounting to the limitation in conventional methods. In this paper, INS measurement for <b>upper</b> <b>wind</b> system is established, its mathematical model is built, and the errors are analyzed. The results indicated that the average relative errors of wind velocity ranges from 2 % to 4 % and average wind direction measurement ranges from 7 degrees to 14 degrees; The maximum relative errors of wind velocity measurement ranges from 8 % to 11 %, the maximum errors of wind direction measurement ranges from 12 degrees to 17 degrees. Above all, the application of INS in <b>upper</b> <b>wind</b> measurement is feasible.) Index Terms—SINS, <b>Upper</b> <b>Wind</b> Measurement, MEMS. I...|$|R

40|$|NASAs LSP {{customers}} {{and the future}} SLS program rely on observations of upper-level winds for steering, loads, and trajectory calculations for the launch vehicles flight. On the day of launch, the 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) Launch Weather Officers (LWOs) monitor the upper-level winds and provide forecasts to the launch team via the AMU-developed LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool for launches at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This tool displays wind speed and direction profiles from rawinsondes released during launch operations, the 45 th Space Wing 915 -MHz Doppler Radar Wind Profilers (DRWPs) and KSC 50 -MHz DRWP, and output from numerical weather prediction models. The goal of this task was to splice the wind speed and direction profiles from the 45 th Space Wing (45 SW) 915 -MHz Doppler radar Wind Profilers (DRWPs) and KSC 50 -MHz DRWP at altitudes where the wind profiles overlap to create a smooth profile. In {{the first version of}} the LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool, the top of the 915 -MHz DRWP wind profile and the bottom of the 50 -MHz DRWP were not spliced, sometimes creating a discontinuity in the profile. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Natural Environments Branch (NE) created algorithms to splice the wind profiles from the two sensors to generate an archive of vertically complete wind profiles for the SLS program. The AMU worked with MSFC NE personnel to implement these algorithms in the LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool to provide a continuous spliced wind profile. The AMU transitioned the MSFC NE algorithms to interpolate and fill data gaps in the data, implement a Gaussian weighting function to produce 50 -m altitude intervals in each sensor, and splice the data together from both DRWPs. They did so by porting the MSFC NE code written with MATLAB software into Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). After testing the new algorithms in stand-alone VBA modules, the AMU replaced the existing VBA code in the LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool with the new algorithms. They then tested the code in the LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool with archived data. The tool will be delivered to the 45 WS after the 50 -MHz DRWP upgrade is complete and the tool is tested with real-time data. The 50 -MHz DRWP upgrade is expected to be finished in October 2014...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reveal the {{evolution}} and structure of heavy rainfalls over Nagasaki district, the authors carried out the observational study using a meteorological RHI radar at Isahaya City. We obtained three-dimensional details of radar echo distribution within a radius of 50 km and up to 15 km in height every 10 minutes. Our observations in June 1996 detected three cases of the line-shaped stationary radar echoes extending from the Nagasaki Peninsula area to the direction of Isahaya Bay. The appearance {{of this kind of}} line echo is fairly common. These particular echoes suggest that there is a topographical effect of rain-cloud formation, because these line-shaped echoes appear only under some common limited conditions, which are : (a) A considerably strong, humid surface wind from the S to SSW. (b) Individual cellular echoes within the linear echoes move in a velocity coinciding with the <b>upper</b> <b>wind,</b> so that, every component is replaced continuously.

40|$|The design <b>charts</b> {{for basic}} <b>wind</b> speeds {{currently}} {{in use in}} Brazil [1] were created in 1977, based on wind speed records from 1950 to 1974. The database covered up to 25 years of wind records obtained in 49 weather stations, totaling 919 station×years of data. Since 1974, additional 37 years of wind records became available, but have not been incorporated in the design code. Hence, the updated <b>wind</b> <b>charts</b> proposed in this paper are long overdue. In this paper, 62 years of wind records in Brazil are gathered in order to construct updated and more reliable <b>wind</b> <b>charts.</b> The original data by Padaratz [2] are complemented by data from 104 airport weather stations, made available through the Wolfram Research Database [3]. In total, 4142 station×years of data {{are used in the}} present study, hence providing much better cover in terms of space and time span. Maximum annual wind speeds for the individual stations are fitted to Gumbel distribu-tions, from which basic wind speeds are evaluated (mean return peri-od of 50 years). Basic wind speeds are used to build a non-linear regression model, using the p-value of the Anderson-Darling good-ness-of-fit test as regression weight. This ensures that extreme value wind distributions for which a good fit is obtained are given more importance in the regression model, reducing the influence of spurious data. The regression model developed herein is used to plot a new design <b>chart</b> for basic <b>wind</b> speeds in Brazil. It is proposed that this new <b>wind</b> <b>chart</b> be incorporated in the Brazilian code for design of structures subject to wind [1]. In this regard, it is observed that basic wind speeds obtained herein are higher than the wind speeds of the current chart for significant parts of Brazil (notably the center, northeast and north), and are the same or smaller {{in some parts of the}} south and southeast. It is shown herein that the main differences between the current and the proposed charts are not due to different modeling assumptions, but are mainly due to the new data. The proposed chart is updated, and is more reliable than the chart cur-rently in use, as it reflects 4142 station×years of data, and covers up to 62 years of wind records...|$|R
