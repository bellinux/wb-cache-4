40|$|The US economy needs low-skill workers {{now more}} than ever, and that {{requires}} a legal channel for the large-scale, employment-based entry of low-skill workers.

5000|$|Soldier {{newspapers}} published before World War I {{have received}} little scholarly attention yet they bear great historical significance.Soldier papers not only documented the everyday cultural {{aspects of life}} in the military at various points in history; they also served to “create a sense of belonging and community for the soldiers.”Soldier papers, while aimed primarily at military men, often made their way back home, linking the men abroad and the people within <b>US</b> <b>borders,</b> <b>creating</b> an “imagined community of empire.”The Bounding Billow was sent back to America, and was referenced in several domestic papers, including the St. Louis Herald [...] and the New York Times.Berkley argues that since the paper’s audience includes the ‘folks at home,’ the paper is serving to spread the domestic boundaries of America beyond its shores. [...] Berkley argues that the Bounding Billow shows “soldiers’ growing consciousness of the role of newspapers in mediating and imagining their community.”In The Anarchy of Empire in the Making of U.S. Culture, Amy Kaplan notes that the Spanish-American War was preceded by rapid U.S. expansion and imperialism under the Doctrine of Manifest Destiny Manifest destiny.Kaplan argues that a period of “Manifest Domesticity” followed the rapid U.S. expansion after the Spanish-American War, including acquisition of many Spanish territories, including Puerto Rico and the Philippines, saying “the notions of the domestic and the foreign mutually constitute one another in an imperial context.”Kaplan goes on to say “’Manifest Domesticity’ turns an imperial nation into a home by producing and colonizing specters of the foreign that lurk inside and outside ever-shifting borders.”The Bounding Billow {{played a key role in}} the imperialist discourse related to the Spanish-American War.The paper itself published maps showing American expansion by “rearranging global relationships through the agency of print.”The Bounding Billow also wrote letters to and received letters from a number of other papers, both foreign and domestic, including an American high school paper, the Butte High School Leader, and the Hong Kong Telegraph. Berkley cites this variety of relationships as indicative of shifting imperial and national identities.|$|R
