40|$|We {{investigate}} the updating behavior of individual consumers regarding their short and long-run inflation expectations. Utilizing the University of Michigan Survey of Consumer's rotating panel microstructure, {{we can identify}} whether individuals adjust their inflation expectations {{over a period of}} six months. We find evidence that the <b>updating</b> <b>frequency</b> has been underestimated. Furthermore, looking at the possible determinants of an update we find support for imperfect information models. Moreover, individual expectations are found to be more accurate after an update and forecast accuracy is affected by inflation volatility measures and news regarding inflation.

40|$|The present-day {{industries}} incorporate many applications, {{and complex}} processes, hence, {{a large number}} of sensors with dissimilar process deadlines and sensor <b>update</b> <b>frequencies</b> will be in place. This paper presents a scheduling algorithm, which takes into account the varying deadlines of the sensors connected to the cluster-head, and formulates a static schedule for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based communication. The scheme uses IEEE 802. 15. 4 e superframe as a baseline and proposes a new superframe structure. For evaluation purposes the <b>update</b> <b>frequencies</b> of different industrial processes are considered. The scheduling algorithm is evaluated under varying network loads by increasing the number of nodes affiliated to a cluster-head. The static schedule generated by the scheduling algorithm offers reduced energy consumption, improved reliability, efficient network load management and improved information to control bits ratio...|$|R
40|$|Nature is {{rich with}} many {{different}} {{examples of the}} cohesive motion of animals. Previous attempts to model collective motion have primarily focused on group behaviours of identical individuals. In contrast, we put our emphasis on modelling the contributions of different individual-level characteristics within such groups by using stochastic asynchronous updating of individual positions and orientations. Our model predicts that higher <b>updating</b> <b>frequency,</b> which we relate to perceived threat, leads to more synchronized group movement, with speed and nearest-neighbour distributions becoming more uniform. Experiments with three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that were exposed to different threat levels provide strong empirical support for our predictions. Our {{results suggest that the}} behaviour of fish (at different states of agitation) can be explained by a single parameter in our model: the <b>updating</b> <b>frequency.</b> We postulate a mechanism for collective behavioural changes in different environment-induced contexts, and explain our findings with reference to confusion and oddity effects...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the extent to which the degree of {{heterogeneity}} of inflation expectations is driven by the flow of information related to current and future price developments. To that end, we follow three routes: i) We propose different measures of information flow that have either a sender or a receiver perspective; ii) We present empirical results for the US and selected EU countries that aim to corroborate the hypothesis that news have the ability to densify expectations, i. e. to reduce forecast heterogeneity; and iii) We augment some otherwise standard models of expectation formation by allowing the individual <b>updating</b> <b>frequency</b> to depend on the observed measure of information flow; since the <b>updating</b> <b>frequency</b> is higher at times of high inflation and decreasing thereafter, this mechanism can contribute to upward biases in inflation expectations over long periods of time...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the optimal pricing strategies with reference effects in revenue management settings. We firstly propose a static pricing model with the properties of stochastic demand, finite horizon and fixed capacity, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Secondly, we extend the fixed pricing model to a periodic pricing model and incorporate a memory-based reference price in the demand function to investigate how the reference effect impacts on traditional revenue management decisions. We present numerical examples in both low demand situations and high demand situations for different levels of reference effects and different <b>updating</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The results show that the dynamic pricing strategies are superior to a static one even when reference effects are taken into consideration. We also provide some manage-rial insights including pricing directions, pricing dispersion and the optimal <b>updating</b> <b>frequency</b> for both demand situations...|$|R

40|$|In VANET (vehicular ad hoc network) environment, the {{successive}} vehicle position data actually are discrete, so {{the key to}} the moving vehicle modeling is to effectively reduce the <b>updating</b> <b>frequency</b> of the position data so as to alleviate the communication and database management load. This paper proposes vehicle position data updating strategy with packet repetition based on Kalman filter predicting. Firstly, we design a position data updating model based on Kalman filter difference predicting equations. Then, we design a packet repetition mode decision algorithm, which is applied to deliver vehicle position updating data. The model with packet repetition can not only generate position updating data according to preset threshold, but also decide packet repetition mode related to the distance of two adjacent vehicles in order to reduce data loss. Both simulated highway and realistic urban road experimental results show that vehicle position data <b>updating</b> <b>frequency</b> could be obviously reduced and the reliability of the communication is greatly improved through packet repetition mechanism by using this position updating strategy...|$|R

50|$|The RUC ran at {{the highest}} {{frequency}} of any forecast model at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), assimilating recent observations to provide very high frequency updates of current conditions and short-range forecasts. This <b>update</b> <b>frequency</b> was only once an hour (the standard interval for ASOS observation reporting), and with computational limitations and {{the time required to}} assimilate all of the data, there is approximately a one-hour delay in producing the forecasts. Because of this, it was common practice to use a one-hour forecast from the RUC as a current analysis, as the one-hour forecast would come out only a few minutes before the time it is forecasting for. There is also little possibility for error in a one-hour forecast, meaning that the RUC's one-hour forecast would not usually vary greatly from the actual state of the atmosphere at that particular point in time.|$|E
50|$|For example, if an IMU {{installed}} in an aeroplane moving along a certain direction vector were to measure a plane's acceleration as 5 m/sec^2 for 1 sec, {{then after that}} 1 sec the guidance computer would deduce that the plane must be traveling at 5 m/sec and must be 2,5 m from its initial position (assuming v0=0 and known starting position coordinates x0, y0, z0). If combined with a mechanical paper map or a digital map archive (systems whose output is generally known as a moving map display since the guidance system position output is often taken as the reference point, resulting in a moving map), the guidance system could use this method to show a pilot where the plane is located geographically in a certain moment, as with a GPS navigation system — but without the need to communicate with or receive communication from any outside components, such as satellites or land radio transponders, though external sources are still used in order to correct drift errors, and since the position <b>update</b> <b>frequency</b> allowed by inertial navigation systems can be higher the vehicle motion on the map display can be perceived as smoother.
