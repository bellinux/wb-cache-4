Pierce opined: [...] "Dramatically, this whole sequence plays out pretty hokily. Guillermo's dialogue is ridiculous, and the entire storyline plays like something out of an episodic social-lesson-of-the-week show.

Other singles like [...] "Mistake No.3" [...] (US No.33) and [...] "The Medal Song" [...] (UK No.32) would become modest hits.
