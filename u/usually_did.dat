5|$|In the Wujing Zongyao {{and other}} {{military}} texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is ambiguous. At the time, the Chinese <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method. One of the few exceptions is the shoupao, or hand bomb, which {{is analogous to the}} hand grenade.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, {{the boys}} would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, the boys would hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|E
5|$|The Washington administration's {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. The episode demonstrated that the new national government had the willingness and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws. It was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. The Washington administration and its supporters <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not mention, however, that the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect, and that many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax. The events contributed {{to the formation of}} political parties in the United States, a process already underway. The whiskey tax was repealed after Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party came to power in 1801, which opposed the Federalist Party of Hamilton and Washington.|$|E

5|$|Every five years, two censors {{were elected}} for an eighteen-month term. Since the {{censorship}} {{was the most}} prestigious of all offices, usually only former consuls were elected to it. Censors were elected by the assembly of Roman Soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly, usually after the new consuls and praetors for the year began their term. After the censors had been elected, the Centuriate Assembly granted the new censors censorial power. Censors did not have imperium powers, {{and they were not}} accompanied by any lictors. In addition, they did not have the power to convene the Roman Senate or Roman assemblies. Technically they outranked all other ordinary magistrates (including consuls and praetors). This ranking, however, was solely a result of their prestige, rather than any real power they had. Since the office could be easily abused (as a result of its power over every ordinary citizen), only former consuls (usually patrician consuls) were elected to the office. This is what gave the office its prestige. Their actions could not be vetoed by any magistrate other than a plebeian tribune, or a fellow censor. No other ordinary magistrate could veto a censor because no ordinary magistrate technically outranked a censor. Tribunes, by virtue of their sacrosanctity as the representatives of the people, could veto anything or anyone. Censors <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not have to act in unison, but if a censor wanted to reduce the status of a citizen in a census, he had to act in unison with his colleague.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the public}} commented that {{although}} some events were sold out, {{there appeared to be}} many unoccupied seats at venues, and claimed that this was because the Ministry of Education (MOE) made a block purchase of 87,000 passes to be given to schools. However, students <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not stay for the full duration of sessions, which can be up to seven hours long. The MOE denied that students were to blame, stating that more than 95% of students allocated tickets had attended events, and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand. The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun, unoccupied seats would be resold to people who turned up in person at venues. To enable venue managers to gauge the number of seats available for resale, teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to leave before sessions ended and the number of seats occupied by students. On 20 August, the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls' football.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E

25|$|The noses {{of these}} {{vehicles}} are built {{to a different}} design than is standard for the Flexity Swift, containing a small scoop-shaped area. This assists in the removal of snow, but the anticipated snow-management method is merely to run trains on a frequent basis rather than actually using snow removal equipment (this was what the earlier streetcar system <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> to keep lines clear, though they also often featured small scrapers {{in front of the}} lead wheels).|$|E
25|$|The Jesuits had {{frequent}} {{disputes with}} other colonists {{who wanted to}} enslave the natives.

Classical liberals were also divided on free trade, as Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by Richard Cobden and the Anti-Corn Law League would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate {{the number of hours}} that children were allowed to work and <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not oppose factory reform legislation.|$|E

It was not until Talmudic times that the word “dvash”, now translated as “honey”, generally meant bee honey.

25|$|Károly Mühlbeck (Nagysurány, 1869 – Sashalom, 1943) {{illustrated}} humor magazines as Kakas Márton, Borsszem Jankó, etc. He {{created a}} unique {{form of the}} comic strip, that headlined the newspaper, Új idők. These sequential drawings <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not tell a story in chronological order, they rather showed a current topic from multiple point of views.

25|$|Survivors {{of ships}} sunk by Allied {{submarines}} frequently refused to surrender, {{and many of}} the prisoners who were captured by submariners were taken by force. US Navy submarines were occasionally ordered to obtain prisoners for intelligence purposes, and formed special teams of personnel for this purpose. Overall, however, Allied submariners <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not attempt to take prisoners, and the number of Japanese personnel they captured was relatively small. The submarines which took prisoners normally did so towards the end of their patrols so {{that they did not have}} to be guarded for a long time.|$|E

The Patsy contains her imitations which she <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> for friends, of silent stars Lillian Gish, Mae Murray and Pola Negri. King Vidor saw Davies as a comedic actress instead of the dramatic actress that Hearst wanted her to be. He noticed she was the life of parties and incorporated that into his films.|$|E
25|$|Eluvial deposits—those {{that had}} {{weathered}} from the lode {{in the usual}} way, but had not then been transported by flowing water—were also worked; these tended to be poorer deposits {{due to the lack}} of sorting that a stream provides, and they <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not have such a ready supply of water available to work them. They are found on gently sloping hillsides. Where possible the water needed to work these deposits was carried by a leat from the nearest available river, or if the site was above such supplies, reservoirs were constructed to collect rainwater and runoff from hillsides.|$|E
