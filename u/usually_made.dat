5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Falafel is {{made from}} fava beans or chickpeas, or a {{combination}} of the two. The use of chickpeas is predominant in most Middle Eastern countries.

5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> of metal.|$|E
5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Syphilis is most {{commonly}} spread through sexual activity. It {{may also be}} transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested.|$|E

50|$|Microwave tube {{designers}} {{used to take}} numerous {{steps to}} reduce microphonism in klystrons. Where tuning was essential, a compromise <b>usually</b> was <b>made</b> between {{the resistance of the}} klystron to microphonism and the obtainable performance.|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
5|$|The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease are {{difficult}} to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} used a documentary-style filming technique. Three {{cameras were}} used for each shoot and entire scenes were shot in one take. In contrast, most productions film a scene from each angle and typically repeat the scene several times while readjusting lighting to accommodate each shot. The first takes <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> the final cut. By filming a scene all at once, the producers tried {{to create an environment}} for the actors that was more organic and allowed for the best performances.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} Belarusian dress originates {{from the}} Kievan Rus' period. Due to the cool climate, clothes {{were designed to}} preserve body heat and were <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> from flax or wool. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns. One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates the hoist of the Belarusian national flag, adopted in a disputed referendum in 1995.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E
5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is <b>usually</b> <b>made</b> of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
25|$|Modern bats are <b>usually</b> hand <b>made</b> in India or Pakistan {{due to the}} {{low cost}} of labour. However a few specialists in England, Australia, and New Zealand still make bats, mostly with use of a CNC lathe.|$|R
50|$|The term “hot carrier injection” usually {{refers to}} the effect in MOSFETs, where a carrier is {{injected}} from the conducting channel in the silicon substrate to the gate dielectric, which <b>usually</b> is <b>made</b> of silicon dioxide (SiO2).|$|R
50|$|These moulds are <b>usually</b> commercially <b>made</b> and {{are offered}} {{in a range of}} {{standard}} shapes and sizes: bowls, trays etc. For custom pieces, a glass worker may also make a specialised or temporaty mould as a one-off.|$|R
