25|$|The {{establishment}} of relayed VHF stations proved {{the reliability of}} unmanned stations, and the Telecommunications Administration started a process to <b>unman</b> the least trafficked coast radio stations. Proposals of remote controlling stations often resulted in a heated local debate, in part caused by the press claiming that the stations would be closed instead of simply moving the employees. One {{of the advantages of}} remote controlling was that instead of having one person on duty, there would be two, of which one person would be a dedicated emergency transmission listener and one would handle other correspondence. In smaller stations there was only one employee for both tasks. An often-used argument against unmanning was that the operators had local knowledge. Operators were often {{from other parts of the}} country and typically did not have sufficient local knowledge for their section of the coastline for it to make a difference. Search and rescue operations would always be coordinated by the police and not the coast station.|$|E

2500|$|Livingston later {{sold his}} stock in Capitol Industries to form his own company, Mediarts, Inc., for the {{production}} of motion pictures, records and music publishing. He eventually sold his interest in that company to United Artists as a result, particularly, of its success in the record business including Don McLean, who reached the #1 position in the country with his [...] "American Pie" [...] single and album in 1972. Two feature motion pictures were completed during the company's operation: Downhill Racer (1969) starring Robert Redford and Gene Hackman, and <b>Unman,</b> Wittering and Zigo (1971) starring David Hemmings; both released by Paramount Pictures.|$|E

60|$|He dressed moodily, {{and left}} the room to go down to breakfast. Breakfast would at least {{alleviate}} this sinking feeling which was <b>unmanning</b> him. And he could think more briskly after a cup or two of coffee.|$|R
6000|$|This anthem, sung out of full hearts, {{remains on}} our minds {{as the last}} {{perfection}} of a perfect day. For myself, I am not ashamed to own that it made me weep like a child. Indeed, I cannot write of it now as I would; it <b>unmans</b> me so! ...|$|R

60|$|The {{fathers and}} the other older men stand about in groups, leaning on their sticks, talking in whispers, recounting former {{experiences}} of entraining, or recruiting, of those abominable three years; and the young girls--the sweethearts, the sisters, the friends--dare not speak for fear they should break down and help to <b>unman</b> the lads.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall go mad {{if she is}} not here," [...] {{rejoined the}} other more calmly, [...] "the fear has entered into my soul, Nicolaes, that Gilda will yet betray us at the {{eleventh}} hour.

60|$|Illness {{never in}} the {{smallest}} degree affects my intellectual powers. I can think with all my ordinary vigour {{in the midst of}} pain; but I am beset with the most wretched and <b>unmanning</b> reluctance and shrinking from action. I could not upon such occasions take the pen in hand to write down my thoughts for all the wide world.|$|R
60|$|The fear I {{felt was}} no {{rational}} fear, but a panic terror {{not only of}} the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me.

6000|$|At {{last the}} Baronet {{mastered}} himself enough to say, 'I'm very weak, Maynard--God help me!

I've been too proud and obstinate.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never saw}} any man so {{astonished}} in my life! He was utterly flabbergasted. Charles thought he must have expected to get clear away at once, and that this prompt action on our part had taken the fellow so much by surprise as to simply <b>unman</b> him. He gazed about {{him as if he}} hardly realised what was happening.|$|E
60|$|WORLD. I thought so. And it has {{happened}} unto thee as unto other weak men, who, meddling with things too high for them, do suddenly fall into thy crazy thoughts, which thoughts do not only <b>unman</b> men, as thine I perceive have done thee, but they run them upon desperate efforts to obtain they know not what.|$|E

6000|$|I can't but {{say it is}} {{an awkward}} sight [...] To see one's native land {{receding}} through [...] The growing waters; it <b>unmans</b> one quite, [...] Especially when life is rather new: [...] I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white, [...] But almost every other country 's blue, [...] When gazing on them, mystified by distance, [...] We enter on our nautical existence.|$|R

6000|$|... "Neither the one nor the other. But if I {{may take}} the liberty of a friend with you, I should advise you to combat this feeling of horror. If you do not, it will <b>unman</b> you.

60|$|As a {{practical}} move, the action had flaws. The shots cannot have gone anywhere near their vague target. But as a demonstration, {{it was a}} wonderful success. The yard became suddenly full of dancing bullets. They struck the flagstones, bounded off, chipped the bricks of the far wall, ricocheted from those, buzzed in all directions, and generally behaved in a manner calculated to <b>unman</b> the stoutest hearted.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{outline the}} basis for a new {{distributed}} Bayesian search scheme in which all Bayesian decision makers recognize the same performance objective but do not possess the ability to communicate with each other. Coordination among the players is achieved indirectly by tracking search performance. This scheme is ideal for <b>unmaned</b> vehicles searching in extreme environments where extensive bilateral communication between actuators is not feasible. Preliminary results suggests our new search scheme is scalable and can easily be adapted for tracking moving targets. ...|$|R
60|$|But Henry {{had yet to}} {{experience}} the <b>unmanning</b> atmosphere of a lonely summer resort. He had only just reached the position in the bank where he was permitted to take his annual vacation in the summer. Hitherto {{he had always been}} released from his cage during the winter months, and had spent his ten days of freedom at his flat, with a book in his hand and his feet on the radiator. But the summer after Sidney Mercer's departure they unleashed him in August.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Garnett: [...] "How noble you are! I don't {{wonder he}} adores you. I should. But you won't find it so easy. You must do {{something}} drastic. It is drastic, isn't it? or do I mean static? One of those things when you simply crush a person. But now I must go. How I should like to listen at the door! We must kiss each other very quietly, and I must slip out-- Oh, you dear! How I long to know what you'll do! But it will be perfect, whatever it is. You always did do perfect things." [...] They knit their fingers together in parting. [...] "On second thoughts I won't kiss you. It might <b>unman</b> you, and you need all your strength. <b>Unman</b> isn't the word, exactly, but you can't say ungirl, can you? It would be ridiculous. Though girls are as brave as men {{when it comes to}} duty. Good-by, dear!" [...] She catches Miss Ramsey about the neck, and pressing her lips silently to her cheek, runs out. Miss Ramsey rings and the maid appears.|$|E
60|$|The door opened. Warm, kitcheny scents {{came through}} it. Strong men hurried {{out to take}} down the trunks, while fair women, {{in the shape of}} two nervous scullery maids, {{approached}} Joan and Ashe, and bobbed curtsies. This under more normal conditions would have been enough to <b>unman</b> Ashe; but in his frozen state a mere curtsying scullery maid expended herself harmlessly on him. He even acknowledged the greeting with a kindly nod.|$|E
60|$|And {{why does}} not Tom care {{to look at}} the prospect? Certainly not because he is afraid. He slept as soundly as ever last night; and knows not what fear means. But somehow, the glorious view reminds him of another glorious view, which he saw last summer walking by Grace Harvey's side from Tolchard's farm. And that subject he will sternly put away. He is not sure but what it might <b>unman</b> even him.|$|E

The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to keep under review the structure and strength of the peacekeeping force with a view to restructuring it if necessary. A humanitarian review was also undertaken by UNFICYP and the Council endorsed its recommendations.|$|R
50|$|The Security Council {{reconfirmed}} {{that the}} extension of the mandate of the UNFICYP peacekeeping force in Cyprus would be reviewed every six months. It also stressed the importance of voluntary contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations, in particular stressing the importance of an early settlement of the Cyprus dispute and the implementation of confidence-building measures. Both sides were instructed to co-operate with UNFICYP to extend the <b>unmanning</b> agreement of 1989 to all areas of the United Nations-controlled Buffer Zone where the two sides were in close proximity to each other.|$|R
