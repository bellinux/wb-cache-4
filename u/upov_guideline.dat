40|$|In {{ornamental}} apple breeding process, the vigour {{of the tree}} is an important characteristic, this trait being analyzed in selection of seminal descendants obtained by hybridization. The vigour of the apple trees was studied in 25 interspecific hybrids F 1 belonging to different Malus ornamental species, used as maternal or paternal genitors, crossed with several cultivars and selections. The seedling vigour was noted when hybrids were four to seven years old, in accordance with <b>UPOV</b> <b>guideline</b> standard: 3 - weak; 5 - medium; 7 - strong. The mean of marks for tree vigour of F 1 hybrids in the 25 combinations ranged between 4. 00 and 6. 13. Compared with the mean of experiment as control (5. 20), the most vigorous seedlings were obtained in the families ‘Cluj 218 / 2 ’ x M. niedzwetzkyana and ‘Reinette Baumann’ x M. prunifolia, both with significant differences of growth versus the mean growth of all combinations. The weakest growth was noted in progenies belonging to ‘Rosu de Cluj’ x M. coronaria, ‘Starkrimson’ x M. prunifolia, ‘Frumos de Voinesti’ x M. floribunda, ‘Cluj II- 1 - 2 ’ x M. floribunda, M. zumi x ‘Reinette Baumann’, M. coronaria x ‘Reinette Baumann’. No {{significant differences were found}} between the mean of marks for tree vigour in the group of combinations in which the Malus species were used as maternal genitors (5. 18) and paternal genitors (5. 20). The coefficient of variability ranged in the experiment between 2. 6 % and 27. 4 %; in ten families a lower variability for seedlings vigour (under 10 %) was identified, in 13 a medium one (between 10 - 20 %) and in two a large one (more than 20 %). Even if in some combinations the variability of tree vigour was not very large, there seems to be fair possibilities to identify by selection the seedlings with a desired vigour in each family...|$|E
40|$|Trees habit is an {{important}} trait in pear breeding and pear culture (1, 2, 3). The segregation for trees habit of F 1 pear hybrids belonging from six combinations was analysed. The seedlings originate in incomplete diallel cross, effectuated with four genitors (Comtesse de Paris, Milenium, Virgiliu Hibernal, Cluj 89 - 1 - 81 selection), were framed in six classes of growth (after <b>UPOV</b> <b>Guidelines),</b> respectively architectural ideotype: 1.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} that confer high quality to the seed is its genetic purity. Genetic impurities in sunflower seed lot can originate from seed due to self-pollination, uncontrolled cross-pollination or mechanical mixing of seeds. Genetic purity of 18 seed lots of sunflower parental lines is controlled by comparative analysis of morphological traits and electrophoretic analysis 4 isoenzyme systems, according to the <b>UPOV</b> <b>guidelines</b> for DUS test of sunflower lines and hybrids. In 83. 3 % of the total analysed samples, results {{in the field and}} laboratory were in agreement. In parental line R- 8 5 % genetic impurity was found by isoenzyme analysis, which was not detected based on morphological characteristics, while electrophoretic analysis of samples L- 10 and L- 11 showed less genetic impurities in comparison with the analysis in the field. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{reliability}} of morphological characterization of lightsprouts for differentiation of potato varieties was {{performed at the}} Agricultural Institute of Slovenia in cooperation with Biotechnical Faculty Podgorica in order to introduce simple method for further characterization of potato accessions in Montenegrin gene bank. Seven selected, potentially different, potato accessions preserved in the Montenegrin gene bank were used for morphological characterization of lightsprouts. Using <b>UPOV</b> <b>guidelines</b> 11 lightsprout traits were estimated. Molecular assessment {{was carried out in}} parallel with morphological characterization by six microsatellite (SSR) markers. The latter successfully distinguished all accessions but two, while four different lightsprout phenotypes were identified in morphological characterization. Though molecular markers showed more strength in resolving relationships between genotypes, characterization of lightsprouts still demonstrated its usefulness due to cheap, simple and rapid procedure...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the progress in providing a system of plant variety protection (PVP) in {{the states of the}} African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI). Following a brief introduction to the missions of OAPI, the challenge of creating a system of PVP suited to the situation in the member states is explored. The solution to this challenge, the introduction of a uniform system in accord with <b>UPOV</b> <b>guidelines,</b> was achieved by the agreement, and ratification in 2002, of Annex X of the Bangui Agreement. The practicalities of setting up testing and examination centers, and the determination of the initial 19 genera and species for protection from the start date in 2006 are described. Finally, the potential societal and economic benefits flowing from this form of PVP are summarized.

40|$|Eight {{transgressive}} variants {{were selected}} from a cross between Oryza rufipogon Griff. (IRGC 105491) and MR 219, a Malaysian high yielding rice cultivar. The field trials revealed the yield potentiality of the variants and showed significantly (p< 0. 05) higher yield than the control, MR 219. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for agronomic traits were validated in the selected variants in BC 2 F 5 generation. The yield of these variants was influenced by several QTLs related to days to maturity, tillers per plant, panicles per plant, spikelets per panicle and thousand grain weight. Chromosome segment analysis confirmed the introgression of wild alleles for yield and yield related traits. Registration process for eight variants has been initiated under the National Plant Variety (NPV) Act of Malaysia with the preferred name of UKMRC 1 to UKMRC 8. The DUS test was conducted in 2011 following <b>UPOV</b> <b>guidelines</b> in collaboration with Department of Agriculture, Malaysia to confirm distinctness, uniformity and stability of these variants. Steps will be taken {{for some of the}} promising registered variants to be released as new varieties...|$|R
40|$|A set of 42 {{winter wheat}} cultivars {{developed}} from nine populations were evaluated for distinctness. Three marker systems: morphological markers, gliadin allele profiles and microsatellites {{were used to}} analyze distinctness between sister cultivars. The morphological based distinctness tests for wheat {{are based on a}} crop-specific set of characters that comply with <b>UPOV</b> <b>guidelines.</b> The morphological markers were quite informative although they were not capable to estimate the distances/distinctness between two pair of sister cultivars Evropa 90 and Evropa and Novosadska rana 3 and Novosadska rana 2. The gliadins allele profiles were the least efficient to estimate distinctness between sister line cultivars. This system was not capable to distinguish even cultivars developed from different populations. Sister line wheat cultivars were fingerprinted with 19 wheat microsatellites markers. A total of 106 alleles were detected at 19 wheat microsatellite loci, resulting in an average allele number per marker of 5. 6. The number of markers was sufficient to distinguish among most sister line cultivars. Only one pair of sister cultivars, Lozničanka and Kosovka, derived from the same cross could not be distinguished. Comparing all marker systems to evaluate distinctness of sister line wheat cultivars the most efficient was microsatellite markers while gliadin allele profiles was the least efficient. Correlations between matrices based on pedigree data and morphological marker, gliadin profiles and microsatellites were significant but not large.

50|$|In {{order to}} be granted breeder's rights, the variety in {{question}} must {{be shown to be}} new. This means that the plant variety cannot have previously been available for more than one year in the applicant’s country, or for more than four years in any other country or territory. The variety must also be distinct (D), that is, easily distinguishable through certain characteristics from any other known variety (protected or otherwise). The other two criteria, uniformity (U) and stability (S), mean that individual plants of the new variety must show no more variation in the relevant characteristics than one would naturally expect to see, and that future generations of the variety through various propagation means must continue to show the relevant distinguishing characteristics. The <b>UPOV</b> offers general <b>guidelines</b> for DUS testing.|$|R
