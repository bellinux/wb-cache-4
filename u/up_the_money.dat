The director knew film mogul Arnon Milchan and met with him to help finance the film. Milchan was eager {{to work on the}} project and launch his new company, Regency Enterprises, with a high profile film like JFK. Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. to put <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for the film. Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page shooting script.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, an October {{snowstorm}} in Salida, Colorado, destroyed Sunday's tent—a special disaster because revivalists {{were typically}} paid with a freewill offering {{at the end}} of their meetings. Thereafter he insisted that towns build him temporary wooden tabernacles at their expense. The tabernacles were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold {{at the end of}} the meetings), and locals had to put <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for them in advance. This change in Sunday's operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore. At least at first, raising tabernacles provided good public relations for the coming meetings as townspeople joined together in what was effectively a giant barnraising. Sunday built rapport by participating in the process, and the tabernacles were also a status symbol, because they had previously been built only for major evangelists such as Chapman.|$|E

5|$|With {{more and}} more people coming to Aspen, a better road from the east was needed. An early {{investor}} in the city, B. Clark Wheeler, put <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> needed to improve the path over the pass to a stage road. It opened in November 1881, just as winter was beginning. The tolls, 25 cents for saddle horses and twice that for stages ($ and $ in modern dollars respectively) were primarily spent hiring a large crew of men who kept the pass clear in winter with snowshovels. They were able to keep the road through the pass open during its first five winters. In deep enough snow passengers switched to sleighs; in summer, dogs ran in advance to warn oncoming traffic through the pass itself as the stages took the switchbacks at full speed. It usually took a stage 10–25 hours and five changes of horses to reach Aspen from Twin Lakes.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that {{she is going to}} buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E

25|$|A new {{building}} opened in 1883 at 10th and Minnesota streets. The building {{was the first}} high school built in Saint Paul. In 1888, a 14-room annex was added for laboratories, {{but there was no}} money for an astronomical observatory. The Debate society decided to put on plays to make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to pay for it. Soon, Central was known as the only high school in the United States to have a fixed telescope with a lens ground and polished by the great telescope maker Alvan Clark (18041887), whose company built some of the largest and best telescopes in the world, including the telescope for the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Mechanics Arts High School, then known as Manual Training High School, was first housed in the basement of Central. The school was renamed Central High School in 1888.|$|E

25|$|On July 13, {{the kidnappers}} {{contacted}} Sergio Cázares Garza, {{one of the}} family members who lived in Texas, and told him that his remaining relatives would be released if the family paid a ransom. Initially, the family said they could only pay a few thousand dollars, but the captors allowed for them to have at least two days to collect more money. In total, the Cázares made four different payments to the kidnappers in Matamoros in a sum of US$100,000. The first one was delivered at a grocery store parking lot and the second one was left behind a fast-food eatery. The kidnappers communicated with the Cázares family that was in hiding in Texas through telephone, and the cash deliveries were made by a trusted employee of the family in Matamoros. Each time the deliveries were made, the Gulf Cartel sent a different envoy to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from the Cázares at a disclosed location.|$|E

[...] However, following her success in Hollywood, she began to express concerns about the direction of her career. In a July 1966 interview with Life, she confessed her fear of being over-glamourized and exploited, like Sophia Loren, and although she had several further U.S. films lined up, stated: [...] "If I have to give <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> I give it up.

500|$|The local prosecutor, City of Winchester Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Thomson, {{filed suit}} against WINC and sister station WINC-FM in June 1988 for a {{promotion}} Thomson called an [...] "illegal cash lottery".

500|$|Originally, the U.S. Millionaire {{carried over}} the musical score from the British version, {{composed}} by father-and-son duo Keith and Matthew Strachan. Unlike older game show musical scores, Millionaires musical score {{was created to}} feature music playing almost throughout the entire show.

On GSN's Gameshow Hall of Fame special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as [...] "mimicking the sound of a beating heart," [...] and stated that as the contestant worked their way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> ladder, the music was [...] "perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse." ...|$|E

[...] The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at Stern, but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahr's deputy managing director, Dr Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 200,000mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau.
