The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the Shore Line in 1870) bought {{the east end of}} the Parade from New London for the unusually low price of $15,000, with the <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> the railroads would build a structure more suitable for the bustling city.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the rules, {{procedures}} and <b>understandings</b> <b>that</b> surround international financial flows are inadequate. The paper advocates limiting short-term capital inflows and strengthening international crisis management measures. International capital flows can be very volatile: capital reversals were a central element in the Asian crisis of 1997 - 8.   International financial flows to the crisis countries since then have been relatively modest until now, but some East Asian countries are beginning to experience some of the symptoms of the problems which preceded the Asian crisis. This paper {{argues that the}} rules, procedures and <b>understandings</b> <b>that</b> surround international financial flows are inadequate.

5|$|Frank Elgyn (Michael Wincott), the Betty captain, is Sabra Hillard's lover. Elgyn has {{an illegal}} {{partnership}} with General Martin Perez {{in which he}} delivers materials off the books to expedite the Auriga research and other activities. Elgyn delivers a shipment of humans in cryostasis, which are used as incubators for the Aliens. Elgyn and Perez maintain an <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> {{there will be no}} disruptive activity aboard the station. This agreement is later compromised by Call by her contact with Ripley 8. Shortly after the Aliens escape captivity, Elgyn is killed when one of them pulls him through floor grates and impales him.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E

In a compromise, First & Goal agreed to pay for grass to be installed for special events when needed.|$|E
40|$|Many {{significant}} day-to-day {{decisions in}} educational settings that either improve or restrict civic capacity {{are based on}} the conceptions of key stakeholders in schools and communities. However, few research approaches center on identifying and evaluating the <b>understandings</b> <b>that</b> underpin these important educational decisions and practices. Phenomenography is a useful tool for mapping this terrain. It is a research approach that seeks to identify and map the qualitatively different conceptions present within specific populations. This research approach can be used to expand knowledge about the <b>understandings</b> <b>that</b> underpin stakeholder attitudes and decisions in schools, neighborhoods, and communities. This paper outlines phenomenography’s theoretical and analytical frameworks. It reviews literature on key methodological issues and explains in detail the research process, showing how it can be used in studies designed to improve civic capacity...|$|R

5|$|Object {{permanence}} is the <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> objects {{continue to}} exist even when they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied {{in the field of}} developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vimy Ridge was {{the first}} {{occasion}} on which all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, {{and it became a}} Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> Canada use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters, and unexploded munitions still honeycomb the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.|$|E
5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{engineering}} {{for all the}} German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but final design and testing was farmed out to commercial firms with the <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> production would be shared with multiple companies. Demag was chosen to develop {{the smallest of the}} German half-tracks and spent the years between 1934 and 1938 perfecting the design through a series of prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The general {{principle}} behind {{the process of}} qiyas {{is based on the}} <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective. Thus, if the cause of an injunction can be deduced from the primary sources, then analogical deduction can be applied to cases with similar causes. For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The {{most ancient}} {{recorded}} name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the chasm), {{which is consistent}} with modern <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge. It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer. Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.|$|E

5|$|The pier {{was sold}} to the Noble Organisation in 1984. The theatre was removed two years later, on the <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> it would be replaced; however a domed {{amusement}} arcade {{was put in place}} instead. Consequently, the seaward end of the pier was filled with fairground rides, including thrill rides, children's rides and roller coasters. Entertainment continued to be popular at the pier; the Spice Girls made an early live performance there in 1996 and returned the following year after achieving commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Then if V'i = V {{for each}} i, the {{resulting}} direct sum {{can be written}} in exponential notation as V⊕N, or simply VN with the <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> the direct sum is the default. We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some natural number, we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real vector space Rn.|$|E
5|$|Turkey {{itself was}} in no {{condition}} {{to fight against the}} Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus and Soviet-occupied Iran were already assembling for an invasion of Turkey. However, as the hostility between the East and West developed into the Cold War, especially after the issuing of the Truman Doctrine in 1947, Turkey strengthened its ties with the West. The Soviet Union relinquished its claims over the lost territories, <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> the newly formed NATO would intervene on Turkey's side {{in the event of a}} conflict.|$|E
