5|$|The {{chemistry}} of plutonium {{was found to}} resemble uranium {{after a few months}} of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. On December 2, 1942, on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and <b>uranium</b> <b>pile</b> known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.|$|E

30|$|An {{environmental}} radioactivity survey {{carried out}} in the Sabugal region, Portugal, showed enhanced radioactivity levels in surface water streams related to water discharges from old uranium mines. Water from irrigation wells in this region displayed variable radionuclide levels due to natural occurrence of radionuclides and to contamination by mine water drainage. Horticulture products grown near the uranium mine sites contained elevated radium (226 Ra) concentrations, but lower concentrations of uranium and other radionuclides. Despite the relatively high radioactivity in irrigation water, the absorption and accumulation of radionuclides in agriculture products were limited.

Its relationship to the function of the parathyroid glands, and vitamin D and its role in certain pathological conditions uch as arteriosclerosis and neuro-muscular disorders have been recognized and extensively studied. The comparatively recent advent of isotopic tracers, both stable and radioactive, has been of inestimable value in demonstrating the general dy-namic state of metabolic reactions. Up to the present time, however, the difficulties involved in the char-acterization and production of a radioactive isotope of calcium in quantities uitable for biological ex-perimentation have, unfortunately, precluded a great deal of work with this element.

The struc-ture and the size of these metallic nanoparticles were characterized using synchrotron radiation-based methods such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEpithermal uranium {{deposits}} of the Sierra Peña Blanca are classic examples of volcanic-hosted deposits {{and have been}} used as natural analogs for radionuclide migration in volcanic settings. We present a new genetic model that incorporates both geochemical and tectonic features of these deposits, including one of the few documented cases of a geochemical signature of biogenic reducing conditions favoring uranium mineralization in an epithermal deposit. Four tectono-magmatic faulting events affected the volcanic <b>pile.</b> <b>Uranium</b> occurrences are associated with breccia zones at the intersection of fault systems. Periodic reactivation of these structures associated with Basin and Range and Rio Grande tectonic events resulted in the mobilization of U and other elements by meteoric fluids heated by geothermal activity. Focused along breccia zones, these fluids precipitated under reducing conditions several generations of pyrite and uraninite together with kaolinite. Oxygen isotopic data indicate a low formation temperature of uraninite, 45 - 55 °C for the uraninite from the ore body and ∼ 20 °C for late uraninite hosted by the underlying conglomerate. There is geochemical evidence for biological activity being at the origin of these reducing conditions, as shown by low δ 34 S values (∼− 24. 5 ‰) in pyrites and the presence of low δ 13 C (∼− 24 ‰) values in microbial patches intimately associated with uraninite. These data show that tectonic activity coupled with microbial activity can {{play a major role in}} the formation of epithermal uranium deposits in unusual nearsurface environments...|$|R

Surface-layer (S-layer) proteins are one of those self-assembling molecules and their chemical and structural properties make them quite attractive for nanotechnical purposes. They possess a high content of functional groups so a sequential coupling of functional devices is possible {{and their ability to}} self assemble in aqueous solutions or on surfaces, e. g. SiO 2 wafers, qualifies them for nanotechnical applications. In this work, first experiments were done in order to construct a sensory device containing S-layer proteins as matrix to bind optical elements and analytes for detection of specific substances. The S-layer proteins were isolated from the Lysinibacillus sphaericus strain JG-A 12 recovered from a <b>uranium</b> mining waste <b>pile</b> in Germany. As optical elements fluorescent dyes or quantum dots can be used. Three different fluorescent dyes which are able to perform a Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) were used and coupled to the S-layer proteins. As receptor molecule aptamers were chosen due to their high specifity and stability towards many chemicals. Aptamers are short oligonucleotides which are able to bind specific molecules via their three dimensional structure. In this work, a model aptamer was used that is specific towards human thrombin. The aim was to construct a sensor system which is able to detect specific substances in very low concentration ranges in aqueous solutions...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{discharges}} {{have been}} identified at the Syabru-Bensi hot springs, located at the Main Central Thrust zone in Central Nepal and characterized by a water temperature reaching 61 °C, high salinity and high alkalinity. The gas is mainly dry carbon dioxide, marked by a δ 13 C isotopic anomaly of - 0. 8 ‰. The diffuse carbon dioxide exhalation flux, mapped by the accumulation chamber method, reaches 19 000 g×m- 2 ×day- 1, comparable with values measured on active volcanoes. Radon exhalation flux at the soil surface has been measured at more than sixty points {{in the vicinity of}} the main gas discharge. Extreme values, larger than 2 Bq×m- 2 ×s- 1, similar to peak values measured in volcanic areas or above <b>uranium</b> waste <b>piles,</b> are observed in association with the larger values of the carbon dioxide exhalation flux. This high radon exhalation thus results from emanation at depth, producing a radon concentration in the pore space varying from 25 000 to more than 50 000 Bq×m- 3, transported to the surface by the flow of carbon dioxide. The high radon- 222 content of the carbon dioxide offers an interesting tracing method and an additional practical tool for long term monitoring, for example to study transient changes preceding large earthquakes. An extended dipolar self-potential anomaly has also been found, with a negative pole reaching - 180 mV at the main gas discharge, and a wide positive lobe on the terrace above. This dipolar anomaly, the largest reported so far, is interpreted in a hydroelectrical numerical model assuming a primary upward fluid flow associated with the gas, coupled with a secondary flow towards the springs, taking into account the resistivity structure obtained from profiles of electrical resistivity tomography. Thus, the Syabru-Bensi hot springs provide a unique opportunity to study the generation of electrical currents associated with biphasic fluid flow in a geodynamically active area. A pilot multidisciplinary team has now undertaken a multidisciplinary study of the geological, geophysical and geochemical properties of the Syabru-Bensi geothermal system. Studying the spatial and temporal variations of the gas discharges and the associated properties of the hot springs may lead to important clues on the presence and displacements of crustal fluids in relation with the nucleation of large earthquakes in the Nepal Himalayas...|$|R
