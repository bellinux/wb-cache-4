The somewhat variable names may be descriptive or indicate where the object is kept, as in the Oar, the Snuffbox, the Small Santiago Tablet, and the Santiago Staff.|$|E
25|$|While the FIDE Handbook, {{appendix}} C.13 {{uses the}} digit zero (0-0 and 0-0-0), PGN requires the <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter</b> O (O-O and O-O-O).|$|E
25|$|If a {{geographical}} name consists of several elements whose relationship {{is marked by}} suffixes or postpositions, these elements are also written separately. The <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter</b> of the beginning element is kept even in an adjectival form.|$|E

25|$|Each move of a {{piece is}} {{indicated}} by the piece's <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter,</b> plus the coordinate of the destination square. For example, Be5 (move a bishop to e5), Nf3 (move a knight to f3). For pawn moves, a letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, c5 (move a pawn to c5).|$|E
25|$|Each piece type (other than pawns) is {{identified}} by an <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter.</b> English-speaking players use the letters K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, and N for knight (since K is already used). S (from the German Springer) {{was also used}} for the knight {{in the early days}} of algebraic notation and is still used in chess problems (where N stands for the nightrider, a popular fairy chess piece).|$|E
25|$|Only {{the first}} element is {{capitalized}} in subnational entities like counties, shires, areas, districts, neighbourhoods. When forming an adjective, this <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter</b> is only kept if this element is a proper name, e.g. New York állam ‘State of New York’ vs. New York állami. However, if the beginning element {{of such an}} entity is a common name or an adjectival form, all elements are written lowercase (e.g. in names of local administrative units like Váci kistérség vs. váci kistérségi).|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "degree Celsius" [...] {{has been}} the only SI unit whose full unit name {{contains}} an <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter</b> since the SI base unit for temperature, the kelvin, became the proper name in 1967 replacing the term degrees Kelvin. The plural form is degrees Celsius.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{proposed}} manual alphabet {{as part of}} the Signuno project. Signuno itself, as signed Esperanto rather than a language in its own right, is a manual logographic Esperanto orthography. [...] The Signuno alphabet derives from international norms (that is from Gestuno which in turn derives from ASL) but there are sometimes significant differences, most notably that all letters are static and upright and with a straight wrist (for example the G is simply turned upright compared to ASL). [...] T is as Irish T rather than exactly like ASL, and F is as the okay handshape rather than exactly like ASL. [...] The handshape for H resembles its <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter</b> (as in French fingerspelling), as does P to a degree (deriving it seems from mixing Polish and Russian). [...] Q is a modification from Irish, but also a merging of the Signuno handshapes for K and V. [...] The Z appears to be unique to Signuno (it's shaped like an ASL 3, and the three fingers of the Z seem vaguely to relate to the three strokes of the letter Z). The diacritic letters Ĉ, Ĝ, Ĥ, Ĵ, Ŝ, Ŭ are derived from their base letters C, G, H, J, S, U. [...] Ĉ is a modified C (and Chinese), Ĝ is the inverse of G, Ĥ is a modified H, Ĵ is the inverse of J and also a modified Z (as if ZH), Ŝ is the inverse of S (and [...] German). J resembles its <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter</b> and is derived from I, while Ŭ is from U (as W is from V).|$|E
2500|$|In the Unicode standard, iota {{subscript}} {{is represented}} by a non-spacing combining diacritic character U+0345 [...] "Combining Greek Ypogegrammeni". There is also a spacing clone of this character (U+037A, [...] ), as well as 36 precomposed characters, representing each of the usual combinations of iota subscript with lowercase , [...] and , with and {{without any of the}} accent and breathing diacritics. In addition, for capitalized ("titlecase") use, Unicode provides a corresponding set of 27 precomposed code points with [...] "prosgegrammeni" [...] ( [...] → [...] ). Despite their name, which implies the use of an adscript glyph, these code points are defined as being equivalent to a combination of the base letter and the combining subscript character U+0345, just like their lowercase equivalents. They may be variously realized with either a subscript diacritic or a full-sized adscript iota glyph, depending on the font design. For use in all-capitals ("uppercase"), Unicode additionally stipulates a special case-mapping rule according to which lowercase letters should be mapped to combinations of the <b>uppercase</b> <b>letter</b> and uppercase iota ( [...] → [...] ).|$|E

DNN trained on digits are perfectly capable of recognizing <b>uppercase</b> <b>letters</b> with minimal retraining. They are on par with DNN fully trained on <b>uppercase</b> <b>letters,</b> but train much faster. DNN trained on Chinese characters easily recognize <b>uppercase</b> Latin <b>letters.</b> Learning Chinese characters is accelerated by first pretraining a DNN on a small subset of all classes and then continuing to train on all classes.
