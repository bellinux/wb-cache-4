5|$|A Washington Post {{editorial}} {{asked why}} an apparently unstable Army private {{had been able}} to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place. According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality came into play by illustrating for the far right that gay people were <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven knows. I {{think she}} will. But she {{is exactly the}} girl to remain {{unmarried}} if she takes it into her head that the man she likes is in any way <b>unfitted</b> <b>for</b> her." ...|$|R

50|$|The Vizier suffered, in this way, both in {{influence}} and in income. Moreover, Mir Jumla allowed {{no opportunity to}} pass without depreciating the Sayyid brothers, and brought forward arguments of every sort {{to prove that they}} were <b>unfitted</b> <b>for</b> the offices that they held.|$|R
5|$|After her return, Congress {{served as}} a {{receiving}} ship; being moved between the Norfolk and Washington Navy Yards under tow as needed.

5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> consumption.|$|E
5|$|At FBI headquarters, Deputy Director Alvin Kersh calls John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{into his}} office. He informs them that Mulder {{has applied for}} {{reinstatement}} to the X-Files. He intends to deny the request, claiming {{a higher percentage of}} success with Doggett. Kersh ignores Doggett and Skinner's defenses of Mulder, perceiving him to be a crusader <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> proper Bureau work.|$|E
6000|$|Morton went to {{his work}} next morning quite <b>unfitted</b> <b>for</b> an {{especially}} delicate piece of dissection which he had in hand.

6000|$|I {{then went}} on to explain that I found myself peculiarly <b>unfitted</b> <b>for</b> the {{situation}} offered to me, not merely by my political opinions, but by the very constitution and habits of my mind. [...] "My whole course of life," [...] I observed, [...] "has been desultory, and I am <b>unfitted</b> <b>for</b> any periodically recurring task, or any stipulated labor of body or mind. I have no command of my talents, such as they are, and have to watch the varyings of my mind as I would those of a weathercock. Practice and training may bring me more into rule; but at present I am as useless for regular service as one of my own country Indians or a Don Cossack.|$|R
6000|$|... {287} Or rather were. The Conservancy of late {{seems to}} have {{constituted}} itself into a society for the employment of idiots.

50|$|John went to Drogheda Grammar School, Drogheda, but had {{to leave}} when his father’s wealth disappeared. Early in life he was {{attracted}} to the stage and the acting profession.

60|$|I am terribly {{tired of}} business. I am by nature and {{disposition}} <b>unfitted</b> <b>for</b> it and I {{want to get}} out of it. I am standing on the Mount Morris volcano with help from the machine a long way off--doubtless a long way further off than the Connecticut Co. imagines.|$|R
5|$|Some House Republicans were {{critical}} of Thorne-Begland's {{lying to the}} Navy about his homosexuality, stating that his violation of the military's code of conduct made him <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> a judgeship.

5|$|The restorations {{completed}} in 1971 made the structure {{wind and water}} tight, added extra windows and installed fresh glazing, but {{as it was then}} abandoned again, weather elements exacerbated by vandalism led to further structural deterioration.

5|$|Three {{weeks of}} pursuit from 25 May until 17 June placed an {{enormous}} strain on U-853s crew.

Sommer {{and a large number}} of the crew was declared <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> duty. On 10 July Sommer was formally relieved by Oberleutnant zur See Otto Wermuth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mad," [...] muttered {{her father}} to himself {{as she left the}} room.

6000|$|... "Now, I {{know this}} man, C.," [...] I said when I had finished. [...] "And I {{want to ask}} whether you will let me show him Miss Montague's letter.

6000|$|Lady Bothwell endeavoured to {{maintain}} her proposed incognito, and, as the Doctor ushered them to {{the upper end of}} the room, made a motion declining his courtesy, as <b>unfitted</b> <b>for</b> their condition.

5|$|After the First World War, the Urban District Council, {{which had}} {{replaced}} the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. Large areas of open farmland were purchased for the building of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman defeat, {{the fleet}} was laid {{up at the}} Golden Horn and left largely {{unattended}} for the following twenty years.

At {{the start of the}} Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mesudiye was found to be <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> combat, as were most of the other major warships of the fleet. On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Navy {{decided that}} Nevada {{was too old to}} be retained, so they {{assigned}} it to be a target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 (Operation Crossroads).

5000|$|General Floyd, the {{commanding}} officer, {{who was a}} man of talent enough for any civil position was no soldier, and possibly, did not possess the elements of one.

As Secretary of War, he had taken a solemn oath to maintain the Constitution of the United States and uphold the same against all enemies. He had betrayed that trust. Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

6000|$|... "I was destined," [...] Agostino, for a soldier's {{life in the}} {{following}} of my valiant foster-brother, your father. Had I preserved the strength of my early youth, undoubtedly a soldier's harness would be strapped here to-day {{in the place of}} this scapulary. But it happened that an illness left me sickly and ailing, and <b>unfitted</b> me utterly <b>for</b> such a life. Similarly it <b>unfitted</b> me <b>for</b> the labour of the fields, so that I threatened to become a useless burden upon my parents, who were peasant-folk. To avoid this they determined to make a monk of me; they offered me to God because they found me <b>unfitted</b> <b>for</b> the service of man; and, poor, simple, self-deluded folk, they accounted that in doing so they did a good and pious thing.|$|R
50|$|Yangsanjab, Prince Öndür, was a Mongol {{prince of}} the Khorchin Left Wing Middle Banner in southeastern Mongolia. He {{was one of}} the leading figures in the {{resistance}} against Chinese colonization of Mongolia.
