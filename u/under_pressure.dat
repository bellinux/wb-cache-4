40|$|Restricted Access. The phase {{transition}} behaviour of three homologous discotic mesogens, the hexa‐n‐alkoxyanthraquinones HOAQ(n), n indicating {{the number of}} carbon atoms in the alkoxy group, was investigated <b>under</b> hydrostatic <b>pressures</b> up to 500 [*]MPa using a high pressure differential thermal analyser. The T vs. P phase diagrams of HOAQ(6), HOAQ(8) and HOAQ(9) were constructed for solution‐ (Cr 0) and melt‐crystallized (Cr 1) samples of the compounds. HOAQ(6) shows the reversible Cr 0 –rectangular columnar phase (Colr) –hexagonal columnar phase (Colh) –isotropic liquid (I) phase sequence at atmospheric pressure. The stable Colr phase of HOAQ(6) has a decreased temperature range with increasing pressure and then the Colr phase disappears <b>under</b> <b>pressures</b> above about 350 [*]MPa; instead the Cr 0 –Colh–I phase sequence is exhibited. For HOAQ(8), the solution‐grown sample exhibits the stable Cr 0 –Colh–I phase sequence at atmospheric pressure. Applying pressure to the solution‐grown sample induces {{the formation of the}} stable Colr phase in the pressure region between 10 and 350 [*]MPa, leading to the Cr 0 –Colr–Colh–I phase sequence. The pressure‐induced Colr phase disappears <b>under</b> higher <b>pressures.</b> The melt‐cooled sample of HOAQ(8) shows the formation of the metastable crystal (Cr 1), unknown mesophase (X) and Colr phases at lower temperatures <b>under</b> atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> and exhibits the reversible Cr 1 –X–Colr–Colh–I phase sequence on subsequent thermal cycles. The metastable phase sequence was observed <b>under</b> <b>pressures</b> up to 100 [*]MPa, but the {{phase transition}}s were too small to be detected <b>under</b> higher <b>pressures.</b> In HOAQ(9) the stable Cr 0 –Colh–I phase sequence is observed at all pressures, while the melt‐cooled sample shows the metastable Cr 1 –Colr–Colh–I phase sequence <b>under</b> <b>pressures</b> up to 300 [*]MPa.

40|$|In {{this part}} of studies, an {{improved}} stationary plutinum electrode polarograph named Oxigraph was proved to be applicable to measure dissolved oxygen of solutions <b>under</b> high hydrostatic <b>pressure.</b> Experimental results are as follows; 1) <b>Under</b> high hydrostatic <b>pressure,</b> limiting current value concerning oxygen wave of solution increases its degree {{in proportion to the}} strength of applied pressure. The oscillation of limiting current value widens <b>under</b> high <b>pressure</b> generally. 2) <b>Under</b> high <b>pressure</b> up to 1, 500 Kg/㎠., the electrical potential inducing oxygen reduction wave is not influenced in buffer solution. 3) When the same charging potential as at normal pressue is charged, the stability and reproducibility of limiting current value does not alter at high pressure up to 1, 500 Kg/㎠. 4) At the moment of the appilication of high hydrostatic pressure, a transient increment of limithing current value is observed in proportion to both dissolved oxygen amount and <b>pressure</b> intensity. 5) <b>Under</b> high <b>pressure,</b> the influence of temperature on the limiting current value resembles to that <b>under</b> normal <b>pressure.</b> 6) In glutinous solution such as 1 - 5 % dextrin-Ringer's solution, the limiting current value decreases in proportion to the concentration of glutinous substance both under normal and high hydrostatic pressure. The increment of limiting current value of glutious solution <b>under</b> high <b>pressure</b> is inferior to that of Ringer's solution only. On the other hand, the increase of final ascendent <b>under</b> high hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> is dominant in glutinous solution.
