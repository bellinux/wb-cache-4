40|$|We {{show that}} the Hilbert space spanned by a {{continuously}} parametrized wavefunction family [...] -i. e., a quantum state manifold [...] -is dominated by a subspace, onto which all member states have close to <b>unity</b> <b>projection</b> weight. Its characteristic dimensionality $D_P$ is {{much smaller than the}} full Hilbert space dimension, and is equivalent to a statistical complexity measure $e^{S_ 2 }$, where $S_ 2 $ is the $ 2 ^{nd}$ Renyi entropy of the manifold. In the thermodynamic limit, $D_P$ closely approximates the quantum geometric volume of the manifold under the Fubini-Study metric, revealing an intriguing connection between information and geometry. This connection persists in compact manifolds such as a twisted boundary phase, where the corresponding geometric circumference is lower bounded by a term proportional to its topological index, reminiscent of entanglement entropy.

40|$|A new {{variant of}} the isospectral Feshbach map defined on {{operators}} in Hilbert space is presented. It is constructed {{with the help of}} a smooth partition of <b>unity,</b> instead of <b>projections,</b> and is therefore called smooth Feshbach map. It is an effective tool in spectral and singular perturbation theory. As an illustration of its power, a novel operator-theoretic renormalization group method is described and applied to analyze a general class of Hamiltonians on Fock space. The main advantage of the new renormalization group method over its predecessors is its technical simplicity, which it owes to the use of the smooth Feshbach map...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the algebraic and physical {{properties of the}} anisotropic XY-chain in a magnetic field for special boundary conditions, which make the system invariant under quantum group transformations. This allows a two-parameter deformation of the su(1 / 1) superalgebra to be defined. If {{one of the two}} parameters #alpha# and #beta# is a root of <b>unity,</b> a <b>projection</b> mechanism is needed to select physical states. We diagonalize the chain giving the spectrum and the eigenvectors. Furthermore we show that the substitution #alpha##->##alpha#["-" 1 corresponds to a nontrivial similarity transformation, which {{turns out to be a}} generalization of the Ising duality transformation. We {{investigate the}} implications of these symmetries with respect to the phase structure, the finite-size expansion of the ground state and the partition function of the chain. In particular we study correlation functions in the massless case. It turns out that correlation functions of local operators are, in general, infrared divergent. If one considers, however, correlation functions invariant under the quantum group, the divergences cancel out. Finallly we discuss possible generalizations to chains with several fermions per site.

40|$|We {{characterize}} a {{value of}} an observable by a `sum rule' for generally non-commuting observables and a `product rule' when restricted to a maximal commuting subalgebra of observables together with the requirement that the value is <b>unity</b> for the <b>projection</b> operator of the prepared state and the values are zero for the projection operators of the states which are orthogonal to the prepared state. The crucial requirement is that the expectation value and the variance of an observable should be independent {{of the way of}} measurement, i. e., the choice of the maximal commuting subalgebra of observables. We shall call the value a `contextual value'. We show that the contextual value of an observable coincides with the weak value advocated by Aharonov and his colleagues by demanding the consistency of quantum mechanics with Kolmogorov's measure theory of probability. This also gives a derivation of Born's rule, {{which is one of the}} axioms of conventional quantum mechanics. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
40|$|This {{creative}} {{project has}} explored a staging of Eugene Ionesco's The Bald Soprano that incorporated motion-picture {{film as a}} technical device. Drawing from the full body of Ionesco's works and their amplification of themes, theatrical techniques and use of language, this study considered The Bald Soprano as an Absurd play. The use of motion-picture film and slides in other theatrical productions was analyzed {{in order to justify}} the attempt to marry live actors and film on-stage in lonesco's play. In addition, this study discussed the director's approach to the production of The Bald Soprano: the rehearsal process, the light and set design, the use of film. Finally, it evaluated the attempt in terms of four principles of criticism: <b>unity,</b> communication, truthful <b>projection</b> of the playwright's emphasis and rhythm. The creative project also contains: a copy of the script annotated with the actions of the actors, the stage movements, light and sound effects, photographs of the play; a scenario of the film used and photographs lifted from individual frames of the film.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{considers}} the mythology {{connected to the}} maritime sphere and notions of British national identity and collective <b>unity</b> through the <b>projection</b> of the maritime in British film and television. Specifically, it traces the evolution of this myth through the period 1960 - 2012, a post-Imperialist era characterised by broad social, economic and political changes and internal divisions within the historic Union of Great Britain, demonstrating how British culture continually uses the past {{to comment on the}} present. The thesis argues that the maritime remains a vibrant cultural site of British national self-examination and re-examination despite the precipitous decline of both Empire and Royal Navy within this time period. The specific audio-visual properties of the filmic and televisual forms and their position as the most successful cultural industries of the 20 th Century suggest themselves as vital components for interrogating national myth and <b>projections</b> of collective <b>unity</b> and the attendant challenges to these. Aligned to this is the manner in which critical reception continues to operate as an indigent of collective memory, morality and communality aligning itself as provision not only of positive cultural taste but also of a wider debate on the merits or de-merits of the specific components of myth and identity. Each text is situated within its specific historical and industrial context and a combination of primary sources, textual analysis and reception studies are unified to argue that both the texts themselves and their reception within critical discourse collectively negotiate the role that media cultures play in constructing and challenging notions of collective identity and myth. Finally, this thesis argues constructively, that the seemingly banal cultural symbols of national identity and mythology, far from being an irrelevance in a globalised age, remain amongst the most vital cultural, social, political and economic discourses of the age. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to develop {{software}} {{that is capable of}} back projecting primary fluence images obtained from EPID measurements through phantom and patient geometries in order to calculate 3 D dose distributions. In the first instance, we aim to develop a tool for pretreatment verification in IMRT. In our approach, a Geant 4 application is used to back project primary fluence values from each EPID pixel towards the source. Each beam is considered to be polyenergetic, with a spectrum obtained from Monte Carlo calculations for the LINAC in question. At each step of the ray tracing process, the energy differential fluence is corrected for attenuation and beam divergence. Subsequently, the TERMA is calculated and accumulated to an energy differential 3 D TERMA distribution. This distribution is then convolved with monoenergetic point spread kernels, thus generating energy differential 3 D dose distributions. The resulting dose distributions are accumulated to yield the total dose distribution, which can then be used for pre-treatment verification of IMRT plans. Preliminary results were obtained for a test EPID image comprised of 100 9 100 pixels of <b>unity</b> fluence. Back <b>projection</b> of this field into a 30 cm 9 30 cm 9 30 cm water phantom was performed, with TERMA distributions obtained in approximately 10 min (running on a single core of a 3 GHz processor). Point spread kernels for monoenergetic photons in water were calculated using a separate Geant 4 application. Following convolution and summation, the resulting 3 D dose distribution produced familiar build-up and penumbral features. In order to validate the dose model we will use EPID images recorded without any attenuating material in the beam for a number of MLC defined square fields. The dose distributions in water will be calculated and compared to TPS predictions...|$|R
