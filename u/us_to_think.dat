25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E

Like Agid, Todd Ramlow of PopMatters lamented the production's fixation on binary gender, but he found positive qualities in its presentation of some of the struggles and anxieties a transgender person might experience.

When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing [...] "both indicts and exculpates" [...] them, implying that humanity is bad, {{but it is not}} their fault.

500|$|Hazlitt's {{essay on}} Hamlet was later used by David Bromwich in an {{extensive}} comparison of Coleridge's and Hazlitt's critical views in general. Although, to Bromwich, Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet contained {{a greater number}} of original ideas, including the general assessment of Prince Hamlet's character, Hazlitt's view is notable in that it does not, like Coleridge, reduce that character to a single dominating flaw, his inability to act. In one of his lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge claimed that [...] "Shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth that action is the chief end of existence—that no faculties of intellect, however brilliant, can be considered valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes, if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action, and lead <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and think of doing, until the time has elapsed when we can do anything effectually." [...] Hazlitt, on the other hand, instead of applying this moral, pointed to the necessity of each reader's identifying with Hamlet to understand him (which, he believed, occurred more readily than with any other of Shakespeare's characters) and the reader's judging of Hamlet in part {{on the basis of what}} that reader then saw in himself. This made it unlikely that Hamlet's entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson.|$|E

500|$|Finally, from {{a purely}} {{linguistic}} point of view, {{there is the}} dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet {{is a type of}} planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as not so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and 'minor planet' are best considered compound nouns. Benjamin Zimmer of Language Log summarised the confusion: [...] "The fact that the IAU would like <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as 'Welsh rabbit' (not really a rabbit) and 'Rocky Mountain oysters' (not really oysters)." [...] As Dava Sobel, the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with National Public Radio, [...] "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one can love, dwarf planet." [...] Mike Brown noted {{in an interview with the}} Smithsonian that, [...] "Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word [...] "dwarf planet," [...] but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you're left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets." ...|$|E

As a result of the line-up change, Taller in More Ways was re-released to feature Berrabah's vocals on three tracks, which included [...] "Red Dress", [...] "Gotta Be You" [...] and [...] "Follow Me Home". [...] "Red Dress" [...] was subsequently chosen as the third single from the album. Buena later revealed that she had been uncomfortable with the original version of the song after recording it, clarifying that she [...] "absolutely hated" [...] it.

500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And I do think that there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E

Does he want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Wilson was the divine Christ?"

2500|$|To {{argue in}} favor of this thesis, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a {{prominent}} German philosopher, says, [...] "The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. … From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of them…" ...|$|E

[...] For example, how should incidental findings be handled when a presumed healthy research subject is scanned for neuroscience research and the scan reveals an abnormality? [...] How safe are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function? [...] These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics. [...] They are important issues, and luckily we can call upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases. [...] In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics.

2500|$|Many {{fundamental}} laws {{of physics}} and chemistry can be formulated as differential equations. In biology and economics, differential equations are used to model the behavior of complex systems. The mathematical theory of differential equations first developed together with the sciences where the equations had originated and where the results found application. However, diverse problems, sometimes originating in quite distinct scientific fields, may give rise to identical differential equations. Whenever this happens, mathematical theory behind the equations {{can be viewed as}} a unifying principle behind diverse phenomena. As an example, consider propagation of light and sound in the atmosphere, and of waves on the surface of a pond. All of them may be described by the same second-order partial differential equation, the wave equation, which allows <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of light and sound as forms of waves, much like familiar waves in the water. Conduction of heat, the theory of which was developed by Joseph Fourier, is governed by another second-order partial differential equation, the heat equation. It turns out that many diffusion processes, while seemingly different, are described by the same equation; [...] the Black–Scholes equation in finance is, for instance, related to the heat equation.|$|E

2500|$|Hume elaborates more on {{this last}} {{principle}} of cause and effect. When a person observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, it results in “an expectation that a particular event (a ‘cause’) {{will be followed by}} another event (an ‘effect’) previously and constantly associated with it." [...] Hume calls this principle custom, or habit, saying that “custom…renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past." [...] However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words, “experience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect…the reason why we mistakenly infer that there is something in the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in this way." [...] Continuing this idea, Hume argues that “only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [...] causation safely…be applied – all other sciences are reduced to probability." [...] He uses this skepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.|$|E
2500|$|Accounts differ {{as to who}} popularized the term. President George W. Bush {{introduced}} the term officially during his presidency. According to Safire, author Christopher Hitchens was responsible for its diffusion, while Valerie Scatamburlo d'Annibale argues that its popularization {{is due to the}} work of Eliot Cohen, former counselor to Condoleezza Rice, reputed occasionally to be [...] "the most influential neocon in academe".

It moved into the mainstream in August 2006. [...] After the arrest of Islamic terrorists suspected of preparing to blow up airlines, Bush once more alluded to [...] "Islamic Fascists", apparently a [...] "toned-down" [...] variant of the word, The public use of the neologism and the analogous Islamic fascism during the run-up to the U.S. 2006 mid-term elections, perhaps with a specific focus group in mind, provoked an outcry, or storm of protest, and was quickly dropped from the president's rhetorical armory. Katha Pollitt, stating the principle that, [...] "if the control the language, you control the debate", remarked that while the term looked [...] "analytic", it was emotional and [...] "intended to get <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> less and fear". David Gergen, former speechwriter for Richard Nixon, commented that the phrase [...] "confuses more than it clarifies", for [...] "Islamic fascism has no meaning" [...] in the Arab world. Neoconservative writers, critics and scholars from Hitchens to Robert Wistrich however responded that the Muslim religion itself is fascistic, a view which, in identifying Islam with political fascism, was lambasted for being as offensive as the term Judeo-Nazi coined in the 1970s by Yeshayahu Leibowitz, editor of the Encyclopedia Hebraica, to characterize Messianic Jews settling in the occupied West Bank. Hitchens replied that the link is no more deleterious than that made by Leibowitz, or by left-wing analysts who wrote of clerical fascism.|$|E
