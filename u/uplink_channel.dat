The [...] "+M" [...] version added several new features, such as the ability to use [...] "DVB-S2" [...] bursts in the <b>uplink</b> <b>channel</b> back to the satellite.

50|$|Duplex spacing is the {{separation}} between the <b>uplink</b> <b>channel</b> and the corresponding downlink channel. A larger separation implies less likelihood of self-interference between a handset transmitter and its own receiver. Because a power amplifier out of band response {{is related to the}} bandwidth, the duplex separation requirement is also dependent on the carrier bandwidth {{in order to protect the}} receiver from self-interference. A duplex spacing of 30 MHz is sufficient to support carrier bandwidths of up to 10 MHz. This result is derived using 3GPP specification 3GPP 36.101.|$|E
50|$|The current version {{supports}} bit rates up to 6.25 Gbit/s over {{a single}} coaxial cable from camera to frame grabber. A low speed <b>uplink</b> <b>channel,</b> operating at 20.833 Mbit/s from frame grabber to camera {{can be used}} for camera control or triggering. A 24 V power supply is also available over the coaxial cable to deliver up to 13 W to the camera. Applications requiring more than a 13 W power supply utilize a separate power supply. For higher bit rates, two or more coaxial cables can be used in parallel.|$|E
30|$|LTE uplink {{has adopted}} SC-FDMA[20]. The {{bandwidth}} {{is divided into}} subbands which are called physical resource blocks (PRBs). The PRB defines the resource allocation granularity in LTE. Herein, a transmission bandwidth of 10 MHz is allocated for uplink and thus there are 48 PRBs available for data transmission on the physical <b>uplink</b> shared <b>channel</b> (PUSCH) and 2 PRBs are reserved to the <b>uplink</b> control <b>channel.</b>|$|R

30|$|GPRS is an {{enhancement}} {{over the}} existing GSM systems {{by using the}} same air interface and channel access control procedure. Specifically, we discuss the GPRS systems based on the GSM- 900 bands. In GSM- 900, the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) frequency bands are 25 [*]MHz wide each and each band is divided into 200 [*]KHz channels. The frequency separation between the corresponding downlink and <b>uplink</b> <b>channels</b> is 45 [*]MHz.|$|R
50|$|TD-SCDMA uses TDD, in {{contrast}} to the FDD scheme used by W-CDMA. By dynamically adjusting the number of timeslots used for downlink and uplink, the system can more easily accommodate asymmetric traffic with different data rate requirements on downlink and uplink than FDD schemes. Since it does not require paired spectrum for downlink and uplink, spectrum allocation flexibility is also increased. Using the same carrier frequency for uplink and downlink also means that the channel condition is the same on both directions, and the base station can deduce the downlink channel information from <b>uplink</b> <b>channel</b> estimates, which is helpful to the application of beamforming techniques.|$|E
50|$|In older systems, {{interactive}} video broadcasting was possible {{as a result}} of using physical cables for connectivity. However, in remote areas cable connections may be unavailable, two-way communication was then impossible via traditional means. One possible solution was to use a satellite linked connection for the return (<b>uplink)</b> <b>channel</b> in addition to the standard downlink channel. This option is more expensive to implement than with cabled connections in built-up areas, but may be more cost effective for remote areas where the costs of laying cable to users would not be recovered for a long time. Additional costs involved in RCS systems include the costs of a two-way satellite antenna and renting data bandwidth from a satellite communications provider.|$|E

Upon receipt of the command from the user the satellite sends the user request data to the service provider. This takes about 0.5 seconds to connect each way with the satellite.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{downlink}} compressive channel estimation based on weighted SP for FDD massive MIMO systems, and the weighted SP {{makes use of}} the priori support information to improve the estimation performance. The reciprocity between <b>uplink</b> and downlink <b>channels</b> in angular domain is used for diagnosing the support priori information of downlink channel. The proposed support diagnosis algorithm considers the basis mismatch, leakage effect, and angle deviation for <b>uplink</b> and downlink <b>channels</b> and applies the DBSCAN algorithm used in machine learning to the channel support diagnosis. RIP-based analysis shows a better convergence and error performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the standard SP. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm improves the downlink channel estimation accuracy compared to the IRLS, the SP algorithm which does not utilize the uplink priori information, and the weighted SP which assumes that the downlink and <b>uplink</b> <b>channels</b> have common supports.|$|R
50|$|The {{control channel}} {{discipline}} is Slotted Aloha where the forward or downlink channel (that {{received by the}} mobiles) provides timeslots within which a mobile may transmit a request in the <b>uplink</b> <b>channel.</b> In general, a mobile may only transmit on the control channel if invited to by TSC. This invitation may be explicitly addressed to a mobile or a group; {{or it may be}} random access. Random access timeslots will be used when a mobile user initiates a call, or when a mobile registers on the TSC.On a heavily loaded control channel, it is likely that two or more mobile radio units will try to transmit at the same time on the same random access timeslot. This is detected by mobile, when the expected reply from the TSC is not received within a certain timeout. The mobile may then retry its request in another random access slot. The timeouts and number of retries is configured in the mobile when it is set up for the network.|$|E

To {{reduce the}} overhead of downlink <b>channel</b> estimation and <b>uplink</b> feedback in FDD systems, cascaded precoding {{has been used}} in massive MIMO such that only a low-dimensional effective channel needs to be estimated and fed back. On the other hand, traditional channel estimations can hardly achieve the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) performance due to lack of the a priori knowledge of the channels. In this paper, we design and analyze a strategy for downlink channel estimation based on the parametric model in massive MIMO with cascaded precoding. For a parametric model, channel frequency responses are expressed using the path delays and the associated complex amplitudes. The path delays of <b>uplink</b> <b>channels</b> are first estimated and quantized at the base station, then fed forward to the user equipment (UE) through a dedicated feedforward link. In this manner, the UE can obtain the a priori knowledge of the downlink channel in advance since it has been demonstrated that the downlink and the <b>uplink</b> <b>channels</b> can have identical path delays. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve near-MMSE performance...|$|R
