5000|$|The {{underwriting}} {{cycle is}} {{the tendency of}} property and casualty insurance premiums, profits, and availability of coverage to rise and fall with some regularity over time. A cycle begins when insurers tighten their underwriting standards and sharply raise premiums {{after a period of}} severe <b>underwriting</b> <b>losses</b> or negative stocks to capital (e.g., investment losses). Stricter standards and higher premium rates lead to an increase in profits and accumulation of capital. The increase in underwriting capacity increases competition, which in turn drives premium rates down and relaxes underwriting standards, thereby causing <b>underwriting</b> <b>losses</b> and setting the stage for the cycle to begin again. For example, Lloyd's Franchise Performance Director Rolf Tolle stated in 2007 that [...] "mitigating the insurance cycle was the [...] "biggest challenge" [...] facing managing agents in the next few years".|$|R

40|$|Federally subsidized crop {{insurance}} {{has a long}} history of <b>underwriting</b> <b>losses.</b> These losses may be due to premium rating procedures that do not account, as fully as possible, for differences in yield loss risk across farms. If farmers understand their own yield loss risk in more detail than is reflected in {{crop insurance}} premium rates, an information asymmetry may be leading to adverse selection or moral hazard. Regional differences in <b>underwriting</b> <b>losses</b> suggest that the effect of asymmetric information is relatively large where inter-farm yield variability is also relatively large. An econometric model is used to identify asymmetric information in crop insurance premium rating. A simulation model is used to compare existing crop insurance premium rates to alternative rates calculated using yield loss risk measures based on existing, farm-specific yield history data. Both models are applied to crop/region combinations where inter-farm yield variability is relatively low (non-irrigated corn in the Corn Belt region) and where inter-farm yield variability is relatively high (non-irrigated, continuously cropped wheat in the Northern Plains). Region-wide asymmetric information effects are identified for both regions, but the asymmetric information effect is found to be larger in the high variability region. This difference explains at least part of the inter-regional difference in <b>underwriting</b> <b>losses.</b> The simulation analysis suggests that, on average, across an entire region, premium rates derived from a farm-specific measure of yield variability are closer to actuarially fair rates than RMA premium rates. At a county- and farm-level, however, it is much more difficult to say, with a high level of statistical confidence, whether these alternate premium rates are closer than RMA rates to the actuarially fair rates. To provide a foundation for the crop insurance models, an econometric model of crop yields is estimated and used to separate total yield variation into systematic and random components. Random yield variation is tested against several common distributions, including normal, gamma, and beta. The effect of aggregation on the representation of both systematic and random yield variation is also investigated...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how a {{coherent}} risk measure {{could be used}} to determine risk-sensitive capital requirements for reinsurance treaties. The need for a risk-sensitive capital calculation arises in the context of estimating the return on equity (ROE) for several treaties or different options on one treaty. Looking at the loss random variable alone is insufficient for a complete risk analysis since this would fail to incorporate the impact of adjustable premium and ceding commission provisions on the final net risk. The paper presents a framework for systematically reflecting treaty features by viewing capital {{as a function of the}} distribution of the final net <b>underwriting</b> <b>loss.</b> To avoid negative values for indicated capital, the concept of a risk quantity variable is introduced as a non-negative monotonically increasing function of the net <b>underwriting</b> <b>loss</b> variable. Two risk quantities are discussed: one obtained by capping the net <b>underwriting</b> <b>loss</b> from below at zero, and the other by taking the excess of the net <b>underwriting</b> <b>loss</b> above its expectation. A coherent risk measure is then applied to a risk quantity to obtain indicated capital. The approach is demonstrated in simple discrete distribution examples by applying {{a coherent}} measure, the Tail Value at Risk, to the two risk quantities. Sensitivity testing on the examples is presented showing how the different measures respond to changes in premium adequacy, swing rating, sliding scale commission plans, and layering. In summary, this paper is one attempt to bridge the gap between the theoretical results of coherence theory and the practical need for methods to set risk-sensitive capital in treaty ROE analysis...|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} methods {{companies}} use {{to determine the}} appropriate amount of capital required to support their insurance operations. In general these models focus on the downside risk arising from the existing book of liabilities, such as the l-in- 100 or l-in- 500 <b>underwriting</b> <b>loss.</b> Unfortunately, many of the methods either ignore the risk arising from their investment portfolio or use a method that is disconnected from their liability risk analysis.

The crisis phenomena, which first appeared in late 1984 and lasted until mid- 1986, consisted of enormous increases in liability insurance premiums and alarming reductions in the availability of certain types of liability coverage. In the two principal liability lines of insurance (Other Liability and Medical Malpractice), premiums increased by hundreds (in some cases thousands) of percentage points in a matter of months. At the same time, the availability of liability insurance contracted sharply. The liability policies that were sold during this period contained large deductibles and unusually low policy limits. Moreover, for some specific liability risks-for example, coverage for day care centers-no insurance policies were sold at all; that is, no coverage was offered at a price consumers were willing to pay.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to develop the {{framework}} for an underwriting system for excess of loss reinsurance. A system is constructed and tested which builds on the strengths but avoids the most important practical limitations of existing judgemental or scientific methods. Key issues in the proposed method are the identification of underwriting decision criteria {{in the face of}} uncertainty and the important influence of the market in the decision process. The research involves the following stages. Firstly,. a conceptual framework is provided for tackling the problem effectively in a flexible but comprehensive manner. Secondly, a rigorous empirical examination of underwriting activities over a four year period is undertaken on data collected from an excess of <b>loss</b> <b>underwriting</b> agency operating in the London Market. Thirdly, from relationships established in the empirical investigation, an underwriting system is devised, subjected to sensitivity analysis, and tested in comparison with the performance of a professional excess of loss underwriter. From the research, the contribution to knowledge is as follows: 1) The first detailed study of excess of loss underwriters' actual decisionÂ­ making behaviour is provided; Z) Practical application of risk-theoretic techniques is demonstrated as being negligible among excess of loss un<;lerwriters; 3) Evidence is provided for the existence of a satisficing model for excess of <b>loss</b> <b>underwriting</b> decisions; Â· 4) An excess of <b>loss.</b> <b>underwriting</b> system based on market heuristics is constructed, tested and evaluated; 5) Wider implications of the fact that real units of trade may differ from how they are perceived by market operators are presented. and discussed.

40|$|Insurance and {{reinsurance}} {{firms have}} seen a remarkable increase in <b>underwriting</b> <b>losses</b> associated with natural catastrophes during the past decade. Yet, the volume of global risk-financing capacity of catastrophe events has remained limited to date. This raises concerns over the effect of insolvencies and disruptions in insurance and reinsurance markets {{in the event of}} a severe natural catastrophe. Insurance securitization has long been hailed as an important tool to increase the underwriting capacity of firms exposed to catastrophe risk. Surprisingly, however, global volumes of insurance securitization have remained low to date. The thesis provides the first comprehensive analysis of the expected losses to U. S. insurers (as reflected in stock market returns) linked to a series of large natural catastrophes. The results show that, overall, the expected performance implications of mega-catastrophes are by no means devastating for insurers as the sample of natural catastrophes causes only relatively modest value losses for firms with catastrophe exposure. The thesis also provides the first empirical investigation into both the performance effects and the risk effects for insurance and reinsurance firms which engage in insurance securitization by issuing catastrophe bonds. The results show that insurance securitization provides issuers with potential cost advantages (compared to other forms of catastrophe risk management) and that insurance securitization is an effective tool for hedging catastrophe risk. In sum, while the relatively modest performance effects of natural catastrophes on insurance firms put a ceiling on the potential benefits of insurance securitization to firms exposed to catastrophe risk, the thesis shows that catastrophe bonds have some benefits for their issuers. Therefore, this thesis argues that insurance securitization is less valuable as a tool for capacity building in the market for catastrophe underwriting and more useful as a tool to realize cost efficacies and hedging benefits for insurance and reinsurance firms...|$|R
