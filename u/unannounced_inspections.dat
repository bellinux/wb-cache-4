500|$|The showing, {{exhibition}} {{and sale of}} Tennessee Walking Horses and some other horse breeds is governed by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA) due to concerns about the practice of soring, which developed during the 1950s and became widespread in the 1960s, resulting in a public outcry. Congress passed the Horse Protection Act in 1970, declaring the practice [...] "cruel and inhumane". The Act prohibits anyone from entering a sored horse into a show, sale, auction or exhibition, and prohibits drivers from transporting sored horses to a sale or show. Congress delegated statutory responsibility for enforcement to the management of sales and horse shows, but placed administration of the act with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Violations of the HPA may result in criminal charges, fines and prison sentences. The USDA certifies certain Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) to train and license Designated Qualified Persons (DQPs) to complete inspections. APHIS inspection teams, which include inspectors, investigators, and veterinary medical officers, also conduct <b>unannounced</b> <b>inspections</b> of some horse shows, and {{have the authority to}} revoke the license of a DQP who does not follow the standards of the Act.|$|E
