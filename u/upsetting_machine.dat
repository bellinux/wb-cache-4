2500|$|Upset forging {{is usually}} done in special {{high-speed}} machines called crank presses. The machines are usually {{set up to}} work in the horizontal plane, to facilitate the quick exchange of workpieces from one station to the next, but upsetting can also be done in a vertical crank press or a hydraulic press. The initial workpiece is usually wire or rod, but some machines can accept bars up to [...] in diameter and a capacity of over 1000 tons. The standard <b>upsetting</b> <b>machine</b> employs split dies that contain multiple cavities. The dies open enough to allow the workpiece to move from one cavity to the next; the dies then close and the heading tool, or ram, then moves longitudinally against the bar, upsetting it into the cavity. If all of the cavities are utilized on every cycle, then a finished part will be produced with every cycle, which makes this process advantageous for mass production.|$|E
50|$|Upset forging {{increases}} {{the diameter of}} the workpiece by compressing its length. Based on number of pieces produced this is the most widely used forging process. Upset forging is usually done in special high speed machines; the machines are usually set up to work in the horizontal plane to facilitate the quick exchange of workpieces from one station to the next. The initial workpiece is usually wire or rod, but some machines can accept bars up to 25 cm (10 in.) in diameter. The standard <b>upsetting</b> <b>machine</b> employs split dies that contain multiple cavities. The dies open enough to allow the workpiece to move from one cavity to the next; the dies then close and the heading tool, or ram, then moves longitudinally against the bar, upsetting it into the cavity. If all of the cavities are utilizes on every cycle then a finished part will be produced with every cycle, which is why this process is ideal for mass production.|$|E

It was composed chiefly of white men and requested recognition as the official South Carolina Republican Party from the Republican National Committee.|$|R
40|$|Upsetting, or {{pressure}} {{tests are}} in an engineering practice used for determining {{the effect of the}} pressure load on material properties. They determine the values of deformation resistance and formability of tested materials. The usability of upsetting tests is even expanded with different kinds of execution, shapes of test samples and kinds of used test <b>machines.</b> <b>Upsetting</b> tests are then {{one of the most important}} and most variable kinds of tests that are used for the examination of mechanical properties of materials in an engineering practice...|$|R

40|$|Designing and {{constructing}} {{resistance welding}} machines involves {{a combination of}} electrical design, machine structures, mechanisms and controls. The machines vary from simple mechanisms to exceptionally complicated units. Monitoring the condition of large <b>upset</b> welding <b>machines</b> in operating industries has attracted increasing interest in recent years owing {{to the need for}} decreasing the energy consumption on production machinery and for reducing the extent of secondary damage caused by failures. Upset Welding (UW) is a resistance welding process utilizing both heat and deformation to form a weld. A micro-setup would certainly reduce heat consumption and offer greater efficiency. In this paper an electro-mechanical micro upset welding setup is constructed following the fundamental principles of resistance welding. The chief electrical and mechanical components used are single phase ac transformer, welding arms or copper alloy electrodes, externally threaded steel shaft, frame, multimeter and control switches. After the construction of the micro welder, two thin sheets of mild steel are welded...|$|R
60|$|I had {{not long}} {{to wait for}} an {{opportunity}} of testing this property also of the Magic Watch, for, even as the thought passed through my mind, the accident I was imagining occurred. A light cart {{was standing at the}} door of the 'Great Millinery Depot' of Elveston, laden with card-board packing-cases, which the driver was carrying into the shop, one by one. One of the cases had fallen into the street, but it scarcely seemed worth while to step forward and pick it up, as the man would be back again in a moment. Yet, in that moment, a young man riding a bicycle came sharp round the corner of the street and, in trying to avoid running over the box, <b>upset</b> his <b>machine,</b> and was thrown headlong against the wheel of the spring-cart. The driver ran out to his assistance, and he and I together raised the unfortunate cyclist and carried him into the shop. His head was cut and bleeding; and one knee seemed to be badly injured; and it was speedily settled that he had better be conveyed at once to the only Surgery in the place. I helped them in emptying the cart, and placing in it some pillows for the wounded man to rest on; and it was only when the driver had mounted to his place, and was starting for the Surgery, that I bethought me of the strange power I possessed of undoing all this harm.|$|R
40|$|This work investigates {{upsetting}} of the tri-metallic cylindrical billets both experimentally and analytically with {{a reduction}} ratio 30 %. Steel, brass, and copper {{are used for}} the outer and outmost rings and aluminum for the inner core. Two different models {{have been designed to}} show material flow and the cavity took place over the two interfaces during forming after this reduction ratio. Each model has an outmost ring material as steel. Model 1 has an outer ring between the outmost ring and the solid core material as copper and Model 2 has a material as brass. Solid core is aluminum for each model. Billets were <b>upset</b> in press <b>machine</b> by using parallel flat dies. Upsetting load was recorded and compared for models and single billets. To extend the tests and compare with experimental procedure to a wider range of inner core and outer ring geometries, finite element model was performed. ABAQUS software was used for the simulations. The aim is to show how contact between outmost ring, outer ring and the inner core are carried on throughout the upsetting process. Results have shown that, with changing in height, between outmost ring, outer ring and inner core, the Model 1 and Model 2 had very good interaction, and the contact surfaces of models had various interface behaviour. It is also observed that tri-metallic materials have lower weight but better mechanical properties than single materials. This can give an idea for using and producing these new materials for different purposes...|$|R
50|$|Lucy (Ari Graynor), {{another young}} blonde woman, gets ready on another morning. She readies {{herself for the}} day, noticeably filled with glee, putting on a sundress despite the 20 degree weather. Hurrying to her desk, she notices her male coworker, Steve Mason, and makes a {{slightly}} flirtatious move towards him before her phone begins to ring wildly, distracting her from him. Steve scribbles a note and lays it out before her which says 'ROOF NOOON'. During this time Ben (Colin Hanks) approaches her and informs her of the jammed copy <b>machine.</b> <b>Upset</b> at having been distracted from Steve, she irritably assists her coworker before rushing {{up to the roof}} to meet Steve. There, he informs her that he wishes to break off their affair as she is 'not right for him.' Meanwhile, Ben is standing at the sandwich tray, searching for another tuna sandwich so that both he and Lucy can have one. When he sees one, he buys it and ventures to the roof to see if she would care to split it; however, having unknowingly stumbled upon such an intimate encounter, he hides until Steve leaves and Lucy notices him.After an awkward elevator ride together where they share the sandwich, Ben goes to his office where his mother calls him to come home quickly for an emergency and Lucy walks into an important meeting led by Steve and informs the clients and employees about their sexual affair. Having realized she had probably lost her job, Lucy grabs her things and heads to the car garage where Ben notices her and beseeches her for a ride to his house. In the car, he experiences a flashback of them as kids and remembers him telling an indifferent Lucy that he loved her and how he kissed her before she screamed and ran away.|$|R
