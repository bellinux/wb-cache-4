40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} formats on {{the accuracy of}} dating news {{and the distribution of}} personal events was examined in four conditions. In the first, participants had to date events in the absolute <b>time</b> <b>format</b> (e. g., "July 2004 "), and in the second, they had to date events in the relative <b>time</b> <b>format</b> (e. g., " 3 weeks ago"). In the other conditions, they were asked to choose between the two formats. We found a small backward telescoping effect for recent news events and a large forward telescoping effect for remote events. Events dated in the absolute <b>time</b> <b>format</b> were more accurate than those dated in the relative <b>time</b> <b>format.</b> Furthermore, participants preferred to date news events with the relative <b>time</b> <b>format</b> and personal events with the absolute <b>time</b> <b>format,</b> as well as preferring to date remote events in the relative <b>time</b> <b>format</b> and recent events in the absolute <b>time</b> <b>format...</b>|$|R

30|$|In this section, we will briefly {{summarize}} the container monitoring process as determined in the MoCo project. When a container is stored empty, its MoCo Device will daily report about its position and battery level {{according to a}} fixed Universal <b>Time</b> Coordinated (<b>UTC)</b> <b>time</b> (e.g. 12 : 00 <b>UTC</b> <b>time).</b> This way, neighbouring containers will all transmit {{around the same time}} and communication can be more easily optimized. This status is called REST mode. When the container is stuffed, its doors are closed and a MoCo Reader will send a trigger, putting the MoCo Device in Secured Transport Mode (STP mode). From now on, the MoCo Device will send 2 -hourly status updates and reports of optional sensors attached to the cargo, again according to <b>UTC</b> <b>time.</b> In addition, it will immediately report about any critical event that occurs. Finally, there is an optional mode called Secured Vessel Mode (SVE mode). By sending a trigger from a MoCo Router to a MoCo Device upon loading the container in the vessel, the MoCo Device can go to energy-saving mode, where the 802.15. 4 radio is disabled, an internal clock is scheduled and no status updates are sent until the device wakes up again.|$|R
40|$|Resume: Until recently, {{the only}} GPS time {{receiver}} calibration technique for the <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> transfer was the traditional GPS-GPS one [8, 9], {{which has been}} organised by BIPM {{for most of the}} GPS equipment in contributing laboratories. The BEV GPS equipment calibration is the first experiment using the TW-GPS technique and the result has been used for BIPM <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> transfer. This report studies, {{in the view of the}} standard UTC computation, the data processing so as to improve the calibration quality and uncertainty estimation. 1. The JRG calibration result In cooperation with TUG and with the support of PTB and BEV, using a portable TW ground station, the JRG carried out a TW time transfer between PTB and BEV from 9 to 31 October 2007. The main purpose was to calibrate the BEV GPS time transfer receiver (Rx) through the side by side TW and GPS simultaneous time measurement comparisons [1, 10] (cf. Figure 1. 1). The reference [10] depicts the equipment setting up for the calibration. The calibration computation and result were reported in the sections 4. 5 and 6 of [1] and [2]. The uncertainty estimation was reported to BIPM by BEV in [3]. The calibration result for the official primary GPS Rx for the <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> transfer at BEV is...|$|R

5000|$|Since legal, political, {{social and}} {{economic}} criteria in addition to physical or geographical criteria {{are used in the}} drawing of time zones, actual time zones do not precisely adhere to meridian lines. The 'GMT' time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of the area between meridians 7°30'W and 7°30'E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a 'physical' <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> use another time zone (UTC+1 in particular); conversely, there are European areas that use UTC, even though their 'physical' time zone is UTC−1 (e.g., most of Portugal), or UTC−2 (the westernmost part of Iceland). Because the <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> zone in Europe is 'shifted' to the west, Lowestoft in the United Kingdom at only 1°45'E is the easternmost settlement in Europe in which UTC is applied.

50|$|The POSIX {{committee}} was swayed by arguments against complexity {{in the library}} functions, and firmly defined the Unix time in a simple manner {{in terms of the}} elements of <b>UTC</b> <b>time.</b> Unfortunately, this definition was so simple that it didn't even encompass the entire leap year rule of the Gregorian calendar, and would make 2100 a leap year.|$|R
