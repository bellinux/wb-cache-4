40|$|Gloss is {{considered}} one of the most important visual attributes of many foods, which is difficult to measure objectively. In this paper, a gloss imaging system (GIS) was implemented to evaluate the suitability of four indexes for measuring gloss from intensity images in flat and curved surfaces and to analyze <b>gloss</b> <b>of</b> some fruits and vegetables. Three indexes were computed from goniometric curves: maximum intensity (MI), width of the curve at 50 % (WC), and area under the curve (AC). The fourth index was computed from the same intensity images as the average of the reflected luminance flux (LF) at the surface of the image. The results showed linear relationships (R- 2 = 0. 97) when values of MI, AC, LF for flat and curved gloss targets in the range of 4 - 90 <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> (GU) were compared with their standard gloss levels. However, the measured gloss was significantly affected by curvature and unevenness of the surface of fruits and vegetables. In spite of this, we concluded that a colour digital camera of moderate cost combined with simple image analysis procedure can yield parameters which correlate highly with the <b>gloss</b> appearance <b>of</b> fruits and vegetables and allow measurements over a very wide range <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> with high sensitivity.

5000|$|A {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>glosses</b> is a glossary. A collection <b>of</b> medieval legal <b>glosses,</b> made by glossators, {{is called}} an apparatus. The compilation <b>of</b> <b>glosses</b> into glossaries {{was the beginning}} of lexicography, and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first dictionaries. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The German Romantic movement used the expression <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish Décima style.|$|R

The analysis of learner’s actual references to gloss as well as survey on their perception revealed that learners’ showed no patterned significant preference <b>of</b> one <b>gloss</b> presentation over the other.

40|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{appearance of}} various objects {{is important to}} human beings. One measure {{of the quality of}} an object is its surface quality, which can be characterized with the concept <b>of</b> <b>gloss.</b> Nowadays measurement <b>of</b> the <b>gloss</b> is a routine off-line method in assessment of quality of product at various sectors of industry. The book gives a fresh treatment on the concept <b>of</b> <b>gloss.</b> Theoretical description will be on more general basis of optical physics than in other sources. The text will give a modern treatise of machine vision based glossmeters and furnish the ideas how to measure and analyse gloss from complex-structured objects.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new model of}} surface appearance that is based on quantitative studies <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> perception. We use image synthesis techniques to conduct experiments that explore the relationships between the physical dimensions of glossy reflectance and the perceptual dimensions of glossy appearance. The product of these experiments is a psychophysically-based model <b>of</b> surface <b>gloss,</b> with dimensions that are both physically and perceptually meaningful and scales that reflect our sensitivity to gloss variations. We demonstrate that the model can be used to describe and control the appearance of glossy surfaces in synthetic images, allowing prediction <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> matches and quantification <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> differences. This work represents some initial steps toward developing psychophysical models of the goniometric aspects of surface appearance to complement widely-used colorimetric models...|$|R

40|$|The {{variation}} of the appearance such as <b>gloss</b> provides one <b>of</b> the most important information for object recognition. However, {{little is known about}} the neural mechanisms related to the perception <b>of</b> <b>gloss.</b> We examined whether the neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the monkeys are coding <b>gloss</b> <b>of</b> objects. We made visual stimuli which have various surface reflectance properties, and tested responses of IT neurons to these stimuli while a monkey was performing a visual fixation task. We found that there exist neurons in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus that selectively responded to specific stimuli. The selectivity was largely maintained when the object shape or illumination condition was changed. In contrast, neural selectivity was lost when the pixels of objects were randomly rearranged. In the former manipulation <b>of</b> the stimuli, <b>gloss</b> perceptions were maintained, whereas in the latter manipulation, gloss perception was dramatically changed. These results indicate that these IT neurons selectively responded to gloss, not to the irrelevant local image features or average luminance or color. Next, to understand how the responses <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> selective neurons are related to perceived <b>gloss,</b> responses <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> selective neurons were mapped in perceptual gloss space in which glossiness changes uniformly. I found that responses <b>of</b> most <b>gloss</b> selective neurons can be explained by linear combinations of two parameters that are shown to be important for gloss perception. This result suggests that the responses <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> selective neurons <b>of</b> IT cortex are closely related to gloss perception...|$|R

By quantitatively measuring gloss using instrumentation Ingersoll based his research around the theory that light is polarised in specular reflection whereas diffusely reflected light is non-polarized. The Ingersoll “glarimeter” had a specular geometry with incident and viewing angles at 57.5°. Using this configuration gloss was measured using a contrast method which subtracted the specular component from the total reflectance using a polarizing filter.|$|R

The focus was whether different densities <b>of</b> <b>glossing</b> would create trade-off effects. Thirty-three Malaysian ESL learners were assigned to three different conditions: high-density glossing, low-density glossing, and no-glossing. Three weeks after a vocabulary pretest the participants read a text {{under one of the}} conditions, and took a reading comprehension test and a vocabulary posttest. The results revealed that there were no trade-off effects between reading comprehension and uptake of the target words. However, the glossed words did appear to detract from the uptake of un-glossed vocabulary. The results also hinted at a trade-off effect between attention given to idea units containing glossed target words, and those that did not contain glosses. The findings suggested that teachers should be aware of potential side-effects <b>of</b> <b>glossing...</b>|$|R
