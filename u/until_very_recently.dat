5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One {{of the greatest challenges}} has been the classification of the aye-aye, which has been a topic of debate up <b>until</b> <b>very</b> <b>recently.</b> Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic <b>until</b> <b>very</b> <b>recently.</b> Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E

40|$|We {{carry out}} a {{comparative}} analysis of the transversities and the longitudinally polarized parton distribution functions {{in light of the}} first empirical extraction of the transversity distributions recently done by Anselmino et al. It is shown that the precise determination of the isoscalar tensor charge, which is defined as the 1 st moment of the isoscalar combination of the transversity distributions, is of fundamental importance for clarifying the internal spin structure function of the nucleon. As is well known, the transversity is one of the three fundamental parton distribution functions (PDFs) with the lowest twist 2. Different from the other two, i. e. more familiar unpolarized PDF and the longitudinally polarized PDF, its chiral-odd nature prevents us from extracting it directly through the standard inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering measurements [1],[2]. For this reason, we have had little empirical information on it <b>until</b> <b>recently.</b> <b>Very</b> <b>recently,</b> however, Anselmino et al. succeeded to get a first empirical information on the transversities [3] from the combined global analysis of the azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive DIS scatterings measured by HERMES and COMPAS...|$|R

25|$|The {{attitude}} of Buddhists towards gender has been varied throughout history {{as it has}} been influenced by each particular culture and belief system such as Confucianism (which sees women as subservient) and Hinduism. The Theravadin commentator Buddhaghosa (5th century CE) for example, seems to have been influenced by his Brahmin background in stating that rebirth as a male is higher than rebirth as a female. Some Mahayana sutras such as the ‘Sutra on Changing the Female Sex’ and the ‘Questions of the Daughter Pure Faith’ also echo this idea. For various historical and cultural reasons such as wars and invasions, the orders of ordained Buddhist nuns disappeared or was never introduced in Southeast Asia and Tibet, though they slowly started being reintroduced by nuns such as Ayya Khema, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, Tenzin Palmo and Thubten Chodron. <b>Until</b> <b>very</b> <b>recently,</b> China, Taiwan and Korea were the only places where fully ordained bhiksuni lineages still existed.

25|$|During his exile Ludlow {{wrote an}} {{autobiography}} entitled A voyce from the watch tower. After his death his manuscript {{was obtained by}} Slingsby Bethel, who had visited him in Switzerland. Part of it, covering the years 1660–77, was discovered at Warwick Castle in 1970 {{and is now in}} the Bodleian Library. A heavily rewritten and shortened version of A voyce appeared as The Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow in 1698–9 in three volumes. The historian Blair Worden has surmised that the editor was the deist John Toland. The Memoirs were part of a range of late seventeenth-century publications printed by John Darby, including the Discourses of Algernon Sidney and the works of John Milton and James Harrington. In the Memoirs Ludlow's puritanism is virtually written out, and his views changed to make him a Whig-like secular republican. Until the 1970s the Memoirs were generally assumed to be authentic – there were editions in 1720–22, 1751, and 1771, with a scholarly edition by C.H. Firth in 1895. As a result, the Memoirs have been used <b>until</b> <b>very</b> <b>recently</b> as a major source for historians of the seventeenth century, with only the rediscovery of Ludlow's original manuscript prompting a reassessment.|$|E

[...] More recently, the aye-aye's placement has posed problems for the rafting hypothesis for the primate colonization of Madagascar.
