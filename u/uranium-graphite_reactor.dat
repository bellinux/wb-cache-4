40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{discussion}} of problem of graphite radioactive waste formation and accumulation. It is shown that irradiated nuclear graphite being inalienable part of <b>uranium-graphite</b> <b>reactor</b> may contain fission and activation products. Much attention {{is given to the}} process of formation of radioactive cesium on the graphite element surface. It is described a process of plasma decontamination of irradiated graphite in inert argon atmosphere. Quasi-one mathematical model is offered, it describes heat transfer process in graphite-cesium-argon system. Article shows results of calculation of temperature field inside the unit cell. Authors determined the factors which influence on temperature change...|$|E
40|$|Russian {{research}} reactors (RR) have {{a history}} of more than 60 years, which begins on December 26, 1946, when the first Russian RR – 24 kW <b>uranium-graphite</b> <b>reactor</b> F- 1 – was started in Moscow. This reactor is still in operation and is protected by the government as a monument to Russian scientific and engineering thought. The F- 1 reactor ushered in the era of nuclear power in Russia (USSR in those days) and gave rise to an important line in these activities, i. e. reactor engineering for research purposes. Russian research reactors had an eventful and far from easy way to go in their development. Like other major nuclear states, Russia took energetic efforts to provide its own research reactors in the period of 1950 s-‘ 80 s; it exported such reactors to other countries, and survived the nuclear stagnation {{of the end of the}} 20 th century through beginning of the 21 st century to keep its leading position in RR uses to the present day. Reforms in the Russian nuclear industry, the extensive experience in building research reactors both at home and abroad, together with the proactive export policy of the newly established public corporation “Rosatom ” form a groundwork for making Russia a more important player in the international market of research reactors. Today, Russia can offer a broad spectrum of services to foreign customers, ranging from conduct of specific experiments in its domestic reactors to building of scientific centres with research reactors at their core. This paper discusses the current status of Russian research reactors as well as the prospects for their development in the coming years. A special note is made of the trend towards more active presence of Russia in the international RR market...|$|E
40|$|The {{radionuclide}} {{composition and}} the activity {{level of the}} irradiated zirconium alloy E 110, the radionuclide immobilization strength and the retention properties of the mixed clay barrier material {{with respect to the}} radionuclides identified in the alloy were investigated to perform the safety assessment of handling structural units of zirconium alloy used for the technological channels in <b>uranium-graphite</b> <b>reactors.</b> The irradiated zirconium alloy waste contained the following activation products:{ 93 m}Nb and the long-lived { 94 }Nb, { 93 }Zr radionuclides. Radionuclides of { 60 }Co, { 137 }Cs, { 90 }Sr, and actinides were also present in the alloy. In the course of the runs no leaching of niobium and zirconium isotopes from the E 110 alloy was detected. Leach rates were observed merely for { 60 }Co and { 137 }Cs present in the deposits formed on the internal surface of technological channels. The radionuclides present were effectively adsorbed by the barrier material. To ensure the localization of radionuclides in case of the radionuclide migration from the irradiated zirconium alloy into the barrier material, the sorption properties were determined of the barrier material used for creating the long-term storage point for the graphite stack from <b>uranium-graphite</b> <b>reactors...</b>|$|R

The {{results of a}} void free filling technology application for the reactor space cavities were demonstrated, which had been developed during the <b>uranium-graphite</b> nuclear <b>reactors</b> decommissioning at the JSC “PDC UGR” site. The technologies provide means for creating engineered geological barriers and preventing radionuclides release from the burial site into the environment during 10 000 years...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} nuclear {{reactors}} {{did not provide}} for decommissioning solutions, {{and there were no}} safe technologies to handle irradiated reactor graphite. Decommissioning of <b>uranium–graphite</b> <b>reactors</b> is a combination of complex tasks involving the selection of appropriate methods and techniques for the radioactive graphite handling. Computer modeling of the reactor graphite reprocessing by heating in a carbon dioxide environment makes it possible to determine the behavior of radioactive elements. The behavior of Ca, Sr and Cs during radioactive graphite heating in the carbon dioxide atmosphere was studied through computer modeling. It has been found that calcium is present as vapors of Ca, CaO, CaCl and CaCl 2, as Ca+ and CaO+ ions, and as condensed forms of CaCO 3, CaCl 2 and CaO. Strontium is present as vapors of Sr, SrO, SrCl and SrCl 2, as Sr+ and SrO+ ions, and as condensed forms of SrCl 2, SrCO 3 and SrO. Cesium is present as vapors of Cs and CsCl, as Cs+ ions, and as a condensed phase of CsCl 2. Basic reactions have been identified and their respective equilibrium constants have been determined. The data obtained has shown that formation of calcium, strontium and cesium chloride vapors takes place at temperatures of 573 to 973 K. A temperature increase to 1373 K leads to thermal ionization of cesium chloride and to formation of ionized cesium. As the temperature increases to 2273 K, thermal ionization of strontium and cesium is observed and ionized calcium and strontium form...|$|R
