6000|$|... 'Did {{you never}} get my letter?' said Anne; 'I wrote {{to tell you that}} the day was altered, and you were to meet <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> the Wednesday.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, God bless your soul!' cried Tim, innocently, 'you don't suppose I {{should think}} {{of such a}} thing without their knowing it! Why they left <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> purpose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not think, uncle, that Roswell Gardiner will be {{very likely}} to stop {{on his way to}} <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> Oyster Pond," [...] was the answer she made.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{a strange}} idea that each other's names We've each of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> got <b>on.</b> Such things have been," [...] said PRIVATE JAMES. [...] "They have!" [...] sneered GENERAL JOHN.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at them {{low down}} white trash out there!" [...] she shrilled, {{pointing}} toward the Arrow. [...] "They-all's a desecrating <b>us,</b> right <b>here</b> <b>on</b> this <b>here</b> perverted island." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{not think}} of leaving <b>us</b> out <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> the Atlantic, Mr. Wallingford, five hundred miles from the Land's End," [...] Sennit at length called out, time having been taken to chew the cud of reflection.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{dismount}}," [...] he said {{in answer}} to Vincent's look of surprise. [...] "They would riddle <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> horseback in the open. Besides, we must dismount to break in the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for you, citizeness," [...] he said, with {{a sudden}} access of viciousness against her, [...] "if you have brought <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> a fool's errand, it will go ill with you, remember. Do not leave the house until our return. I may have some {{questions}} to put to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell yer, redskin, {{it seems}} to me as how you've brought <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> a fool's errand. I don't see no signs of a canoe, and it aint likely that the British would be along the lake here, seeing as how there's a score of canoes with your people in them {{scouting}} ahead." ...|$|E
50|$|You should trust me, and {{you should}} help <b>us</b> to live <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> our land, for my people.|$|R
5000|$|... "Some of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> can go <b>on</b> {{a hunger}} strike. That will prove that our civil rights are more {{important}} to us than food. They cannot starve us out!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, don't go till next day. I {{wanted you}} to come and stay a few days with <b>us.</b> <b>Here</b> I am, <b>on</b> purpose to bid you, and you fly off to Yarmouth!' ...|$|R
60|$|The Moses of Science and the Aaron of Idealism {{have got}} the whole bunch of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> top of Pisgah. It's a tight squeeze, and we'll be falling very, very foul of one another in five minutes, unless some of us climb down. But before leaving our {{eminence}} let us have a look round, and get our bearings.|$|E
6000|$|... "You ain't goin' to {{have half}} {{so much trouble}} as you think, Teddy. Anybody can see that even the 'Squire is on your side, {{although}} he did issue the warrant, an' the proof must be mighty strong to make any of 'em believe you did anything against the old miser. But this keeps <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> the grounds another day, doesn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What miracle is this, Captain Harker?” {{the officer}} cried {{as he came}} on deck. “Your {{lieutenant}} brought us news that you were dismasted and lying helpless in some little inlet, {{and here you are}} with what I can see is a French equipment and a couple of prizes! I can almost accuse you of having brought <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> a fool’s errand.” ...|$|E
6000|$|The languid figure {{leaned back}} in the chair with an air of resignation. [...] "I'm sure I don't know why they cook the dinners up so high," [...] she murmured, pettishly, to her husband. [...] "Why can't they stick the kitchens underground--in the hold, I mean--instead of bothering <b>us</b> up <b>here</b> <b>on</b> deck with them?" ...|$|R
50|$|Pour {{out your}} Holy Spirit <b>on</b> <b>us</b> {{gathered}} <b>here,</b> and <b>on</b> these gifts {{of bread and}} wine. Make them be for us the body and blood of Christ, {{that we may be}} for the world the body of Christ, redeemed by his blood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, I {{never was}} unfriends," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "Y' are a brave lad in your way, albeit {{something of a}} milksop too. I never met your like before this day. But, prithee, fetch back your breath, and let <b>us</b> <b>on.</b> <b>Here</b> {{is no place for}} chatter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{would soon}} meet death from {{starvation}} if you left <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> the island; so, as {{there is at least}} a chance of our being able to escape in your company I, for one, am willing to risk being drowned. It is easier and quicker than being starved. And, as I'm the heavier, I suppose you'll drop me first." ...|$|E
6000|$|Art thou content? for I {{have given}} to thee [...] More than the crown. My words have consecrated [...] Thy power. So let the Church and Empire be [...] Now at last reconciled. The mystery [...] That holds three persons in one substance, nor [...] Confounds them, may it make <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> earth [...] To reign forever, image of itself, [...] In unity {{which is like}} to that of God.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{a typical}} cold-blooded Britisher," [...] {{asserted}} the other man. [...] "I don't know either. I leave all details {{to the members}} of the company; but we've a secretary, who understands all about it, in this house to-night. We're half of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> business, directly or indirectly, and not for pleasure, so it's possible he may talk to you. But I see our hostess eying us, and it's time we walked along." ...|$|E
60|$|It is much lamented by {{many that}} this First Biennial had no {{members of the}} old Constituent in it, with their {{experience}} of parties and parliamentary tactics; that such was their foolish Self-denying Law. Most surely, old members of the Constituent had been welcome to <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> But, <b>on</b> the other hand, what old or what new members of any Constituent under the Sun could have effectually profited? There are First biennial Parliaments so postured as to be, in a sense, beyond wisdom; where wisdom and folly differ only in degree, and wreckage and dissolution are the appointed issue for both.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, thus," [...] said Sir Hubert, [...] "let Your Majesty and <b>us</b> <b>here</b> present put <b>on</b> the robes {{of seven}} of the Order of Black Friars, and let Your Majesty hang a purse of one hundred pounds beneath your gown; then let us {{undertake}} to ride from here to Mansfield Town tomorrow, and, without I am much mistaken, we will both meet with Robin Hood and dine with him before the day be passed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{not tell}} the truth at once, Olaf? You are afraid of this beast, and that's why you let <b>us</b> come <b>on</b> <b>here</b> when {{you knew it was}} in the wood. You hoped that before we got back there it would be too dark to hunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{patience}} with me, Elizabeth!" [...] cried he, passionately. [...] "Do not desert me, though this veil must be between <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> earth. Be mine, and hereafter there shall be no veil over my face, no darkness between our souls! It {{is but a}} mortal veil--it is not for eternity! O! you know not how lonely I am, and how frightened, to be alone behind my black veil. Do not leave me in this miserable obscurity forever!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he has half of it," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, [...] "he {{ought to}} be {{satisfied}} with that, and not keep <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> pins and needles until he gets the rest. Of course, I do not want to say anything that would pain you, Edna, and I won't do it, but people can't help thinking, and I think that we have waited as long as our consciences have any right to ask us to wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{the image}} of yours," [...] Obert said to me, fitting the cap, [...] "but it's a funny thing that it should really recall to one some face among <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> this occasion--I mean some face in our party--that I can't think of." [...] We had our eyes again on the ominous figure. [...] "We've seen him yesterday--we've seen him already this morning." [...] Obert, oddly enough, still couldn't catch it. [...] "Who the deuce is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} of {{a little bit of a}} sparklet before," [...] said Richard, [...] "but I think I do see what Ethel means; and it is like what I heard and liked in a {{university}} sermon some Sundays ago, saying that these lessons and holy words were to be impressed <b>on</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> from infancy <b>on</b> earth, that we might be always unravelling their meaning, and learn it fully at last--where we hope to be." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following circuit precedent, he {{held that}} the {{similarities}} between the two Acts were more significant than the differences and that on this issue they should be interpreted similarly because of McMahon: [...] "The Supreme Court opinion in McMahon, which binds <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> turns solely <b>on</b> the adequacy of arbitration to resolve securities disputes. It does not distinguish between the Exchange Act and the Securities Act." [...] That holding, and the circuit's own Noble case the year before [...] "lead directly to the obsolescence of Wilko and the arbitrability of Securities Act § 12(2) claims." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] exclaimed Euphemia, {{stopping}} {{short in}} the little path that wound along by the river bank. [...] "Do you see this river, those woods, those beautiful fields, with not a soul in them or anywhere near them; and those lovely blue mountains over there?"--as she spoke she waved her parasol {{in the direction of}} the objects indicated, and I could not mistake them. [...] "Now what could we want better than this?" [...] she continued. [...] "Here we can fish, and do everything that we want to. I say, let <b>us</b> camp <b>here</b> <b>on</b> our own river. I can take you to the very spot for the tent. Come on!" [...] And she was so excited about it that she fairly ran.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{patience}} with me, Elizabeth!" [...] cried he, passionately. [...] "Do not desert me though this veil must be between <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> earth. Be mine, and hereafter there shall be no veil over my face, no darkness between our souls. It {{is but a}} mortal veil; {{it is not for}} eternity. Oh, you know not how lonely I am, and how frightened to be alone behind my black veil! Do not leave me in this miserable obscurity for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess the}} Allinson outfit know their business," [...] he observed. [...] "It looks a curious way to pitch a claim, {{but if you}} come to figure out the thing, it gives them the best {{frontage}} they could get. This corner post's just where I'd have put it. If they'd located it a bit to the right, it would have swung their line off the richest stuff. There's no room for <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> pay dirt: we'll move higher up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{woman has}} been talking in her sleep, in this fashion, most of the watch," [...] {{observed}} Jack, coolly, and perhaps a little contemptuously. [...] "But, Mr. Mulford, unless my eyes have cheated me, we are near that boat again. The passage through the reef is close aboard <b>us,</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> our larboard bow, as it might be, and the current has sucked us in it in a fashion to bring it {{in a sort of}} athwart-hawse direction to us." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{if any one}} shall {{say that}} the souls of good men in heaven cannot help <b>us</b> who are <b>here</b> <b>on</b> earth, I answer--When did they ascend into heaven to find out that? If they had ever been there, let us be sure {{they would have had}} better news to bring home than this, that those whom we have honoured and loved on earth have lost the power which they used once to have of comforting us who are {{struggling}} below.|$|R
6000|$|Within our happy Castle there dwelt One [...] Whom without blame I may not overlook; [...] For never sun {{on living}} {{creature}} shone [...] Who more devout enjoyment with <b>us</b> took: [...] <b>Here</b> <b>on</b> his hours he hung as on a book, [...] 5 [...] On {{his own time}} here would he float away, [...] As doth a fly upon a summer brook; [...] But go to-morrow, or belike to-day, [...] Seek for him,--he is fled; and whither none can say.|$|R
50|$|The first {{concert with}} Þeyr {{took place on}} January 28 at the Hótel Saga. Þeyr was a group very {{sophisticated}} with a deep philosophical and physic inspiration, since all its members were by then intellectuals in music, sciences, philosophy, religion and even magic: “We {{were looking for a}} kind of ‘Theory of Everything’ which would unite all known disciplines of mankind into one coherent structure of wisdom. One man’s religion is another man’s magic, one man’s science is another man’s religion, etc... The very fact of <b>us</b> being <b>here</b> <b>on</b> Earth is both magical and religious, as well as scientific and philosophical. We went deeply into the ancient Nordic wisdom (before 800 A.C.) as well as the Middle Age’s alchemy as well as the dawn of the Galilean/Newtonian era up to the present Einstein/Heisenberg era”.|$|R
