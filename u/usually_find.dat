25|$|Studies that {{compare the}} {{knowledge}} base and quality of care provided by generalists versus specialists <b>usually</b> <b>find</b> that the specialists are more knowledgeable and provide better care. However, the studies examine {{the quality of care}} in the domain of the specialists. In addition, they need to account for clustering of patients and physicians.|$|E

Freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption, although some freegans also {{say that they do}} so for amusement, to acquire free goods, or out of religious conviction.|$|E

25|$|Each ADR {{is issued}} by a {{domestic}} custodian bank when the underlying shares are deposited {{in a foreign}} depositary bank, usually by a broker who has purchased the shares in the open market local to the foreign company. An ADR can represent {{a fraction of a}} share, a single share, or multiple shares of a foreign security. The holder of a DR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the DR represents, but investors <b>usually</b> <b>find</b> it more convenient to own the DR. The price of a DR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of DRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5% creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government. Depositary banks have various responsibilities to DR holders and to the issuing foreign company the DR represents.|$|E
25|$|This Lingering Life (2015) premiered at the Theatre of Yugen. The {{play was}} {{inspired}} by 14th century Japanese Noh plays, which Miyagawa studied in Japan during her Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Fellowship. The play retells nine ancient Japanese stories with 27 characters, all which have no names. Miyagawa {{said in an interview}} that the characters, “they are identified by their types, such as Crazy Woman, Mystical Warrior, Woman with Tragic Hair, and Gangster on the Run, in an attempt to create sympathetic characters without making them into our neighbors.” The play received critical acclaim. The Huffington Post said, “Miyagawa's plays, this one especially, sit somewhere between this world and another world. They also commit so fully to their own aesthetic that I <b>usually</b> <b>find</b> myself pondering the fascinating rules of this alternate existence hours or even days later (this lingering life indeed).” The New Yorker praised the play as” clever, stylish, and often funny”.|$|E

500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if I am right about him; I <b>usually</b> <b>find</b> that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In actuality, {{young men}} and women who were {{attracted}} to each other would often meet privately, in the bush or on the beach.

2500|$|Oenococcus oeni, the LAB species {{most often}} desired by winemakers {{to carry out}} malolactic fermentation, {{can be found in}} the vineyard, but often at very low levels. While moldy, damaged fruit has the {{potential}} to carry a diverse flora of microbes, the LAB most often found on clean, healthy grapes after harvest are species from the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera. After crushing, microbiologists <b>usually</b> <b>find</b> populations under 103 colony forming units/ml containing a mix of [...] P. damnosus, L. casei, L. hilgardii, and [...] L. plantarum, as well as O. oeni.

2500|$|Dysthymia has {{a number}} of typical characteristics: low energy and drive, low self-esteem, and a low {{capacity}} for pleasure in everyday life. [...] Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure. [...] In more severe cases of dysthymia, people may even withdraw from daily activities. [...] They will <b>usually</b> <b>find</b> little pleasure in usual activities and pastimes. Diagnosis of dysthymia can be difficult because of the subtle nature of the symptoms and patients can often hide them in social situations, making it challenging for others to detect symptoms. [...] Additionally, dysthymia often occurs {{at the same time as}} other psychological disorders, which adds a level of complexity in determining the presence of dysthymia, particularly because there is often an overlap in the symptoms of disorders. [...] There is a high incidence of comorbid illness in those with dysthymia. Suicidal behavior is also a particular problem with persons with dysthymia. It is vital to look for signs of major depression, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol and substance misuse and personality disorder.|$|E
2500|$|The Klingon {{language}} was first conceived by James Doohan {{for the movie}} Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and consisted only of a few words. Later, Marc Okrand proceeded to flesh out the sparse vocabulary into a real language, complete with grammar rules and phonology, and {{went so far as}} to publish The Klingon Dictionary (1985, revised edition 1992); the Klingon Language Institute was created soon thereafter. Okrand's Klingon {{language was}} used to write the Klingon dialogues heard in several Star Trek movies and episodes. Okrand has developed the language in an important way in two audio-courses: Conversational Klingon (1992) and Power Klingon (1993), and in two books: The Klingon Way (1996) and Klingon for the Galactic Traveller (1997). [...] Despite these facts, however, Ronald D. Moore stated in 1997: [...] "Whether or not [...] use the language as spelled out in Marc's dictionary is up to the individual writer," [...] and that he [...] "find the dictionary cumbersome and <b>usually</b> <b>find</b> it easier to make [...] up phonetically." ...|$|E

2500|$|A 2014 {{review in}} Nature Reviews Cancer found that [...] "contrary to the claimed {{mechanism}} of redirecting {{the flow of}} qi through meridians, researchers <b>usually</b> <b>find</b> that it generally does not matter where the needles are inserted, how often (that is, no dose-response effect is observed), or even if needles are actually inserted. In other words, 'sham' or 'placebo' acupuncture generally produces the same effects as 'real' acupuncture and, in some cases, does better." [...] A 2013 meta-analysis found little evidence that the effectiveness of acupuncture on pain (compared to sham) was modified by {{the location of the}} needles, the number of needles used, the experience or technique of the practitioner, or by the circumstances of the sessions. The same analysis also suggested that the number of needles and sessions is important, as greater numbers improved the outcomes of acupuncture compared to non-acupuncture controls. There has been little systematic investigation of which components of an acupuncture session may be important for any therapeutic effect, including needle placement and depth, type and intensity of stimulation, and number of needles used. The research seems to suggest that needles do not need to stimulate the traditionally specified acupuncture points or penetrate the skin to attain an anticipated effect (e.g. psychosocial factors).|$|E
