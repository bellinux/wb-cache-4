5000|$|The BCD code is the {{adaptation}} of the punched card code to a six-bit binary code by encoding the digit rows (nine rows, plus <b>unpunched)</b> into the low four bits, and the zone rows (three rows, plus <b>unpunched)</b> into the high two rows. [...] The digit zero (a single punch in row 0) is usually handled specially in some way, and the digit code was extended to values 10 through 15 by combining a digit in the range 2-7 with a punch in row 8. IBM applied the terms binary-coded decimal and BCD to the variations of BCD alphamerics used in most early IBM computers, including the IBM 1620, IBM 1400 series, and non-Decimal Architecture members of the IBM 700/7000 series.|$|E
5000|$|By this time, {{the first}} {{mechanical}} devices {{driven by a}} binary pattern had been invented. The industrial revolution had driven forward the mechanization of many tasks, and this included weaving. Punched cards controlled Joseph Marie Jacquard's loom in 1801, where a hole punched in the card indicated a binary one and an <b>unpunched</b> spot indicated a binary zero. Jacquard's loom was {{far from being a}} computer, but it did illustrate that machines could be driven by binary systems [...]|$|E
50|$|Punched {{cards and}} paper tape are {{obsolete}} WORM media. Although any <b>unpunched</b> {{area of the}} medium could be punched after the first write of the medium, doing so was virtually never useful. Read-only memory (ROM) is also a WORM medium. Such memory may contain the instructions to a computer to read the operating system from another storage device such as a hard disk. The non-technical end-user, however, cannot write the ROM even once, but considers it part of the unchangeable computing platform.|$|E
50|$|The current Unicode charts, {{and some}} fonts, use empty circles to {{indicate}} dots {{that are not}} punched. This does not always render very clearly: if the circle outlines are printed heavily then {{it can be difficult}} to tell at a glance whether the dot is filled in or not. The braille package for LaTeX (and several printed publications such as the printed manual for the new international braille music code) show <b>unpunched</b> dots as very small dots (much smaller than the filled-in dots) rather than circles, and this tends to print better.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{meaning of this}} character was like NOP - when sent to a printer or a terminal, it does nothing (some terminals, however, incorrectly display it as space). When electromechanical teleprinters were used as computer output devices, one or more null characters were sent {{at the end of}} each printed line to allow time for the mechanism to return to the first printing position on the next line. On punched tape, the character is represented with no holes at all, so a new <b>unpunched</b> tape is initially filled with null characters, and often text could be [...] "inserted" [...] at a reserved space of null characters by punching the new characters into the tape over the nulls.|$|E
50|$|On Christmas Eve in late 1959, a boy {{witnesses}} a train {{called the}} Polar Express {{that is about}} to depart for the North Pole. When the boy examines the engine, the conductor allows him to board the train. The boy meets other children, including a girl and a know-it-all boy with a Brooklyn accent and a hyperactive personality. When the train picks up another boy, Billy, the hero boy applies the emergency brakes when Billy initially declines to board. The conductor summons a waiter team to give the children hot chocolate and the girl hides one under her seat to give to Billy. The girl and conductor go to deliver the hot chocolate cup to Billy, but the hero boy discovers the girl’s ticket is <b>unpunched.</b> He loses it before he can return it. The boy explains the lost ticket to the conductor, and the conductor takes her for {{a walk on the}} top of the train. The hero boy locates the lost ticket and pursues them.|$|E
40|$|Journal which, if prophetic, {{has proved}} to be so more in general than {{specific}} terms. In any case {{it turned out to be}} a very long-range forecast. The Library of Congress will install a department where phonograph records of speeches of statesmen and distinguished persons will be preserved for the benefit of future generations. The government recently received a record containing an address made by the German emperor, and this led to the suggestion that the utterances of other statesmen might be preserved in the same way. 1 The phonograph record 2 of Wilhelm I 1 was made at the instigation of E. W. Scripture on January 24, 1904, and was subsequently presented to Herbert Putnam, the Librarian of Congress. It was taken from the Librarian’s safe many years later and today occupies a place of honor in the Library’s recorded sound collections-no longer the earliest specimen of recording in the collections, but nevertheless the first to arrivea 3 Growth of the recorded sound collection from that lone cylinder had some time to wait. The collection of more “speeches of statesmen and distinguished persons ” had still longer to wait, for the next audible acquisitions appear to have been musical, in the form of rolls for the mechanical player piano, deposited for copyright in the late teens and twenties. While the 1909 copyright law made no provision for the registration of recorded sound, the rolls contained copyrightable printed matter-biographies of composers, analytical and descriptive notes-in addition to the punched holes to activate the piano mechanism. Alas, some rolls were deposited printed, but <b>unpunched.</b> A bit of prehistory in the Library’s sound service was recently discovered in a log book maintained by the reference librarian during th...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a large class of matrix problems, {{which includes the}} problem of classifying arbitrary systems of linear mappings. For every matrix problem from this class, we construct Belitskiĭ’s algorithm for reducing a matrix to a canonical form, which is the generalization of the Jordan normal form, and study the set Cmn of indecomposable canonical m × n matrices. Considering Cmn as a subset in the affine space of m-by-n matrices, we prove that either Cmn consists of {{a finite number of}} points and straight lines for every m × n, or Cmn contains a 2 -dimensional plane for a certain m × n. AMS classification: 15 A 21; 16 G 60. Keywords: Canonical forms; Canonical matrices; Reduction; Classification; Tame and wild matrix problems. All matrices are considered over an algebraically closed field k; k m×n denotes the set of m-by-n matrices over k. The article consists of three sections. In Section 1 we present Belitskiĭ’s algorithm [2] (see also [3]) in a form, which is convenient for linear algebra. In particular, the algorithm permits to reduce pairs of n-by-n matrices to a canonical form by transformations of simultaneous similarity: (A, B) ↦ → (S − 1 AS, S − 1 BS); another solution of this classical problem was given by Friedland [15]. This section uses rudimentary linear algebra (except for the proof of Theorem 1. 1) and may be interested for the general reader. This is the author’s version of a work that was published in Linear Algebra Appl. 317 (2000) 53 – 102. 1 In Section 2 we determine a broad class of matrix problems, which includes the problems of classifying representations of quivers, partially ordered sets and finite dimensional algebras. In Section 3 we get the following geometric characterization of the set of canonical matrices in the spirit of [17]: if a matrix problem does not ‘contain ’ the canonical form problem for pairs of matrices under simultaneous similarity, then its set of indecomposable canonical m × n matrices in the affine space k m×n consists of a finite number of points and straight lines (contrary to [17], these lines are <b>unpunched).</b> A detailed introduction is given at the beginning of every section. Each introduction may be read independently. 1 Belitskiĭ’s algorith...|$|E
