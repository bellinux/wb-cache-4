The experimentally acquired frequency characteristics of complex dielectric permittivity are substituted by equivalent mathematical models of dielectric relaxation.

40|$|Predicting {{magnitude}} {{and frequency of}} floods is a key issue in hydrology, with implications in many fields ranging from river science and geomorphology to the insurance industry. In this paper, a novel physically based approach is proposed to estimate the recurrence intervals of seasonal flow maxima. The method links the extremal distribution of streamflows to the stochastic dynamics of daily discharge, providing an analytical expression of the seasonal flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve.</b> The parameters involved in the formulation embody climate and landscape attributes of the contributing catchment and can be estimated from daily rainfall and streamflow data. Only one parameter, which {{is linked to the}} antecedent wetness condition in the watershed, needs to be calibrated on the observed maxima. The performance of the method is discussed through a set of applications in four rivers featuring heterogeneous daily flow regimes. The model provides reliable estimates of seasonal maximum flows in different climatic settings and is able to capture diverse <b>shapes</b> of flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> emerging in erratic and persistent flow regimes. The proposed method exploits experimental information on the full range of discharges experienced by rivers. As a consequence, model performances do not deteriorate when the magnitude of events with return times longer than the available sample size is estimated. The approach provides a framework for the prediction of floods based on short data series of rainfall and daily streamflows that may be especially valuable in data scarce regions of the world...|$|R

40|$|We model {{an agency}} {{relationship}} {{in which the}} agent's cost is non-monotonic with respect to type and the type is correlated with a public ex-post signal. The principal can use lotteries to exploit the type-signal correlation within the limit of the agent's liability.

First, {{the structure of the}} optimal lottery varies across types and, for each type, it depends on whether the cost is <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> or reverse <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> with respect to type. Second, as compared to the case of monotonic cost, the design of incentive compatible lotteries is easier when the cost is <b>U</b> <b>shaped,</b> more difficult when the cost is reverse <b>U</b> <b>shaped.</b> The root of the second effect is that incentives are non-monotonic either below or above some interior types. The two effects involve that non-monotonicity is unfavorable to the principal when the cost is reverse <b>U</b> <b>shaped.</b> This conclusion is at odds with the wisdom, concerning settings without correlated information, that non-monotonicity, which triggers countervailing incentives, enhances contracting...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how to select the minimum set of storms that should be simulated each year in order to estimate an accurate flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> for return periods ranging between 1 and 1000 years. The Manzanares basin (Spain) was used as a study case. A continuous 100, 000 -year hourly rainfall series was generated using the stochastic spatial–temporal model RanSimV 3. Individual storms were extracted from the series by applying the exponential method. For each year, the extracted storms were transformed into hydrographs by applying an hourly time-step semi-distributed event-based rainfall–runoff model, and the maximum peak flow per year was determined to generate the reference flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve.</b> Then, different flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained considering the N storms with maximum rainfall depth per year, with 1 ≤ N ≤ total number of storms. Main results show that: (a) the degree of alignment between the calculated flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> and the reference flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> depends on the return period considered, increasing the accuracy for higher return periods; (b) for the analyzed case studies, the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> for medium and high return period (50 ≤ return period ≤ 1000 years) can be estimated with a difference lower than 3 % (compared to the reference flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve)</b> by considering the three storms with the maximum total rainfall depth each year; (c) when considering only the greatest storm of the year, for return periods higher than 10 years, the difference for the estimation of the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> is lower than 10 %; and (d) when considering the three greatest storms each year, for return periods higher than 100 years, the probability of achieving simultaneously a hydrograph with the annual maximum peak flow and the maximum volume is 94 %...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} the effects of selected catchment storage thresholds upon runoff behaviour, and specifically their impact upon flood frequency. The analysis is carried out with the use of a stochastic rainfall model, incorporating rainfall variability at intra-event, inter-event and seasonal timescales, as well as infrequent summer tropical cyclones, coupled with deterministic rainfall-runoff models that incorporate runoff generation by both saturation excess and subsurface stormflow mechanisms. Changing runoff generation mechanisms (i. e. from subsurface flow to surface runoff) associated with a given threshold (i. e. saturation storage capacity) are shown to be manifested in the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> as a break in slope. It is observed that the inclusion of infrequent summer storm events increases the temporal frequency occurrence and magnitude of surface runoff events, in this way contributing to steeper flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves,</b> and an additional break in the slope of the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve.</b> The results of this study highlight the importance of thresholds on flood frequency, and provide insights into the complex interactions between rainfall variability and threshold nonlinearities in the rainfall-runoff process, which are shown to have a significant impact on the resulting flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves...</b>|$|R
