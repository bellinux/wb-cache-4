5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E
5|$|They {{set out on}} {{the road}} with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark {{convertible}} with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount). Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes up the next day to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd. They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E
25|$|After the {{procedure}} is complete, the patient is typically asked to lie flat for 5–10 minutes to provide pressure over {{the procedure}} site. After that, assuming no bleeding is observed, the patient can get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> about their normal activities. Paracetamol (aka acetaminophen) or other simple analgesics {{can be used to}} ease soreness, which is common for 2–3 days after the procedure. Any worsening pain, redness, fever, bleeding or swelling may suggest a complication. Patients are also advised to avoid washing the procedure site for at least 24 hours after {{the procedure is}} completed.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{are also}} looking at the effect of tai chi on gait performance, and balance in people with Parkinson's Disease. The first study {{concluded}} that tai chi was ineffective {{since there was no}} improvement on gait performance and no improvement on the Part III score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The second study found that patients taking tai chi improved on their UPDRS score, Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test, six-minute walk and backwards walking. It did not however, show any improvements on their forward walking or their one leg stance test.|$|E
25|$|Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test (TUG) {{scores have}} been seen to improve after having engaged in gaming rehabilitation. Several studies have {{produced}} output that suggests that Wii games are able to effectively increase patients' scores after {{a certain period of}} rehabilitation through them. Stroke recovery patients and patients with an Acquired brain injury are two such examples of this output. Both patient classes have been shown to display slightly better improvements when using the Wii game or Wii balance board than when engaging in regular therapeutic methodologies. Continuing past these classes, studies are continually proving that these scores can be increased in a variety of patients with a variety of physical disabilities and from a variety of backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|The Elrics go to {{northern}} Amestris where they inform {{the soldiers of}} Fort Briggs of the conspiracies in Central. Finding an underground tunnel beneath Briggs, the Elrics and General Olivier Armstrong discover that Amestris is practically {{nothing more than a}} human farm created by Father, who has been creating a nationwide transmutation circle and plans to cull its citizens by converting them into an extremely powerful Philosopher's Stone, which he shall use as a weapon to ascend to godhood. The Elrics are forced to work with Solf J. Kimblee to track down Scar, with Winry as a hostage. They learn Scar's brother created a new type of alchemy to combat Father, leading them to team <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> on the run from the military, though Edward is left behind to divert Kimblee. Greed regains his past self's memories and betrays Father, teaming up with Edward, Kimblee's chimera minions, and later Hohenheim. Hohenheim reveals to his sons separately that he is immortal, turned into a living Philosopher's Stone by Father four hundred years ago.|$|E

25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to work. As Mildred tries {{to care for her}} husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: {{over the course of several}} decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E

500|$|Rabbits {{have long}} been {{associated}} with bad luck on Portland; use of the name is still taboo—the creatures are {{often referred to as}} [...] "underground mutton", [...] "long-eared furry things" [...] or just [...] "bunnies". The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers: they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured. Local fishermen too would refuse to go to sea if the word was mentioned.|$|E
500|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} most music critics. Ian Gittins of The Guardian {{called it a}} [...] "bitchy put-down of ageing suitors". Doug Rule of Metro Weekly criticized the song's chorus, which according to him is [...] "spelt out like a [...] "modern-day Toni Basil", saying: [...] "Are we supposed to think that's cute, even clever? It's neither." [...] The UrbanWire's Cheryl Chia was critical of the song, saying that it [...] "has {{the potential to be}} very annoying after a few rounds." [...] Billboards Monica Herrera also gave a negative review. She used the song as an example of one of the album's [...] "missteps", stating that it could [...] "only appeal to the most heartless of teens". Ailbhe Malone of NME stated that [...] "Dinosaur" [...] contains the pay-off [...] "Honey, your toupee is falling to the left side/Get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> bro/Oh wait, you’re fossilized".|$|E

Am I crazy? Am I crazy? Am I crazy?" [...] After the play, Riegels was so distraught that he had to be talked into {{returning}} to the game by coach Nibs Price for the second half.

[...] Coach Price responded by saying [...] "Roy, get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back out there—the game is only half over". Riegels did play on; he turned in a strong second-half performance, {{including}} blocking a Georgia Tech punt. Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, but that was not enough. Georgia Tech won the game and its second national championship 8–7. Its starting lineup was Waddey (left end), Speer (left tackle), Drennon (left guard), Pund (center), Westbrook (right guard), Maree (right tackle), Jones (right end), Durant (quarterback), Thomason (left halfback), Mizell (right halfback), and Lumpkin (fullback).|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The war's end {{swung the}} {{pendulum}} back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed {{it after the}} war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide {{but over the years}} adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now under a European Community directive summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016). The U.S. was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few U.S. cities retained DST locally thereafter, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a [...] "deception". Reasoning that people should instead get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to work earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.|$|E

500|$|The Youngstown club {{kicked off}} the 1906 season with an {{exhibition}} game against a Cleveland team, emerging as victors in a close contest of 3–4. [...] "Up till the closing minutes {{it looked like the}} visiting team, the Cleveland Leaders, would stow the contest away in their bat-bags and leave the field on top", the Vindicator reported. [...] "The finish was exciting, and 400 fanatics who took chances on pneumonia had a chance to warm <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> home in good spirits.". [...] The paper stated that, {{at the top of the}} first inning, the Cleveland team was leading by one point, when [...] "the Youngstown gentlemen got busy in the most approved style". According to the Vindicator, Ohio Works player Curley Blount [...] "stepped in front of a slow pitched ball and was sent to third", while A. C. McClintock [...] "stole second with all hands asleep". [...] At this point, the paper added, [...] " [...] McCloskey took another base hit and Blount and McClintock scored". [...] The Vindicators summary of the game called attention to pitcher Roy Castleton, [...] "who struck out all three batters in the tenth and got one in the ninth".

500|$|Star Ocean has a game {{mechanic}} called [...] "Private Actions" [...] {{that plays}} a role in character development. While entirely optional, they often reveal additional backstory of particular characters or have other varying effects on gameplay. Upon arriving in a town, the player can opt to have all the characters in the party to temporarily split <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> their separate ways within the limitations of the town. The player retains control of just Ratix, and is able to look for the other characters. Upon finding other party members, various events may happen; sometimes only small talk results, other times, larger events happen, that may even require a choice to be made by the player. Depending on the results, this can cause characters to either gain or lose [...] "affinity" [...] toward other characters in the party. For example, if one character loves another, the affinity level will be high, but if the former is mistreated, it will lower their feelings for the latter. A character's affinity towards one another can have effects {{on the rest of the}} game. Affinity also affect which character's endings players see. While the game's overarching plot always largely ends the same, various parts of the ending are changed, added, or left out, depending on characters' affinity at the end of the game.|$|E
500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were about to give <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E
