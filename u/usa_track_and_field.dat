While at Oregon, he also coached the <b>USA</b> <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> team and helped bring the U.S. Olympic Trials to Hayward Field {{for the first}} time. In 2009, The Bowerman Award was created in coach Bowerman's name and administered by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. The award is given annually as the highest honor for the best collegiate track and field athlete of the year, one each for men and for women.|$|E
5|$|Hayward Field {{has been}} host to {{numerous}} national {{track and field}} {{events such as the}} U.S. Olympic Trials, NCAA Championships, and the <b>USA</b> <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> Championships. No other venue has hosted more NCAA Championships and no other venue had held three consecutive U.S. Olympic Trials. Many have attested to the magical aura of Hayward field, citing many personal bests run at the venue. Credit often goes to the regular attendance of knowledgeable track and field fans for the phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of {{numerous}} regional championships, {{as well as the}} growth in Olympic-style multi-sport events (such as the Commonwealth Games and the Pan-American Games), competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread. From the 1960s onwards, the sport gained more exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations. After over half a century of amateurism, the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by growing professionalism in the late 1970s. As a result, the Amateur Athletic Union was dissolved in the United States and it was replaced with a non-amateur body solely focused on the sport of athletics: The Athletics Congress (later <b>USA</b> <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field).</b> The IAAF soon followed suit in 1982, abandoning amateurism, and later removing all references to it from its name by rebranding itself as the International Association of Athletics Federations. The following year saw the establishment of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics—the first ever global competition just for athletics—which, with the Olympics, became one of track and field's most prestigious competitions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} meeting of the 2011 IAAF Diamond League, at the Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix, he won the 200 m with a time of 20.06 seconds. Dix took further 200m {{victories}} at the Eugene and London legs of the series, while Usain Bolt won the other three 200m mid-season legs. He achieved a 100/200 sprint double at the 2011 <b>USA</b> <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> Championships, winning in the absence of Tyson Gay and Wallace Spearmon. Running in both the events at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, he first secured the silver medal in the 100m final – defending champion Bolt was disqualified for a false start and Dix was runner-up to another Jamaican, Yohan Blake, in a comparatively slow 10.08 seconds. In the 200-meter final Bolt beat the field but Dix was the closest to him, running 19.70 seconds to take his second silver of the tournament. He attempted to gain a third medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay final, but a mid-race collision between Darvis Patton and Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey meant the American team's baton never reached Dix's final leg. At the Diamond League 200m final at the Memorial Van Damme he ran a personal best of 19.53 seconds. Blake was even faster (19.26), however, leaving Dix in second place even as he became the fourth fastest 200m runner of all-time and then won the league series.|$|E

25|$|Named after Florida State's first {{track and}} field head coach, the complex has {{attracted}} {{some of the top}} meets in the nation. Mike Long Track and the City of Tallahassee played host to the <b>USA</b> <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> National Junior Championships in 1988 and the AAU National Championships in 1991.

The <b>USA</b> <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> National Junior Championships returned ti Mike Long Track in the Summer of '94. The British Olympic Team, who trained in Tallahassee for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, used the facility for all their {{track and field}} practices and workouts over the summer. The Florida State track and field team has been calling Mike Long Track home now for 53 years. The 2003 season marked the unveiling of Mike Long Track's brand new track, complete with a new surface, wider lanes, faster turns and a larger infield area for hosting field events. Seating capacity was also expanded to accommodate 1,500 spectators. The competition areas were resurfaced {{before the start of the}} 2008 season. In the spring of 2008 the newest addition to the facility, an 18,000-foot expansion gave the center a total space of 22,000 square feet. The improvements benefit not only the track and field/cross country programs, but also volleyball, soccer, softball and tennis student-athletes. The expanded center includes locker rooms, student-athlete lounges, medical preparation areas, coaches' offices and a conference room.|$|E

She began training with Olympic gold medalist Jon Drummond during this period. Her Olympic year form returned in 2007, which she began with personal record-equalling run of 11.26seconds at the Mt. SAC Relays and an outright 200m best of 22.46seconds to finish as runner-up at the Adidas Track Classic. She finished fourth in the 200m at the 2007 US Outdoor National Championships, but {{due to the fact}} that the race winner (Allyson Felix) was automatically qualified for the 2007 World Championships in Athletics as the reigning world champion, Moore gained a position on the US team. She went on to be one of four American women to reach the 2007 World 200m final (along with Felix, Sanya Richards and Torri Edwards) but she only managed seventh place with a below-peak form run of 22.97seconds. After making appearances in the 2007 IAAF Golden League, at the ISTAF and Memorial van Damme meetings, she closed the season by winning a bronze medal at the 2007 IAAF World Athletics Final – her first global senior medal.|$|E
