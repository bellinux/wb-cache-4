5|$|López de Salcedo moved Trujillo <b>upslope</b> {{from its}} {{previous}} swampy location. In 1528, López de Salcedo {{spent a month}} in the Olancho Valley, which at this time was likely to have been inhabited by Pech. He attempted to bring the inhabitants under his control, spurring them into preparation to resist further Spanish incursions. He hanged several indigenous leaders who taken part in the attack on Natividad de Nuestra Señora, and imposed such harsh obligations upon the natives that they burned their villages and their crops and fled into the mountains. In Olancho, López de Salcedo unsuccessfully clashed with rival Spaniards that he found still there. Unrest among the natives spread widely, from Comayagua to as far south as Nicaragua, causing difficulties in procuring provisions, and presenting constant danger to the expedition. Nevertheless, he continued onwards to León, in Nicaragua. At about this time, Pedrarias was appointed governor of Nicaragua after vigorously protesting his loss of governorship over Castilla del Oro.|$|E
5|$|The {{major cause}} of rain {{production}} is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where <b>upslope</b> flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall {{along the sides of}} mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.|$|E

50|$|A final {{approach}} over an <b>upsloping</b> terrain {{with a flat}} runway, or to an unusually narrow or long runway may produce the visual illusion of being too high on {{final approach}}.

25|$|There is a {{pronounced}} morphology {{characterized by a}} channel <b>upslope</b> and snouts downslope. Flow surfaces display pronounced fractures with a V profile, which developed {{a year after the}} eruption.

25|$|The {{climate of}} Kilimanjaro is {{influenced}} by the height of the mountain, which allows the simultaneous influence of the equatorial trade winds and the high altitude anti-trades, and the isolated position of the mountain. Kilimanjaro has daily <b>upslope</b> and nightly downslope winds, a regimen stronger on the southern than the northern side of the mountain. The flatter southern flanks are more extended and affect the atmosphere more strongly.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} monsoon, wind {{patterns}} undergo large scale changes. In May {{there is very}} little large scale wind current through the mountains, most circulates around the mountains, although onshore flow is present. As the high pressure moves north, air is pulled off the Gulf of Mexico, bringing easterly winds aloft to the mountains. On the east slope of the mountain daytime <b>upslope</b> winds flow to the crest, where the flow joins westerly winds. The mountains cause convection during the following monsoon season, during which nocturnal winds at low levels in the atmosphere move moisture overnight. After the high pressure breaks down, wind patterns return to those prior to the monsoon season.|$|E
50|$|This {{illusion}} {{may make}} a pilot change (increase or decrease) the slope of their final approach. They are caused by runways with different widths, <b>upsloping</b> or downsloping runways, and <b>upsloping</b> or downsloping final approach terrain. Pilots learn to recognize a normal final approach by developing and recalling a mental image of the expected relationship between the length and the width of an average runway. An example would be a pilot used to small general aviation fields visiting a large international airport. The much wider runway would give the pilot the mental picture of {{the point where they}} would usually begin the flare, when they are much higher than they should be. A pilot flying an aircraft where the cockpit height relative to the ground is vastly higher or lower than they are used to can cause a similar illusion in {{the last part of the}} approach.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of outlet glaciers on short (annual to decadal) timescales {{is affected by}} various external forcings, such as basal or oceanic conditions. Understanding {{the sensitivity of the}} dynamic response to such forcings can help assess more accurate ice volume projections. In this work, we investigate the spatiotemporal sensitivity of outlet glaciers to fast cyclical forcings using a one-dimensional depth and width-averaged heuristic model. Our results indicate that even on such short timescales, nonlinearities in ice dynamics may lead to an asymmetric response, despite the forcing functions being symmetric around each reference value. Results also show that such short-timescale effects become more pronounced as glaciers become closer to flotation. While being qualitatively similar for both downsloping and <b>upsloping</b> bed geometries, the results indicate higher sensitivity for <b>upsloping</b> ("West Antarctica-like") beds. The range in asymmetric response for different configurations motivate parameterizing or including short-timescale effects in models while investigating the dynamic behavior of outlet glaciers...|$|R
40|$|The main {{features}} of the general circulation {{in the region of}} the Bering Strait are summarized. This flow has been simulated by a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, which is briefly described with some emphasis on the initial and boundary conditions. The modelled vertical velocity field is analysed. First, it is suggested to regard the vertical velocity as the sum of two components, namely the <b>upsloping</b> and the upwelling velocity. Next, the fields of upwelling and <b>upsloping</b> velocity are examined and it is seen that the vertical motions predicted by the model are qualitatively in agreement with the existence of a cold water plume downstream of the Anadyr Strait. Finally, a successful attempt is made to explain the upwelling phenomena found in the model results by a mechanism which relies on the velocity veering induced by the bottom stress, is independent of wind forcing, and is inspired by the classical theory of Ekman pumping...|$|R

Perry's brigade commander, Brigadier General Evander M. Law ordered his brigade, including Perry's 44th Alabama Infantry, to support the attack of Brigadier General Jerome B. Robertson's brigade by moving over Plum Rum toward Devil's Den. As they approached this objective, Law ordered Perry to seize four guns on the <b>upslope</b> behind Devil's Den as part of the assault. Perry's regiment had stalled about 50 yards short of Devil's Den when Perry was wounded. As Perry expressed concern about nearby artillery to Major Cary of his regiment, a shell landed near Perry's head, wounding him. After Georgia regiments from Brigadier General Henry Benning's brigade moved forward in support of the 44th Alabama Infantry and 48th Alabama Infantry, the Confederates cleared out the Fourth New York Artillery Battery under Captain James E. Smith and ultimately won control of Devil's Den and nearby woods. The 44th Alabama Infantry held this area while other regiments from Law's and Robertson's brigades unsuccessfully assaulted Little Round Top.|$|E
500|$|The storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} across southwestern Guatemala. Up to 9inches (228mm) of rainfall {{was reported in}} localized areas along the Pacific coast of the country.

It is reported that tropical-storm-force winds occurred along coastal areas of southern Mexico. The rainfall destroyed some houses and killed numerous livestock, and triggered a mudslide which killed two children. In Honduras, rainfall from the Lester destroyed a bridge which affected transportation for about 1,000people.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{patients with}} a distinct electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern without ST-segment elevation {{in the presence of}} an acute occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. DESIGN: Single-centre observational study. PATIENTS: Patients with acute anterior wall myocardial infarction who were referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between 1998 and 2008. RESULTS: We identified {{patients with a}} static, distinct ECG pattern without ST-segment elevation and an occlusion of the proximal LAD artery during urgent coronary angiography before PCI. Of 1890 patients who underwent primary PCI of the LAD artery, we could identify 35 patients (2 %) with this distinct ECG pattern. The ECG showed ST-segment depression at the J-point of at least 1 mm in precordial leads with <b>upsloping</b> ST-segments continuing into tall, symmetrical T-waves. Patients with this distinct ECG pattern were younger, more often male and more often had hypercholesterolaemia compared to patients with anterior myocardial infarction and ST-segment elevation. CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with chest pain, ST-segment depression at the J-point with <b>upsloping</b> ST-segments and tall, symmetrical T-waves in the precordial leads of the 12 -lead ECG signifies proximal LAD artery occlusion. It is important for cardiologists and emergency care physicians to recognise this distinct ECG pattern, so they can triage such patients for immediate reperfusion therap...|$|R

500|$|Tropical cyclone {{rainfall}} forecasting is important, since between 1970–2004, inland flooding from tropical cyclones {{caused a}} majority of the fatalities from tropical cyclones in the United States.

500|$|In mountainous areas, local {{distortion}} of the airflow becomes severe. Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as rotors, which can be topped by lenticular clouds. Strong updrafts, downdrafts and eddies develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by the}} rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, also known as <b>upslope</b> flow, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed. Winds that flow over mountains down into lower elevations are known as downslope winds. These winds are warm and dry. In Europe downwind of the Alps, they are known as foehn. In Poland, an example is the halny wiatr. In Argentina, the local name for downsloped winds is zonda. In Java, the local name for such winds is koembang. In New Zealand, they are known as the Nor'west arch, and are accompanied by the cloud formation they are named after that has inspired artwork over the years. In the Great Plains of the United States, the winds are known as a chinook. In California, downsloped winds are funneled through mountain passes, which intensify their effect, and examples include the Santa Ana and sundowner winds.
