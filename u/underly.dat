50|$|Pin risk {{occurs when}} the market price of the <b>underlier</b> of an option {{contract}} {{at the time of}} the contract's expiration is close to the option's strike price. In this situation, the <b>underlier</b> is said to have pinned. The risk to the writer (seller) of the option is that they cannot predict with certainty whether the option will be exercised or not. So the writer cannot hedge his position precisely and may end up with a loss or gain. There is a chance that the price of the <b>underlier</b> may move adversely, resulting in an unanticipated loss to the writer. In other words, an option position may result in a large, undesired risky position in the <b>underlier</b> immediately after expiration, regardless of the actions of the writer.|$|R

50|$|Sellers of option {{contracts}} often hedge {{them to create}} delta neutral portfolios. The objective is to minimize risk due to {{the movement of the}} underlier's price, while implementing whatever strategy led to the sale of the options in the first place. For instance, a seller of a call may hedge by buying just enough of the <b>underlier</b> to create a delta neutral portfolio. As time passes, the option seller adjusts his hedge position by buying or selling some quantity of the <b>underlier</b> to counteract changes in the price of the <b>underlier.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the {{day that}} an option expires—for U.S. {{exchange}} traded equity options this is the Saturday following the third Friday of the month—if an option's <b>underlier</b> is close to pinning, the trader must pay close attention. A small movement of the underlier's price through the strike (e.g. from below the strike price to above, or vice versa) can have a large impact on the trader's net position in the <b>underlier</b> on the trading day after expiration. For instance, if an option goes from being in the money to out of the money, the trader must rapidly trade enough of the <b>underlier</b> so that the position after expiration will be flat.|$|R
50|$|Options market makers, or others, may form a delta neutral {{portfolio}} using related options {{instead of}} the underlying. The portfolio's delta (assuming the same <b>underlier)</b> is then {{the sum of all}} the individual options' deltas. This method can also be used when the <b>underlier</b> is difficult to trade, for instance when an underlying stock is hard to borrow and therefore cannot be sold short.|$|R

50|$|Depression is also {{characterized}} by decreased {{activation of the}} medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, {{and in particular the}} nucleus accumbens in response to positive stimuli. These regions are important in reward processing, and dysfunction of them in depression is thought to <b>underly</b> anhedonia, a core symptom of depression involving decreased ability to feel pleasure. Residual anhedonia that is not well targeted by serotonergic antidepressants is hypothesized to result from inhibition of dopamine release by activation of 5-HT2C receptors in the striatum.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} explanation for the lack of agreement on hydrologic change throughout the Quaternary is that there was significant heterogeneity in climate during the Last Glacial Maximum throughout Indonesia. Alternativley, the physical and chemical processes that <b>underly</b> the method of inferring precipitation from δ18O records may have operated differently in the past. Some authors working primarily with pollen records have also noted the difficulties of using vegetation records to detect changes in precipitation regimes in such a humid environment, as water is not a limiting factor in community assemblage.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{one sees}} {{this type of}} {{situation}} often when the short leg is being bid up for a specific reason. For instance, the near option may include an upcoming event, such as an earnings announcement, that will, in all probability, cause the <b>underlier</b> price to move. After the event has passed, the market may expect the <b>underlier</b> to be relatively stable which results in a lower implied volatility for the subsequent period.|$|R
5000|$|Cash {{settlement}} - Cash-settled options do {{not require}} the actual delivery of the <b>underlier.</b> Instead, the market value, at the exercise date, of the <b>underlier</b> is compared to the strike price, and the difference (if in a favourable direction) is paid by the option seller to {{the owner of the}} option. An example of a cash-settled contract is most U.S.-listed exchange-traded index options. This settlement occurs the next business day following the trade.|$|R

5000|$|In {{some cases}} {{psychiatric}} phenomenon may emerge such as stimulant psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation. Acute toxicity has been reportedly {{associated with a}} homicide, paranoia, aggressive behavior, motor dysfunction, and punding. The violent and aggressive behavior associated with acute stimulant toxicity may partially be driven by paranoia. [...] Most drugs classified as stimulants are sympathomimetics, that is they stimulate the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. This leads to effects such as mydriasis, increased heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and body temperature. [...] When these changes become pathological, they are called arrhythmia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, and may lead to rhabdomyolysis, stroke, cardiac arrest, or seizures. However given {{the complexity of the}} mechanisms that <b>underly</b> these potentially fatal outcomes of acute stimulant toxicity, it is impossible to determine what dose may be lethal.|$|E

However, {{this does not mean that}} the language of the Charter can be totally avoided by proceeding to a general examination of such values or that the court can through the process of judicial interpretation change the nature of the right. As held in Blencoe [...] "While notions of dignity and reputation <b>underly</b> many Charter rights, they are not stand-alone rights that trigger s. 7 in and of themselves." [...] A purposive approach to Charter interpretation, while coloured by an overarching concern with human dignity, democracy and other such Charter values, must first and foremost look to the purpose of the section in question. Without some link to the language of the Charter, the legitimacy of the entire process of Charter adjudication is brought into question.|$|E
50|$|He was {{nominated}} by the lords {{of the congregation}} to the church of Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, 19 July 1560, in which year and the following {{he was a member}} of assembly. He was deposed from his incumbency, with some difficulty, towards the end of 1562, for adultery with his servant, and sentence of excommunication was also pronounced against him. Thereupon he fled to England and resumed his ministerial office there. In 1563 it was declared in the assembly that he was 'verie sorrowful for his grievous offence, and wald <b>underly</b> whatever punishment the kirk would lay upon him,' which declaration, on 27 Dec. 1564, 'the haill Assemblie with ane voyce are content to receive.' After an absence of up wards of two years the assembly, on 26 June 1566, ordained his public repentance. He was ordered to appear at the church door of Edinburgh when the second bell rang for public worship, clothed in sackcloth, bare-headed and bare-footed; to stand there until the prayer and psalms were finished; when he was to be brought into the church to hear the sermon, during which he was to be 'placeit in the publick spectakill of repentance above the peiple.' He was to repeat this procedure at Dundee and Jedburgh, where he had officiated as minister. Methuen went through a part of this discipline, but being overwhelmed with shame, or despairing to regain his lost reputation, he stopped in the midst of it, and again returned to England.|$|E
