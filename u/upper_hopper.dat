40|$|This {{experimental}} research investigates transverse particle segregation in a binary mixture of spherical particles in air. in a gravity driven. vertical channel flow. Glass beads with similar properties, except for size and color, are randomly mixed in an <b>upper</b> <b>hopper</b> {{at the entrance}} of a vertical channel. When roughened channel walls are employed. particles show segregation by size, with a preferred position of larger particles at the centerline and approximately 80...|$|E
40|$|A 10 m-high locally {{supported}} silo containing flour or {{sugar is}} analyzed. The horizontal cross-section of the 6. 2 m-high vertical walls is an irregular octagon with four sides of 1. 9 m {{and the remaining}} four of 0. 7 m. The walls and <b>upper</b> <b>hopper</b> (from the top section of the columns to the bottom boundary of the walls) are made of stainless steel of class AISI 430 and have a thickness of 1. 5 mm. The lower hopper (below the the top section of the columns) is made of stainless steel of class AISI 304 and has a thickness of 3 mm. The silo was installed into a site with PGA approximately equal to agS = 0. 3 g for TR = 475 years. Elasto-plastic analyses {{in the presence of}} geometric nonlinearities and initial imperfection were carried out. The L-shaped columns showed torsional buckling under serviceability conditions. Therefore, they were replaced with box section profiles. Moreover, the stiffening of the ring positioned at the transition between upper and lower parts of the hopper was proposed. The seismic response is ruled by the mass of the contained solid. Then, a pushover analysis with a mass-proportional lateral force profile was conducted. The capacity curve is almost linear up to failure of the rings in {{the upper part of the}} walls. At this load level, the shell elements in the hopper have largely exceeded the elastic range. However, due to the proposed retrofitting, the seismic resistance is adequate...|$|E
50|$|Verandahs {{are located}} on the southeast, {{northwest}} and between the eastern and western wings. These have timber posts on masonry upstands with timber batten balustrade between, arched timber valance, raked boarded ceilings and timber floors. Arched panelled windows with central hopper sections, lighting the main court room, are located above the verandah line with deep curved timber eave brackets. Below these are French doors, with panelled glass <b>upper</b> portions and <b>hopper</b> fanlights, and casement windows opening onto the verandah.|$|R
