Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E
5|$|Another injury problem; {{this time}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just twogoals in 17games in the 1997–98 season.
