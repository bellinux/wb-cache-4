5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the <b>US,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites {{were thought to be}} responsible for about half the losses.|$|E

25|$|The {{signing of}} the Treaty of Paris in 1783 {{formally}} ended the war. Britain made several concessions to the Americans {{at the expense of}} the North American colonies. Notably, the borders between Canada and the United States were officially demarcated; all land south of the Great Lakes, which was formerly a part of the Province of Quebec and included modern day Michigan, Illinois and Ohio, was ceded to the Americans. Fishing rights were also granted to the United States in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the coast of Newfoundland and the Grand Banks. The British ignored part of the treaty and maintained their military outposts in the Great Lakes areas it had ceded to the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> continued to supply their native allies with munitions. The British evacuated the outposts with the Jay Treaty of 1795, but the continued supply of munitions irritated the Americans in the run-up to the War of 1812.|$|E

Fiji needed to qualify for the semi-finals to guarantee they would win the series. They qualified top of pool A and faced Wales in their quarter-final. Wales defeated Fiji in 21–14 in a major upset. [...] "Wales kept the ball well against <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> scored tries. They deserved to win," [...] Serevi said of the loss. New Zealand then won the tournament, making them the series champions after accumulating 130 points to Fiji's 128. On 6 July 2007, Serevi announced his resignation as coach of the national sevens team.|$|E

Kennan found his ambassadorship in Belgrade to be much improved from his experiences in Moscow a decade earlier. He commented, [...] "I was favored in being surrounded {{with a group of}} exceptionally able and loyal assistants, whose abilities I myself admired, whose judgment I valued, and whose attitude toward myself was at all times... enthusiastically cooperative... Who was I to complain?" [...] Kennan found the Yugoslav government treated the American diplomats politely, in contrast from {{the way in which the}} Russians treated him in Moscow. He wrote that the Yugoslavs [...] "considered me, rightly or wrongly, a distinguished person in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were pleased that someone whose name they had heard before was being sent to Belgrade".|$|E

500|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{was looking}} ever more tenuous {{and the idea}} of [...] "no {{independence}} before majority rule" [...] was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and [...] "go it alone". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of [...] "Southern Rhodesia first", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that [...] "trouble pays dividends". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, he said that if there were black MPs [...] "they will share the restaurant with <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by jowl with them, and what sort of legislation can {{the people of this country}} expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1980, {{alongside}} Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder, Cher {{wrote her}} last Casablanca disco recording, [...] "Bad Love", {{for the film}} Foxes. She formed the rock band Black Rose that year with her then-lover, guitarist Les Dudek. Although Cher was the lead singer, she did not receive top billing {{because she wanted to}} create the impression that all band members were equal. Since she was easily recognized when she performed with the band, she developed a punk look by cutting her trademark long hair. Despite appearances on television, the band failed to earn concert dates. Their album Black Rose received unfavorable reviews; Cher told Rolling Stone, [...] "The critics panned <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> didn't attack the record. They attacked me. It was like, 'How dare Cher sing rock & roll?'" [...] During the band's active period, Cher was simultaneously doing a residency show in Las Vegas, earning $300,000 a week. Its companion television special Cher... A Celebration at Caesars aired on Lifetime in April 1983. Black Rose disbanded in 1981. That year, she released a duet with musician Meat Loaf called [...] "Dead Ringer for Love", which reached number five on the UK Singles Chart and was later described by AllMusic's Donald A. Guarisco as [...] "one of the more inspired rock duets of the 1980s". In 1982, Columbia Records released the album I Paralyze, later deemed by Bego as Cher's [...] "strongest and most consistent solo album in years" [...] despite its low sales.|$|E

2500|$|On March 25, 2007, New York Daily News {{reported}} that an unnamed Queens drug dealer, after being arrested, alleged that Sean Bell had shot him {{the previous year}} on July 13, 2006, over a drug turf dispute. Police sources called the drug dealer's account credible but could {{not rule out the}} possibility that he falsely identified Sean Bell to garner favor with authorities. The attorney representing the Bell family, Nicole Paultre, and the two other occupants of the vehicle who were wounded during the shooting denounced this development, saying, [...] "We expected them to throw dirt at <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are throwing dirt at us." [...] NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau detectives say the dealer's tale has no direct bearing on the police shooting of Bell, though some legal experts have noted that it could help the defense by portraying Sean Bell as possibly armed and dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Cheney met Scott Owen at Jells Park Primary School {{and they}} began their career {{together}} in 1992, in a Melbourne band, The Runaway Boys, who took their name from a Stray Cats album, Runaway Boys – which Cheney cites {{as one of his}} favourites. The group was a covers band playing Stray Cats and The Clash material. In 1992 the group's first paying gig was at the Richmond Club Hotel and they soon followed with a residency at the nearby Corner Hotel. The Runaway Boys had a succession of drummers, [...] "The first two guys, Shane and Grant, were at high school with <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were never really into 1950s rock'n'roll. We were probably a bit pushy at that point. Grant was happy to play along, but then when high school finished he was ready to move on and go to university". Cheney also gigged on guitar in another band, Goodbye Sideburns Forever, though he was not recorded with them.|$|E

And that comradre with everybody, and hearing him singing our music, which was born and raised and produced and recorded in Memphis Tennessee. It was just something I, it's hard to explain the excitement coming from being on stage and that excitement coming out of the audience. It just filled our hearts. Because they really liked <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> really liked that good old Memphis music, and here's one of the biggest Idols singing that music.

He was replaced on bass by studio guitarist Jimmy Page, whom the Yardbirds had originally approached to replace Eric Clapton. Page's position as bassist was temporary and within a short while he switched to second lead guitarist alongside Jeff Beck, with rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja taking over on bass. In 1966, the Beck/Page dual lead guitar line-up produced the psychedelic [...] "Happenings Ten Years Time Ago", [...] "Psycho Daisies" [...] and [...] "Stroll On", the updated remake of [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] for their appearance in Michelangelo Antonioni's film Blow-Up.

She declared: [...] "Until the American Muslim community find it in their hearts to separate themselves from their evil, radical counterparts, to condemn those who want to destroy our civilization and will fight against them, we are not obligated to open our society to any of them." [...] Ben Lemming, a Democrat candidate for the same seat, was one of the few Tennessee politicians to support the mosque project, stating: [...] "The Americans that want to build this mosque are already our neighbors.
