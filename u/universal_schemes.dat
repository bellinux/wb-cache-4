For instance, in hash chaining, the expected time per operation is proportional to the sum of collision probabilities, which is the same for any <b>universal</b> <b>scheme</b> as it would be for truly random hash functions, and is constant whenever the load factor of the hash table is constant. Therefore, tabulation hashing can be used to compute hash functions for hash chaining with a theoretical guarantee of constant expected time per operation.|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} {{concern for}} policy-makers should be avoiding multiple disadvantages through the welfare state. The modernization of unemployment and pension systems towards more <b>universal</b> <b>schemes</b> {{would not only}} improve the socio-economic situation of temporary workers but also increase {{the legitimacy of the}} dual employment model. If society compensates temporary workers for their higher risk by offering decent and accessible social security, this could lessen feelings of political marginalization or exclusion. As the fiscal situation in most affected member states does not leave much leeway for social policy expansion, the politics necessary for such changes are complex and probably involve zero-sum conflicts. However, the recent Italian reforms towards more universal unemployment benefits demonstrate that these are not insurmountable hurdles.|$|E

This problem is strongly believed to be classically hard to simulate. We show that an analogous procedure implements the same problem, using photon-added or -subtracted squeezed vacuum states (with arbitrary squeezing), where sampling at the output is performed via parity measurements. The equivalence is exact and independent of the squeezing parameter, and hence provides an entire class of new quantum states {{of light in the}} same complexity class as boson sampling.

40|$|The {{order of}} letters {{is not always}} {{relevant}} in a communication task. This paper discusses the implications of order irrelevance on source coding, presenting results in several major branches of source coding theory: lossless coding, universal lossless coding, rate-distortion, high-rate quantization, and universal lossy coding. The main conclusions demonstrate {{that there is a}} significant rate savings when order is irrelevant. In particular, lossless coding of n letters from a finite alphabet requires Theta(log n) bits and universal lossless coding requires n + o(n) bits for many countable alphabet sources. However, there are no <b>universal</b> <b>schemes</b> that can drive a strong redundancy measure to zero. Results for lossy coding include distribution-free expressions for the rate savings from order irrelevance in various high-rate quantization schemes. Rate-distortion bounds are given, and it is shown that the analogue of the Shannon lower bound is loose at all finite rates. Comment: 35 page...|$|E

40|$|Aperiodic {{dynamical}} decoupling (DD) {{sequences of}} π pulses are {{of great interest}} to decoherence control and have been recently extended from single-qubit to two-qubit systems. If the environmental noise power spectrum is made available, then one may further optimize aperiodic DD sequences to reach higher efficiency of decoherence suppression than known <b>universal</b> <b>schemes.</b> This possibility is investigated in this work for the protection of two-qubit states, using an exactly solvable pure dephasing model including both local and nonlocal noise. The performance of optimized DD sequences in protecting two-qubit states is compared with that achieved by nested Uhrig's DD (nested-UDD) sequences, for several different types of noise spectrum. Except for cases with noise spectrum decaying slowly in the high-frequency regime, optimized DD sequences with tens of control pulses can perform orders of magnitude better than that of nested-UDD. A two-qubit system with highly unbalanced local noise is also examined to shed more light on a recent experiment. Possible experiments that may be motivated by this work are discussed.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} joint universal variable-rate lossy coding and identification for parametric classes of stationary β-mixing sources with general (Polish) alphabets. Compression performance is {{measured in terms of}} Lagrangians, while identification performance is measured by the variational distance between the true source and the estimated source. Provided that the sources are mixing at a sufficiently fast rate and satisfy certain smoothness and Vapnik–Chervonenkis learnability conditions, it is shown that, for bounded metric distortions, there exist <b>universal</b> <b>schemes</b> for joint lossy compression and identification whose Lagrangian redundancies converge to zero as p Vn log n/n as the block length n tends to infinity, where Vn is the Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension of a certain class of decision regions defined by the n-dimensional marginal distributions of the sources; furthermore, for each n, the decoder can identify n-dimensional marginal of the active source up to a ball of radius O (p Vn log n/n) in variational distance, eventually with probability one.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} securing a linear network coding system against an adversary that is both an eavesdropper and a jammer. The network is assumed to transport n packets from source to each receiver, and the adversary is allowed to eavesdrop on μ arbitrarily chosen links and also to inject up to t erroneous packets into the network. The goal {{of the system is}} to achieve zero-error communication that is information-theoretically secure from the adversary. Moreover, this goal must be attained in a universal fashion, i. e., regardless of the network topology or the underlying network code. An upper bound on the achievable rate under these requirements is shown to be n-μ- 2 t packets per transmission. A scheme is proposed that can achieve this maximum rate, for any n and any field size q, provided the packet length m is at least n symbols. The scheme is based on rank-metric codes and admits low-complexity encoding and decoding. In addition, the scheme is shown to be optimal {{in the sense that the}} required packet length is the smallest possible among all <b>universal</b> <b>schemes</b> that achieve the maximum rate.
