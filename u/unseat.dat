5|$|Despite {{benefiting from}} {{large numbers of}} {{campaign}} contributions from individual donors, and the efforts of tech-savvy supporters determined to keep his name a frequent topic of discussion on the internet, {{over the course of}} the campaign Paul was unable to translate the enthusiasm of his core supporters into large enough numbers of actual primary votes to <b>unseat</b> his rivals.|$|E
5|$|McCluskey's bid to <b>unseat</b> Kefalas was {{endorsed}} by the Denver Post, while Kefalas was {{endorsed by}} the Windsor Beacon and the Fort Collins Coloradoan.

5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and {{he did not want to}} risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to <b>unseat</b> Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{much needed}} representative sample data for reuse life of fully seated and torqued locknuts. Most national requirements for prevailing torque locking fasteners only specify <b>unseated</b> reuse life. This {{could create a}} potentially dangerous situation if <b>unseated</b> is misinterpreted for seated. This thesis provides comparative data for seated verses <b>unseated</b> configuration.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of restrainers is to prevent <b>unseating</b> of bridge spans. Pipe seat extenders are the {{preferred}} (and in some cases required) method of preventing <b>unseating</b> since they increase the relative displacement capacity of bridge frames.

He was elected for that constituency, without being <b>unseated,</b> in 1713 and served until 1715. He later served as Member of Parliament for Queenborough from 1722 to 1723.|$|R
5|$|Because of Barkley's role in {{crafting}} the Railway Labor Act, the Associated Railway Labor Organizations endorsed him to <b>unseat</b> Ernst {{even before}} he formally announced his candidacy on April 26, 1926. Since the 1923 gubernatorial contest, he had distanced himself from Haly and promised the conservatives {{that he would not}} push a ban on parimutuel betting if elected. Consequently, he had no opposition in the primary. Congressman (and later Chief Justice) Fred M. Vinson managed his general election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Despite Beckham's move to <b>unseat</b> McCreary in the Senate, the {{two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because he thought he could control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} at Gythium, Pythagoras had joined Nabis at Sparta, {{bringing}} with him 3,000 men from Argos. When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered {{he decided to}} send an envoy to Flamininus to open negotiations on {{the terms of a}} peace. Nabis offered to withdraw the rest of his garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners. Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and <b>unseat</b> Nabis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Unseating</b> of bridge spans due to {{excessive}} relative hinge opening {{is a common}} problem for bridges subjected to strong ground motion. Various <b>unseating</b> prevention devices have been developed in both the United States and Japan to try to {{reduce the likelihood of}} collapse due to <b>unseating.</b> This paper presents the results of the evaluation of <b>unseating</b> prevention devices using nitinol shape memory alloys (SMAs). Superelastic SMAs have the ability to remain elastic under very large deformations, due to a solid-state martensitic transformation. This unique property leads to enhanced performance of the adaptive superelastic <b>unseating</b> prevention device, compared with conventional devices used in the United States and Japan. To assess the effectiveness of the devices, nonlinear time history analyses are performed on a typical multiple frame reinforced concrete box girder bridge using a suite of representative ground motions. The results show that for multiple frame reinforced concrete box girder bridges the adaptive superelastic devices are very effective in limiting the relative hinge displacement and preventing <b>unseating,</b> compared with the conventional steel cable restrainers. 1...|$|R
5|$|Greeley resumed the editorship of the Tribune, {{but quickly}} learned {{there was a}} {{movement}} under way to <b>unseat</b> him. He found himself unable to sleep, and after a final visit to the Tribune on November 13 (a week after the election) remained under medical care. At the recommendation of a family physician, Greeley {{was sent to the}} asylum of Dr. George S. Choate at Pleasantville, New York. There, he continued to worsen, and died on November 29, with his two surviving daughters and Whitelaw Reid at his side.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential {{candidate}} {{of his party}} for the first time, but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP, who {{was supported by the}} ruling center-left coalition. Ahead of the 1976 elections, CDU chairman Helmut Kohl included him in his shadow cabinet for the party’s campaign to <b>unseat</b> incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor. Between 1979 and 1981, Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{the eastern}} {{departments}} pushed for greater autonomy, but Morales' government rejected {{the legitimacy of}} their position. They called for a referendum on recalling Morales, which saw an 83% turnout and in which Morales was ratified with 67.4% of the vote. Unified as the National Council for Democracy (CONALDE), these groups – financed by the wealthy agro-industrialist, petroleum, and financial elite – embarked {{on a series of}} destabilisation campaigns to <b>unseat</b> Morales' government.|$|E

Siding with the revolutionary forces after the Chinese Revolution, he joined Brig. Cai E in the October 1911 expeditionary force that marched on Qing forces in Sichuan. He served as a regimental commander in the campaign to <b>unseat</b> Yuan Shikai in 1915-16. When Cai became governor of Sichuan after Yuan's death in June 1916, Zhu was made a brigade commander.|$|E
5|$|Realising the Conservative {{governance}} of Lambeth Borough council {{was hard to}} <b>unseat,</b> Livingstone aided Eddie Lopez in reaching out {{to members of the}} local populace disenfranchised from the traditional Labour leadership. Associating with the leftist Schools' Action Union (SAU) founded {{in the wake of the}} 1968 student protests, he encouraged members of the Brixton branch of the Black Panther Party to join Labour. His involvement in the SAU led to his dismissal from the PFTCC student's union, who disagreed with politicising secondary school pupils.|$|E
5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave {{the door open for}} a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to <b>unseat</b> Gaddafi.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States Senator from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, The New York Times alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to <b>unseat</b> Sam Hoyt in the New York State Assembly.|$|E

In 1961 and 1964, he was appointed to the state board of education. He served as a delegate to an assembly to revise the state constitution in 1964. In 1965, the University of Kentucky honored him with a Centennial Award and inducted him into its Hall of Distinguished Alumni. He died February 7, 1970 in Richmond, Kentucky, and is buried in Richmond Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{district}} court judge Ricardo Rodriguez campaigned to <b>unseat</b> Guerra as district attorney, and the Garza case arose as a campaign issue.

In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take a new look at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E

5|$|In early 1947, Quwatli and the National Party, {{the largest}} party in parliament, made an {{amendment}} to the constitution to enable Quwatli to seek re-election. The move was met by strong disapproval from rival Syrian parties and opposition politicians, and a campaign to <b>unseat</b> Quwatli in the next presidential election was commenced. Quwatli's allies won 24 out of 127 seats during the 1947 parliamentary election, the first in post-independence Syria, while the opposition won 53 seats and independents unaffiliated with any political party won 50. A number of Quwatli's allies defected from the National Party and former president Atassi retired from politics because of his frustration at Quwatli's handling of Syrian internal affairs. Quwatli tasked Jamil Mardam Bey to form a new cabinet in October, which included mostly pro-Western politicians.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election the party lost the gains {{it had made}} according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to <b>unseat</b> the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg {{and replace it with}} a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the political differences too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.|$|E
5|$|In the West, {{however, the}} loose {{ends of the}} Diocletianic {{settlement}} were about to bring the whole Tetrarchic tapestry down. Constantine, son of Constantius, and Maxentius, son of Maximian, had been overlooked in the Diocletianic succession, offending the parents and angering the sons. Constantine, against Galerius's will, succeeded his father on July 25, 306. He immediately ended any ongoing persecutions and offered Christians full restitution {{of what they had}} lost under the persecution. This declaration gave Constantine the opportunity to portray himself as a possible liberator of oppressed Christians everywhere. Maxentius, meanwhile, had seized power in Rome on October 28, 306, and soon brought toleration to all Christians within his realm. Galerius made two attempts to <b>unseat</b> Maxentius, but failed both times. During the first campaign against Maxentius, Severus was captured, imprisoned, and executed.|$|E
