40|$|Summary: Insulin, C-peptide and {{proinsulin}} {{were measured}} in peripheral blood of 11 patients suffering from {{different types of}} hormone-producing pancreatic B-cell tumours. While proinsulin was elevated in 10 / 11 patients during prolonged fasting, C-peptide and insulin levels were found within the reference ränge in 5 / 11 and 3 / 5 cases respectively. A rapid insulin assay performed during surgery was helpful for localisation and identification of the respective tumours. B-Zellpeptide als Kenngrößen zur Diagnostik und Lokalisation von Insulinomen Zusammenfassung: Insulin, C-Peptid und Proinsulin wurden bei 11 Patienten mit unterschiedlichen Formen von B-Zelltumoren gemessen. Proinsulin fand sich in 10 / 11 Patienten, C-Peptid in 5 / 11 und Insulin in 2 / 5 Fällen erhöht. Ein intraoperativ durchgeführter Insulinschnelltest erwies sich als hilfreich zur Lokalisation und Identifikation der entsprechenden Tumoren.

40|$|Sleep, {{depression}} and insomnia have manifold associations. Psychiatric sleep research in affective disorders {{has demonstrated that}} sleep in depression is characterized by an impairment of sleep continuity, deficits in slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of REM sleep (including shortened REM latency and increased REM density). Traditionally, insomnia, i. e. prolonged latency to fall asleep and increased frequency of nocturnal wake periods, was considered as an <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptom</b> of affective disorders. In the meantime, a shift in clinical and scientific focus has taken place viewing insomnia in addition as an independent diagnostic entity and as a clinical predictor of depression. Unfortunately, the neurobiological processes underlying the relationships between sleep, insomnia and depression have not been fully identified yet. It is clear that both insomnia and depression are characterized by alterations in the arousal system in the CNS presenting as hyperarousal. Moreover, insomniac patients display reduced and fragmented REM sleep periods, which might interfere negatively with basal processes of emotion regulation. The alterations in the arousal system and the interaction of it with the affect-regulatory system {{over the course of}} time might influence cognitive systems and hence lead to the clinical picture of depression. Given the suggestion of insomnia symptoms as possibly involved in the causation and the maintenance of psychopathology in general, this type of sequence might also be found in relation to other mental disorders...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of fatigue scales exist {{and there is no}} {{consensus}} on which fatigue measuring scales that are most appropriate for use in assessment of fatigue in different diseases. We aimed to describe the use of fatigue scales in studies of disease-related fatigue during the last three decades. We searched databases from 1975 to 2004 for original studies reporting on disease-related fatigue and extracted information on method used to assess fatigue, diseases under study and year of publication. A total of 2285 papers reported measures of fatigue in chronic non-acute diseases of which 80 % were published during the last decade. We identified 252 different ways to measure fatigue, of which 150 were use only once. Multi-symptom scales (n = 156) were used in 670 studies, while 71 scales specifically designed to measure fatigue were applied in 416 studies. The majority of these studies used scales with a multidimensional approach to fatigue, and most studies used scales that were disease-specific or only applied to few different diseases. Research in disease-related fatigue has increased exponentially during the last three decades, even if we adjust for the general increase in publishing activity. The number of scales has also increased and the majority of scales were developed for specific diseases. There is need for measure instruments with different sizes and dimensionality, and due to ceiling and floor effects, the same scale may not be useful for patients with different severity of fatigue. However, since fatigue is an <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptom</b> there should not be need for adopting disease specific fatigue scales for each individual disease. There may be differences in characteristics of fatigue between diseases and generic measurement instruments may facilitate documentation of such differences, which may be of clinical importance...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recently, a {{possible}} correlation between atypical femur fractures and long-term use of bisphosphonates has been found. Thigh pain and radiographic skeletal changes are possible prodromal symptoms and findings. Objective:The {{aim of the}} current study was to elucidate if prodromal thigh pain could be {{could be used as a}} screening tool to find patients at high risk of atypical femoral fractures in patients with low BMD measured by the Osteoporosis centre at the Orthopaedic department of Oslo University Hospital Ullevål. Methods: All available DEXA-data at Oslo University Hospital Ullevål were collected. We included patients who had T-score equal to or lower than - 2. 5 and searched their journals for available information on fracture history, drug history, bisphosphonate use, and DEXA-data. Patients were interviewed by telephone in order to complete the data. We used multivariable binary logistic regression and Pearson’s Chi-Square test to test correlation between thigh pain and other factors. Results DEXA-data provided us with 338 patients, of which 120 were included. 9 patients reported thigh pain, of which one already had experienced an atypical femur fracture. The other patients had pain related to other illnesses. Specificity of bone pain is 11 %. We found a correlation between thigh pain and age (p = 0. 003, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 13) but no correlation to length of bisphosphonate use (p = 0. 112, 95 % CI 0. 99 - 1. 07), nor other drugs affecting bone metabolism (p = 0. 196, 95 % CI 0. 48 - 35. 49). Conclusion: Thigh pain asked by telephone is an <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptom.</b> Previous studies imply that caution should be maintained when the duration of bisphosphonate therapy exceeds 4 - 5 years. Examination of bone mineral density should be performed, the continuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be re-evaluated and the physician should consult the patient regarding thigh pain. Patients should also be informed about atypical femur fractures so that they can contact a physician for clinical and radiographic examination if thigh pain occurs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA 51 -year-old man {{developed}} symptoms (palpitations) {{related to}} a large left atrial mass attached to interatrial septum discovered by trans-thoracic heart ultrasonography. Six months earlier this patient had undergone radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an atrial flutter substrate. The left atrial mass was removed surgically using cardiopulmonary bypass with disappearance of symptoms. A post-operative diagnosis of atrial myxoma was made. The present case shows that a big left-atrial tumor could manifest with only mild <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptoms</b> such as palpitations. It {{is not clear whether}} the development of myxomas could be related to RFA or occurrence of heart tumors after RFA (already reported in medical literature) or whether it could be just chance without a causal link with ablation procedures. <Learning objective: It is essential to consider myxoma in the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses identified in patients after radiofrequency ablation since some cases of myxoma development after radiofrequency ablation have recently been described in the literature. Transthoracic echocardiography is a precise technique in the evaluation of cardiac masses, but a high index of clinical suspicion is necessary in order to define intracardiac pathologies that could be missed for <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptoms</b> of presentation. ...|$|R
40|$|In Scandinavia, tick-borne infections {{affecting}} humans include Lyme borreliosis (LB), {{tick-borne encephalitis}} (TBE) and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). Each of these infections can present with <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptoms.</b> In this prospective clinical study, we recruited patients {{based on two}} independent inclusion criteria; 1) patients with <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptoms,</b> i. e. fever (≥ 38. 0 ˚C) or a history of feverishness and/or any combination of headache, myalgia or arthralgia and 2) patients with erythema migrans (EM), following an observed tick bite or tick exposure within one month prior to onset of symptoms. A total of 206 patients fulfilled the study. Among these, we could identify 186 cases of LB (174 with EM), 18 confirmed and two probable cases of HGA and two cases of TBE. Thirteen of the HGA cases presented without fever. Furthermore, 22 of the EM patients had a sub-clinical co-infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, based on serology.

Neuroborreliosis may present with <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptoms</b> and signs and often remains difficult to diagnose in patients with central nervous system symptoms, particularly if the pathognomonic erythema chronica migrans does not develop or is missed. Thus, vigilance is mandatory in cases with atypical presentation {{of the disease and}} with potentially severe consequences if not recognized early. We present a patient with neuroborreliosis demonstrating brain stem and vestibular nerve abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed T 2 -weighted hyperintense signal alterations in the pons and in the vestibular nerves as well as bilateral post-contrast enhancement of the vestibular nerves. Serologic testing of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. CONCLUSION: Patients infected with neuroborreliosis may present with <b>unspecific</b> neurologic <b>symptoms</b> and magnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive imaging tool showing signal abnormalities in the brain stem and nerve root enhancement may help in establishing the diagnosis...|$|R
