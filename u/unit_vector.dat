5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E
5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper {{right corner of the}} diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing the sum of the vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E

25|$|<b>Unit</b> <b>vectors</b> enable two {{convenient}} identities: the {{dot product}} of two <b>unit</b> <b>vectors</b> yields the cosine (which may be positive or negative) of the angle {{between the two}} <b>unit</b> <b>vectors.</b> The magnitude of the cross product of the two <b>unit</b> <b>vectors</b> yields the sine (which will always be positive).|$|R

25|$|A <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> is any vector with {{a length}} of one; {{normally}} unit vectors are used simply to indicate direction. A vector of arbitrary length can be divided by its length to create a <b>unit</b> <b>vector.</b> This is known as normalizing a vector. A <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> is often indicated with a hat as in â.|$|E
25|$|The {{trajectory}} at {{a position}} s has one tangent <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> s that invariably {{points in the}} direction of growing s’s, as well as one <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> n, perpendicular to s, that points towards the local centre of curvature O.|$|E

25|$|A 1-frame in Fn {{is nothing}} but a <b>unit</b> <b>vector,</b> so the Stiefel {{manifold}} V1(Fn) is just the unit sphere in Fn.|$|E
25|$|Let r(t) be a vector that {{describes}} {{the position of a}} point mass as a function of time. Since we are assuming circular motion, let r(t) = R·ur, where R is a constant (the radius of the circle) and ur is the <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> pointing from the origin to the point mass. The direction of ur is described by θ, the angle between the x-axis and the <b>unit</b> <b>vector,</b> measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. The other <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> for polar coordinates, uθ is perpendicular to ur and points in the direction of increasing θ. These polar unit vectors can be expressed in terms of Cartesian unit vectors in the x and y directions, denoted i and j respectively: and uθ depend on θ, and so in general have non-zero time derivatives.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{magnitude}} of the cross product goes by the sine of the angle between its arguments, the cross product {{can be thought of as}} a measure of perpendicularity in the same way that the dot product is a measure of parallelism. Given two <b>unit</b> <b>vectors,</b> their cross product has a magnitude of 1 if the two are perpendicular and a magnitude of zero if the two are parallel. The dot product of two <b>unit</b> <b>vectors</b> behaves just oppositely: it is zero when the <b>unit</b> <b>vectors</b> are perpendicular and 1 if the <b>unit</b> <b>vectors</b> are parallel.|$|R

25|$|Treating a grain {{boundary}} geometrically as an interface {{of a single}} crystal cut into two parts, {{one of which is}} rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a {{grain boundary}}. The first two numbers come from the <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> that is normal to this plane).|$|E
25|$|N is {{the normal}} <b>unit</b> <b>vector,</b> the {{derivative}} of T {{with respect to}} the arclength parameter of the curve, divided by its length.|$|E

25|$|A similar method, called axis-angle representation, {{describes}} a rotation or orientation using a <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> {{aligned with the}} rotation axis, and a separate value to indicate the angle (see figure).|$|E
