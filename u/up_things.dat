It is no place for those want to evade conscription in their own country. The Gardens was built for many things, but not for picking <b>up</b> <b>things</b> that no one else wants."

500|$|Parker and Stone said {{a number}} of Cartman's {{characteristics}} which have endured throughout the South Park series started in [...] "Damien".

Some of his regular vocal mannerisms were also developed in the episode, including his use of the sound [...] "Nyah" [...] while saying the word [...] "Here", and the way he says [...] "Hey you guuuuuuys" [...] while talking to his friends. Parker, who provides the voice of Cartman, said the characteristics came about naturally while filming the episode: [...] "This show for some reason, for whatever reason, maybe I just lost interest, but I was trying all these messed <b>up</b> <b>things</b> with him and all these things sort of stuck." ...|$|E
500|$|Dutch {{journalist}} Michiel Jongsma {{suggests that}} Kieftenbeld's position {{of choice is}} as a holding midfielder {{in front of the}} defence, where he can best use his energy in recovering the ball. He is comfortable on the ball and able to distribute it, but can be careless in possession, and [...] "he really tries to shake <b>up</b> <b>things</b> when the play has gone dormant. In that lies his weakness as wellhe can pick up silly fouls and cards from time to time." [...] With Groningen, he averaged eight yellow cards a season. According to Groningen's technical director Henk Veldmate, speaking in 2014, his battling style and never-say-die attitude made him the sort of player with whom supporters could identify. In a 2011 interview, Kieftenbeld described himself as a perfectionist who always wanted to improve, and said that he sometimes put too much pressure on himself.|$|E

500|$|Journalists {{noted the}} tracks' {{instrumentations}} of guitars, bass guitar, drums, vocoded, robotic and female vocals, and synthesizers used to emulate orchestral instruments, and well as compositional {{elements of a}} variety of complex builds. Downes said that he used five synthesizers in making The Age of Plastic, which were used to [...] "fake <b>up</b> <b>things</b> and to provide effects we won’t use them in the manner that somebody like John Foxx does." [...] According to Horn: [...] "We used about three different drummers including one from Landscape and Johnny Richardson from The Rubettes, who’s really good. We also used the occasional session guitarist to play various bits and there were three or four girl singers involved. Apart from that, we did everything ourselves." [...] Downes claimed of using George Shearing's trick of doubling melody lines in block chords very heavily on some of the songs.|$|E

Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E
