40|$|During {{last two}} decades Czech {{agriculture}} has gone through significant changes: the transition of agriculture in the 1990 s and {{the entrance of the}} Czech Republic into the EU and its commitment to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Both of these changes contributed to the structural and regional differentiation of Czech agriculture and exposed it to competition with the whole of Europe. Furthermore, CAP exposed Czech agriculture to <b>uneven</b> <b>conditions</b> for farmers within the EU. The most significant results of these changes have been a decrease in the agricultural sector output, a reduction in farm animals bred, and shrinkage of arable land. On the other hand, many non-productive and non-agricultural activities in the rural areas are subsidised, which offers farmers new possibilities of development.

40|$|Chinese feminist cinema in the postsocialist era {{is shaped}} by the grand {{narrative}} of nation building that glamorizes urban professional career women and their contributions to economic marketization and globalization.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of removing organic pollutants from wastewater in a household wastewater treatment plant with a hybrid reactor. The efficiency of the plant was analysed in terms of decreasing BOD 5, COD and the content of total suspended solids in differentiated technological conditions. The variable parameter was the length of the reactor aeration phase and the dwell phase. Six different aeration variants were analysed. The efficiency of a wastewater treatment plant with a hybrid reactor in terms of reducing BOD 5 oscillated from 81 to 90 %, COD – 64 – 84 %, whereas total suspended solids – 66 – 89 % which, as a rule, was not sufficient to achieve standard levels. The best results were achieved for the following variants: 2 h aeration – 2 h dwell and 1 h aeration – 0. 5 h dwell.

40|$|Concentrating and {{extending}} urbanisation processes include changes in networks, decision-making and growth premises, and may reflect and generate <b>uneven</b> <b>conditions</b> for stability and change. Vulnerable situations can appear both {{in areas of}} economic growth and in so-called declining environments, and are defined here as fragile urban landscapes: local-regional spatial situations that suffer from inability for adaptation and transformation, with substantial consequences {{for the development of}} potentials and synergy effects in sustaining social, political and economic processes in societal change. This research project has developed through extensive collaboration with local-regional planning practice in the Skaraborg region in Sweden. Urban planning needs concepts to describe and rethink current socio-spatial processes of urbanisation, and tools that support re-negotiation of the urban landscape in its full spectrum and from a multitude of centralities to implement relevant and resource-efficient change. With an architectural, design-driven planning approach this paper argues that Urban Ecologies can be made operative as complex productive configurations to clarify urban processes, identify assemblages of relevant contingencies and meaning for specific situations, reveal local-regional potentials and identify interventions that combine or re-combine available local-regional resources. The process of articulating Urban Ecologies is propelled by, and interacts with, specific strategic interventions to enhance combined resources and tackle uneven geographies – here named Key Urban Projects. These projects operate as complementary planning tools that: 1) identify and develop strategic interventions and mappings; 2) constitute bridges between planning and implementation at different scales; 3) establish platforms for critical negotiation that assemble available public and private resources, skills and relevant stakeholders This knowledge-production needs a design thinking that builds and rebuilds assemblages but also contains a productive and relational perspective on the material and physical landscape [...] Through theoretical frameworks and empirical cases, the paper discusses how fragile urban landscapes can be addressed and developed. Particular interest is set on roles, functions and responsibilities of local and regional actors, stressing structural, political, discursive and situation-specific initiatives that can trigger change in material, topologic and relational qualities on both local and regional scales, in order to enhance resilience and adaptatio...|$|E

40|$|Session 8 a: The Ever Popular Monstrous MothersThis {{paper will}} examine matricide and the mother-as-murderer in an {{acclaimed}} Chinese {{film of the}} late twentieth-century to probe the emergent connections between discourse of law and the neoliberal subject in postsocialist modernity. THE DAY THE SUN TURNED COLD (Yim Ho, 1995) as an art film departs from the self-exoticizing rural narratives in Chinese cinema in which female infidelity serves as a locus for visual and affective seduction of global spectators. While drawing certain recurrent features from these rural narratives, this film raises the specter of male fantasy of female infidelity and female criminality as the problematic basis of law in a neoliberal economy. Taking a post-nationalist approach that contextualizes the film in the <b>uneven</b> <b>conditions</b> of modernity, this paper will examine the paradox of criminal (m) other and matricentricity in relation to its overt emphasis on the angst and dilemmas facing an ethical subject of natural, social and state law in China. Zhang Yimou’s STORY OF QIU JU (1993) has told {{the tale of a}} stubborn but naïve rural woman in pursuit of justice by negotiating a state system of arbitration and the courts that are beyond her understanding. The DAY THE SUN TURNED COLD enacts domestic violence and its aftermath for the mother-son relationship instead to consciously probe the inter-generational, social and legal implications of amoral motherhood. Drawing certain components from the narratives of primitive passion, this film has adopted a memory framework, an ancient gong-an fiction (legal case fiction) inflected with Freudian overtones, a migrant’s trauma of underdevelopment, and an unsentimental approach to problematize the link between matricide and law. My discussion will consider the limits of gendered evil and the film’s self-conscious questioning of law and matricide. It will relate this questioning to the current controversies in the realm of law-mediated contestation of abuse of everyday rights. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 3 rd Global Conference on Evil, Women and the Feminine, Warsaw, Poland, 13 - 15 May 2011...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} trenchless plough {{drainage}} implement {{has increased}} {{in the past few}} years due to its efficiency and cost advantages over other methods. However, the performance of these machines when working in fields with irregular soil conditions is not yet satisfactory. It is important therefore to study the soil parameters and conditions which could affect the implement behaviour under these circumstances. Therefore, a detailed investigation of the soil reaction forces acting upon a scale model of the trenchless plough was conducted under controlled conditions in a soil laboratory. The model was tested first under restricted conditions of movement, in order to observe and determine all the possible soil reaction forces. The tine, due to its geometric characteristics, was classified as a very narrow tine, and an existing model to predict the soil reaction force acting on the front face of these tines was extended to predict the forces on the sides. Since the length of the failure plane ahead of the tine is often required in the investigation of the soil reaction forces, a mathematical solution based on the Coulomb principle of Passive Earth Pressure was presented to estimate the soil failure pattern. There was good agreement between the values of the angle of the shear plane predicted by this method and the experimental data obtained from the glass sided tank tests. Dynamic tests were conducted with the implement assembled with a long floating beam arrangement assisted by a small link (free-link), used between the hitch-point and the pivoted end of the beam. These tests revealed that, when working over irregular soil conditions a better grade control can be obtained if the hitch-point is kept at constant level in reference to a desired line. In the case where field irregularities persist for long (step inputs), corrections in the hitch-point height might be necessary. These tests show that the implement depth changes in different proportion in relation to the hitch-point height. Where no control is imposed on the hitch-point, the path of the implement is attenuated in relation to the hitch-point position, where better results are obtained for high frequency of the hitch-point. A mathematical solution based on these findings and on the dynamic balance of the forces acting on the system was presented. Since it is an interactive method and requires long and repetitive calculations, a computer programme was developed and used to predict the response of the implement under these <b>uneven</b> <b>conditions.</b> Good agreement between data and estimated values suggested that the method is acceptable...|$|E

40|$|This project proposes and applies a {{research}} strategy to understand types of cities using {{the case study}} of Bogotá. This strategy combines a conceptual framework developed around the notion of ‘centrality’ and ‘urban semiotics’ {{as a method of}} qualitative enquiry in order to comprehend complex spatial arrangements as significant constituents of cultural geographies. In this sense, this study problematizes current tendencies such as spatial fragmentation and challenges the argument that contemporary urban ensembles in Latin America are either homogenized within globalization trends or illegible entities with no structural coherence. Bogotá is addressed as an instrumental case study to redraw generalizations developed from different methodological frameworks about the configuration process of spatial structures and their significance within the Latin American geography. Thus the study questions how urban centrality has evolved as an essential socio-cultural phenomenon and in this manner decodes the messages transmitted by main spatial arrangements. As a first step, the study discusses the construction of spatial meaning and its structural interpretation. In addition, the concept of centrality is examined in depth and an urban centrality typology is introduced to enable the analysis of spatial structures in socio-cultural terms. These contents are followed by the discussion of the existing approaches to the topic and their limitations. Subsequently, this research reconstructs the configuration of Bogotá’s spatial structure which is decoded in the last chapter. The study concludes that the highly fragmented and <b>uneven</b> <b>condition</b> of urban space in Latin America can be read. The case study of Bogotá substantiates that there is a code that paradoxically provides spatial cohesiveness within unstable socio-spatial hierarchies. Such a spatial code is deciphered through the reading of Bogotá’s spatial structure whose super-centre denotes ‘the sacralisation of authoritarianism’. This is a ‘structural meaning’ related to a specific or intrinsic logic of spatial concentration that is useful for the further discussion of socio-spatial patterns and the meanings of Latin American cities. The concluding remarks integrate the main arguments and outline lines of action in spatial planning processes...|$|R
