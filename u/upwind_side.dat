40|$|International audienceComplex {{interactions}} between katabatic winds and the cryosphere {{may lead to}} the formation of sedimentation waves at the surface of ice sheets. These have been first described and named snow megadunes in Antarctica. Here we use topographic data, optical images, subsurface radar soundings and spectroscopic data acquired by Mars orbiters, to show that the surface of the Martian North Polar Cap displays two superimposed sets of sedimentation waves with differing wavelengths. These sedimentation waves have similarities with Antarctic snow megadunes regarding their surface morphology, texture, grain size asymmetry, and internal stratigraphic architecture. Both sets of Martian sedimentation waves present young ice and occasional sastrugi fields, indicative of net accumulation, on their shallow-dipping <b>upwind</b> <b>sides,</b> their tops and the intervening troughs. Old layers of dusty ice, indicative of net ablation, are exhumed on the steep-dipping downwind sides of the larger waves. Smooth surfaces of coarse-grained ice, indicative of reduced accumulation associated with sublimation metamorphism, cover the steep-dipping downwind sides of the smaller waves. These surface characteristics and the internal stratigraphy revealed by radar soundings are consistent with the interpretation that both sets of Martian sedimentation waves grow and migrate upwind in response to the development of periodic accumulation/ablation patterns controlled by katabatic winds. The recognition of these sedimentation waves provides the basis {{for the development of a}} common model of ice/wind interaction at the surface of Martian and terrestrial glaciers. Martian smaller waves, characterized by reduced net accumulation on their downwind sides, are analogous to Antarctic snow megadunes that have been described so far. A terrestrial equivalent remains to be discovered for the larger Martian waves, characterized by net ablation on their downwind sides. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wind {{turbine blades}} are {{structurally}} composed {{of different types}} of materials. Some of which include; wood and/or steel used for constructing the main-spar and glass reinforced plastic (GRP) for building the downwind and <b>upwind</b> <b>sides</b> of the blade. During manufacture and over the operation lifetime of wind turbine blades, they are subject to defects and degradation which can result to deformation/fault occurrence (such as cracks) and subsequent failure. The wide-spread of materials used in their construction makes it difficult for predictions on lifetime health to be made, thus the importance of condition monitoring. Condition monitoring of wind turbines is an effective method for improving the maintenance and subsequent operation of wind turbine systems. In this paper, non-destructive evaluations were conducted using vibration/modal analysis, low-cost MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) accelerometers and signal processing techniques to detect defects and variations in the health of small wind turbine blades. A healthy (new) and an unhealthy (old) Rutland 913 Windcharger blade were tested in a small scale experiment and comparisons were made. Results showed that the presence of a crack and the overall deterioration in the structural health of the old blade increased its modal frequency from that of the new blade and an edge crack decreased the local stiffness of the wind turbine blade. Experiments were conducted on a 4. 5 m blade to show how the results extend to larger blades. In conclusion, these low-cost accelerometers have the ability to detect high and low blade resonance frequencies and have the potential to be integrated easily either retrofitted externally or embedded in blades at manufacture for condition monitoring at marginal cost. Keywords- condition monitoring, small turbine blades, vibration testing, MEMS accelerometers. ...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{advances}} in sensor networks and remote sensing technologies, the acquisition and storage rates of meteorological and climatological data increases {{every day and}} ask for novel and efficient processing algorithms. A fundamental problem of data analysis and modeling is the spatial prediction of meteorological variables in complex orography, which serves among others to extended climatological analyses, for the assimilation of data into numerical weather prediction models, for preparing inputs to hydrological models and for real time monitoring and short-term forecasting of weather. In this thesis, a new framework for spatial estimation is proposed {{by taking advantage of}} a class of algorithms emerging from the statistical learning theory. Nonparametric kernel-based methods for nonlinear data classification, regression and target detection, known as support vector machines (SVM), are adapted for mapping of meteorological variables in complex orography. With the advent of high resolution digital elevation models, the field of spatial prediction met new horizons. In fact, by exploiting image processing tools along with physical heuristics, an incredible number of terrain features which account for the topographic conditions at multiple spatial scales can be extracted. Such features are highly relevant for the mapping of meteorological variables because they control a considerable part of the spatial variability of meteorological fields in the complex Alpine orography. For instance, patterns of orographic rainfall, wind speed and cold air pools are known to be correlated with particular terrain forms, e. g. convex/concave surfaces and <b>upwind</b> <b>sides</b> of mountain slopes. Kernel-based methods are employed to learn the nonlinear statistical dependence which links the multidimensional space of geographical and topographic explanatory variables to the variable of interest, that is the wind speed as measured at the weather stations or the occurrence of orographic rainfall patterns as extracted from sequences of radar images. Compared to low dimensional models integrating only the geographical coordinates, the proposed framework opens a way to regionalize meteorological variables which are multidimensional in nature and rarely show spatial auto-correlation in the original space making the use of classical geostatistics tangled. The challenges which are explored during the thesis are manifolds. First, the complexity of models is optimized to impose appropriate smoothness properties and reduce the impact of noisy measurements. Secondly, a multiple kernel extension of SVM is considered to select the multiscale features which explain most of the spatial variability of wind speed. Then, SVM target detection methods are implemented to describe the orographic conditions which cause persistent and stationary rainfall patterns. Finally, the optimal splitting of the data is studied to estimate realistic performances and confidence intervals characterizing the uncertainty of predictions. The resulting maps of average wind speeds find applications within renewable resources assessment and opens a route to decrease the temporal scale of analysis to meet hydrological requirements. Furthermore, the maps depicting the susceptibility to orographic rainfall enhancement can be used to improve current radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation and forecasting systems and to generate stochastic ensembles of precipitation fields conditioned upon the orography...|$|R

40|$|Between 1990 and 1994, 19 {{flights were}} {{performed}} {{with a highly}} instrumented research aircraft in and around an industrialized region in eastern Germany to study horizontal transport and temporal trends of air pollutants after the time of German unification. Besides the dolphin flight path for vertical screening of the boundary layer, a mapping flight path at 150 m above ground was employed. The meteorological conditions severely limited the interpretability of the data sets in many cases. We found those data that were gained during conditions with a stable boundary layer can not be utilized for emission flux computations or trend analyses. Also, in cases with a neutrally stratified or convective boundary layer, the data sets were of complex structure which hindered the application of parametric statistical tools. Therefore, any meaningful emission fluxes could not be decuded from data sets that were measured in short distance to the emission sources.

40|$|The Columbia River tidal plume or {{near-field}} {{is formed}} twice daily by the ebb outflow of the Columbia River. It {{is a part}} of a larger, anticyclonic plume bulge, which in turn is embedded in far-field plume and coastal waters. Because of the mixing caused directly and indirectly by plume fronts, the interaction of the tidal plume and bulge with the California Current upwelling regime plays a vital role in coastal productivity on the Oregon and Washington shelves. The tidal plume is initially supercritical with respect to the internal Froude number on all stronger ebbs. It is separated from the plume bulge by a front, whose properties are very different under upwelling vs. downwelling conditions. Under summer upwelling conditions, this front is sharp and narrow (only 50 - 100 m wide on its <b>upwind</b> or northern <b>side)</b> and marks a transition from supercritical to subcritical flow for 6 - 12 hours after high water. This sharp front is a source of turbulent mixing, despite the strong stratification. Because the tidal plume may overlie newly upwelled waters, these fronts can mix nutrients into the plume, enhancing primary productivity. Symmetry would suggest {{that there should be a}} sharp front south of the estuary mouth under summer downwelling conditions. Instead, the downwelling tidal plume front is usually broad (up to several km) and diffuse on the upstream side. Less mixing occurs, and the water immediately below the plume consists of old plume and surface ocean waters, both low in nutrients. There is also a second up-welling-downwelling asymmetry. Supercritical upwelling plume fronts often generate solitons trains as they slow and transition to a subcritical state. These soliton trains contribute to vertical mixing in the plume bulge and have a non-zero Stokes drift so that they transport low-salinity water across the tidal plume into the plume bulge. Under downwelling conditions, soliton forma-tion is uncommon. Moreover, solition formation almost always begins on the south side of the plume so that the front 2 ̆ 2 unzips 2 ̆ 2 from south to north. This implies that a frontal transition from supercritical to subcritical conditions first occurs on the south side tidal plume, regardless of whether this is the <b>upwind</b> or downwind <b>side</b> of the plume. This contribution describes and analyzes these two asymmetries using vessel data, SAR images and a vorticity analysis. Internal Froude number and plume depth are key parameters in distinguishing the upwelling and downwelling situations, and the observed asymmetries can be explained in terms of potential vorticity conservation. The tidal outflow embeds relative vorticity in the emerging tidal plume water mass. This vorticity controls the transition of the tidal plume front to a subcritical state and the timing and location of internal wave generation by plume fronts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a joint numerical and experimental investigation of flame lift-off and stabilization mechanisms in heavy-duty diesel engines. The injection strategy, employing different nozzle configurations, allows for quantification {{of the impact}} of varying inter-jet angle spacing in the presence of swirl. For this purpose, three different inter-jet angles are chosen in this study; 45 °, 90 ° and 135 °. Large-eddy simulations are performed utilizing a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for n-heptane to resolve the turbulent fuel and air mixing and to capture the important species surrounding the ignition and flame-fronts to describe the flame stabilization process. Measurements are carried out for OH chemiluminescence to identify the flame lift-off position in an optical accessible engine. In general, the swirl flow in the ambient air shows a great impact on the lift-off, with a 15 % difference in the lift-off lengths on the <b>upwind</b> and downwind <b>side</b> of the jet. The LES results show that important ignition reactions undergo in a broad region in front of the lift-off position. With decreasing inter-jet angle, it is shown that the impact of transportation of hot products from adjacent jets becomes more prominent.

The electrostatic effects of the ions are analysed theoretically {{and the results of}} simultaneous measurements of {{the potential}} gradient on the <b>upwind</b> and downwind <b>side</b> of an artificial point, wind speed, wind direction and temperature gradient reported. It is concluded that for distances {{from the base of the}} point less than √ 3 h times the height of the point and excluding conditions of snow and very heavy rain the electro-static field of the ion stream can be computed on the assumption that the ions take up an infinite line distribution. These conclusions are then applied to measurements made on a line of trees at Durham University Observatory and around a sycamore tree at the Durham City Golf course. The results for the line of trees indicate a change in point discharge characteristic with season; for the sycamore tree the current down the tree was found to be less than 1 μa for a potential gradient of + 7, 000 V/m. The changes of characteristic with season might be correlated with the appearance of the leaves on the trees. The implications of these results are discussed with reference to the assessment of point discharge current density basedon the equivalence of an artificial point and tree of a similar height. It is concluded that this equivalence is not in general justified and that a more comprehensive study of a similar nature is required before a reliable estimate of mean point discharge current density can be obtained from measurements with artificial points...|$|R

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance of}} the low solidity curved-bladed Darrieus {{vertical axis wind turbine}} has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. Initial studies showed the need for an engineering prediction scheme sufficiently accurate to give blade forces as functions of rotational position which did not require excessive computational time. The scheme proposed here develops a suggestion first made by Lapin in 1975, to treat the turbine as two actuator discs, one upwind and the other down-wind. This suggestion, combined with a multiple streamtube approach, the momentum equations in the freestream direction and blade element theory enables the system of equations to be solved. A continuity argument connects the flow between the two discs. The theory does not rely on analytic formulations for aerofoil force coefficients and can therefore use data obtained from experiment, tabulated for a range of Reynolds numbers, thereby including the effects of stall and drag. Comparison with the power coefficients obtained from experiments, using a two-bladed wind tunnel turbine at a Reynolds number of 28, 000 (based on free wind speed and blade chord) shows that the theory is accurate enough to detect the effect of dynamic stall. It is also shown that the continuity argument is essential for improved power output predictions, over earlier single actuator disc theories. The new theory also indicates large differences between air speeds on the <b>upwind</b> and downwind <b>sides</b> of the turbine. These were also confirmed by experiment. Comparison of blade force predictions with those obtained using a computationally expensive time-marching discrete vortex theory shows that good estimates are obtained over the normal turbine operating range.

40|$|International audienceIn desert, complex {{patterns}} of dunes form. Under unidirectional wind, transverse rectilinear dunes or crescent shaped dunes called barchan dunes can appear, {{depending on the}} amount of sediment available. Most rectilinear transverse sand dunes are observed to fragment, for example at White Sands (New Mexico, United States of America) or Walvis Bay (Namibia). We develop a reduced complexity model to investigate the morphodynamics of sand dunes migrating over a non-erodible bed under unidirectional wind. The model is simply based on two physical ingredients, namely, the sand capture process at the slip face and the cross-wind sand transport. The efficiency of the sand capture process is taken to be dependent of the dune height and lateral diffusion is considered on both the windward and lee sides of the dune. In addition, the dune cross section is assumed to be scale invariant and is approximated by a triangular shape. In this framework, the dune dynamics is reduced to the motion of a string representing the dune crest line and is expressed as a set of two coupled nonlinear differential equations. This simple model reveals its ability to reproduce basic features of barchan and transverse dunes. Analytical predictions are drawn concerning dune equilibrium shape, stability and long-term dynamics. We derive, in particular, analytical solutions for barchan dunes, yielding explicit relationships between their shape and the lateral sand diffusion; and analytical predictions for the migration speed and equilibrium sand flux. A stability analysis of a rectilinear transverse dune allows us to predict analytically the wavelength emerging from fluctuations of the dune crest. We also determine the characteristic time needed for the rectilinear dune to fragment into a multitude of barchan dunes. These outcomes show that extremely simple ingredients can generate complex patterns for migrating dunes. From several dune field data, we are able to determine values of the model parameters and in particular the intensity of the lateral sand diffusion on <b>upwind</b> and downwind <b>sides</b> of the dune, bringing a new light on sediment transport processes...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Hawaiian fountains, {{typically}} occurring on basaltic volcanoes, are sustained, weakly-explosive jets of gas {{and juvenile}} ejecta. A broad range of Hawaiian fountaining styles occurred during twelve episodes of the Mauna Ulu eruption on Kīlauea between May and December 1969. The western episode 1 fissure system is currently well exposed, providing an exclusive opportunity to study processes of low-intensity fissure fountains. Episode 1 fountains occurred along a 5 km long fissure system that exploited the eastern-most kilometer of the Ko'ai fault system. A low, near-continuous, spatter rampart is present on the northern <b>upwind</b> and upslope <b>side</b> of the fissure. Most pyroclastic products, however, fell downwind {{to the south and}} little was preserved because of two processes: 1) incorporation of proximal spatter in rheomorphic lava flows 10 [...] 20 meters from the vents, and 2) downslope transport of cooler spatter falling on top of these flows > 20 meters from vent. There is a clear 'lava-shed' delineation between lava that drained back into the fissure and lava that continued flowing into the flowfield. Vents range in surface geometry from linear [...] circular, with superimposed irregularity and sinuosity, and range from straight-sided [...] flaring cross-sectional geometries. Irregularity results from joints in the pre-existing wall rock. Sinuosity results from the local stress field. Geometry of non-flared vents could indicate the true geometry of the dike. Flared vents likely formed through mechanical erosion and thermo-mechanical abrasion. Vent positions along the fissure likely resulted from flow focusing. Uniquely, these vents drained and remain unobstructed (some > 100 m depth), despite subsequent nearby eruptive activity. Three vents were imaged ≤ 16 m in depth at < 4 cm resolution with tripod-mounted LiDAR. Textural analyses of pyroclasts from eruptive episodes 2 [...] 12 show three distinct degassing and outgassing paths: 1) rapid degassing and quenching with minimal outgassing, 2) prolonged degassing and outgassing, and 3) rapid degassing and quenching on pyroclasts' rims with prolonged internal bubble coalesce.

Animals usually rest facing downwind, so that they can see danger approaching from the downwind side, while they can smell danger coming from behind them. An animal may also double back on its spoor and circle downwind before settling down to rest. A predator following its trail will move past the resting animal on the <b>upwind</b> <b>side</b> before realizing that the animal had doubled back, and the resting animal will smell the predator in time to make its escape.|$|E
