5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins {{are to be found in}} the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E
5|$|These {{methods of}} steel {{production}} were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} (BOS), developed in the 1950s, and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They {{can also be used}} for converting pig iron to steel, but they <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> electrical energy (about 440 kWh per metric ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.|$|E
5|$|Netflix {{required}} the production to shoot with 4K cameras {{to make the}} look of the show future-proof and John Toll who is credited as the main director of photography for overseeing the distinct look of the nine featured locations, made the decision to shoot by using mostly Sony's CineAlta PMW-F55 cameras, paired with Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime and Cooke Optics S4 lenses. During the first season, Toll, once again collaborating with the Wachowskis and Glass after Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, personally handled the cinematography in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Iceland, and Seoul. Toll's approach to shooting was to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Steadicam and hand-held partly out of the necessity to follow the faster schedule of a television production compared to the feature films he was used to working on. Additional cinematographers worked {{with the rest of the}} directors in the remaining locations and they used a similar shooting style because they were facing the same scheduling challenges. McTeigue's cinematographer of choice for shooting in Mexico City and Mumbai was Danny Ruhlmann, who previously shot The Raven and Survivor for him. Tykwer worked with Frank Griebe and Christian Almesberger for the Berlin and Nairobi scenes respectively. Griebe had previously shot seven feature films of Tykwer's including Cloud Atlas and Almesberger was the cinematographer of two films Tykwer had produced in Nairobi: Soul Boy and Nairobi Half Life.|$|E

25|$|Franklin's {{part in the}} {{discovery}} of the nature of DNA was shown in the 1987 TV Movie Life Story, starring Tim Pigott-Smith as Crick, Alan Howard as Wilkins, Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and Juliet Stevenson as Franklin.

25|$|Centralized {{wastewater}} treatment {{systems can be}} costly and <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> energy. An alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer, which avoids these costs and shows other benefits. By collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized biogas plant with other biological waste, liquid fertilizer can be produced. This concept was demonstrated by a settlement in Lubeck Germany in the late 1990s. Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offsetting greenhouse gas emission. Producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process.|$|E

25|$|The alley scene had to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> computer-generated imagery to {{accomplish}} the look that the team needed. The entire alley had to be tracked by the computer {{in order to make}} sure that the digital raindrops hit all the objects in the frame, including dumpsters that were visible. In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she is about to get shot and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to lean against a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she was in the process of running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall out of frame, as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E
500|$|The series {{features}} [...] "sky flowers" [...] {{as a main}} setting material. They {{first appeared}} in the pilot and have since become a common feature throughout the series. When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked what they were, he answered, [...] "They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren't really clouds.

Among the cast and crew, only the lead actors and director Worsley spoke English. Worsley would recall the production difficulties this caused: [...] "No matter what galaxy we explored, everyone spoke with a German accent. The use of German actors who could not speak English required us to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> close-ups. I would stand behind the camera, correctly positioned for the actor's look, and read his or her line; the actor would then repeat the line, mimicking my pronunciation and emphasis." ...|$|E

Okabe served as the lead composer and as the director for the project as a whole. Okabe was brought onto the project when the concept for the game was first being devised, and worked intermittently on the soundtrack {{for the next three}} years until its release.

500|$|The artists, {{especially}} Mokona, {{were told}} by Ohkawa to use thin lines {{and to try to}} express things through curved lines as opposed to straight lines. The style of artwork was decided at the beginning to unify the world view of Cardcaptor Sakura. Ohkawa wanted the series to have a [...] "soft, cute-like" [...] feel, so she asked the artists to not <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ink and to make the pages light. For the multitude of flower imagery used in the manga, Nekoi looked through various books to find appropriate flowers, and tried to avoid using the same flower more than once in one chapter. Igarashi remarked that they [...] "never had to draw so many flowers for one series," [...] but they made a point to not use roses. Clamp wanted to incorporate transformation scenes into Cardcaptor Sakura, but because many magical girl manga have the girls wearing the same outfit, Clamp wanted Sakura to wear different costumes. Clamp felt that [...] "it's pretty sad for a girl to wear the same outfit all the time." ...|$|E

You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making.

That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
