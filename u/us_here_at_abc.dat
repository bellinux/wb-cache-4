5000|$|Every so often, Koppel {{ended the}} program with a [...] "Closing Thought", in which Koppel usually {{expressed}} his opinion {{on the subject of}} the night's broadcast. On his final night, urging viewers to continue watching the program, Koppel concluded his final Nightline broadcast with the following [...] "Closing Thought": There's this quiz I give to some of our young interns when they first arrive at Nightline. I didn't do it with the last batch; it's a little too close to home. [...] "How many of you", I'll ask, [...] "can you tell me anything about Eric Sevareid?" [...] Blank stares. [...] "How about Howard K. Smith or Frank Reynolds?" [...] Not a twitch of recognition. [...] "Chet Huntley? John Chancellor?" [...] Still nothing. [...] "David Brinkley" [...] sometimes causes a hand or two to be raised, and Walter Cronkite may be glad to learn that a lot of young people still have a vague recollection that he once worked in television news.What none of these young men and women in their late teens and early twenties appreciates, until I point it out to them, is that they have just heard the names of seven anchormen or commentators who were once so famous that everyone in the country knew their names. Everybody. Trust me, the transition from one anchor to another is not that big a deal. Cronkite begat Rather, Chancellor begat Brokaw, Reynolds begat Jennings. And each of them did a pretty fair job in his own right. You've always been very nice to me, so give this new anchor team for Nightline a fair break. If you don't, I promise you the network will just put another comedy show in this time slot. Then you'll be sorry. And that's our report for tonight, I'm Ted Koppel in Washington and from all of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> <b>ABC</b> News, good night.|$|E

Al talked to me {{for about five minutes}} and hired me. I went on the air two weeks later, scared stiff. I got no training at all.

He {{was signed by}} head coach Hugh Campbell who stated: [...] "We're delighted to welcome a player of Eddie's calibre to Hughenden.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, {{he would}}! {{he would be}} delighted, he is very fond of the English. I will answer for it {{that you will be}} welcome. Meet <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> seven o'clock this evening; he has hired a big room, and there will be two or three dozen of us there--all good fellows.

[...] "Since one's bound {{to meet with}} {{difficulties}} one can't foresee, it proves that one man has resource, resolution, and many other eminently useful qualities; but all this is getting too serious. I'd better point out that Lisle hasn't even promised to meet <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> any particular time." [...] She paused and laughed mischievously.

50|$|In SPIN’s November 1988 issue, writer Legs McNeil {{noted the}} compilation's appeal - “This LP makes <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> SPIN nostalgic for great slaughtered-teen tear-jerkers and gives us pause {{to wonder why}} there are not modernized {{versions}} of the genre” - and invited readers, “in the interest of resurrecting this vital aspect of rock’n’roll lore,” to submit ideas for “Teen Tragedy Update: Song Titles We’d Like to See.” The magazine offered as prizes five copies of the LP that inspired the contest.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, {{that was}} not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> six o'clock {{tomorrow}} evening.

6000|$|... "So I looked idly {{enough to}} pass the time, and there I saw a tall man in a Moorish dress, and with him, for their arms were about each other, a woman. As I was turning my head away who {{did not wish to}} spy upon them thus, the woman lifted her face to kiss the man, and I knew her for that {{beautiful}} Inez who has visited <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> times, as a spy I think. Presently, too, the man, after paying her back her embrace, glanced about him guiltily, and I saw his face also, and knew it." ...|$|R

40|$|The solar corona, the hot, tenuous outer {{atmosphere}} of the Sun, exhibits many fascinating phenomena {{on a wide range}} of scales. One of the ways that the Sun can affect <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Earth is through the large-scale structure of the corona and the dynamical phenomena associated with it, as it is the corona that extends outward as the solar wind and encounters the Earth's magnetosphere. The goal of our research sponsored by NASA's Supporting Research and Technology Program in Solar Physics is to develop increasingly realistic models of the large-scale solar corona, so that we can understand the underlying properties of the coronal magnetic field that lead to the observed structure and evolution of the corona.

40|$|Extract] Australians {{have just}} celebrated Mabo Day – this year marking the 20 th {{anniversary of the}} {{landmark}} High Court decision that {{changed the course of}} land rights in Australia The case has special resonance for <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> James Cook University. It is here, on our Townsville campus that Eddie Koiki Mabo worked and shared the story of his people and his land with historians Henry Reynolds and Noel Loos. At a conference at James Cook in 1981 the seeds were planted to challenge the dispossession of the Meriam people. Against this backdrop, I have been reflecting on the Mabo decision and what it represents for me: a non-Indigenous Australian lawyer. To me, this story is about the possibilities of the law as a means of progressive change and importantly, about reconciliation itself...|$|R

It is the soldier, not the agitator, who has given us the freedom to protest. It is the soldier who salutes the flag, serves beneath the flag, whose coffin is draped by the flag who gives that protester the freedom to abuse and burn that flag.

Insurance against dangers scarcely less grave and much more near and constant which threaten <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> home in our own island. I had the honour and opportunity a few days ago of explaining to the House of Commons our proposals for unemployment insurance. That is a considerable matter. It stands by itself. It is a much simpler question than invalidity insurance; but it is a great matter by itself. Indeed, I thought while I was explaining it to the House of Commons that I had not made such an important speech since I had the honour of explaining the details of the Transvaal Constitution.|$|R
