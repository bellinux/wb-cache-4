In this paper we will describe our recent results on plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) growth of free-standing wurtzite AlxGa 1 −xN bulk crystals using the latest model of Riber's highly efficient nitrogen RF plasma source. We have achieved AlGaN growth rates up to 3 µm/h. Wurtzite AlxGa 1 −xN layers with thicknesses up to 100 μm were successfully grown by PA-MBE on 2 -inch and 3 -inch GaAs (111) B substrates. After growth the GaAs was subsequently removed using a chemical etch to achieve free-standing AlxGa 1 −xN wafers. Free-standing bulk AlxGa 1 −xN wafers with thicknesses in the range 30 – 100 μm {{may be used as}} substrates for further growth of AlxGa 1 −xN-based structures and devices. High Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-STEM) and Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) were employed for detailed structural analysis of AlGaN/GaAs (111) B interface and allowed us to determine the N-polarity of AlGaN layers grown on GaAs (111) B substrates.

40|$|As the {{traditional}} techniques used in optical photolithography at 193 nm {{are running out}} of steam and are becoming prohibitively expensive, a new cost-effective, high power EUV (extreme <b>ultra-violet)</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> is needed to enable high volume manufacturing (HVM) of ever shrinking semiconductor devices. XTREME technologies GmbH and EUVA have jointly developed tin based LDP (Laser assisted Discharge Plasma) source systems during the last two years for the integration of such sources into scanners of the latest and future generations. The goals of the consortium are 1) to solve the wavelength gap- the growing gap between the printed critical dimensions (CD) driven by Mooreﾕs Law and the printing capability of lithographic exposure tools constrained by the wavelength of the light source- and 2) to enable the timely availability of EUV light sources for high volume manufacturing. A first Beta EUV Source Collector Module (SoCoMo) containing a tin based laser assisted discharge plasma source is in operation at XTREME technologies since September 2009. Alongside the power increase, the main focus of work emphasizes on the improvement of uptime and reliability of the system leveraging years of experience with the Alpha sources. Over the past period, a cumulated EUV dose of several hundreds of Mega Joules of EUV light has been generated at the intermediate focus, capable to expose more than a hundred thousand wafers with the right dose stability to create well-yielding transistors.

We have studied the growth of free-standing wurtzite AlxGa 1 xN bulk crystals by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE). Thick wurtzite AlxGa 1 xN films were grown by PA-MBE on 2 -in.

We have demonstrated that free-standing wurtzite AlxGa 1 xN wafers can be achieved by PA-MBE for a wide range of AlN fractions.

Our analyses show that, given the current limited insight concerning the process window of EUV generation, the HPAM module should have an actuator pitch of ≥ 4 mm. Furthermore we have modelled the sensitivity of performance with respect to dimpling and actuator noise. For example, for a deformable mirror with an actuator pitch of 4 mm, and if the associated performance impact is to be limited to smaller than 5 %, the actuator noise should be smaller than 45 nm (rms).

40|$|Visible and <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> have {{numerous}} {{applications in}} the fields of solid state lighting, optical data storage, plastic fiber communications, heads-up displays in automobiles, and in quantum cryptography and communications. Most research and development into such sources is being done using III-nitride materials where the emission can be tuned from the deep UV in AlN to the near infrared in InN. However due to material limitations including large strain, piezoelectric polarization, and the unavailability of cheap native substrates, most visible devices are restricted to emission near GaN at 365 nm up to around 530 nm. These dots are formed by the relaxation of strain, and it has been shown both theoretically and experimentally that the piezoelectric field and the resultant quantum confined stark effect are significantly lower than those values reported in comparable QWs. As a result, the radiative carrier lifetimes in such dots are typically around 10 - 100 times smaller than those in equivalent QWs. Furthermore, the quasi-three dimensional confinement of carriers in the InGaN islands that form the dots can reduce carrier migration to (and therefore recombination at) dislocations and other defects. In the present study, molecular beam epitaxial growth and the properties of InGaN/GaN self-assembled quantum dots have been investigated in detail. The quantum dots, emitting at 630 nm, have been studied optically through temperature-dependent, excitation-dependent, and time-resolved photoluminescence. A radiative lifetime of ~ 2 ns has been measured in these samples. Samples with varying number of dot layers were grown and characterized structurally by atomic force microscopy. The growth conditions of the dots have been optimized including the InGaN and GaN thickness and the nitrogen interruption time. The optimized dots have been incorporated into edge-emitting laser heterostructures. Other optimizations including the novel use of an all In 0. 18 Al 0. 82 N cladding are incorporated into the laser heterostructure to optimize the output power and reduce loss. The first red emitting quantum dot lasers, emitting at up to 630 nm have been realized in the present study. These lasers show good performance compared with other material systems, including InGaAlP/GaAs and AlGaAs based red lasers. The maximum measured output power is 30 mW, making them suitable for the applications discussed above...|$|R

A tuneable infra-red diode laser operating at 835 nm and either an Ar+ laser or a single frequency continuous-wave intracavity frequency-doubled diode laser, both operating at ca. 488 nm, were used to produce 0. 1 - 0. 5 μW of tuneable radiation at ca. 308 nm by sum frequency generation in a β-BaB 2 O 4 crystal.

40|$|We {{report in}} this paper a novel, {{inexpensive}} and flexible method for fabricating micrometer- and nanometer-scale three-dimensional (3 D) polymer structures using visible <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> instead of <b>ultra-violet</b> (UV) <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> or lasers. This method also {{does not require the}} conventional micro-photolithographic technique (i. e., photolithographic masks) for patterning and fabricating polymer structures such as hydrogels. The major materials and methods required for this novel fabrication technology are: (1) any cross-linked network of photoactive polymers (examples of fabricated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) -diacrylate hydrogel structures are shown {{in this paper}}); (2) an Optically-induced Dielectrophoresis (ODEP) System which includes an “ODEP chip” (i. e., any chip that changes its surface conductivity when exposed to visible light), an optical microscope, a projector, and a computer; and (3) an animator software hosted on a computer that can generate virtual or dynamic patterns which can be projected onto the “ODEP chip” {{through the use of a}} projector and a condenser lens. Essentially, by placing a photosensitive polymer solution inside the microfluidic platform formed by the “ODEP chip” bonded to another substrate, and applying an alternating current (a. c.) electrical potential across the polymer solution (typically ~ 20 Vp-p at 10 kHz), solid polymer micro/nano structures can then be formed on the “ODEP chip” surface when visible-light is projected onto the chip. The 2 D lateral geometry (x and y dimensions) and the thickness (height) of the micro/nano structures are dictated by the image geometry of the visible light projected onto the “ODEP chip” and also the time duration of projection. Typically, after an image projection with intensity ranging from ~ 0. 2 to 0. 4 mW/cm 2 for 10 s, ~ 200 nm high structures can be formed. In our current system, the thickness of these polymer structures can be controlled to form from ~ 200 nanometers to ~ 3 micrometers structures. However, in the in-plane dimensions, only ~ 7 μm resolution can be achieved now, due to the optical diffraction limit and the physical dimensions of DMD mirrors in the projector. Nevertheless, with higher quality optical components, the in-plane resolution is expected to be sub-micron...|$|R
