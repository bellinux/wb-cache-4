500|$|Merlin X with Stanley Hooker re-designed {{supercharger}} incorporating re-designed inlet {{and improved}} guide vanes on impeller with revised blower gear ratios; 8:15:1 for low gear, 9:49:1 for high gear. New larger SU twin choke <b>updraught</b> <b>carburettor.</b> Engine interchangeable with Merlin X. Rated at 1,240-horsepower (924kW) at 2,850rpm in low gear at 10,000 feet and +9lb boost; 1,175-horsepower (876kW) at 2,850rpm in high gear at 17,500 feet at +9lb boost. Revised Rolls-Royce unitised [...] "Power Plant" [...] installation design. Engine used in Bristol Beaufighter II, Boulton Paul Defiant II, Handley Page Halifax II and V, Hawker Hurricane II and IV, and Avro Lancaster I and III. First Merlin produced by Packard Motor Car Company as V-1650-1 and designated by Rolls-Royce as Merlin 28.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1944, a {{decision}} was taken to fit tropical air filters as standard, similar to those fitted to the three Typhoons which {{had been sent to}} North Africa in 1943. One thousand sets of the filters were to be manufactured and fitted to front line Typhoons as Mod. 421. It was estimated that these could be fitted to all Typhoons on the production lines by the end of September. Research shows that late Typhoons starting in the RB--- series were fitted with the filters, as were some rebuilt aircraft from earlier production batches. Mod. 421 appeared as a streamlined rectangular [...] "hump", just behind the main radiator fairing and between the inner wheel doors, where the <b>updraught</b> <b>carburettor</b> intake was located.|$|E
50|$|The Sunbeam Dyak was a British inline six-cylinder, water-cooled, twin <b>updraught</b> <b>carburettor</b> engine.|$|E
50|$|The S.U. Carburetter Company Limited also {{manufactured}} dual-choke <b>updraught</b> <b>carburettors</b> for aero-engines {{such as the}} Rolls-Royce Merlin and Rolls-Royce Griffon.|$|R
50|$|Construction used {{separate}} {{cast iron}} blocks for {{each pair of}} cylinders, mounted on a light-alloy crankcase with an included vee angle of 50 degrees. Each bank had a single overhead camshaft, shaft-driven through bevel gears. It was equipped with a single dual-choke <b>updraught</b> Zenith <b>carburettor,</b> and twin spark ignition through four magnetos. The crankshaft was a flat plane with three bearings and four throws, each pair of cylinders sharing a master-slave connecting rod onto the same crankpin.|$|R
2500|$|The 8C 2900 was {{designed}} to compete in sports car races {{in general and the}} Mille Miglia in particular. [...] It used the 2.9L version of the 8C engine and was based on the 8C 35 Grand Prix racing chassis. As such, it had an inline 8-cylinder 2.9-litre engine using two Roots type superchargers fed by two <b>updraught</b> Weber <b>carburettors</b> and fully independent suspension with Dubonnet-type trailing arm suspension with coil springs and hydraulic dampers at front and swing axles with a transverse leaf spring at the rear.|$|R

5000|$|The Triumph 10/20 {{was a car}} {{manufactured}} from 1923 to 1926 by the Triumph Motor Company. It was {{the first}} Triumph automobile and was named the 10/20 for the Royal Automobile Club's taxation class of 10 horsepower rating and its actual output of 20 brake horsepower. The design was principally by Arthur Alderson assisted by Alan Lea and Arthur Sykes who were employed by Lea-Francis, to whom Triumph paid a royalty on every car made. It was powered by a 1,393 cc (1.4L) 4-cylinder side-valve engine designed by Harry Ricardo and fitted with a single <b>updraught</b> Zenith <b>carburettor.</b> The engine produced [...] at 3000 rpm, giving the car {{a top speed of}} 52 mi/h km/h and economy of 40 mpgimp. The four-speed gearbox was mounted centrally and coupled to the engine by a short drive shaft.|$|R
