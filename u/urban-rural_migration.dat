The <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migrations</b> clearly represent main processes of sociodemographic changes in French countrysides, and in many international contexts (1). Rural gentrification is a form of migration towards rural areas, undertaken by populations of middle and upper classes from cities. They participate in deep transformations of demographic, socioeconomic and housing structures, which have been first analysed in British cases (2). Can we identify same processes in French countrysides? According to life course analyses (3), French's rural areas are also characterized by high proportion of older and retired, living and coming in country districts. What part do they play in repopulation of rural areas, mainly high incomes? Which places are particularly concerned? We propose quantitative statistical and cartographic treatments, to analyse interactions between processes of rural gentrification and ageing. We use several data resources (sociodemographic, income, housing) on whole France, with small geographic scales and aggregated areas, to realise spatial analyses of urban-rural relations and intra-rural. Our research is part of works on rural residential economy (4), in context of post-productive countryside.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of giving an {{overview}} of efficiency research on transformation of land from fragmentation to scale economy, by using the concept of coupling in physics, this paper expounds the behavior basis of transfer of surplus rural labor forces in China and transformation of land from fragmentation to scaling up, and analyzes behaviors of all parties and equilibrium outcomes in the three stages concerning the transformation of agricultural land from fragmentation to scaling up as follows. At {{the first stage of}} coupling after multitudinous rural surplus labor forces emerge. The farmers begin to go to city seeking jobs. In this period, the amalgamation of land management has not occurred and the single farmer's land has not yet concentrated. The total land area of single farmer has not yet increased and the total amount of farmers has not yet decreased. At the second stage of coupling, driven by living standards and income, multitudinous rural surplus labor forces begin to live in the city permanently in fact, and the scale management of rural land begins to arise. Foreign funded enterprises begin to enter agriculture, and the industrialization management of agriculture is equipped with the most fundamental conditions due to the occurrence of scaling up of land. At the third stage of coupling, the transfer of rural surplus labor forces basically ends. The properly rights of agricultural land or the management forms also, in a large measure, concentrate. The obstacles to agricultural scaling-up management are solved fundamentally, and the income gap between urban areas and rural areas is narrowed. <b>Urban-rural</b> population <b>migration</b> is no longer the main form of China's population migration. This stage has not yet been realized in China and it is the future state of villages. Finally, through the two cases researched by the predecessors, we verify the research results of the preceding two stages, which provides reliable reference for transformation of China's agricultural land management, and policy formulation of transfer of surplus labor forces.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this master project in {{sociology}} is to study the relationship between privatisation and income inequality in Western China. The main research theme is whether {{a higher degree of}} privatisation is related to greater income inequality. China has experienced massive economic growth in the reform period over the last 30 years. In the planned economy, the private sector was nearly non-existent, and the growth of the private sector has been a central factor in the transformation towards a market economy. The aim of the project is to investigate how this development has affected the wage structures in Western China in respect to income inequality. In the reform period, millions of people have been lifted out of poverty and experienced improved living conditions. However, increased income inequality across many social dimensions has been following {{in the wake of the}} economic growth, and created new challenges and social problems. The Western region has been lagging behind in regards to development compared to the coastal provinces, and this regional dimension is important in relation to income inequality in China. I use cross-sectional data from the Medow survey, which was conducted in 2004 - 2005 in 11 provinces in Western China. The survey was designed and carried out by Fafo, in cooperation with Chinese partners. Medow is the largest living condition survey that has been conducted in Western China, and has data on both household and individual level on a wide range of topics. I use multilevel analysis to study both individual and structural aspects in relation to income inequality. The level of income inequality in a society is influenced by many factors. I chose to focus on five social structures - education, sector, occupation, <b>urban-rural</b> diversity, and <b>migration,</b> and how these social structures affect income inequality, in relation to the process of privatisation. I draw on a range of theoretical perspectives, to frame how privatisation can influence the five social structures, with further consequences for income inequality. I employ neoclassical economic theory with an emphasis on human capital and market mechanisms related to the labour market, market transition theory with a focus on transitional China and increased returns to education, segmented labour market theory which directs attention to the diversified occupational structure, social closure approach with an emphasis on social categories that establishes boundaries and inequality, and neo-Marxism/Structuralism which is related to uneven regional development and migration issues. In general, the main findings confirm that a higher level of privatisation co-exists with greater income inequality between different social groups in Western China. Prefectures with more privatisation tend to have increased income distance between individuals with different educational attainment, between individuals working in the agricultural sector and other sectors, between different occupational positions, between urban and rural citizens, and between migrants and residents. However, income differences between individuals in the state and private sector are found to decline in prefectures with a higher degree of privatisation. There has been much research on income inequality in China within sociology and economy, but less attention has been given to study this in the context of the Western region. There has also been less focus on the relationship between privatisation and income inequality. My study has both an empirical and theoretical purpose. Empirically, my findings challenge the simplistic view that market economic reforms promote equality through development and the “trickle-down” effect of economic growth to wide segments of the population. I show that privatisation in itself not necessarily contributes to increased equality, but can be seen to maintain and create income inequality. Theoretically, the study contributes with a critical discussion of boundaries and processes of social exclusion in the Chinese labour market, and how they are affected by privatisation in the developing market economy. I discuss how different social groups such as peasants, rural migrants, people with low education and low occupational positions have limited possibilities to improve their life chances. An important implication is that the social boundaries are often reinforced by the practice of and ideology behind privatisation...|$|R
40|$|Background : Movement {{from one}} type of area to another attests to factors of distance, {{socioeconomic}} barriers, and heterogeneity. Movement between two localities of one type entails fewer and different types of changes. Objective : We examine <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration</b> in Israel, {{a country that has}} experienced extensive development outside of its major cities. Methods : We first describe and compare the urban and rural migration patterns of Jews and non-Jews. However, due to the small number of non-Jewish migrants in the 2008 census data set, the explanatory analysis focuses solely on Jews, probing the characteristics of migrants and non-migrants and differentiating among the former by whether migration is between urban and rural places, or among urban or rural areas. Results : Examination of migration over five years points to a strong tendency to change residence, often involving a change of residence type. <b>Urban-rural</b> <b>migration</b> emphasizes the importance of specific individual characteristics and reflects the impact of life course and sociodemographic characteristics. We found a favorable sociodemographic profile of persons who leave the city for rural places, and a somewhat less favorable profile of people who are likely to move in the opposite direction. Migrants who move within settlement types are also somewhat more highly selected than persons moving toward cities. Conclusions : Urban-rural population exchanges among Jews in Israel, while generally in accord with studies in other countries, tend to be less definite with respect to educational attainment and age.

Unfortunately, the construction of this housing typology in Romania, found mostly in the southern part, has stopped instead of evolving because of the failure to understand its benefits and degree of self-sufficiency in terms of energy consumption, protection, environmentally friendly approach, and so on. The main cause of the disappearance or scarce presence of the underground or half buried houses is their association with the early typologies of homes built by less fortunate people and therefore related to poverty and misery. Different global crisis led people to re-design underground homes or even restore vernacular ones for personal purpose or to include them in tourism circuits. One of the conclusions of this paper is that buried houses, derived from the traditional models and equipped with the contemporary technologies, could be a solution built in all respects with less impact on the environment and capable of revitalizing rural areas through eco-tourism...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} links between {{migration}} of labour and location specific (urban) pollution, suggesting {{a sense in which}} pollution can be welfare improving. In a conventional Harris-Todaro model of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration,</b> individuals migrate so as to equate the expected urban wage (given a downward rigid real wage in the urban sector) to the real wage. Unemployment is endogenously determined. Interpreting unemployment as damage, urban pollution (damage denoted in units of labour) can also support the same equilibrium with the value of damage equal to the value of resources otherwise lost through unemployment. However, if the damage function implies an uninternalized externality (due to urban congestion, for instance), an internalization gain can be realized {{through the use of a}} Pigouvian tax (or instrument) that discourages migration. Thus if pollution is introduced into a Harris-Todaro model with no such features, environmental damage displaces unemployment to support a similar outcome. Internalizing the externality then yields a welfare gain. We characterize the optimal Pigouvian tax in such a case and show that it is, in general, non-zero. In this sense, then, pollution can be welfare improving perhaps suggesting an alternative view of congestion and other adverse environmental effects facing urban dwellers in the developing world.

40|$|Small farms {{characterize}} {{agriculture in}} Asia. With {{the fragmentation of}} land holdings, the average size of farms fell in the region, {{while the number of}} small-size holdings increased significantly. These small-scale farmers play an important role for food security and poverty alleviation. However, whether and how these small farms can survive under globalization is a hotly debated topic. In particular, the traditional claim that "small is beautiful," which is based on empirical observation that small farms present higher land productivity than large farms, is being challenged. It has been shown that a positive relationship also exists between farm size and labor productivity (and therefore income). To help these small farms prosper under increasing globalization, the governments have to change the "business as usual" attitude. Innovative land reform, for example, is crucial to secure property rights to farmers and to increase farm size. Equally important is the reform of public institutions in order to help small farmers to have access to credit, marketing, and technology. Moreover, promoting diversification in the production of high-value commodities can {{play an important role in}} raising the small-holders' income.

40|$|When I started {{studying}} Romania’s {{rural areas}} I {{was happy to}} find out among others that “the village” has not lost ground but continues as a topic of interest for specialists. The Romanian village has regained importance due {{to a change in}} the mind-set of a population segment that has come to regard the rural environment as an attractive place to live in. Consequently, a new type of migration occurred, i. e. <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration,</b> which co-existed with the rural exodus up to 1996 and gained momentum after 2002. The new rural residents seek the same extent of housing comfort they enjoyed before moving to permanently live in the country, plus the other advantages of living in less polluted environments, with larger dwelling areas. For a clearer picture of the quality of rural housing we aim to assess the public utility infrastructure quality and the population’s access to utilities by determining the density of the sewerage, drinking water and natural gas networks and by inventorying the dwelling installations (for sewerage and the supply of drinking water, electric power, thermal energy). My second target is to identify the dwellings stock-related issues in terms of the number, structure and space of dwelling units, by analyzing the dwelling space indicators (the number of habitable rooms per house, the number of persons per habitable room/house, the habitable space per person) and by drawing up an inventory of the auxiliary rooms (bathrooms and kitchens) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{migration}} has diverse economic, {{social and environmental}} implications for the places of origin and destination. In the context of balanced regional growth and sustainable regional development {{it is important to}} study how internal migration affects the patterns of population distribution within a country. The spatial distribution of population is influenced by the characteristics of the sending and receiving areas in terms of push and pull factors resulting in rural-urban, urban-urban, rural-rural and <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration</b> flows. As economies transform from being predominantly rural to being predominantly urban societies, the process of urbanisation assumes a rapid pace. Individuals migrate from rural to urban areas as a rational human capital investment decision to reap economic rewards in the form of better economic opportunities and benefits. The consequences of rapid urbanisation are multi faceted and require timely responses by development planners and policy-makers to deal with pressures created on the infrastructure of large urban centres by the influx of migrants. However, in some developing as well as developed countries, lately, there have been signs of a change in the trend of the population distribution away from concentration in a few large cities towards a more widespread distribution in medium-sized urban centres. The other dimension of this rural-urban migrant outflow manifests itself in the changing labour market scenario in the rural economy which loses the more productive members of its labour force to the urban economy. ...|$|E

If this is true, then climate change threatens to accelerate urbanisation and lead to renewed stress on urban infrastructure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore these positions and we do so by collecting survey [n = 241], in-depth interview [n = 75] and focus group [n = 123 participants] data from rural and urban Malawi. Two key results stand out as significant. The first is that migrants in Malawi's capital city tend to stay in the urban environment for longer periods of time than conventional understandings of migration would predict. The second key result is that climate change may actually lead, in the case of Malawi, to reverse (i. e <b>urban–rural)</b> <b>migration.</b> This is because many of the people in Malawi's cities depend on products produced in rural environments (e. g. food and fuelwood). If climate change undermines rural livelihoods, then many urban residents will find the basis of their livelihoods removed and will likely respond by moving back to rural villages. Overall, our results, therefore, suggest that in at least one case the effect of climate change on migration may not be to increase migration towards cities but to stimulate an exodus from cities and back to the rural countryside...|$|E
40|$|For Romania, {{the rural}} area {{represent}} a difficult problem {{because it has}} a high share. During the communist era, a forcefully reduction of the rural share was undertaken through various means, most often destructive (Ailenei, 2001). Even the transition to a market economy has failed to improve the situation because, in recent years, the <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration</b> flows have surpassed the rural-urban flows making the too large rural share problem to block the structural changes needed on one hand to modernize the economy, {{and on the other hand}} for the European integration (Constantin, 1996). If we consider other factors such as access to education, quality of life, the differences between rural and urban economic and social infrastructure, than the factors that slows down economic development in Romania are even more obvious, and the importance of regional development gains an even greater significance. The regional development is of particular importance also in terms of ensuring territorial cohesion, which in turn enhances regional growth. At the local level, ensuring the rural-urban continuum is given by the connection quality and the intensity of economic exchanges between localities. In this context the Leader initiative of the European Union (EU) represents an important opportunity to achieve and strengthen the rural-urban continuum in Romania. This paper analyzes the current directions of rural development, making a comparison between the European rural development and rural development in Romania. As an argument of the current direction of the European regional development the Leader initiative is presented in terms of both its development and the objectives pursued. As a conclusion, the paper argues in favors of local action groups (LAG), the main vehicle of Leader, as a solution for a sustainable rural development in Romania. local action groups, regional disparities, regional development policies. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis project investigates policy reforms {{surrounding}} {{the care of}} older people in post-socialist Lithuania. It is argued that institutional arrangements inherited from the socialist era were shaped by indigenous practices of pre-industrialized Lithuania, as well as polices of the Communist regime. The moral economy of aging-in-place in pre-WWII Lithuania centered on multi-generational rural homesteads where care of the aged {{was assumed to be}} the responsibility of children and the closest kin. With rapid urbanization and industrialization of Lithuania during Soviet times, the rural population began to rapidly decline. When children living in the cities were becoming caretakers of aging parents, new patterns of rural-urban migration of older adults were established, which, reproduced multi-generational households [...] but this time in urban areas. Well-established patterns of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration</b> of older adults characterized a post-independence period in Lithuania due to long-term demographic factors as well as radical socio-economic reform and cultural changes. The severe economic recession of the early 1990 s significantly reduced the state's expenditures on social services, while large-scale emigration to European Union countries destabilized informal family networks of support. Thus, a growing number of older people - especially in rural areas - found themselves pauperized, which occurred simultaneously with a decline in social services. By the mid 1990 s, growing elder-care needs had generated three societal responses, which will be analyzed in detail in this thesis: (a) reforms and expansion of state care provisions for older adults; (b) rise of religious charities devoted to the care of older adults; and (c) initiatives to develop community- based social services. This thesis will discuss the implications of the evolving plural social care model for addressing growing elderly care needs in Lithuania.   M. A...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to offer an {{analysis}} about the urban development strategies in Romania. The focus will be on the transition period (after 1989). Although we can not abstract the outcomes of the urban strategies from the previous period, when the communist state regulation had full controll on the urban policy. Urbanisation was the main goal of communist developments based on the idea of modernisation of the society. Therefore we will offer a brief overwiew of the communiste urban planning strategies. It has been resulted an unbalanced urban hierarchy dominated by the capital city of Bucharest and with a weak level of small cities both in terms of functions and infrastructure. The change of the political system in 1989 has established a new environment for the urban system in Romania, marked by the EU and NATO integration process, by the further globalisation of the romanian economy, privatisation and liberalisation of the urban land- and housing market, decentralisation and growth of the weight and importance of local level. Under this circumctances a new urban development strategy has evolved based on the following elements: a) development of a polycentric and balanced urban system, diminishing the overhelming role of Bucharest and reinforcing the second level of urban centres and the level of small cities; b) a new urbanisation wave has started in 2002, where the main aim is the declaration of new towns. It relies on the fact, that in 1997 the dominant internal migration form became the <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration,</b> without precedent in the modern history of Romania and therefore the urban population of the country is declining. As result the urbanisation level fo the EU candidate country Romania is well behind the EU level (52 %), a situation which should be mastered by the new strategy of urbanisation...|$|E
40|$|Study objective: urban-rural health {{differences}} are observed in many countries, even when socioeconomic and demographic characteristics are controlled for. People living {{in urban areas}} are often found to be less healthy. One of the possible causes for these differences is selective migration with respect to health or health risk factors. This hypothesis is hardly ever empirically tested. This paper tries to assess the existence of selective <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration.</b> Design: health indicators and health risk factors were measured in a 1991 population sample. Moves were registered between 1991 and 1995. Using logistic regression analyses, comparisons were made between firstly, urban to rural movers and rural to urban movers and secondly, between movers and stayers. Setting: region surrounding the city of Eindhoven in south {{eastern part of the}} Netherlands. Subjects: data were used of 15895 respondents aged 20 - 74 in 1991. By 1995 613 subjects from urban to rural and 191 subjects from rural to urban. Main results: bivariate nor multivariate analyses show hardly any differences between movers into urban and movers into rural areas. Bivariate analyses on movers and stayers show that movers are healthier than stayers. However, when socioeconomic and demographic rariables are controlled for, movers appear to be less healthy, {{with the exception of the}} younger age groups. Conclusions: areas that attract many migrants from and lose few migrants to other degrees of urbanicity will in the long run obtain healtier populations, because of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. However, if these characteristics are accounted for, the opposite is true, with the exception of younger age groups. In extreme cases this may cause spurious findings in cross sectional research into the relation between urbanicity and health. Absolute numbers of migrants need to be very high, however, to make this noticeable at the aggregate level. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Romania has {{the highest}} share of EU rural areas (44. 9 %), which generates and {{maintains}} {{a long series of}} regional disparities. Because of these disparities, the economy faces a number of elements that undermine the quality of human and social capital and reduces the potential for growth: precarious social and economic infrastructure, reduced access to markets and thus to goods, a low level of both economic cohesion and living standards, and a difficult access to education and training. During the communist era, a forcefully reduction of the rural share was undertaken through various means, most often destructive. Even the transition to a market economy has failed to improve the situation because, in recent years, the <b>urban-rural</b> <b>migration</b> flows have surpassed the rural-urban flows making the too large rural share problem to block the structural changes needed on one hand to modernize the economy, {{and on the other hand}} for the European integration. When analyzing the use structure of work resources we observe even greater differences, especially on account of population employed in agriculture. From this perspective, the authors consider that the program impact of sustaining local action groups, LEADER+, extends beyond the horizon of the National Plan of Rural Development, tending to a medium or even long run, when the rural problem of Romania can be solved. Thus the local action groups can contribute to urban areas revitalization and development, through the promotion of economic activities in adjacent rural areas in a manner similar to LÃ¶sch's theory. The authors effectuate a diagnosis of the Romanian rural problem and its negative effects. In this framework the implementation progress of local action groups in Romania will be reviewed by testing the main factors that contributed to the organization of local action groups in certain regions of the country. Key words: local action groups, regional disparities, economic cohesion, structural changes. JEL classification: O 18, R 11. ...|$|E
40|$|Détang-Dessendre С, Piguet V., Schmitt В. - Life Cycle Variability in the Microeconomic Determinants of <b>Urban-Rural</b> <b>Migration</b> The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide an analytical framework that would make it possible to identify the factors that account for individual mobility as a function of the position in the life cycle and of the geographic - i. e. urban or rural - origin. We start with the hypothesis that migration decisions result from a complex calculus where the individual aims at satisfying certain needs (occupational and residential) in the face of certain constraints (financial, familial or educational) while taking into account the local levels of the supply of labour, housing, environment, availability of services, etc. Those needs and constraints differ at every stage of an individual's life cycle. The probability of migration between 1982 and 1990 is estimated using a national sub-sample extracted from the French Permanent Demographic Sample (EDP). The results show that, among individuals aged 15 to 24 in 1982, occupational concerns have a significant effect on migration choice, especially among the young who were living in a rural area in 1982. Among 25 - 44 year-olds, family structure (including the birth of children) and the type of accommodation play a prominent role in accounting for migration, while the occupation seems less important. Among the older age groups (those who were aged 45 to 64 in 1982), retirement combined with changes in family structure (the empty nest stage) affects the probability of migration, particularly for individuals who were residing in an urban area at the beginning of the period. Détang-Dessendre С, Piguet V., Schmitt В. - Los déterminantes micro-económicos de las migraciones urbano-rurales: variabilidad en función de la posición en el ciclo de vida Este estudio présenta un modelo analitico para identificar los factores explicativos de la movilidad de los individuos segun su posición en el ciclo de vida y segun su origen geográ- fico (urbano, rural). Partimos de la hipótesis segun la cual la decision de migrar es el resultado de un arbitraje para satisfacer, bajo restricciones (financieras, familiares, de cualificación, etc.), ciertas necesidades (profesionales y residenciales) teniendo en cuenta la oferta local de trabajo, la vivienda, oferta cultural, servicios a particulares, etc. Taies necesidades y restricciones varian a lo largo del ciclo de vida del individuo. La estimación de la probabilidad de migrar entre 1982 y 1 990, llevada a cabo para una sub-muestra nacionál extraída de la muestra demográfica permanente (EDP), muestra que, entre los individuos de edades comprendidas entre los 15 y 24 aňos en 1982, las razones profesionales contribuyen de manera significativa a explicar la decision de migrar, especialmente entre los jóvenes que residían en medio rural en 1982. La estructura familiar (crecimiento de la familia) y el régimen juridico de ocupación de la vivienda juegan un papel fundamental para explicar las migraciones de los individuos de 25 a 44 aňos, mientras que la situación profesionál parece secundaria para este grupo. Entre los individuos que tenian entre 45 y 64 aňos en 1982, la jubilación, asociada con cambios de la estructura familiar (independencia de los hijos), influye sobre la probabilidad de migrar, especialmente entre los individuos que residían en medio urbano al inicio del periodo. The decision to move calls into play an intricate network of factors. It involves the composition of the family, the residence and the occupation before leaving, but also those that are expected as a result of migration. The characteristics of the places of origin and destination, job opportunities and life style, concern for the spouse 'sjob, the psychological need for change and many other factors enter into the picture. Cécile Détang-Dessendre, Virginie Piguet and Bertrand Schmitt focus here on occupational, familial and residential factors, measured at the individual level (using INSEE 's Permanent Demographic Sample) as well as at the level of the district or urban area (from aggregate statistical data). They find that the influence of the family, the home and the job change over the life cycle while the prospect of retirement becomes important after 50. These determinants are also affected by the characteristics of the place of origin and the individual's prior migration history. Détang-Dessendre Cécile, Piguet Virginie, Schmitt Bertrand.
