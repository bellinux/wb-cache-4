5|$|In {{gathering}} inspirations for Wrapped in Red, Clarkson {{started by}} listening to Bing Crosby's and Rosemary Clooney's soundtracks from the 1954 feature film White Christmas, as well as Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas (1994) and Merry Christmas to You (1997) by Reba McEntire. While Greg Kurstin, who <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in a jazz band, took influences from A Charlie Brown Christmas by the Vince Guaraldi Trio and A Christmas Gift for You by Phil Spector as his inspirations, which resulted to the album's Wall of Sound resonance. Clarkson also cited that {{her relationship with her}} then-fiancé Brandon Blackstock had inspired some of the album's lyrical content.|$|E
5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed manual), and a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. There is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E

5|$|Sega {{released}} a combined, semi-portable Genesis/Sega CD unit called the Genesis CDX (marketed as the Multi-Mega in Europe). This unit retailed at $399.95 in the U.S. (roughly $100 {{more than the}} individual Genesis and Sega CD units put together, since the Sega CD dropped its price to $229 half a year before), and was bundled with Sonic CD, Sega Classics Arcade Collection, and the Sega CD version of Ecco the Dolphin. The CDX features a small LCD screen that, when the unit is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> audio CDs, displays the current track being played. With this feature and the system's lightweight build (weighing two pounds), Sega marketed it in part as a portable CD player.|$|E
5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, clarinets {{have been}} nominally tuned according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older clarinets were nominally tuned to meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce vibrato, a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz. Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use vibrato in classical music. Special fingerings may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry with}} IFK Malmö is both {{geographical}} and historical.

IFK Malmö have not played in Allsvenskan since 1962; thus matches between the two sides are rare.|$|E

5|$|In July 1995, Slovenian {{archaeologist}} Ivan Turk {{discovered a}} bone carving {{in the northwest}} region of Slovenia. The carving, named the Divje Babe Flute, features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined could have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> four notes of a diatonic scale. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture. However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a musical instrument. German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The flutes {{were made in the}} Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the plants depicted in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers, however, classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature: German scholar Ernst Langlotz (1895–1978) thought that the women were holding a type of rose; Picard recognizes the symbolism of Demeter and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy, possibly the opium poppy, the Oriental poppy, or the Iranian poppy. Careful examination of the thick 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837–1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (talus bones from goats or sheep <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the game of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.|$|E

The follow-up to the critical and commercial disappointment of 2003's Solo Star was preceded by Knowles's move from Columbia to Geffen Records in late 2007. Knowles was heavily influenced by Motown girl groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes, and by her mother Tina, a one-time member of the 1960s harmony group The Veltones, who <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> music by the likes of Dusty Springfield and Martha Reeves to her.
