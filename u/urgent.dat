5|$|Cheney's long {{histories}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} and periodic need for <b>urgent</b> health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office. Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle. He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, <b>urgent</b> coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Dylan's preoccupations in {{the lyrics}} extend beyond socio-political commentary, and touch on <b>urgent</b> matters of {{personal}} experience--the challenge {{to live and}} grow {{in the face of}} uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{location}} of the island does not allow easy access to serious or <b>urgent</b> medical assistance. There is a pirogue-ambulance for the transportation of people off the island in the case of medical emergencies.|$|E
5|$|The Contingencies Fund is {{an account}} {{which may be}} used for <b>urgent</b> {{expenditure}} in anticipation that the money will be approved by Parliament, or for small payments that {{were not included in the}} year's budget estimates.|$|E
5|$|The term {{ambulance}} does, however, {{extend to}} {{a wider range of}} vehicles other than those with flashing warning lights and sirens. The term also includes a large number of non-urgent ambulances which are for transport of patients without an <b>urgent</b> acute condition (see below: Functional types) and a wide range of <b>urgent</b> and non-urgent vehicles including trucks, vans, bicycles, motorbikes, station wagons, buses, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, boats, and even hospital ships (see below: Vehicle types).|$|E

5|$|A-10s of the 23rd TFW were {{deployed}} to Bridgetown, Barbados during Operation <b>Urgent</b> Fury, the American Invasion of Grenada. They provided air {{cover for the}} U.S. Marine Corps landings {{on the island of}} Carriacou in late October 1983, but did not fire weapons as Marines met no resistance.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 100 years {{since it was}} opened the bridge has {{suffered}} from corrosion and {{was in need of}} <b>urgent</b> repair. The rehabilitation works are co-financed by the French Development Agency (AFD) and by the Government of Senegal. The total cost of the works was estimated to be US$27 million, of which US$17 million is from AFD and US$10 million is from the government.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury Heritage Museum houses many {{exhibits}} - {{including the}} Rupert Bear Museum. The Herne Bay Times {{has reported that}} the Heritage at Risk Register includes 19 listed buildings in Canterbury which need <b>urgent</b> repair but for which the council has insufficient funds.|$|E
5|$|During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of Kristallnacht took place. Speer made {{no mention}} of it in the first draft of Inside the Third Reich, and it was only on the <b>urgent</b> advice of his {{publisher}} that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.|$|E
5|$|For example, in March 2009, as {{a result}} of the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis, the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for <b>urgent</b> consideration of a new international reserve currency and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed greatly expanding the I.M.F.'s special drawing rights. Conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a single global currency for a New World Order.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed that the new law caused these hospitals to close. Many of these rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act, to increase access to medical care in rural areas. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but {{only a small number}} operated emergency rooms (ER) or <b>urgent</b> care centers.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, church {{officials}} threatened to close St Peter's Church after being refused permission to sell silverware {{to pay for}} <b>urgent</b> repairs. The Archdeacon, the Venerable Michael Adie, ruled that such sales were against church policy, and that funds must be raised locally.|$|E
5|$|Keeping the old {{systems and}} {{converting}} them to encrypted systems was also considered. This {{was estimated to}} cost NOK500 million to install, but could not be guaranteed to work satisfactorily. In particular, encryption would delay communications, {{which would be a}} problem for <b>urgent</b> communications. It was also uncertain whether the level of encryption would be sufficient to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{while at}} home, the Smoking Man {{receives}} an <b>urgent</b> {{phone call from}} Deep Throat, who meets him {{near the site of}} a UFO wreck. An alien from the UFO is alive. Deep Throat and Smoking Man reminisce about the multiple times they changed the course of history. They flip a coin over who is tasked to kill the alien survivor. Deep Throat loses, and thus reluctantly shoots the alien.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{highlighted}} {{the failure of}} EMPG, the holding company for US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and the potential impact on the Irish taxpayers of the loans given by Anglo Irish Bank to the investors in EMPG on 13 January 2010. Lee saw this as another example for the <b>urgent</b> need of {{an investigation into the}} Irish banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Smith as Miss Caruso: An Italian agent whom Bond briefly romances. She only {{appears in}} the {{beginning}} of the film. She spends the night with Bond and hides in the closet when M unexpectedly visits Bond's home to give him an <b>urgent</b> mission.|$|E
5|$|Others {{were injured}} and their deaths years later may have {{resulted}} from their radiation exposure. With the end of World War II, the work to build additional nuclear devices was less <b>urgent,</b> and the accident halted work for a while until increased safety protocols were implemented at Los Alamos. The incident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non-fiction accounts.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{is usually}} treated with <b>urgent</b> needle decompression. This {{may be required}} before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E
5|$|The Philistines were infuriated by the riddle. The thirty groomsmen told Samson's {{new wife}} {{that they would}} burn her and her father's {{household}} {{if she did not}} discover the answer to the riddle and tell it to them. At the <b>urgent</b> and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson told her the solution, and she told it to the thirty groomsmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Trotsky believed that its formation was all the more <b>urgent</b> for the role he saw it playing in the impending World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{main and}} most <b>urgent</b> problem, however, was in finding funds {{to support the}} {{continued}} operation of the spacecraft amid the spending crunch in post-Soviet Russia. The French space agency, having already {{contributed significantly to the}} project (both scientifically and financially), took upon itself to fund the continuing operations directly.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>urgent</b> {{problem facing}} the new Emperor was the {{scarcity}} of resources left in the imperial treasury. Basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes, and to revert {{to the practice of}} auctioning the offices, obviously causing a diffuse discontent in the population. He also extorted money from the church, {{with the help of the}} Prefect Epinicus, Verina's long-time favourite.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} <b>urgent</b> and indeed great {{problems}} that we face {{not only in the}} United States of America but all over the world today. That is the problem of racism, the problem of poverty and the problem of war.|$|E
5|$|Two local magistrates, J. Bruce and Anthony Hill, were {{stranded}} in the Castle Inn in Merthyr Tydfil. They swore in around 70 men as special constables, but they were heavily outnumbered by the radical crowds. Bruce wrote an <b>urgent</b> letter to Bute in Cardiff Castle, asking for <b>urgent</b> advice on whether to call in the armed forces, and querying whether the Marquess had readied the Militia for action. Huge crowds marched on the local iron works, stopping production. The messages from Merthyr Tydfil reached Bute that afternoon, who began to assemble the Eastern and Central Yeomanry militia units and transport ready for deployment. Bute paused until the morning, hoping to hear better news, but messengers bought more desperate news from Bruce and Hill, and the Yeomanry were dispatched. Meanwhile, an 80-man unit of the 93rd Foot {{had arrived in the}} Castle Inn from Brecon. Bute continued to keep Whitehall informed of the events by letter throughout.|$|E
5|$|Waendel and Redwell Leisure Centres {{are both}} owned by Wellingborough Borough Council, however are {{operated}} {{on their behalf}} by Places for People. Waendel pool is currently in need of <b>urgent</b> repairs due to tiles coming away from the pool floor.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Lent's awards were {{auctioned}} at Sotheby's, London, on 18 July 1966. The items were bought in one lot by an anonymous bidder {{for the total}} sum of £500. The purchaser was Adolf Galland, the former Inspector of Fighters, {{acting on behalf of}} the West German Ministry of Defence. The awards were sold by Helmut Lent's elder daughter after consultation with her mother who was in <b>urgent</b> need for money to pay for an operation. The Ministry presented the collection to the Wehrgeschichtliches Museum Rastatt.|$|E
5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{had filled}} its most <b>urgent</b> needs for {{submarines}} after {{the outbreak of}} World War I, they selected the German Type UB II design for its next group of submarines in mid 1915. Orders {{for the first six}} boats were placed in October 1915 with the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino and the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius. Two more boats were ordered in 1916, bringing the class total to eight.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of Japan {{at the end of}} World War II, the Kuomintang government revealed that Tang Shengming and Xu Lai had been sent by Dai Li to serve as secret agents in the Wang Jingwei regime. The couple took great personal risks to obtain intelligence about Japanese spies and troop movements and pass it to the resistance. Xu Lai reportedly discovered the identity of a Japanese spy while playing mahjong with Zhou Fohai's wife, and personally delivered messages to Chinese agents in Shanghai in <b>urgent</b> situations.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} the most <b>urgent</b> needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had adopted the German Type UB II design for {{what became known}} as the Austro-Hungarian U-27 class in mid 1915, and had six of that class being built under license in Austria-Hungary by late 1916. In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most <b>urgent</b> needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915. The Germans {{were reluctant to}} allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and <b>urgent</b> care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Both ships had {{suffered}} damage, with the injuries to Astraeas masts requiring <b>urgent</b> repairs while Gloire had also suffered damage to its rigging and sails. The French ship had also taken heavy casualties, with 40 men killed or wounded, including the captain. In contrast, Astraea had not lost a single man, although {{one of the}} eight wounded subsequently died. Paulet effected repairs to both ships and gave temporary command of Gloire to Lieutenant John Talbot, who was subsequently promoted. He then brought both ships to the Portsmouth, where Colpoys was reconstituting his scattered squadron.|$|E
5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, {{but there was an}} <b>urgent</b> need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.|$|E
5|$|During Gage's {{administration}} political tensions rose {{throughout the}} American colonies. As a result, Gage began withdrawing {{troops from the}} frontier to fortify urban centres like New York City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, {{the need to provide}} adequate food and housing for these troops became <b>urgent.</b> Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.|$|E
