5|$|The {{chain of}} {{events leading up to}} Bishop Tempier's {{condemnation}} of 1277 is still not entirely clear. The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines. According to the historian Edward Grant, the theologians desired to condemn Aristotle's teachings on the eternity {{of the world and the}} <b>unicity</b> of the intellect.|$|E

Fifty percent of Winnipeg {{residents}} use a taxi at least once during the year. Cycling is popular in Winnipeg, {{and there are many}} bicycle trails and lanes around the city. Winnipeg holds an annual Bike-to-Work Day and Cyclovia, and bicycle commuters may be seen year-round, even in the winter. Active living infrastructure in Winnipeg encourages bicycling through the inclusion of bike lanes and sharrows.|$|E

Most routes travel through the university campus and also stop at the rail station. The Newark Transit Hub {{is located in the}} eastern part of the town and serves several of the bus routes. There is also a <b>Unicity</b> bus, run jointly through the city and the University, free for everyone to ride, which acts as a community circulator. The University of Delaware also operates a bus system, available and free to all students and those associated with the university.|$|E
500|$|For natural {{language}} plaintext, there will typically {{be only one}} plausible decryption, although for extremely short plaintexts, multiple candidates are possible. For example, the ciphertext MPQY could, plausibly, decrypt to either [...] "aden" [...] or [...] "know" [...] (assuming the plaintext is in English); similarly, [...] "ALIIP" [...] to [...] "dolls" [...] or [...] "wheel"; and [...] "AFCCP" [...] to [...] "jolly" [...] or [...] "cheer" [...] (see also <b>unicity</b> distance).|$|E
500|$|According to {{literary}} historian Alexandru Dobrescu, Caion is the prototype [...] "detractor" [...] in Romanian culture, [...] "born of frustration", the Zoilus to Caragiale's Homer. Dobrescu writes: [...] "In the common definition, the detractor is someone consciously working to debase (or destroy) one's good standing. The cobbler envious of his neighbor, the cordwainer, {{who will go}} lengths to besmirch the latter in hopes of 'helping' him lose his clientele, is a detractor." [...] His verdict about Caion's <b>unicity</b> in a Romanian context is placed in doubt by another author, Constantin Coroiu, who finds it unrealistic.|$|E

He wrote many propagandist articles on this subject advocating not only a vague free love but also multiple partners, which he called [...] "plural love." [...] "'The camaraderie amoureuse thesis,' he explained, 'entails a free contract of association (that may be annulled without notice, following prior agreement) reached between anarchist individualists of different genders, adhering to the necessary standards of sexual hygiene, with a view toward protecting the other parties to the contract from certain risks of the amorous experience, such as rejection, rupture, exclusivism, possessiveness, <b>unicity,</b> coquetry, whims, indifference, flirtatiousness, disregard for others, and prostitution.'".|$|E
2500|$|A revised {{planning}} {{application was}} submitted in December 2013. [...] Although several elements remained the same, such as office accommodation, community facilities and a café/restaurant, the developers now included six flats in their proposal. [...] These {{would be built}} {{at the top of}} the complex, which would rise to six storeys at the front and three storeys to the rear. [...] No car parking would be provided, but bicycle parking was included in the new design. [...] The city council was expected to decide on the application in March 2014, and in that month granted approval which remains valid as of May 2015; but in December 2014 Holland sold the building to <b>Unicity,</b> part of Knightsbridge Student Housing. [...] This company submitted a new planning application in May 2015 in respect of a building consisting of 73 privately rented flats, offices and community space. [...] The proposed housing density is significantly greater than that for which permission was granted in 2014.|$|E
60|$|The {{doctrine}} of the Trinity (the foundation of all rational theology, {{no less than the}} precondition and ground of the rational possibility of the Christian Faith, that is, the Incarnation and Redemption), rests securely on the position,--that in man 'omni actioni præit sua propria passio; Deus autem est actus purissimus sine ulla potentialitate'. As the tune produced between the breeze and Eolian harp is not a self-subsistent, so neither memory, nor understanding, nor even love in man: for he is a passive as well as active being: he is a patible agent. But in God this is not so. Whatever is necessarily of him, (God of God, Light of Light), is necessarily all act; therefore necessarily self-subsistent, though not necessarily self-originated. This then is the true mystery, because the true unique; that the Son of God has origination without passion, that is, without ceasing to be a pure act: while a created entity is, as far as it is merely creaturely and distinguishable from the Creator, a mere 'passio' or recipient. This <b>unicity</b> we strive, not to 'express', for that is impossible; but to designate, by the nearest, though inadequate, analogy,--'Begotten'.|$|E
50|$|Ciphertexts {{greater than}} the <b>unicity</b> {{distance}} can be assumed to have only one meaningful decryption.

50|$|<b>Unicity</b> Mall was a {{shopping}} mall in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was named for the 1972 <b>unicity</b> restructuring of city management.

50|$|<b>Unicity</b> {{distance}} {{is a useful}} theoretical measure, but it doesn't say much about {{the security of a}} block cipher when attacked by an adversary with real-world (limited) resources. Consider a block cipher with a <b>unicity</b> distance of three ciphertext blocks. Although there is clearly enough information for a computationally unbounded adversary to find the right key (simple exhaustive search), this may be computationally infeasible in practice.|$|E

5000|$|The City of Winnipeg, several {{surrounding}} municipalities and the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg {{were subject}} to a municipal amalgamation on January 1, 1972 that created a <b>unicity</b> or unified city.

Until that point, the greater Winnipeg area comprised 12 municipalities under a single metropolitan government, in a [...] "two-tier" [...] system.|$|E
50|$|Another way to {{increase}} the <b>unicity</b> distance is {{to increase}} the number of possible valid sequences in the files as it is read. Since if for at least the first several blocks any bit pattern can effectively be part of a valid message then the <b>unicity</b> distance has not been reached. This is possible on long files when certain bijective string sorting permutations are used, such as the many variants of bijective Burrows-Wheeler transforms.|$|E
50|$|In both versions, the {{plaintext}} {{was first}} converted to digits {{by use of}} a straddling checkerboard rather than a Polybius square. This {{has the advantage of}} slightly compressing the plaintext, thus raising its <b>unicity</b> distance and also allowing radio operators to complete their transmissions quicker and shut down sooner. Shutting down sooner reduces the risk of the operator being found by enemy radio direction finders. Increasing the <b>unicity</b> distance increases strength against statistical attacks.|$|E
