40|$|The {{device for}} {{removing}} water drops from an umbrella is constituted such {{that a number}} of water absorption members with elastic property are disposed at certain intervals radially in the inserting opening for an umbrella of the device body. The inserting space for the umbrella is in the central part of a number of absorption members, thereby a closed rainy umbrella is inserted into the inserting space. The <b>umbrella</b> <b>cloth</b> is inserted into clearance between the each adjacent water absorption member, and then water drops on the <b>umbrella</b> <b>cloth</b> can be absorbed and removed by sliding the inserted umbrella in the direction of insertion of the umbrella. The device does not need such energy as electric energy and water absorption is performed certainly and within only short time...|$|E
5000|$|An {{umbrella}} antenna is a top-loaded electrically lengthened monopole antenna, consisting {{in most cases}} of a mast fed at the ground end, to which a number of radial wires are connected at the top, sloping downwards. The outer end of each wire is connected by an insulator to a supporting rope or cable anchored to the ground. The radial wires can also function as guy wires to support the mast. The radial wires make the antenna look like a giant <b>umbrella</b> without the <b>cloth,</b> accounting for the name.|$|R
5000|$|Station G was an Omega {{transmitter}} {{that used}} an umbrella antenna carried by a 432 m tall grounded lattice steel guyed mast. Unlike {{many of the}} other Omega Transmitters, Woodside was not a [...] "hot tower," [...] that is, one which is insulated from a ground connection by large ceramic insulators that support the entire weight of the structure. Rather, the tower was electrically insulated from the topmost guys which served as the radiators, similar to the metal radials of an <b>umbrella</b> without <b>cloth</b> covering. The mast simply supported the downward sloping guy wires which are the active elements. The guy wires were also used to hold the tower itself in place. This mast was the tallest structure in the southern hemisphere. Construction of this station was originally planned to be built in New Zealand but after protests from anti-war protestors it was built in Australia, although not without controversy. The tower was officially opened in October 1982, but had been operating for 3 months prior to that, with the first broadcast at 10am on the 16th of August, having taken 3.5 years to construct, however the tower itself having taken only 30 days to be constructed.|$|R

According to his account, {{the use of}} the umbrella was granted to only some of the subjects by the king. An umbrella with several circles, as if two or three umbrellas were fastened on the same stick, was permitted to the king alone; the nobles carried a single <b>umbrella</b> with painted <b>cloths</b> hanging from it.The Talapoins (who seem to have been a sort of Siamese monks) had umbrellas made of a palm-leaf cut and folded, so that the stem formed a handle.|$|R

On a beach in the al-'Izbeh area of Khan Younis, roughly 30 metres from the shoreline and 200 metres from housing, around a dozen Palestinians had gathered at the Fun Time Beach café (Waqt al-Marah) to watch a broadcast of the game. The café, owned by the al-Sawalli family, and, according to a local PNA-employed policeman, Wael Soboh, not a military area, was a makeshift arrangement covered by <b>cloth,</b> <b>umbrellas</b> and palm leaves, furnished with plastic chairs and a converted container which served as the kitchen. The portable television was powered by a generator.|$|R

The first Diocesan seminary in the Philippines, the seminary of St. Clement in Manila, was set up with the aid of French Monsignor Charles-Thomas Maillard de Tournon in 1704. French traders, technicians, soldiers, and {{officers}} and crews under the Manila Galleon trade also came to the Philippines. The French recognized the potentials of the Philippines in the trading sector by the 17th century. France discovered the potential use of abaca in the manufacture of naval supplies, particularly ropes. Despite restrictions of Spanish colonial government's restrictions against foreign trade, French and other foreign traders were already in Manila before it was formally opened for foreign trade. Paris fashion became the standard in Manila. Foreign traders imported French products such as stockings, muslin and linen <b>cloth,</b> <b>umbrellas,</b> gloves and coats in the Philippines while the Filipinos exported most of its indigo to France.|$|R

Just after settling, some men returned to East ‘Uvea (Wallis Island) to fetch precious turmeric root stocks that were used for ritual dyeing and anointment.

It was carried by United States Army Air Forces aircraft and intended for use in life rafts. It included the M-277-A collapsible box kite to raise the antenna, which was also included in some of the later SCR-578-B sets. It was similar to the kite included with the NSG2 but did not include the wings. The 17 x 17 x 36 inch frame of the M-277-A was made up of 4 aluminum rods, each rod end was attached at the ends by a hinge to 4 shorter rods, and each of these met in the middle, attached by a locking mechanism, so that the whole thing could be opened up like an <b>umbrella.</b> The yellow <b>cloth</b> was treated with water repellent and part of one section filled with kapok to add buoyancy if it fell into the water. It was designed to be simple to assemble, and could fly in winds from 7 to 40 miles per hour. It packed into a cardboard tube, on which were also printed the assembly instructions.|$|R
