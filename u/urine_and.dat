40|$|Dehydration is {{a common}} water and {{electrolyte}} disorder in long-term care residents. Practical methods to detect and monitor dehydration are needed. This study determined whether urine color measured by a urine color chart reflects hydration status. The study employed a repeated measures design with two observations during a 10 -hour period.
