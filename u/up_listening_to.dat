5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew <b>up</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> {{primarily}} American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Mainer grew <b>up</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> {{traditional}} mountain {{music and}} was largely influenced by his brother-in-law Roscoe Banks. He first {{learned to play}} the banjo at square dances, where he would pick up instruments left by performers and practice on them. After moving to Concord, North Carolina and working {{in a series of}} jobs at cotton mills, he became a part of his brother J.E.'s band, known as J. E. Mainer's Mountaineers. His entry into the band in 1934 marked the beginning of a nearly six-decade career in music. J.E. played the fiddle while Wade performed on the banjo for the string band, and they played at fiddlers' conventions and other gatherings.|$|E

Drawing was another early passion of his; he became known as the class caricaturist at P.S. 141 and anticipated a career in commercial art. He began singing for money at age 13, performing as a singing waiter in several Italian restaurants around his native Queens.|$|E

The singer has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga. Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music like Madonna. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, including Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.|$|E
5|$|Malouma {{commenced}} {{her education}} at {{elementary school in}} 1965 in Mederdra. She qualified as {{an elementary school teacher}} in 1974 in Rosso. According to the traditions of her country, those of the Meidah family are required to carry on the art of their ancestors. As a result, she had to give up her aspirations to teach. Members of each caste are allowed only to marry other members of society within the same caste and the entire society is divided by castes politically, economically, and culturally. Movement outside of a particular caste is forbidden. She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play, especially the ardin harp, and was taught traditional Mauritanian music by her father, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music. As a result, she grew <b>up</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> classical western works such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi and Wagner, as well as the music of traditional Berber, Egyptian, Lebanese and Senegalese artists. She often accompanied her parents who sang traditional griots.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they grew <b>up</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt {{he was the only}} one who could help them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
