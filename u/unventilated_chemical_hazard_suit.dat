40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the fiscal year}} (FY) 2006 assessment to evaluate potential <b>chemical</b> and radiological <b>hazards</b> associated with vessels and piping in the former plutonium process areas at Hanford's Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP). Evaluations by PFP engineers as design authorities for specific systems and other subject-matter experts were conducted to identify the <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards</b> associated with transitioning the process areas for the long-term layup of PFP before its eventual final decontamination and decommissioning (D and D). D and D activities in the main process facilities were suspended in September 2005 {{for a period of}} between 5 and 10 years. A previous assessment conducted in FY 2003 found that certain activities to mitigate <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards</b> could be deferred safely until the D and D of PFP, which had been scheduled to result in a slab-on-grade condition by 2009. As a result of necessary planning changes, however, D and D activities at PFP will be delayed until after the 2009 time frame. Given the extended project and plant life, it was determined that a review of the plant <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards</b> should be conducted. This review to determine the extended life impact of chemicals is called the ''Plutonium Finishing Plant <b>Chemical</b> <b>Hazards</b> Assessment, FY 2006 ''. This FY 2006 assessment addresses potential <b>chemical</b> and radiological <b>hazard</b> areas identified by facility personnel and subject-matter experts who reevaluated all the chemical systems (items) from the FY 2003 assessment. This paper provides the results of the FY 2006 <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards</b> assessment and describes the methodology used to assign a hazard ranking to the items reviewed...|$|R

40|$|Food safety {{remains one}} of the most {{important}} issues in most countries and the detection of food hazards plays a key role in the systematic approach to ensuring food safety. Rapid, easy-to-use and low-cost analytical tools are required to detect <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards</b> in foods. As a promising candidate, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have been rarely applied to real food samples for testing <b>chemical</b> <b>hazards,</b> although numerous papers have been published in this field in the last decade.
