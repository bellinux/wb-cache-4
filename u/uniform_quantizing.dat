40|$|We {{consider}} the compression of a continuous real-valued source X using scalar quantizers and average squared error distortion D. Using lossless compression of the quantizer’s output, Gish and Pierce showed that <b>uniform</b> <b>quantizing</b> yields the smallest output entropy in the limit D → 0, {{resulting in a}} rate penalty of 0. 255 bits/sample above the Shannon Lower Bound (SLB). We present a scalar quantization scheme named lossy-bit entropy-constrained scalar quantization (Lb-ECSQ) that is able to reduce the D → 0 gap to SLB to 0. 251 bits/sample by combining both lossless and binary lossy compression of the quantizer’s output. We also study the low-resolution regime and show that Lb-ECSQ significantly outperforms ECSQ {{in the case of}} 1 -bit quantization...|$|E

40|$|For {{the image}} {{classification}} task, the color histogram {{is widely used}} as an important color feature indicating {{the content of the}} image. However, the high-resolution color histograms are usually of high dimension and contain much redundant information which does not relate to the image content, while the low-resolution histograms cannot provide adequate discriminative information for image classification. In this paper, a new color feature representation is proposed which not only takes the correlation among neighbouring components of the conventional color histogram into account but removes the redundant information as well. A high-resolution, <b>uniform</b> <b>quantized</b> color histogram is first obtained from the image. Then the redundant bins are removed and some neighbouring bins are combined together to generate a new feature component to maximize the discriminative ability. The mutual information is adopted to evaluate the discriminative power of a specific feature set and an iterative algorithm is performed to derive the histogram quantization and their corresponding feature generation. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature representation, an application of detecting adult images, i. e., image classification between erotic and benign images, is carried out. Two widely used classification techniques, SVM and Adaboost, are employed as the classifier. Experimental results show the superior performance of our color representation compared with the conventional color histogram in image classification.

30|$|In {{synchronous}} converters, <b>uniform</b> samples <b>quantized</b> {{to approximate}} a continuous {{range of values}} by {{a specific set of}} discrete values. The quantization process incurs loss of information in the reconstructed signal. Subsequently, the reconstructed signal may differ considerably from the original analog signal. In order to overcome this problem, we must use oversampling converters. In the oversampling converters, sampling rate is greater than Nyquist rate (fNyquist = 1 /τNyquist). The ratio between the sampling rate and twice the signal bandwidth is defined as the oversampling ratio (OSR). After oversampling, the signal is subject to quantization and then low-pass filtered and finally down-sampled to or near to the Nyquist rate (known as decimation) [10].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Enhanced {{version of the}} Embedded Zerotree Wavelet (EEZW) dedicated to Phonocardiogram (PCG) compression. This algorithm is constituted of six steps: applying Discrete Wavelet Transform, <b>uniform</b> scalar <b>quantizing,</b> creating dominant and subordinate lists, generating preliminary symbol stream and finally using arithmetic coding. The compression algorithm has been tested and evaluated by its application on several databases. The adapted 1 -D algorithm shows better performance than the original EZW, the modified Ouafi’s EZW (MEZW) and the popular MP 3 audio-specific format, regarding to the well-known trade-off rate/distortion. Also a low computational complexity of our method is obtained. It {{is due to the}} only one time subordinate pass calculated one time after the achievement of all dominant passes...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} recovering sparse vectors from underdetermined linear measurements via ℓ_p-constrained basis pursuit. Previous analyses of this problem based on generalized restricted isometry properties have suggested that two phenomena occur if p≠ 2. First, one may need substantially more than s (en/s) measurements (optimal for p= 2) for uniform recovery of all s-sparse vectors. Second, the matrix that achieves recovery with the optimal number of measurements may not be Gaussian (as for p= 2). We present a new, direct analysis which shows that in fact neither of these phenomena occur. Via a suitable version of the null space property we show that a standard Gaussian matrix provides ℓ_q/ℓ_ 1 -recovery guarantees for ℓ_p-constrained basis pursuit in the optimal measurement regime. Our result extends to several heavier-tailed measurement matrices. As an application, we show that one can obtain a consistent reconstruction from <b>uniform</b> scalar <b>quantized</b> measurements in the optimal measurement regime...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{by using}} {{quantized}} Berry phases, {{a prescription for}} a local characterization of gapped topological insulators has been given (Hatsugai 2006 Preprint cond-mat/ 0603230). It requires that the ground state is gapped and is invariant under some anti-unitary operation. A spin liquid which is realized as a unique ground state of the Heisenberg spin system with frustrations is a typical target system, since pairwise exchange couplings are always time-reversal invariants even with frustrations. As for a generic Heisenberg model with a finite excitation gap, we locally modify the Hamiltonian by a continuous SU(2) twist only at a specific link and define the Berry connection by the derivative. Then the Berry phase evaluated by the entire many-spin wavefunction is used to define the local topological order parameter at the link. We numerically apply this scheme for several spin liquids and show its physical validity. For example, it implies that the Haldane phase of the S = 1 chains is characterized by <b>uniform</b> π <b>quantized</b> Berry phases...|$|R
40|$|After some post-natal cooling, a spinning, magnetized, {{canonical}} neutronstar (NS) has {{a core of}} superconducting protons, superfluid neutrons, and degenerate extreme relativistic electrons, all {{surrounded by}} a thin highly conducting solid crust.

The physics of such a core predicts {{the evolution of a}} NS’s surface magnetic field and related phenomena as the star’s spin changes. Predictions include changes in NS magnetic dipole moments, anomalously small polar caps in millesecond pulsars, properties of two different families of spinperiod “glitches”, and spin-down ages much greater than true ages for some pulsars.

40|$|The surface {{states of}} topological insulators, which behave as charged massless Dirac fermions, are {{studied in the}} {{presence}} of a <b>quantizing</b> <b>uniform</b> magnetic field. Using the method of D. H. Lee[1], analytical formula satisfied by the energy spectrum is found for a singly and doubly connected geometry. This is in turn used to argue that the way to measure the quantized Hall conductivity is to perform the Laughlin's flux ramping experiment and measure the charge transferred from the inner to the outer surface, analogous to the experiment in Ref. [2]. Unlike the Hall bar setup used currently, this has the advantage of being free of the contamination from the delocalized continuum of the surface edge states. In the presence of the Zeeman coupling, and/or interaction driven Quantum Hall ferromagnetism, which translate into the Dirac mass term, the quantized charge Hall conductivity sigma_xy=n e^ 2 /h, with n= 0,± 1,± 3,± 5 [...] .

40|$|In a <b>uniform</b> fluid, a <b>quantized</b> {{vortex line}} with {{circulation}} h/M can support long-wavelength helical traveling waves proportional to e^i(kz-ω_k t) with the well-known Kelvin dispersion relation ω_k ≈ (ħ k^ 2 / 2 M) (1 /|k|ξ), where ξ is the vortex-core radius. This result is extended {{to include the}} effect of a nonuniform harmonic trap potential, using a quantum generalization of the Biot-Savart law that determines the local velocity V of each element of the vortex line. The normal-mode eigenfunctions form an orthogonal Sturm-Liouville set. Although the line's curvature dominates the dynamics, the transverse and axial trapping potential also affect the normal modes of a straight vortex on the symmetry axis of an axisymmetric Thomas-Fermi condensate. The leading effect of the nonuniform condensate density is to increase the amplitude along the axis away from the trap center. Near the ends, however, a boundary layer forms to satisfy the natural Sturm-Liouville boundary conditions. For a given applied frequency, the next-order correction renormalizes the local wavenumber k(z) upward near the trap center, and k(z) then increases still more toward the ends.

40|$|This lab {{explores the}} details of {{interfacing}} the 68000 with analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters. Successive approximation, which makes use of a D/A converter to achieve A/D is thoroughly examined. The lab also explores companding. While designing systems that interface with the real world, it is often necessary to get analog data {{from the real world}} into the computer for processing and similarly to bring digital data out of the computer back into analog form. These processes describe A/D and D/A conversion, respectively. This lab explores the hardware and software components and the processes used to accomplish such conversions. Conversions are usually linear but there are instances in which there is significant benefit to non-linear conversions. Human hearing, for instance, has a logarithmic sensitivity scale and it makes sense to emphasize weak audio and suppress loud audio for listener comfort. In a compressor/expander (compander) arrangement, voice on a telephone line becomes more intelligible against noise because quiet signals become quantized in finer detail while louder signals have a coarse conversion with larger quantization steps. This lab examines the-law scheme for compressing audio input to provide relatively <b>uniform</b> “signal to <b>quantizing</b> noise ratio ” over a range of input levels. 2.

40|$|S 1. Simulated BLS {{intensity}} as {{a function}} of magnetic field To better understand the magnetic field dependent Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) signal as shown in Fig. 3 a of the main text, the spin wave (SW) amplitude {{as a function}} of magnetic field was calculated using the eq. (34) in a classic paper by Kalinikos [S 1]. We show that there is a small difference between and, defined as the magnetic field corresponding to the BLS signal peak and the lowest transversely <b>quantized</b> <b>uniform</b> precession mode along the waveguide, respectively. We express the eq. (34) in the Cartesian coordinate and only consider the magnetization component perpendicular to the film since it dominates the BLS signal particularly for light at small incident angles as in our experiments [S 2]. Because the thickness of the waveguide is 10 nm, we use the approximation of where is the in-plane wave vector and is the thickness of the magnetic film. For the Damon-Eshbach spin-wave mode, the mode profile along thickness direction is essentially uniform for the 10 nm-thick film, thus only the mode with uniform profile along the thickness direction was considered. We further modify the eq. (34) to include the quantization effect along the waveguide width direction by putting √ where (is the width of waveguide and the index n refers to the quantization along the width direction) and is the wave vector along the waveguide direction. For the single stripe antenna, when we assume a perfectly pinned boundary condition for the waveguide, only n = odd modes are excited. The z-component of dynamic magnetization is given by (the coordinate system defined in Fig. 1 of the main text) ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The increasing use of digital communication systems has produced a continuous search for efficient methods of speech encoding. This thesis describes investigations of novel differential encoding systems. Initially Linear First Order DPCM systems employing a simple delayed encoding algorithm are examined. The systems detect an overload condition in the encoder, and through a simple algorithm reduce the overload noise {{at the expense of}} some increase in the quantization (granular) noise. The signal-to-noise ratio (snr) performance of such d codec has 1 to 2 dB's advantage compared to the First Order Linear DPCM system. In order to obtain a large improvement in snr the high correlation between successive pitch periods as well as the correlation between successive samples in the voiced speech waveform is exploited. A system called "Pitch Synchronous First Order DPCM" (PSFOD) has been developed. Here the difference Sequence formed between the samples of the input sequence in the current pitch period and the samples of the stored decoded sequence from the previous pitch period are encoded. This difference sequence has a smaller dynamic range than the original input speech sequence enabling a quantizer with better resolution to be used for the same transmission bit rate. The snr is increased by 6 dB compared with the peak snr of a First Order DPCM codea. A development of the PSFOD system called a Pitch Synchronous Differential Predictive Encoding system (PSDPE) is next investigated. The principle of its operation is to predict the next sample in the voiced-speech waveform, and form the prediction error which is then subtracted from the corresponding decoded prediction error in the previous pitch period. The difference is then encoded and transmitted. The improvement in snr is approximately 8 dB compared to an ADPCM codea, when the PSDPE system uses an adaptive PCM encoder. The snr of the system increases further when the efficiency of the predictors used improve. However, the performance of a predictor in any differential system is closely related to the quantizer used. The better the quantization the more information is available to the predictor and the better the prediction of the incoming speech samples. This leads automatically to the investigation in techniques of efficient quantization. A novel adaptive quantization technique called Dynamic Ratio quantizer (DRQ) is then considered and its theory presented. The quantizer uses an adaptive non-linear element which transforms the input samples of any amplitude to samples within a defined amplitude range. A fixed <b>uniform</b> quantizer <b>quantizes</b> the transformed signal. The snr for this quantizer is almost constant over a range of input power limited in practice by the dynamia range of the adaptive non-linear element, and it is 2 to 3 dB's better than the snr of a One Word Memory adaptive quantizer. Digital computer simulation techniques have been used widely in the above investigations and provide the necessary experimental flexibility. Their use is described in the text...|$|R
