40|$|Dexterous {{continuum}} manipulators (DCMs) offer {{great potential}} for increasing instrument reach in minimally-invasive surgical procedures. We previously designed and fabricated a tendon driven DCM with a large instrument channel and evenly distributed compliant joints for minimally-invasive skull base surgery and the treatment of osteolysis during hip revision surgery. The evenly distributed compliant joints, in some cases, may limit {{the reach of the}} DCM during lesion removal. In this paper, we propose a finite element analysis (FEA) method for optimizing the distribution of the compliant joints based on treatment space requirements determined preoperatively. After performing experiments to validate the FEA results, we investigated the effects of height and cross distance of <b>unevenly</b> <b>distributed</b> compliant joints on tip trajectories and deflection shapes of DCMs. A boundary exploration for skull base surgery was performed to investigate the improvement in the percent of boundary explored by the optimized DCMs with the <b>unevenly</b> <b>distributed</b> compliant joints. Results show the advantage of using DCMs with <b>unevenly</b> <b>distributed</b> joints in reaching the boundary of the lesion. For a typical lesion in the petrous apex during skull base surgery, simulation results indicates that the design of <b>unevenly</b> <b>distributed</b> compliant joints can increase the reach of the DCM accomplishing 71 % lesion removal compared with 59 % from the DCM with evenly distributed compliant joints...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} for the pattern of international trade of differences among regions within countries [...] what the authors call "lumpiness. " If factors of production are sufficiently <b>unevenly</b> <b>distributed</b> across regions, then the pattern of trade {{of the country as}} a whole may depart from what it would have been had factors been evenly distributed. Thus, lumpiness in the geographical distribution of factors can be a determinant of trade. The authors show in particular that if other determinants of trade are absent, then a country will tend to export the good that intensively uses its lumpier (i. e., more <b>unevenly</b> <b>distributed)</b> factor.
