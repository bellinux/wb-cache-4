60|$|The pupils of the drawing-class {{put away}} their pencils and color-boxes in high good humor: the teacher's {{vigilant}} eye for faults had failed {{him for the}} first time in their experience. Not one of them had been reproved; they had chattered and giggled and drawn caricatures on the margin of the paper, as freely as if the master had left the room. Alban's wandering attention was indeed beyond the reach of control. His interview with Francine had doubled his sense of responsibility toward Emily--while he was further than ever from seeing how he could interfere, to any useful purpose, in his present position, and with his reasons for writing <b>under</b> <b>reserve.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{some mysterious}} way {{the bonds of}} sympathy, by which we had been {{hitherto}} more or less united, seemed to slacken and fall away. We lived on perfectly good terms with one another; {{but there was an}} unrecognized decrease of confidence among us, which I for one felt sometimes almost painfully. An unwholesome atmosphere of distrust enveloped us. Mr. Keller only believed, <b>under</b> <b>reserve,</b> that Madame Fontaine's persistent low spirits were really attributable, as she said, to nothing more important than nervous headaches. Fritz began to doubt whether Mr. Keller was really as well satisfied as he professed to be with the choice that his son had made of a portionless bride. Minna, observing that Fritz was occasionally rather more subdued and silent than usual, began to ask herself whether she was quite as dear to him, in the time of their prosperity, as in the time of their adversity. To sum up all, Madame Fontaine had her doubts of me--and I had my doubts (although she had saved Mr. Keller's life) of Madame Fontaine.|$|E

[...] "I forgot," [...] he writes, [...] "to mention to you that a kind of Poem in dialogue (in blank verse) or drama ... begun last summer in Switzerland, is finished; it is in three acts; but of a very wild, metaphysical, and inexplicable kind." [...] The letter is imperfect, but some pages of [...] "extracts" [...] which were forwarded under the same cover have been preserved. Ten days later (February 25) he reverts to these [...] "extracts," [...] and on February 28 he despatches a fair copy of the first act. On March 9 he remits the third and final act of his [...] "dramatic poem" [...] (a definition adopted as a second title), but <b>under</b> <b>reserve</b> as to publication, and with a strict injunction to Murray [...] "to submit it to Mr. G[ifford] and to whomsoever you please besides." [...] It is certain that this third act was written at Venice (Letter to Murray, April 14), and it may be taken for granted that the composition of the first two acts belongs to the tour in the Bernese Alps (September 17-29), or to the last days at Diodati (September 30 to October 5, 1816), when the estro (see Letter to Murray, January 2, 1817) was upon him, when his [...] "Passions slept," [...] and, in spite of all that had come and gone and could not go, his spirit was uplifted by the [...] "majesty and the power and the glory" [...] of Nature.|$|E

In the fourteen government-established cooperatives, each family received an exclusive area of 2 to 3 km² of grazing land; in times of drought, common land <b>under</b> <b>reserve</b> was to become available. The government committed itself to providing educational and health services as well as serving as a marketing outlet for excess stock.
