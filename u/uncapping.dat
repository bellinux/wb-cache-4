5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by <b>uncapping</b> or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{natural gas}} was usually {{obtained}} as {{a by-product of}} producing oil, since the small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to <b>uncapping</b> a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces. Unwanted natural gas was a disposal problem in the active oil fields. If {{there was not a}} market for natural gas near the wellhead it was prohibitively expensive to pipe to the end user.|$|E
2500|$|Task {{partitioning}} {{refers to}} the division of one task into sequential actions done {{by more than one}} individual. The focus here is on the task, and its division, rather than on the individuals performing it. [...] For example, [...] "hygienic behavior" [...] is a task in which worker bees uncap and remove diseased brood cells that may be affected by American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae) or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. [...] In this case, individual bees often focus on either <b>uncapping</b> or removing diseased brood. [...] Therefore, the task is partitioned, and performed by multiple individuals.|$|E

60|$|Such eyes {{may find}} {{as great a}} store of picturesque {{meanings}} in the cork-woods of Monte Mario, tenderly loved of all equestrians. These are less severely pastoral than our Arcadia, and you might more properly lodge there a damosel of Ariosto than a nymph of Theocritus. Among them is strewn a lovely wilderness of flowers and shrubs, and the whole place has such a charming woodland air, that, casting about {{me the other day}} for a compliment, I declared that it. reminded me of New Hampshire. My compliment had a double edge, and I had no sooner uttered it than I smiled--or sighed--to perceive in all the undiscriminated botany about me the wealth of detail, the idle elegance and grace of Italy alone, the natural stamp of the land which has the singular privilege of making one love her unsanctified beauty all but as well as those features of one's own country toward which nature's small allowance doubles that of one's own affection. For this effect of casting a spell no rides have more value than those you take in Villa Doria or Villa Borghese; or don't take, possibly, if you prefer to reserve these particular regions--the latter in especial--for your walking hours. People do ride, however, in both villas, which deserve honourable mention in this regard. Villa Doria, with its noble site, its splendid views, its great groups of stone-pines, so clustered and yet so individual, its lawns and flowers and fountains, its altogether princely disposition, is a place where one may pace, well mounted, of a brilliant day, with an agreeable sense of its being rather a more elegant pastime to balance in one's stirrups than to trudge on even the smoothest gravel. But at Villa Borghese the walkers have the best of it; for they are free of those adorable outlying corners and bosky byways which the rumble of barouches never reaches. In March the place becomes a perfect epitome of the spring. You cease to care much for the melancholy greenness of the disfeatured statues which has been your chief winter's intimation of verdure; and before you are quite conscious of the tender streaks and patches in the great quaint grassy arena round which the Propaganda students, in their long skirts, wander slowly, like dusky seraphs revolving the gossip of Paradise, you spy the brave little violets <b>uncapping</b> their azure brows beneath the high-stemmed pines. One's walks here would take us too far, and one's pauses detain us too long, when in the quiet parts under the wall one comes across a group of charming small school- boys in full-dress suits and white cravats, shouting over their play in clear Italian, while a grave young priest, beneath a tree, watches them over the top of his book. It sounds like nothing, but the force behind it and the frame round it, the setting, the air, the chord struck, make it a hundred wonderful things.|$|E

50|$|<b>Uncapping,</b> in {{the context}} of cable modems, refers to a number of {{activities}} performed to alter an Internet service provider's modem settings. It is sometimes done for the sake of bandwidth (i.e. by buying a 512kbit/s access modem and then altering it to 10Mbit/s), pluggable interfaces (as by using more than one public ID), or any configurable options a DOCSIS modem can offer. However, <b>uncapping</b> may be considered an illegal activity, such as theft of service.|$|E

We report for the first time a PL emission obtained from <b>uncapped</b> as-grown (non-oxidized) InAs QDs. We also report a dramatic change in the energy position and intensity of the PL as the quantum dots get closer to the top surface of the structure and make a direct comparison between the PL from non-oxidized and oxidized <b>uncapped</b> InAs/GaAs QDs. On the basis of these observations, we offer a physical explanation, based on oxidized versus non-oxidized <b>uncapped</b> QDs, for the discrepancies between previously reported results...|$|R
50|$|The {{traditionally}} <b>uncapped</b> {{player of}} the Barbarians side was Tim Visser.

50|$|Cutouts — stub {{exhaust pipes}} {{installed}} {{behind the front}} wheels that allow <b>uncapping</b> for noise and power. In the 1950s were home made from gas tank filler necks with gas caps and water pipes with screw on caps.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{extraction}} process is to break or remove all of the cappings. This may be accomplished using an automated uncapper machine or with a manually-operated <b>uncapping</b> knife. Usually, these tools are used together, along with a pronged cappings fork. To facilitate cutting off these wax cappings, the knife is often heated. The removed bits of wax, called cappings, are rich in honey which can be slowly drained off with the help of some heating. This 'cappings wax' is very valuable and often used to make candles or other products. Automated <b>uncapping</b> machines normally work by abrading the surface of the wax with moving chains or bristles or hot knives. This, while messy, makes the process easier than doing this task manually.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} honey producers use Langstroth hive frames. The {{honey extraction}} process yields beeswax from the <b>uncapping</b> process. The highest quality beeswax is almost white. Lower quality beeswax from older cappings or comb is yellow or brown. Beeswax should be rendered and filtered {{before it is}} sold.|$|E
