5|$|The FIA {{introduced}} {{more stringent}} {{tests on the}} cars at the Malaysian race to ensure floor mounting systems used by Ferrari and BMW Sauber were not in breach of the regulations. After the first race {{of the season in}} Australia, the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car's <b>undertray</b> to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed. Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight line speed. Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 car would not be compromised in any way by the required modifications.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the unique door design, the Z1 body featured several other innovations: removable plastic body panels, a flat <b>undertray,</b> a roll-hoop integrated into the windscreen surround and continuously zinc welded seams.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamics were a {{focus of}} the vehicle design. The flat plastic <b>undertray</b> is used for ground effect {{aerodynamics}} and the rear bumper - {{in conjunction with the}} aerodynamically shaped muffler - forms a diffuser to reduce rear lift. The front end reportedly induces a high-pressure zone just forward of the front wheels to increase front-wheel traction. The Z1 has a drag coefficient of 0.36Cd with the top up or 0.43Cd with it down.|$|E
50|$|The street circuit {{used for}} this Grand Prix {{laid out in the}} center of Detroit had been {{modified}} a little- the inside wall at the left-right sequence of corners on Beaubien Street between Congress Street and the notoriously bumpy Larned Street had been moved closer to the street itself, which made the right hander transitioning between Beaubien and Larned Streets slower than before. A bridge connecting 2 buildings flanking Larned Street had also been built; which actually hid the worst bumps on Larned from camera view- although these bumps were made obvious to viewers by the car's <b>undertrays</b> creating sparks thanks to the cars bouncing over these bumps rather violently.|$|R
50|$|There are few {{regulations}} or {{requirements on}} aerodynamics. Most teams do not build aerodynamic packages as the speeds involved in FSAE competition rarely exceed 60 mph, and design judging tends to frown upon aerodynamic parts {{that do not}} have definite test data, usually in the form of wind tunnel testing or at least computational fluid dynamics analysis. Therefore, most cars that do utilize aerodynamic downforce tend to develop their entire car around the aerodynamic package, including massive wings and <b>undertrays.</b> The benefit of a well-developed aerodynamic package is evident; depending on how fast the course is, the slowest aero-package cars sometimes run several seconds per lap faster than any of the non-aero cars.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} is {{a double}} wishbone design, while the rear suspension is a two-link live axle design utilizing trailing arms. Brake rotors must be made of magnetic cast iron or steel and may not exceed 12.72 inches (32.3 centimeters) in diameter. The only aerodynamic components on the vehicles are the front splitter, spoiler, NACA ducts in the windows only, and side skirts. The use of rear diffusers, vortex generators, canards, wheel well vents, hood vents, and <b>undertrays</b> is strictly prohibited. While the cars may reach speeds of about 200 mph (321.8 km/h) on certain tracks, Russ Wicks drove a stock car built to NASCAR's specifications 244.9 mph (394.1 km/h) during a speed record attempt at the Bonneville Salt Flats in October 2007.|$|R
25|$|Some teams made {{alterations}} {{to their}} cars {{in preparation for}} the race. Jaguar introduced a revised floor along with new bargeboards, whilst McLaren introduced minor aerodynamic revisions which included new front brake ducts. Sauber had brought new brake ducts and revised their bargeboards and Williams also brought new bargeboards for the race weekend. Prost reverted to an older <b>undertray</b> for Jean Alesi's car who preferred it over a new version débuted for the race.|$|E
25|$|The F40 was {{designed}} with aerodynamics in mind. For speed the car relied more on its shape than its power. Frontal area was reduced, and airflow greatly smoothed, but stability rather than terminal velocity was a primary concern. So too was cooling as the forced induction engine generated {{a great deal}} of heat. In consequence, the car was somewhat like an open-wheel racing car with a body. It had a partial <b>undertray</b> to smooth airflow beneath the radiator, front section, and the cabin, and a second one with diffusers behind the motor, but the engine bay was not sealed. Nonetheless, the F40 had an impressively low drag coefficient of 0.34 with lift controlled by its spoilers and wing.|$|E
25|$|Then, on lap 8, Pierluigi Martini {{spun off}} into the wall and his front wing, which {{separated}} from his car, was hit by Patrese and got stuck in Patrese's <b>undertray.</b> At the front, Mansell was no longer attacking Senna but Senna was unable to pull away. The conditions became better but after another seven laps, the weather started to become worse and more drivers began to spin off, including Mansell who smashed into a wall- which allowed McLaren to win the Constructors' Championship. Berger also spun off twice on the next lap as Senna gestured to the marshals {{to try to get}} the race stopped. Patrese followed suit and finally it was stopped after Senna had finished lap 16. However, the officials had decided to count the results back 2 laps to lap 14 which meant that Senna won from Mansell, Berger, Piquet, Patrese and Morbidelli. Only half points were awarded because the race was stopped before 75% of the distance was over. This particular Grand Prix set a record (that still stands as of today) as the shortest Grand Prix ever run.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reflects}} on two areas of vehicle aerodynamics, optimising cooling performance and features {{that will improve}} {{the handling of the}} car. Both areas will {{have a significant impact on}} the overall performance of the car and at the same time these areas are linked to each other. The considered vehicle in this study was the Chalmers Formula Student 2011 Formula SAE car and the flow field was analysed using both numerical simulations as well as performing wind tunnel experiments on a 1 : 3 -scale model of the car. The focus on increasing downforce without increasing the aerodynamic drag is particularly good in Formula SAE since fuel economy is an event at the competition. Therefore, the intention of this work is to present a study on how <b>undertrays</b> with different design such as added foot plates, diffuser and strakes can improve the downforce and reduce the drag. Apart from this focus has been towards a common issue among open wheeled race cars with the radiator placed behind the front wheels and how changes in this area will influence the handling of the car. Interference effects between these parts were seen as well as the influence on the general aerodynamic performance of the car...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{discussed}} {{issues in}} {{the weeks leading up}} the race involved the ongoing development of aero kit regulations, and the competitive balance between the two engine manufacturers (Chevrolet and Honda). After three major crashes in 2015, in which cars flipped over and became airborne, series officials attempted to address the situation by adding [...] "dome skids" [...] - aerodynamic devices affixed to the <b>undertrays</b> of the cars, designed to keep the cars on the ground during a crash. This rule change was met with some resistance, particularly from the Honda teams, after testing revealed them to be unsettling to the cars' handling. After practice opened, however, the issues appeared to be have been mostly resolved. None of the crashes that have occurred during practice or qualifying saw the respective cars flip over. With respect to the engine competition, Chevrolet entered the month having swept all five race wins and all five race pole positions. In addition, Chevrolet had noticeably outperformed Honda in the 2015 race, sweeping the top five spots in qualifying, as well as the top four positions on race day. After practice opened, however, Honda teams led the speed chart on three of the four days (one day was rained out), and also secured the pole position - Honda's first Indy 500 pole since 2011.|$|R
25|$|Räikkönen and Heidfeld took {{seventh and}} ninth {{positions}} respectively for Sauber; Räikkönen {{was satisfied with}} his starting position as he made small changes to the handling balance of his C20 chassis, whilst Heidfeld was held up by Ralf Schumacher and both McLarens who were driving slowly in the final section of the track, causing Heidfeld to go up across an inside kerb and onto grass which lost him three-tenths of a second. The two Saubers were sandwiched by Montoya in the faster Williams who bent a push-rod on his first run after clipping the kerb at the exit of Becketts corner and took over the spare car set up for Ralf Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher rounded out the top ten qualifiers and said he felt unlucky as his fastest lap was set on his second run and was held up by traffic when track conditions had improved. Panis recorded the eleventh fastest lap time and reported the balance of his car was good but {{had a problem with}} his traction control system which was quickly rectified by his engineers. Villeneuve had an engine problem on his first run and went into the spare BAR monocoque until his race car was fixed and was twelfth fastest. He was ahead of de la Rosa in the faster of the two Jaguars and did not report any problems. Alesi found the old version of his Prost's <b>undertray</b> gave him more consistent handling and recorded the 14th fastest lap. Irvine qualified in 15th position and had a suspension failure and switched to the spare Jaguar which was set-up for de la Rosa. Burti had a large amount of understeer which restricted him to 16th on the grid. Verstappen gradually improved his car throughout the session and secured 17th place; his team-mate Bernoldi took the 20th position and had a throttle issue on his first run which affected his momentum and was held up by Verstappen on his final run. The two Arrows were separated by the Benetton's of Jenson Button and Giancarlo Fisichella; Button was unable to record a faster lap time because he was held up by traffic and Fisichella complained of understeer and poor grip. Alonso secured 21st and completed the grid. His team-mate Tarso Marques failed to set a lap within 107% of Michael Schumacher's pole time and was not allowed to start the race after an appeal by Minardi was rejected by the stewards.|$|E

5000|$|Riccardo Patrese was {{struggling}} with his car because a front wing, from another car, got stuck towards {{the front of his}} <b>undertray.</b> This was spotted by James Hunt in the BBC race commentary, although Murray Walker had suggested earlier that it was the <b>undertray</b> that was loose. Mansell then, {{as a result of the}} increasing downpour, spun off on the start of lap 16 on the Wakefield Road straight, before turn 3, having [...] "instantly gone out of control" [...] according to Mansell himself. The torrential downpour also made Michele Alboreto spin out of the race on lap 15 as well as Stefano Modena, in his last race for Tyrrell-Honda, although he continued. Nelson Piquet also spun at the high-speed Stag turn but was able to recover and he continued as well.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though there}} have been {{numerous}} tweaks to the Tuscan's chassis and suspension, the overall size and appearance of the variants remain virtually identical apart from minor aerodynamic aids to the S model {{in the form of an}} <b>undertray</b> in the front and a small boot-lid spoiler on the rear.|$|E

50|$|The team is {{redesigning}} most {{of their}} components to further reduce weight and is exploring upcoming materials and manufacturing techniques to optimise the overall construction of the car. The team plans to introduce Data Acquisition System (DAQ), Carbon Fibre Push & Pull Rods, CF <b>Undertray</b> and with extensive testing and driver training is sure of landing a podium finish at the competition this season.|$|E

50|$|The {{car body}} was {{developed}} using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) before the car ever saw a wind tunnel. Every {{area from the}} outer skin to the lightweight, composite <b>undertray</b> to the cooling airflow (even {{the shape of the}} exterior mirrors) was optimised using this process. The higher, squarer tail is more efficient aerodynamically than a lower, rounded one, and the XF's coupé-like roofline and raised bootlid lip improve airflow over the rear of the car.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the DUT13 got an {{aerodynamics}} package, {{something the}} team {{up until then}} had never experimented with. Featuring 4-wheel drive, the car now also disposed of a front wing, rear wing and <b>undertray,</b> significantly improving the traction of the car. Additionally, part of the electronics were changed, improving the traction control features and yaw rate controllers. The team won again the Formula Student competition in Germany, and placed second in the competition in Austria.|$|E

Prost reverted to an older <b>undertray</b> for Jean Alesi's car who preferred it over a new version débuted for the race.|$|E
50|$|The Porsche 956 also {{appeared}} with two different rear wing designs. The cars were {{fitted with a}} larger, high downforce rear wing for most events. For the Circuit de la Sarthe at Le Mans however where top speed on the almost 6 km long Mulsanne Straight was essential, the 956 was fitted with a much lower and smaller 'low drag' wing to enable the cars to reach speeds of around 225 mph. Some of the privateer teams would also experiment with a front wing attached to the cars at the tighter circuits {{in an effort to}} increase front downforce, but wind tunnel testing eventually found that these wings were disrupting the airflow over the car and actually increased the aerodynamic drag making the cars slower in a straight line. Notably, the factory backed Rothmans Porsche team did not make use of the smaller front wings. Many attributed this {{to the fact that the}} Rothmans cars used a one piece body <b>undertray</b> which helped increase the downforce generated by the ground effect aerodynamics while the customer 956's used a twin <b>undertray</b> which disrupted the air flow and slightly decreased the downforce.|$|E
50|$|The Free-Way had a welded {{tubular steel}} frame, with a {{secondary}} perimeter frame at bumper height {{to protect the}} driver from impacts. Suspension was fully independent, with two wheels in front and a single wheel in the rear. The fully enclosed two-piece fiberglass body was approximately 0.125 in thick and had the colour molded into the material and was available in high-visibility red, yellow, or orange. The lower body included a full <b>undertray</b> to reduce the drag coefficient of the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|A tureen is {{a serving}} dish for {{foods such as}} soups or stews, often shaped as a broad, deep, oval vessel with fixed handles and a low domed cover with a knob or handle. Over the centuries, tureens have {{appeared}} in many different forms, some round, rectangular, or made into fanciful shapes such as animals or wildfowl. Tureens may be ceramic - either the glazed earthenware called faience or porcelain - or silver, and customarily they stand on an <b>undertray</b> or platter made en suite.|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} {{upgrades}} to Hamilton's {{car for the}} next race at the Nürburgring for the German Grand Prix were positive and saw him qualify in 5th, with Kovalainen in 6th place. However, a collision with Mark Webber's Red Bull at the first corner punctured a tyre and damaged the <b>undertray</b> of the car which effectively ended any chance of competing for a points scoring position, and Hamilton finished the race in 18th and last place with Kovalainen scraping into the points in 8th.|$|E
50|$|F1 {{regulations}} heavily {{limit the}} use of ground effect aerodynamics which are a highly efficient means of creating downforce with a small drag penalty. The underside of the vehicle, the <b>undertray,</b> must be flat between the axles. A 10 mm thick wooden plank or skid block runs {{down the middle of}} the car to prevent the cars from running low enough to contact the track surface; this skid block is measured before and after a race. Should the plank be less than 9 mm thick after the race, the car is disqualified.|$|E
50|$|New {{carbon fibre}} pieces include both {{the front and}} rear bumpers as well as front <b>undertray,</b> rear fenders, side intakes and decklid that {{contribute}} to the significant weight savings over the 650S. Alcantara is used throughout the interior where carpeting is removed and removal of the air conditioning unit and new carbon fibre race seats together save 26.5 kg. 1 millimetre thinner window glass further reduces weight by 3 kg. This extreme focus in weight saving results in a dry weight of 1230 kg, some 100 kg less than the 650S.|$|E

50|$|The Motor {{magazine}} road-tested an XK120 roadster in November 1949. This pre-production car, {{chassis number}} 660001, road-registered as HKV 455, {{was the first}} prototype built. It was also the 1948 London Motor Show display model, and had been driven by Prince Bira in the 1949 Silverstone Production Car Race. When tested, it had the 8:1 compression ratio, was fitted with an <b>undertray,</b> and ran with hood and sidescreens in place. The magazine reported {{a top speed of}} 124.6 mph, acceleration from 0-60 mph in 10.0 seconds and fuel consumption of 19.8 mpgimp. The car as tested cost £1263 including taxes.|$|E
