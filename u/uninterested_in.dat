5|$|Betsy Cline – The head cheerleader, Jeff's girlfriend, and {{the only}} child of the county commissioner, Harold Cline and his wife Liz. She is in love with Mark, yet he is <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> her.|$|E
5|$|Political {{opponents have}} used Keynes's {{sexuality}} to attack his academic work. One {{line of attack}} held that he was <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> the long term ramifications of his theories {{because he had no}} children.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{computer}} scientists were generally <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> business applications when COBOL was created {{and were not}} involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an early}} {{episode in the}} series, Morgan pursues Sarah's DEA friend Carina, and he unknowingly becomes {{involved}} in the spy intrigue of the episode. [...] Carina is <b>uninterested</b> enough <b>in</b> Morgan to frequently forget his name, but feigns a romantic interest in him at her convenience.|$|R
6000|$|He made {{room for}} her with feverish courtesy. She {{lived in the}} same house--He instantly, without a bit of {{encouragement}} from the <b>uninterested</b> way <b>in</b> which she snipped the door to, made up a whole novel about her. Gee! She was a French countess, who lived in a reg'lar chateau, and she was staying in Bloomsbury incognito, seeing the sights. She was a noble. She was-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Fleshy is a skinny, hairless housecat {{resembling}} the Pink Panther cartoon character. Fleshy is remarkable for his being the complete opposite of feline attitudes: he is goofy, fearful, unable to catch {{even the most}} innocuous of butterflies. Fleshy is frequently shown to be entirely <b>uninterested</b> while <b>in</b> the presence of people, but once alone, he shows his intelligence to be on par with humans. He has a son, who was abducted (and then returned) by the same aliens that took Robotman.|$|R
5|$|The Bedouins, the Ghatafan {{and other}} Confederates from Najd {{had already been}} {{compromised}} by Muhammad's negotiations. They had taken part in the expedition in hopes of plunder, rather than any particular prejudice against Islam. They lost hope as chances of success dwindled, <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> continuing the siege. The two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|The power {{stations}} {{were among the}} last remaining heavy industrial buildings in modern Tyneside, and their demolition was felt by many Tynesiders to have {{marked the end of}} industrial Tyneside. The National Trust was then <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> the preservation of modern structures such as this.|$|E
5|$|During the 1830s and 1840s, other faith {{groups also}} came to St. Louis, {{including}} the first Jewish congregation in the area, the United Hebrew Congregation, which was organized in 1837. Followers of Mormonism arrived in 1831, and in 1854, they organized the first LDS church in St. Louis. Despite these events, during the pre-Civil War era most of the population were culturally Catholic or <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> organized religion.|$|E
50|$|One {{week before}} the long-awaited match-up, on June 19, 1976, Valdez's brother was murdered during a barroom fight in Colombia. Already in Monte Carlo for the fight, Valdez wanted {{to pull out of}} it to join his family in mourning. But he was contractually bound to fight Monzon, so he had to stay in Europe, and on June 26, Valdez, who to many {{observers}} seemed rather <b>uninterested,</b> lost <b>in</b> the unification bout to Monzon in a 15-round unanimous decision. Valdez won two more fights after returning to Colombia.|$|R
50|$|Marakrithi is {{to boost}} the interested, inspire the <b>uninterested</b> to excel <b>in</b> the field of {{robotics}} and to gain knowledge, confidence and experience. The field of robotics isn’t a single domain where one gains a specialized knowledge or intelligence about specific thing, instead it is a domain where everyone gets specialized in every aspects like mechanical, electronics, software.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Data {{filtering}} is {{an important}} approach to reduce energy consumption. Following this idea, Interest {{is used as a}} constraint to filter <b>uninterested</b> data <b>in</b> sensor networks. Within these interested data some are more valuable than others. Sometimes among these interested data, we hope to process the more important data first. By using Reward to denote the important level of data, in this paper, we present a packet scheduling algorithm by considering four constraints (Energy, Time, Reward, and Interest) simultaneously. Based on simulation result, we find out that our ETRI-PS packet scheduling algorithm can substantially improve the information quality and reduce energy consumption. 1...|$|R
5|$|In Washington, Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{conduct a}} {{discreet}} {{meeting with a}} Russian informant, Vsevlod Pudovkin, {{who claims to have}} seen a UFO at a secret research center. Upon returning to FBI headquarters, Mulder heads out on vacation to visit Graceland, leaving Scully to follow up on the Pudovkin case for him. Scully is <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> the case and expresses serious doubts about Pudovkin's credibility, leading to an argument with an inconsiderate Mulder. Scully becomes upset over the direction her life and career are going.|$|E
5|$|Lydia wanted Richardson {{to become}} a priest. In Brighton he served as an altar boy, which he enjoyed, but when sent at about fifteen to the nearby Xaverian College, a seminary for trainee priests, he ran away. As a pupil at a series of schools he was <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> most {{subjects}} and was an indifferent scholar. His Latin was poor, and during church services he would improvise parts of the Latin responses, developing a talent for invention when memory failed that proved useful in his later career.|$|E
5|$|Ned is a {{genuinely}} well-meaning good-natured person {{and is one}} of the few in Springfield to whom that description applies. Firmly religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a Republican and a devout Evangelical Christian who strictly follows the Bible literally and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. This has led to his frequent calls to Reverend Lovejoy, who has become increasingly frustrated with and <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> Flanders.|$|E
50|$|Developer George Herscu, {{head of the}} Australian-based {{real estate}} firm L. J. Hooker, first {{proposed}} to build a mall in Cincinnati, Ohio in the mid-1980s. Originally, his mall plans called for discount department stores such as TJ Maxx and Marshalls; these plans were later changed to include primarily upscale merchants. Three high-end department store chains—B. Altman, Bonwit Teller, and Sakowitz, none of which had ever operated in Ohio before—were proposed as anchor stores. The three chains were <b>uninterested,</b> so <b>in</b> 1987, Herscu bought controlling interest in the three chains. In addition to these three department stores, grocery store and discount retailer bigg's, and Elder-Beerman, a mid-range department store, were signed on as anchors.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Mr. Trenchard, having relighted his pipe, {{and set his}} hat rakishly {{atop his}} golden wig, strolled up the High Street, {{swinging}} his long cane {{very much like a}} gentleman taking the air in quest of an appetite for supper. He strolled past the Cross and on until he came to the handsome mansion--one of the few handsome houses in Bridgwater--where opulent Mr. Newlington had his residence. A small crowd had congregated about the doors, for word had gone forth that His Majesty was to sup there. Trenchard moved slowly through the people, seemingly <b>uninterested,</b> but, <b>in</b> fact, scanning closely every face he encountered. Suddenly, {{out of the corner of}} his eye, he espied in the indifferent light Mr. Richard Westmacott.|$|R
5000|$|Sheeran wrote [...] "Tenerife Sea" [...] {{while in}} Nashville, {{the capital of}} the US state of Tennessee. It was {{inspired}} by the events following the 2013 Grammy Awards, wherein his single [...] "The A Team" [...] was nominated for Song of the Year, a first Grammy nomination for Sheeran. He lost the award to the American band Fun for its song [...] "We Are Young". Along with his girlfriend, Sheeran attended the after-party where he, being in a new experience, felt <b>uninterested</b> participating <b>in</b> the conversations. According to Sheeran, [...] "neither of them wanted to be there - you just want to be with this one person". He also told The San Francisco Examiner: [...] "It was a very odd atmosphere, where everyone was out for themselves. And I found myself being competitive, as well, and pissed off that I didn’t win, which felt very unhealthy." ...|$|R
5|$|Peart soon {{settled into}} his new position, also {{becoming}} the band's primary lyricist. Before joining Rush, {{he had written}} few songs, but, with the other members largely <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> writing lyrics, Peart's previously underutilized writing became as noticed as his musicianship. The band was working hard to establish themselves as a recording act, and Peart, {{along with the rest}} of the band, began to undertake extensive touring.|$|E
5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E
5|$|To {{help fund}} his {{research}} {{and that of}} other scientists — and because the CDC were dismissive of his expertise and <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> his assistance — Sonnabend collaborated with his friend Mathilde Krim and others {{to set up the}} AIDS Medical Foundation (AMF) in 1983. This organisation would later become amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, one of the world's leading nonprofit supporters of HIV/AIDS research, prevention and advocacy.|$|E
25|$|Eliminating the murderer's {{attempt at}} {{stealing}} the jewels from Jennifer Sutcliffe by {{posing as a}} stranger with a new tennis racquet from her Aunt Gina; subsequently Jennifer is not the unobservant and <b>uninterested</b> character as <b>in</b> the novel. Another small fact related {{to the theme of}} concealed identity – a pregnant and hardly recognisable Miss Rich being in Ramat {{at the time of the}} revolution – is also left out of the adaptation, although Miss Rich was still pregnant and delivered a stillborn child during a leave of absence in the adaptation.|$|R
5000|$|After {{having another}} son in February 1848, {{she took a}} job as a tailor. Her husband had a harder time finding work, and they were offered a job {{maintaining}} a hotel in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. There Adam and their baby became very sick. Mary's leg swelled and she almost had her leg amputated. She records that she prayed for God to spare her limb. While living there, a man stopped by her house and offered her a medicine that would supposedly heal anything. <b>Uninterested,</b> but <b>in</b> an attempt to get the man to leave, she, her husband and her aunt tasted the medicine. She even gave some to her children. Within moments, they all became ill and two of her children died. The man had given them poison. The man was caught by authorities, but Mary begged them not to hang him. They were going to put the man on trial, but he escaped and was never tried.|$|R
5000|$|Warren, {{when working}} with the Defence Science and Technology Organisations' Aeronautical Research Laboratory (Melbourne, Australia), {{published}} a 1954 report entitled [...] "A Device for Assisting Investigation into Aircraft Accidents" [...] and built a prototype FDR called [...] "The ARL Flight Memory Unit" [...] in 1957. The first coupled FDR / CVR prototype designed with civilian aircraft in mind, for explicit post-crash examination purposes, was produced in 1958. However, aviation authorities {{from around the world}} were largely <b>uninterested.</b> This changed <b>in</b> 1958 when Sir Robert Hardingham, the Secretary of the British Air Registration Board, visited the ARL and was introduced to Warren.|$|R
5|$|When the CIA {{failed to}} receive {{approval}} for funding, McDonnell approached the U.S. Air Force with the project; however the Air Force proved <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> adopting the CIA project, despite {{the support of}} General Bernard Schriever, chief of the Air Force Systems Command. Therefore, in late 1967 the Isinglass project was terminated, with a brief effort to revive the project in 1968 proving unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|With {{support from}} California (because {{the state had}} profited from the import of sugar), Kalākaua again {{approached}} Congress. When the United States still seemed <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> reciprocity, he threatened to forge more favorable export agreements with Australia or New Zealand. Congress feared that a treaty between Hawaii and Australia or New Zealand would result in annexation by one of those countries instead of the United States. Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii, he signed the treaty in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics {{to a greater degree}} than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E
50|$|Boniface and {{the other}} leaders sent envoys to Venice, Genoa, and other city-states in 1200 to {{negotiate}} a contract for transport to Egypt, the object of their crusade; one of the envoys was the future historian Geoffrey of Villehardouin. Earlier crusades focused on Palestine had involved the slow movement of large and disorganised land hosts across a generally hostile Anatolia. Egypt was now the dominant Muslim power in the eastern Mediterranean but also a major trading partner of Venice. An attack on Egypt would clearly be a maritime enterprise, requiring {{the creation of a}} fleet. Genoa was <b>uninterested,</b> but <b>in</b> March 1201 negotiations were opened with Venice, which agreed to transport 33,500 crusaders, a very ambitious number. This agreement required a full year of preparation {{on the part of the}} Venetians to build numerous ships and train the sailors who would man them, all the while curtailing the city's commercial activities. The crusading army was expected to consist of 4,500 knights (as well as 4,500 horses), 9,000 squires, and 20,000 foot-soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|Many strips appear only once. These {{very often}} have {{extremely}} surreal or bizarre storylines, and often feature celebrities. For example: [...] "Paul Daniels's Jet-Ski Journey to the Centre of Elvis", and [...] "Arse Farm - Young Pete and Jenny Nostradamus were spending the holidays with their Uncle Jed, who farmed arses {{deep in the}} heart of the Sussex countryside...". The latter type often follows the style of Enid Blyton and other popular children's adventure stories of the 1950s. Several strips were single-panel, one-off puns, such as [...] "Daft Bugger", which featured two bored, <b>uninterested</b> men engaged <b>in</b> the act of buggery; the buggerer then states that he has forgotten his car keys (thus making him [...] "daft").|$|R
5000|$|The Swatantra Party {{stands for}} the {{protection}} of the individual citizen against the increasing trespasses of the State. It is an answer to the challenge of the so-called Socialism of the Indian Congress party. It is founded on the conviction that social justice and welfare can be attained through the fostering of individual interest and individual enterprise in all fields better than through State ownership and Government control. It is based on the truth that bureaucratic management leads to loss of incentive and waste of resources. When the State trespasses beyond what is legitimately within its province, it just hands over the management from those who are interested in frugal and efficient management to bureaucracy which is untrained and <b>uninterested</b> except <b>in</b> its own survival.The Swatantra Party is founded on the claim that individual citizens should be free to hold their property and carry on their professions freely and through binding mutual agreements among themselves and that the State should assist and encourage in every possible way the individual in this freedom, but not seek to replace him. Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari writing about his party in 1960 ...|$|R
5|$|Airline {{customers}} were <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, {{adding to the}} heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E
5|$|Alex {{decides to}} remove {{this program and}} grant Ada her own mental freedom, as he is <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> a partner who cannot truly {{interact}} with him. Because removing the program is illegal and carries harsh consequences for both Ada and Alex, they have to pretend Ada is not self-aware. When a jealous love-interest of Alex reports Ada as sentient to the FBI, Alex and Ada attempt to flee the country. When they are intercepted by the FBI, Ada gets shot {{by the police and}} Alex is arrested. He is convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but Ada is not found to be sentient.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was <b>uninterested</b> <b>in</b> that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested {{that there would be a}} lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
5000|$|The G-Man exudes a calm, almost <b>uninterested</b> {{demeanor}} - <b>in</b> {{situations in}} which other humans panic and flee, the G-Man can be seen calmly straightening his tie or brushing his suit lapels with his hand. When working on the G-Man in Half-Life 2, animator Doug Wood stated, [...] "I wanted the player to never quite know what side the G-Man was on. I would have him express an apologetic look toward Freeman as he 'regretted' to put Dr. Freeman in this situation, but then give a slight smirk or smile at the end to keep you guessing about his sincerity." [...] Before animating the G-Man's facial expressions, Wood spent weeks {{in front of a}} mirror practicing the expressions on himself.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Stipe of R.E.M. {{commented that}} [...] "Søren {{has a great}} {{understanding}} of light, and a rare eye for beauty and portraiture," [...] while Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand said that [...] "working with Søren, nothing feels invasive or exploitative. You trust him and you forget about his lens. It becomes invisible. It makes him the photographer he is - not just how he responds to his light meter, sets his aperture or chooses a composition, but how he can capture what makes us the humans we are." [...] Ricky Wilson of Kaiser Chiefs once jokingly remarked [...] "anyone who can keep five <b>uninterested</b> grown men <b>in</b> coats from Leeds in his view-finder {{for more than five}} seconds, must be some kind of a genius." ...|$|R
6000|$|Although he was {{scarcely}} yet {{out of his}} teens, the Duke of Scaw was already marked out as a personality widely differing from others of his caste and period. Not in externals; therein he conformed correctly to type. His hair was faintly reminiscent of Houbigant, and {{at the other end}} of him his shoes exhaled the right SOUPÇON of harness-room; his socks compelled one's attention without losing one's respect; and his attitude in repose had just that suggestion of Whistler's mother, so becoming in the really young. It was within that the trouble lay, if trouble it could be accounted, which marked him apart from his fellows. The Duke was religious. Not in any of the ordinary senses of the word; he took small heed of High Church or Evangelical standpoints, he stood outside of all the movements and missions and cults and crusades of the day, uncaring and <b>uninterested.</b> Yet <b>in</b> a mystical-practical way of his own, which had served him unscathed and unshaken through the fickle years of boyhood, he was intensely and intensively religious. His family were naturally, though unobtrusively, distressed about it. [...] "I am so afraid it may affect his bridge," [...] said his mother.|$|R
