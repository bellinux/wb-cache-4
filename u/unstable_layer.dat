5000|$|The {{evolution}} of a castellanus thus depends {{on the amount of}} humidity and the characteristics of the unstable (or conditionally <b>unstable)</b> <b>layer.</b> Scattered clouds in the sky are generally found in relatively dry air with a more humid [...] If they show such a tall and narrow growth, the dry air surrounding them will not perpetuate the convection which will result in the cloud dissipation. However, a more extended cloud layer shows a higher relative humidity in the layer; a scenario more likely to be associated with overdevelopment of the towers.|$|E
5000|$|Within an <b>unstable</b> <b>layer</b> in the troposphere, {{the lifting}} of air parcels will occur, and {{continue}} {{for as long as}} the nearby atmosphere remains unstable. Once overturning through the depth of the troposphere occurs (with convection being capped by the relatively warmer, more stable layer of the stratosphere), deep convective currents lead to thunderstorm development when enough moisture is present. Over warm ocean waters and within a region of the troposphere with light vertical wind shear and significant low level spin (or vorticity), such thunderstorm activity can grow in coverage and develop into a tropical cyclone. [...] Over hot surfaces during warm days, unstable dry air can lead to significant refraction of the light within the air layer, which causes inferior mirages.|$|E
50|$|Castellanus {{can arise}} from clouds formed by either surface-based {{convection}} (e.g., cumulus) or elevated convection (e.g., altocumulus). Most of the convection in the towers, however, {{is due to}} instability (or conditional instability) at cloud height - not to convection below the cloud. The air surrounding the cloud is rapidly entrained into the towers. Cloud physics show that if a cloud does not contain enough humidity, the water vapour contained inside the cloud will only condense at a higher level, where {{the temperature of the}} ascending parcel reaches its saturation point. This will consequently dry out the cloud from the base and eventually result in its disappearance if this dry air does not condense below the cloud top.Conversely, if the air surrounding the cloud is nearly saturated and a thick, unstable (or conditionally <b>unstable)</b> <b>layer</b> exists above the initial cloud, convection will be able to continue. Then a tower, that will become wider and wider, will build up that will in some cases become a cumulonimbus.|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} anelastic {{model is}} used to study slantwise convection. The initial atmosphere is specified to be statically, inertially and symmetrically stable for dry convection. By varying the distribution of environmental relative humidity, a moist basic state potentially stable for upright convection but unstable for slantwise convection was obtained. The conditional symmetric instability (CSI) is released by specifying an initial streamfunction impulse. The results show a typical slantwise convective circulation. A cloudband extends along the updraft of the CSI circulation. An energy budget analysis shows that {{the main source of}} perturbation kinetic energy comes from the vertical shear of the basic state flow, although the buoyancy term is important during the initial onset stage. It is also found that the CSI circulation induces both upright convective <b>unstable</b> <b>layers</b> and horizontal inertial <b>unstable</b> <b>layers.</b> Although the decay stage has already been reached at the end of simulation, a neutral state with zero moist potential vorticity was not achieved.

A uniform rate of ascent is associated with inversion conditions. An ascent that shows two rates, a faster one through the first few hundred meters and a slower one above, occurs when the surface layer is undergoing mixing of either convective or mechanical origin.

40|$|As dust {{settles in}} a protoplanetary disk, a {{vertical}} shear develops because the dust-rich {{gas in the}} midplane orbits at a rate closer to true Keplerian than the slower-moving dust-depleted gas above and below. A classical analysis (neglecting the Coriolis force and differential rotation) predicts that Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs when the Richardson number of the stratified shear flow is below roughly one-quarter. However, earlier numerical studies showed that the Coriolis force makes <b>layers</b> more <b>unstable,</b> whereas horizontal shear may stabilize the layers. Simulations with a 3 D spectral code were used to investigate these opposing influences on the instability in order to resolve whether such layers can ever reach the dense enough conditions for the onset of gravitational instability. I confirm that the Coriolis force, {{in the absence of}} radial shear, does indeed make dust <b>layers</b> more <b>unstable,</b> however the instability sets in at high spatial wavenumber for thicker layers. When radial shear is introduced, the onset of instability depends on the amplitude of perturbations: small amplitude perturbations are sheared to high wavenumber where further growth is damped; whereas larger amplitude perturbations grow to magnitudes that disrupt the dust layer. However, this critical amplitude decreases sharply for thinner, more <b>unstable</b> <b>layers.</b> In 3 D simulations of <b>unstable</b> <b>layers,</b> turbulence mixes the dust and gas, creating thicker, more stable layers.

The intrinsic updraught inside convective cells constitutes a dominant but transient source for ice supersaturation.
