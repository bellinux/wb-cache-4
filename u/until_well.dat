5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya <b>until</b> <b>well</b> after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E

But the great event that did more to transform the bleak Sand Ridge into a fertile garden spot was {{the coming of the}} Davis and Weber Counties Canal in 1884.

From Wells to Salt Lake, the route, {{known as the}} Shafter Subdivision, loosely follows the historical route of the Hastings Cutoff, tunneling underneath the Pequop Mountains and crossing the Toano Range via Silver Zone Pass. The eastern approach to Silver Zone Pass features a near 360 degree horseshoe curve known as the Arnold loop. After crossing these mountain ranges the route proceeds southwest towards the Great Salt Lake Desert.
