40|$|International audienceTo {{increase}} the dependability of complex systems, one {{solution is to}} assess their state of health continuously through the monitoring of variables sensitive to potential degradation modes. When computed in an operating environment, these variables, known as health indicators, are subject to many uncertainties. Hence, the stochastic nature of health assessment combined {{with the lack of}} data in design stages makes it difficult to evaluate the efficiency of a health indicator before the system enters into service. This paper introduces a method for early validation of health indicators during the design stages of a system development process. This method uses physics-based modeling and <b>uncertainties</b> <b>propagation</b> to create simulated stochastic data. However, because of the large number of parameters defining the model and its computation duration, the necessary runtime for <b>uncertainties</b> <b>propagation</b> is prohibitive. Thus, kriging is used to obtain low computation time estimations of the model outputs. Moreover, sensitivity analysis techniques are performed upstream to determine the hierarchization of the model parameters and to reduce the dimension of the input space. The validation is based on three types of numerical key performance indicators corresponding to the detection, identification and prognostic processes. After having introduced and formalized the framework of uncertain systems modeling and the different performance metrics, the issues of sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling are addressed. The method is subsequently applied to the validation of a set of health indicators for the monitoring of an aircraft engine's pumping unit...|$|R

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulation}} (MCS) {{has been}} widely used for the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagations</b> of building simulation tools.

This paper introduces a fuzzy MCS for dealing with the aforementioned problems. In comparison with the MCS, the fuzzy MCS has the advantage of considering the aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, and can provide a family of probability distributions. This paper also discusses how fuzzy MCS could be effectively used for uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainty {{is present}} in our {{everyday}} decision making process {{as well as our}} understanding {{of the structure of the}} universe. As a result an intense and mathematically rigorous study of how uncertainty propagates in the dynamic systems present in our lives is warranted and arguably necessary. In this thesis we examine existing methods for <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation</b> in dynamic systems and present the results of a literature survey that justifies the development of a conservation based method of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation.</b> Conservation methods are physics based and physics drives our understanding of the physical world. Thus, it makes perfect sense to formulate an understanding of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation</b> in terms of one of the fundamental concepts in physics: conservation. We develop that theory for a small group of dynamic systems which are fundamental. They include ordinary differential equations, finite difference equations, differential inclusions and inequalities, stochastic differential equations, and Markov chains. The study presented considers <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation</b> from the initial condition where the initial condition is given as a prior distribution defined within a probability structure. This probability structure is preserved in the sense of measure. The results of this study are the first steps into a generalized theory for <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation</b> using conservation laws.

40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) is {{an established}} tool {{to quantify the}} environmental impact of a product. A good assessment of uncertainty is important for making well-informed decisions in comparative LCA, as well as for correctly prioritising data collection efforts. Under- or overestimation of output uncertainty (e. g. output variance) will lead to incorrect decisions in such matters. The presence of correlations between input parameters during <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation,</b> can increase or decrease the the output variance. However, most LCA studies that include uncertainty analysis, ignore correlations between input parameters during <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation,</b> which may lead to incorrect conclusions. Two approaches to include correlations between input parameters during <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation</b> and global sensitivity analysis were studied: an analytical approach and a sampling approach. The use of both approaches is illustrated for an artificial case study of electricity production. Results demonstrate that both approaches yield approximately the same output variance and sensitivity indices for this specific case study. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the analytical approach can be used to quantify the risk of ignoring correlations between input parameters during <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation</b> in LCA. We demonstrate that: (1) we can predict if including correlations among input parameters in <b>uncertainty</b> <b>propagation</b> will increase or decrease output variance; (2) we can quantify the risk of ignoring correlations on the output variance and the global sensitivity indices.

OBJECTIVES The objective is to develop both measurement and inversion techniques {{in order to build}} a 2 D geoacoustic uncertainty model (2 D-GeUM) over an operationally significant area. APPROACH In order to predict the impact of seabed geoacoustic uncertainties and variability on <b>propagation</b> <b>uncertainty</b> along a radial of interest, a 2 D geoacoustic uncertainty model (2 D-GeUM) is required. Such a model quantifies depth- and range-dependent geoacoustic properties and their uncertainties over the area of interest. For the QPE experiment, the ~ 50 km x 50 km area of interest was off northeast Taiwan, including part of the Chilung shelf, the East China Sea shelf and upper slope. The original approach included a combination of direct-path wide-angle seabed reflection measurements and geologic modeling as the basis for generating the 2 D-GeUM. The wide-angle reflection data were to be collected at multiple sites in the QPE experiment area northeast of Taiwan in FY 09. However, severe weather, equipment problems, and limitations of the research vessel prevented the data from being acquired. In lieu of this, the approach was to 1) advance theoretical understanding of the impact of seabed variability on <b>propagation</b> <b>uncertainty</b> (see [1]); 2) develop geoacoustic uncertainty methodologies using simulated and experimental data, (see [2 - 5]) and 3) apply the theory to the experimental geoacoustic <b>uncertainties</b> to examine <b>propagation</b> <b>uncertainty...</b>|$|R
