5|$|By 1910, the Regia Marina {{had decided}} {{to dispose of the}} {{obsolescent}} cruiser. Rumors that year of a potential sale to the Ecuadorian Navy prompted Peru to buy the old French cruiser , though Ecuador did not end up purchasing <b>Umbria.</b> Instead, in December 1910, the Regia Marina sold <b>Umbria</b> to the Haitian Navy, but she did not arrive in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, until 13 June 1911. After the sale, the ship was renamed Consul Gostrück. The ship was rumored to be carrying Cipriano Castro, the deposed president of Venezuela, though they later proved to be false. A German captain, Willy Meyer, was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti, but due to the lengthy delays, he quit. The cruiser sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced in handling the ship. <b>Umbria</b> was eventually raised and towed to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for disposal in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Numbers in {{parentheses}} list {{the year of}} twinning. The first agreement was signed {{with the city of}} Perugia, <b>Umbria,</b> in Italy on July 18, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{was present}} in Korea during the Russo-Japanese War, which took place {{primarily}} in neighboring Manchuria. She witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in February 1904 and rescued Russian survivors along with British and French cruisers. In 1905, <b>Umbria</b> represented Italy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 190608. Etruria visited the United States twice for major events, the Jamestown Exposition in 1907 and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909. Elba and Liguria were modified to operate an observation balloon to assist in spotting naval mines, which could be more easily seen from the air. In December 1910, <b>Umbria</b> was sold to the Haitian Navy and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she sank shortly after the transfer due to her new crew's inexperience.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile {{is widely}} {{distributed}} {{in much of}} mainland Italy, especially in the provinces of Trento, Lombardy, Veneto, Liguria, Tuscany, <b>Umbria,</b> Lazio, Campania, Apulia, and Calabria, {{as well as on}} the island of Sicily. Although it used to be found as far north as Lake Garda, P.fluviatile no longer occurs north of the River Po.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war years, jazz {{took off in}} Italy. All American post-war jazz styles, from bebop to free jazz and fusion have their equivalents in Italy. The universality of Italian culture ensured that jazz clubs would spring up throughout the peninsula, that all radio and then television studios would have jazz-based house bands, that Italian musicians would then start nurturing a home grown kind of jazz, based on European song forms, classical composition techniques and folk music. Currently, all Italian music conservatories have jazz departments, and there are jazz festivals each year in Italy, {{the best known of}} which is the <b>Umbria</b> Jazz Festival, and there are prominent publications such as the journal, Musica Jazz.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Regioni class {{served in a}} variety of roles {{throughout}} their careers. Their first decade in service was marked by frequent deployments abroad, interspersed between stints in the main Italian fleet, where they served as scouts for the battleships. In 1895, Etruria and much of the main fleet visited Germany for the opening ceremonies for the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Lombardia was stationed in South America in 1896, when an outbreak of yellow fever killed half of her crew while she was in Rio de Janeiro. In 1897, <b>Umbria</b> and Liguria were assigned to the Cruiser Squadron of the main fleet. Lombardia was deployed to China in 1901, where she replaced Elba, and to Italian Somaliland in 1903. There, she briefly skirmished with Somali rebels.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} their careers, including scouts for the main fleet, colonial cruisers, and representatives of Italy at major foreign events. Elba observed the Russo-Japanese War, including the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in 1904, where she picked up Russian survivors. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 1906. Elba and Liguria were equipped with observation balloons in 19071908. In 1910, <b>Umbria</b> was sold to Haiti and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she quickly sank under the care of her inexperienced crew. The remaining ships, except for Lombardia, took part in the Italo-Turkish War in 191112, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops, bombarded Ottoman ports, and instituted a blockade in the Red Sea.|$|E
25|$|Abruzzo holds many of Italy's best-preserved {{medieval and}} Renaissance hill towns that rival those in <b>Umbria</b> and Tuscany. Abruzzo boasts indeed twenty of The most {{beautiful}} villages in Italy, 2nd only to <b>Umbria</b> which has 22. These awards {{are not just}} for aesthetic beauty but also are for art and culture, historical importance and livability. The abrupt decline of Abruzzo's agricultural economy {{in the early to}} mid-20th-century saved some of the region's most beautiful hill towns from the onslaught of modern development. Many lie entirely within regional and national parks.|$|E
25|$|Examples of bank barns can {{be found}} in the United Kingdom, in the US, in eastern Canada, in Norway, in the Dordogne in France and in <b>Umbria,</b> Italy, amongst other places.|$|E
25|$|Annibale Bugnini {{was born}} in Civitella del Lago in <b>Umbria.</b> In 1928 he began his {{theological}} studies with the Congregation of the Mission and was ordained a priest on 26 July 1936.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is located}} in {{northern}} <b>Umbria,</b> near the border with Marche. The municipality borders Cagli (PU), Cantiano (PU), Costacciaro, Fossato di Vico, Gualdo Tadino, Perugia, Pietralunga, Scheggia e Pascelupo, Sigillo, Umbertide and Valfabbrica.|$|E
25|$|Gubbio is a {{town and}} comune in the far northeastern part of the Italian {{province}} of Perugia (<b>Umbria).</b> It {{is located on the}} lowest slope of Mt. Ingino, a small mountain of the Apennines.|$|E
25|$|Lepontic, {{the oldest}} attested Celtic {{language}} (from the 6th century BC). Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to <b>Umbria.</b> Coins with Lepontic inscriptions {{have been found}} in Noricum and Gallia Narbonensis.|$|E
25|$|The {{race has}} strong devotional, civic, and {{historical}} overtones {{and is one}} of the best-known folklore manifestations in Italy; the Ceri were chosen as the heraldic emblem on the coat of arms of <b>Umbria</b> as a modern administrative region.|$|E
25|$|In November 1883, Parthia {{made her}} 119th and final {{crossing}} for Cunard. After returning to Liverpool, Parthia was laid up. As part of Cunard's larger plans, Parthia {{was sold to}} John Elder & Co. in 1884 to help cover {{part of the cost}} of the new greyhounds <b>Umbria</b> and Etruria along with covering part of the cost for purchasing the ex-Guion Line greyhound Oregon. With the larger <b>Umbria,</b> Etruria and Oregon fulfilling Cunard's new ambitions, Sir William Pierce MP, the owner of John Elder & Co. had a new future in store for the old Parthia. Pierce planned on transferring the Parthia to his other company, the aforementioned Guion Line, for passenger/livestock service from Glasgow to Canada.|$|E
25|$|From there, the Pelasgians {{dispersed}} to Crete, the Cyclades, Histaeotis, Boeotia, Phocis, Euboea, {{the coast}} along the Hellespont and the islands, especially Lesbos, {{which had been}} colonized by Macar son of Crinacus. Most went to Dodona and eventually being driven from there to Italy then called Saturnia. They landed at Spina {{at the mouth of}} the Po River. Still others crossed the Apennine Mountains to <b>Umbria</b> and being driven from there went to the country of the Aborigines. These consented to a treaty and settled them at Velia. They and the Aborigenes took over <b>Umbria</b> but were dispossessed by the Tyrrhenians. The author continues to detail the tribulations of the Pelasgians and then goes on to the Tyrrhenians, whom he is careful to distinguish from the Pelasgians.|$|E
25|$|Other correspondences {{include the}} ancient {{name of the}} Lake of Bracciano, Sabatinus Lacus {{and the town of}} Sabate on its shores, and the river Sāpis in <b>Umbria,</b> names based on a Praeindoeuropean root *sāb- meaning water, seen also in the name Vada Sabatia (today Vado Ligure).|$|E
25|$|Saint Francis is {{considered}} the first Italian poet by literary critics. He believed commoners {{should be able to}} pray to God in their own language, and he wrote often in the dialect of <b>Umbria</b> instead of Latin. His writings are considered to have great literary and religious value.|$|E
25|$|His example drew {{others to}} him. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The {{brothers}} lived a simple {{life in the}} deserted lazar house of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent {{much of their time}} wandering through the mountainous districts of <b>Umbria,</b> making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.|$|E
25|$|The Romanesque façade {{was built}} with stones from the Monte Subasio. It {{is a typical}} example of the style found in 12th-century churches of <b>Umbria.</b> This façade is divided in three sections. The rather bare top level is {{triangular}} with an empty semi-circular arch in the middle, probably intended to contain a frieze or a mosaic.|$|E
25|$|The {{party had}} roughly 10–15% support across Italy, having its strongholds in Central and Southern Italy (Lazio 18.6%, <b>Umbria</b> 15.2%, Marche 14.3%, Abruzzo 14.3%, Apulia 13.2%, Sardinia 12.9%, Tuscany 12.6% and Campania 12.6% {{in the last}} general election), scoring badly in Lombardy (10.2%) and Sicily (10.9%), while {{competing}} in the North-East (Friuli-Venezia Giulia 15.5% and Veneto 11.3%).|$|E
25|$|Grenache is {{also found}} in Sicily, <b>Umbria</b> (in Trasimeno lake area), Marche (called Bordò) and Calabria. Grenache has been grown in Israel since the 19th century and was once an {{important}} grape in the Algerian wine industry. Today there are still some producers in Morocco producing Grenache rosés. Sizable plantings of Grenache are also found in Cyprus and scattered among the Greek islands.|$|E
25|$|The central wall is {{decorated}} with the Glory of St. Bernardino, on two levels as was the lost Assumption by Perugino. The lower section portrays Bernardino on a rock, with open arms, surmounted by two angels crowning him. He is flanked by the saints Augustine and Antony of Padua, while in the background is a landscape inspired by those of <b>Umbria.</b> The upper sector depicts a blessing Christ within an almond, with angels and musicians.|$|E
25|$|However, Rome’s {{dominance}} over central Italy {{and part}} of southern Italy was not fully established yet. Etruria and <b>Umbria</b> were not quite pacified. There were two expeditions to Umbria; there were wars with the Etruscans in 301 BC and in 298 BC. The latter was the year the Third Samnite War broke out. The second war accelerated the process of Roman expansion and the third war established Rome’s dominance of the areas concerned.|$|E
25|$|Italian Merlots {{are often}} {{characterized}} by their light bodies and herbal notes. Merlot's low acidity {{serves as a}} balance for the higher acidity in many Italian wine grapes with the grape often being used in blends in the Veneto, Alto Adige and <b>Umbria.</b> Global warming is potentially having an influence on Italian Merlot as more cooler-climate regions in northern Italy are being able to ripen the grape successfully while other regions already planted are encountering issues with over-ripeness.|$|E
25|$|The bulk {{of today}} Italy was {{inhabited}} by Italic tribes who occupied the modern regions of Lazio, <b>Umbria,</b> Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Basilicata, Calabria, Apulia and Sicily. Sicily, {{in addition to}} having an Italic population in the Sicels, also was inhabited by the Sicani and the Elymians, of uncertain origin. The Veneti, most often regarded as an Italic tribe, chiefly inhabited the Veneto, but extended as far east as Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Istria, and had colonies as far south as Lazio.|$|E
25|$|Pope Pius VI, being {{obliged to}} coin {{a great deal}} of copper money, gave the minting of it to a great many cities of the Patrimony of Peter, of <b>Umbria</b> and of the Marches, which, {{together}} with those already named, continued to strike these coins; among them were Civitavecchia, Gubbio, Matelica, Ronciglione (the coins of 1799 showing the burning of this city are famous), Terni and Tivoli. Pius VII suppressed all the mints except those of Rome and of Bologna.|$|E
25|$|After his death, the {{influence}} of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Raphael's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models. His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by Giorgio Vasari: his early years in <b>Umbria,</b> then {{a period of about}} four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of Florence, followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two Popes and their close associates.|$|E
25|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, many {{pigments}} {{were known}} by the location where they were produced. Pigments based on minerals and clays often bore {{the name of the}} city or region where they were mined. Raw Sienna and Burnt Sienna came from Siena, Italy, while Raw Umber and Burnt Umber came from <b>Umbria.</b> These pigments were among the easiest to synthesize, and chemists created modern colors based on the originals that were more consistent than colors mined from the original ore bodies. But the place names remained.|$|E
25|$|Garibaldi {{was unwilling}} to stop at this point, and planned an {{immediate}} invasion of the Papal States. Cavour feared France in that case would declare war to defend the Pope and successfully stopped Garibaldi from initiating his attack. Garibaldi had been weakened by the Battle of Volturno, so Cavour quickly invaded the Papal regions of <b>Umbria</b> and Marche. This linked the territories conquered by Piedmont with those taken by Garibaldi. The King met with Garibaldi, who handed over control of southern Italy and Sicily, thus uniting Italy.|$|E
25|$|To the east, the Adriatic Sea {{provides}} a moderating Mediterranean climate for the vineyards that run along a west-east orientation in calcareous clay river valleys that {{flow from the}} mountains to the seas. In the northern region of Abruzzo, along the Marche border, the microclimates, vineyard soils and altitude of many vineyards are similar to other central Italian wine regions in Tuscany, <b>Umbria</b> and Marche, while the warmer, flatter, more humid and fertile vineyard sites in the southern Chieti have microclimates more similar to southern Italian wine regions like Calabria and Apulia.|$|E
25|$|In the peninsula, {{alongside}} the Etruscans, lived numerous tribes, mostly of Indo-European origin: the Umbri in <b>Umbria</b> and northern Abruzzo, the Latins, {{who created the}} Roman civilization, Sabellians, Falisci, Volsci and Aequi in the Latium; Piceni in the Marche and north-east Abruzzo; Samnites in southern Abruzzo, Molise and Campania; Daunians, Messapii and Peucetii (forming the Apulian or Iapygian confederation) in Apulia; Lucani and Bruttii in the southern tips of the peninsula. In Sicily lived the Sicels, Elymians and Sicani while Sardinia was still inhabited by the Nuragic peoples.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} Tuscany {{includes}} seven coastal islands and is Italy's fifth largest region. It is bordered {{to the northwest}} by Liguria, the north by Emilia-Romagna, <b>Umbria</b> {{to the east and}} Lazio to the south. To the west is the Tyrrhenian Sea which gives the area a warm mediterranean climate. The terrain is quite hilly (over 68% of the terrain), progressing inward to the Apennine Mountains along the border with Emilia-Romagna. The hills serve as a tempering affect on the summertime heat with many vineyards planted on the higher elevations of the hillsides.|$|E
25|$|Pope John Paul II {{died in the}} Vatican at {{the time}} of the Change, instead of {{surviving}} until 2005, as in our timeline, but Cardinal Ratzinger fled to <b>Umbria,</b> where connections with the worldwide Roman Catholic church were reestablished and he was still elected Pope, as in our timeline – and his pontificate lasts until 2022. Perhaps the greatest post-Change success of the Roman Catholic Church was reunification with the Church of England, which led to the crowning of the British monarch (William V) as Emperor of the West.|$|E
25|$|Frondizi {{was born}} in Paso de los Libres, Corrientes Province; to Isabel (née Ercoli) and Giulio Frondizi, Italian {{immigrants}} from the <b>Umbria</b> Region. Arturo was one of 11 sons; his brothers included: Silvio, who became {{a professor of law}} at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and was assassinated in 1974 by the Triple A, and Risieri, who became a philosopher and rector of the University of Buenos Aires. The family relocated to Concepción del Uruguay in 1912, and in 1923 to Buenos Aires. Frondizi enrolled in the UBA in 1926.|$|E
25|$|Pope Alexander IV, {{favored a}} plan for the {{amalgamation}} of all institutes following the Rule of St. Augustine. This was accomplished in March 1256, and about the same time a Rescript was issued confirming the Order of the Servites as a separate body with power to elect a general. Four years later a general chapter was convened at which the order was divided into two provinces, Tuscany and <b>Umbria,</b> the former of which St. Manettus directed, while the latter was given into the care of St. Sostene. Within five years two new provinces were added: Romagna and Lombardy.|$|E
