40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess the {{relationships}} among chemical, phase and structural composition and etiopathogenic factors of non-infectious phosphate calculi formed in patients with low and high <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> concentrations, and to characterize the mechanism of their formation related on biochemical results. Material and Methods: Twelve samples of phosphate renal calculi were obtained, 4 from patients with low phosphaturia and 6 from patients with high <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> concentrations. Their chemical composition was determined qualitatively by energy dispersive X-ray analysis and quantitatively by spectrophotometric and thermal analysis; and their phase composition was determined by Fourier transform infrared transmission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The structure of the calculi was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Non-infectious phosphate renal calculi of patients with low phosphaturia consist of poorly crystalline carbonate hydroxyapatite, whereas those of patients with high <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> concentrations consist of poorly crystalline hydroxyapatite with some amount of calcium oxalate crystals. Calculi of patients with high <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> concentrations are formed at urinary supersaturation with respect to hydroxyapatite and calcium oxalate about 4 times higher than in patients with low phosphaturia. Conclusion: In patients with low phosphaturia, the non-infectious phosphate renal calculi are formed in urine near pH 7 and contain only poorly crystalline carbonate hydroxyapatite. In patients with high <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> concentrations and hypercalciuria, the calculi are formed in urine near pH 6 and consist of both poorly crystalline hydroxyapatite and some amount of calcium oxalate crystals. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: The {{efficacy}} of phosphate binders {{is difficult to}} be estimated clinically. This study analyzes the changes in serum phosphate and <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> excretion after the prescription of phosphate binders (PB) in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4 – 5 pre-dialysis, and {{the usefulness of the}} ratio between total <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> and protein catabolic rate (Pu/PCR) for estimating the {{efficacy of}} PB. Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study included adult chronic kidney disease patients. Biochemical parameters were determined baseline and after 45 – 60 days on a low phosphate diet plus PB (“binder” subgroup =  260 patients) or only with dietary advice (“control” subgroup =  79 patients). Results: Phosphate load (total urinary excretion) per unit of renal function (Pu/GFR) was the best parameter correlated with serum phosphate levels (R 2  =  0. 61). Mean ± SD level of Pu/PCR was 8. 2  ±  2. 3  mg of <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> per each g of estimated protein intake. After treatment with PB, serum phosphate levels decreased by 11 %, <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> 22 %, protein catabolic rate 7 %, and Pu/PCR 15 %. In the control subgroup, Pu/PCR increased by 20 %. <b>Urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> and urea nitrogen excretion correlated strongly, both baseline and after PB or dietary advice. Conclusions: The proposed parameter Pu/PCR may reflect the rate of intestinal phosphate absorption, and therefore, its variations after PB prescription may be a useful tool for estimating the pharmacological efficacy of these drugs...|$|E

40|$|Micropuncture {{studies were}} carried out in rats to {{determine}} changes in tubular transport of phosphate which occur in chronic renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Rats underwent subtotal nephrectomy (NX) and were fed a low calcium, high phosphorus diet for 3 [...] 4 wk. Other groups consisted of normal control animals, normal rats infused with sodium phosphate to raise filtered load of phosphate, subtotal NX rats parathyroidectomized (PTX) on the day of experiment, and normal PTX rats infused with sodium phosphate. It was found that filtered phosphate/nephron is markedly increased in subtotal NX rats due to high single nephron filtration rates, proximal tubular fluid plasma phosphate ratios are less than 1. 0, and fractional reabsorption of phosphate is decreased in the proximal tubule. More phosphate was present in the final urine than in surface distal convoluted tubules. Acute PTX in subtotal NX rats resulted in a striking increase in proximal phosphate reabsorption, and <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> became approximately equal to that remaining in surface distal tubules. Phosphate loading in normal rats reduced fractional reabsorption in the proximal tubule, but <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> was not greater than {{that at the end of}} surface distal tubules. Acute PTX in normal phosphate-loaded animals had no significant effect on proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption. These observations suggest that phosphate homeostasis in chronic renal failure is acheived by inhibition of proximal phosphate reabsorption, counteracting a greatly enhanced intrinsic capacity for reabsorption. In addition, the large amount of <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> is consistent either with secretion by the collecting ducts or with a disproportionately high contribution by deep nephrons.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the precise technique for assessing bone mineral content (BMC) in preterm infants, but is not widely available. To investigate the clinical and biochemical parameters, including bone metabolism markers as potential predictors of BMC, in preterm infants up to 3 months corrected age (CA). Ca-P homeostasis, iPTH, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, N-terminal propeptide, cross-linked C-telopeptide and amino-terminal pro C-type natriuretic peptide and the DXA scans were prospectively performed in 184 preterm infants (≤ 34 weeks' gestation) between term age and 3 mo CA. Lower bone mass was defined as BMC below or equal to respective median value for the whole study group, rounded to the nearest whole number. The appropriate quality DXA scans were available for 160 infants (87 %) examined at term and for 130 (71 %) tested at 3 mo CA. Higher iPTH level was the only independent predictor of lower BMC at term, whereas lower BMC at 3 mo CA was associated both with lower <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> excretion and higher serum osteocalcin level. ROC analysis showed that iPTH > 43. 6 pg/mL provided 40 % sensitivity and 88 % specificity in identification of preterm infants with lower BMC at term. In turn, <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> excretion (TRP> 97 % or UP/Cr ≤ 0. 74 mg/mg) and serum osteocalcin > 172 ng/mL provided 40 % sensitivity and 93 % specificity in identification of infants with decreased BMC at 3 mo CA. Serum iPTH might to be a simple predictor of reduced BMC in preterm infants at term age, but <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> excretion and serum osteocalcin might predict reduced BMC at 3 mo CA.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 a single (n = 88) and multiple (n = 36) ascending dose study in healthy subjects, and a randomized, open-label, uncontrolled, phase 1 b study in hyperphosphatemic ESRD patients on hemodialysis (single oral dose, n = 5; multiple oral doses, n = 17). Primary efficacy measures were <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> and fecal phosphorous excretion (healthy subjects) and serum phosphate level (ESRD patients). Results: No time- or dose-dependent changes in <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> or fecal phosphorous excretion were observed following single/multiple ASP 3325 doses for 7 days in healthy subjects.

40|$|Calcium (Ca) {{preparations}} {{are widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} osteoporosis, usually as soluble salts. Tolerance might be improved by prescription of slowly dissolved Ca preparations, since Ca is also absorbed distally, even in the colon. In this regard the use of natural forms of Ca might be advantageous, but natural products cannot be labeled reliably for easy evaluation of their absorption. To study the intestinal absorption of an osseino-mineral complex (Ossopan) in comparison with Ca-gluconate, healthy males were investigated by means of conventional blood and urinary measurements before and after ingestion of either substance containing 1. 58 g Ca. All subjects were placed on a standard diet 2 days before and during test day. Ca-gluconate (n = 7) evoked a marked and transient rise in plasma ionized calcium; total plasma calcium and urinary calcium followed a parallel course, while plasma and <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> decreased. After administration of osseino-mineral complex (n = 6), a slow but sustained elevation of plasma ionized calcium was observed while total calcium remained unchanged when corrected by the plasma proteins.

40|$|In tro duc ti on Phosphorus is {{a mineral}} {{essential}} for numerous cellular functions {{and is an}} important constituent of bones. Hypophosphatemia in children leads to rickets resulting in poor growth and frequently in skeletal deformities. Among the various causes of low serum phosphorus are inherited disorders associated with increased <b>urinary</b> excretion of <b>phosphate,</b> which include X- linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), and hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) (1). Clinical and biological characteristics of hypophosphatemia, {{as well as its}} management, depend on the specific etiology (2).

40|$|The {{collection}} of data on {{the response of the}} skeletal and muscular systems to 14 -day space flights was evaluated for loss of calcium, nitrogen, and other metabolically related elements. Considerable interindividual variability was demonstrated in all experimental factors that were measured. Calcium balance became less positive and <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> excretion increased substantially in flight despite a reduction in phosphate intake. Patterns of excretion of magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride were different for each subject, and, in part, could be correlated with changes in adrenocortical steroid production. The principal hormonal change was a striking decrease during flight in the urinary excretion of 17 -hydroxycortocosteroids. Dermal losses of calcium, magnesium, sulfate, and phosphate were insignificant during all three phases...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of various}} drugs {{closely related to}} forma t i on or {{prevention}} of urinary calculi on phosphate and calcium metabolism have been experimentally and clinically studied. 1) Cortisone and ACTH If a large doses of cortisone and ACTH were injected daily to rabbits in short priod, urinary outputs of phosphate and calcium were transiently decreased, then increased and again decreased, in another words the outputs showed biphasic pattern. This tendency was more prominent in calcium metabolism than that of phosphate. If a large doses of Cortisone and ACTH were injected daily in shorter period, effects of the former were prominent than that of ACTH and the larger the dose injected, the longer was the period of increased urinary outputs of phosphate and calcium. 2) Alumi-gel Oral administration of Alumi-gel to human subjects slightly decreased the level of serum phosphate and markedly decreased urinary output of phosphate. The mechanism of decrease in urinary output of phosphate has been comfirmed by Tracer Test of P 32, which indicated the blocking action of Alumi-gel to intestinal phosphate absorption. Theoretically prevention of phosphate calculi by Alumi-gel will be recommended. Since oral administration of large doses of Alumi-gel in longer period, however, may cause hypophosphatemia and disfunction of gastric secretion, treatment with Alumi-gel for <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> calculi should be limited only to those cases which are relapsing and excreting large amount of phosphate in urine and furthermore regular biochemical test and gastric secretory function test are both essential. 3) Neo-stro n g Minophagen C and Chondroitin Sulfate Prevention of urinary calculi formation by th e se drugs is due to their protective action of urinary colloids and no effect on urinary outputs of phosphate and calcium. Therefore if one expects full effect of these drugs for prevention of urinary calculi formation, {{it is recommended that}} urinary outputs of phosphate and calcium are decreased by other durgs. 4) Sulfonamide In a case of anuria due to acute sulfonamide poisoning, the level of serum and <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> and calcium were measured after the patient started urinating. Immediately after urination has been started, the high level of serum phosphate, phosphaturia, calciuria were encountered. As renal function was improved, serum phosphate and <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> and calcium were decreased. In acute sulfonamide poisoning, both urinary obstruction due to non-soluble sulfonamide and formations of phosphate and calcium calcuii produce anuria. Administration of Alumi-gel for prevention of phosphaturia and for activation of protective action on urinary colloids is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) {{may cause}} acute kidney injury and {{proximal}} tubular dysfunction. However, no detailed studies document <b>urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> wasting {{as a marker}} of TDF-induced tubulopathy. Methods: Records of HIV-infected patients with presumed TDF toxicity were reviewed. We describe the characteristics and clinical course of 15 patients who had documented elevated (> 20 %) fractional excretion of phosphate (FEphos). Results: Patientswere predominantly Caucasian andmale (73 and 80 %, respectively), with amean age of 56 years (range 38 – 76). Of the 15 patients, 11 had a estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of> 90 mL/min/ 1. 732 at time of TDF initiation. The mean duration of TDF therapy prior to diagnosis of TDF toxicity was 64 months. Mean FEphos was 34 % (range 20 – 62). Themean eGFR at TDF initiationwas 104 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 [standard deviation (SD) 17. 0]with a gradual decline to 69 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (SD 19. 0) {{by the time of}} TDF discontinuation. Of 10 patients with repeated FEphos after TDF discontinuation, 9 had improvement of their FEphos. Of these individuals, 6 had normalization of their FEphos. Estimated GFR improved in 12 patients after discontinuation of TDF, though importantly, none returned to their baseline eGFR. Conclusions: <b>Urinary</b> <b>phosphate</b> wasting is a sensitive marker for TDF-induced proximal tubulopathy and is associated with unrecognized and permanent renal function decline. Tubular dysfunction can develop after years of TDF therapy in thosewith normal kidney function at the time of drug initiation. This suggests that continuing vigilance bemaintained in all those on TDF. Key words: HIV, kidney injury, phosphate wasting, proximal tubular dysfunction, tenofovi...|$|E

All subjects received supplementation to ensure a minimum of 800 mg calcium per day. 25 subjects completed at least 10 month follow up serum calcium, <b>phosphate,</b> glucose and <b>urinary</b> calcium and phosphatae measurements by colorimetric, method. We compared women with herselves, the median change in biochemical studies showed significant decrease in serum calcium, <b>phosphate</b> an <b>urinary</b> excrition of calcium, but significant increase in <b>urinary</b> excrition of <b>phosphate.</b> Fasting plasma glucose did not change significantly. Decrease serum calcium (9. 6 compared with 9. 16; P&lt; 0. 005) decrease, serum phosphate (3. 77 compared with 3. 39; P&lt; 0. 005), decrease uri calcium (149. 81 compared with 121. 46, P&lt; 0. 005), increase uri phosphate (625. 83 compared with 676, P&lt; 0. 005), FBS (92. 03 compared with 91. 45, 0. 1 &gt;P&gt; 0. 05).

40|$|The {{effect of}} a single oral dose of 25 mg {{bemetizide}} on renal function without and with concomitant administration of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin was investigated in ten healthy volunteers during sustained water diuresis. Bemetizide induced {{a significant increase in}} urinary sodium and chloride excretion from 196 +/- 30 and 163 +/- 28 mumol/min to 690 +/- 54 and 537 +/- 51 mumol/min (P less than 0. 01). This effect occurred in the absence of changes in glomerular filtration rate, <b>urinary</b> excretion of <b>phosphate</b> or the delivery of chloride beyond the proximal nephron to the distal tubules (distal delivery) [(CH 2 O + CCl) /GFR. 100], but was associated with a significant decrease in distal fractional chloride absorption (DFACl) [CH 2 O/(CH 2 O + CCl) ] from 0. 84 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 63 +/- 0. 02 (P less than 0. 01). Bemetizide also increased urinary excretion of prostaglandin (PG) E 2. Concomitant indomethacin administration significantly suppressed urinary excretion of PGE 2 and markedly decreased urinary excretion of sodium and chloride during control and following bemetizide administration. Indomethacin had no effect on glomerular filtration rate, <b>urinary</b> excretion of <b>phosphate,</b> distal delivery or the urinary excretion of bemetizide but significantly increased DFACl both during control and after bemetizide administration. Our results show that bemetizide as a thiazide-diuretic acts in the diluting segments of the nephron. Indomethacin administration induces retention of sodium and chloride and blunts the renal effects of bemetizide via increased absorption in the diluting segments. The interaction of both drugs most likely represents a pharmacodynamic interaction...|$|R
