40|$|The authorsâ€™ {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} simple and reliable descriptive method for categorizing patient states during psychotherapy. The categories would be based on the degree of apparent control over emotional expressions. Methods involved scoring videotapes of psychotherapy for 5 patients with neurotic-level Axis I disorders. Three judges rated each 30 -second segment as predominantly one of these four states: well modulated, overmodulated, <b>undermodulated,</b> or shimmering. Shimmering states combine emotional display with efforts to stifle that expression. The results showed that judges could reliably rate states by the definitions used in this study. This technique can provide a simplified and general approach to observation of degrees of defensive control of emotion of patients in psychotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Imaging {{studies in}} {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) have shown differing neural network patterns between hypo-aroused/dissociative and hyper-aroused subtypes. Since dissociative identity disorder (DID) involves different emotional states, this study tests whether DID fits aspects of the differing brain-activation patterns in PTSD. While brain activation was monitored using positron emission tomography, DID individuals (n= 11) and matched DID-simulating healthy controls (n= 16) underwent an autobiographic script-driven imagery paradigm in a hypo-aroused and a hyper-aroused identity state. Results were consistent with those previously found in the two PTSD subtypes for the rostral/dorsal anterior cingulate, the prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala and insula, respectively. Furthermore, the dissociative identity state uniquely activated the posterior association areas and the parahippocampal gyri, whereas the hyper-aroused identity state uniquely activated the caudate nucleus. Therefore, we proposed an extended PTSD-based neurobiological model for emotion modulation in DID: the hypo-aroused identity state activates the prefrontal cortex, cingulate, posterior association areas and parahippocampal gyri, thereby overmodulating emotion regulation; the hyper-aroused identity state activates the amygdala and insula {{as well as the}} dorsal striatum, thereby <b>undermodulating</b> emotion regulation. This confirms the notion that DID is related to PTSD as hypo-aroused and hyper-arousal states in DID and PTSD are similar. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
