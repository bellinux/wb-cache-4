5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with <b>urination,</b> frequent <b>urination,</b> and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} chronic treatment with low doses of diazepam on body weight, defecations and <b>urinations,</b> vertical rears, the elevated platform test, and self-grooming in male rats exposed for 21 days to social isolation. The rats were treated for 21 days with diazepam (0. 2 mg/kg, i. p) or its vehicle. Social isolation led to decreased body weight and vertical rears, more defecations and <b>urinations,</b> increased reluctance to step down from the test platform, shorter duration of grooming, and longer reluctance to start grooming. Chronic diazepam in individually housed rats produced increase in body weight and vertical rears, {{decrease in the number}} of defecations and <b>urinations,</b> and shortening of the time of reluctance to step down from the platform. The number of grooming bouts, their duration, and reluctance to start grooming were not altered by diazepam, but it decreased the percentage of incorrect transitions. The obtained data indicate that chronic diazepam treatment of socially isolated rats changes non-grooming behavior and some grooming behavior parameters.

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body.

This could have caused Rodrigo to apply the brake and turn the wheel violently.|$|E
40|$|Signs referable to {{the lower}} urinary tract of indoor-housed cats have been {{described}} in the veterinary literature for at least 80 years [1]. The terms feline urologic syndrome (FUS) and feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) were coined in the 1970 s (FUS [2]) and 1980 s (FLUTD [3]) to describe variable combinations of straining, hematuria, pollakiuria (frequent passage of small amounts of urine), and periuria (<b>urinations</b> in inappropriate locations) seen in cats with the disorder. No diagnosis for clinical signs of irritative voiding can be determined in approximately two thirds of cats with lower urinary tract (LUT) signs, so we {{refer to them as}} having feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC). If cystoscopy is performed and characteristic submucosal petechial hemorrhages are seen, a diagnosis of feline interstitial cystitis can be made [4]. This term was chosen because of similarities between cats and human beings with interstitial cystitis, an idiopathic pelvic pain syndrome that is characterized by difficult, painful, and frequent <b>urinations</b> without a diagnosable cause [5]...|$|R

5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, faeces, and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by <b>urination</b> stand less than a metre away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome. Another major reason for fights is to acquire dominance in the breeding season. These can even involve cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with <b>urination,</b> pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E

Poisoned individuals {{may appear to}} be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and <b>urination.</b> Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} suggest therapy modi cations {{with the aim}} of {{diminishing}} the risk of therapy-induced long-term distressful symptoms in cancer survivors, data are needed relating details of therapy to the long-term symptom situation. In this article, the concept s and means used to assess the latter while developin g the Radiumhemmet scale for symptom assessment are described. The focus is on the subjective long-term situation, and symptoms as a perceived abnormality are de ned. For conceptual clarity, one symptom at a time is considered, excluding scales in which items are summarized. Moreover, measures of disease occurrence in the population are translated (epidemiolog-ically) into measures of symptom occurrence in an individual. Nature distinguishes one long-term symptom from another. Occurrence of a symptom in an individual is measured by an incidence (e. g. number of defecations per week) or prevalence rate (e. g. <b>urinations</b> with involuntary cessation divided {{by the total number of}} <b>urinations).</b> Any scale expressing symptom intensity is arbitrary, be it ‘verbal’ (no:little:moderate:much pain) or visual (analogue or with integers). A time period describes symptom duration.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish a pattern of excreting behaviour of pigs in relation to ammonia emission and to predict the ammonia emission rates from clean and fouled with excretions areas. The study involved 3 organic pig farms in which the housing systems included straw pens inside and a paved yard outside. Two pens with fattening pigs were chosen on each farm and measurements of excreting behaviour and ammonia emission were made at two stages in the fattening period, at approximately 45 and 80 kg of body weight. Behaviour was observed with video cameras at two consecutive days for 24 hours. From video recordings <b>urinations</b> and defecations, including the corresponding times, were noted. Diagrams of the excretion activity pattern during the day for every weight class and every farm were made. From the figures of the frequency of <b>urinations</b> during the day it was clear, that in all the tree farms there were two excretion peaks – one in the morning and one in the afternoon-evening hours. Clean areas inside emitted 1. 9 g ammonia. day- 1 m- 2 and clean areas ouside – 2. 7 gday- 1 m- 2. Inside polluted areas had a higher emission than the polluted areas on the outside yard – 13. 3 gday- 1 m- 2 vs 11. 4 gday- 1 m- 2, resp. ...|$|R
5|$|The flesh has a mild taste, and a strong, pungent, fruity smell. The {{mushroom}} is poisonous, containing muscarine compounds. Consumption of {{the mushroom}} {{could lead to}} a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, <b>urination,</b> defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public <b>urination)</b> after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, lacrimation, <b>urination,</b> defecation, gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, <b>urination,</b> and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual <b>urination</b> and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls <b>urination,</b> which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
40|$|After intensifying pig {{husbandry}} {{in the second}} half of the 20 th century to improve economical development, public concern brought about legislation to secure animal welfare and ecological values. The development of welfare-friendly sow husbandry in recent years focussed mainly on two purposes: to keep sows loose in groups and to provide the sows with straw bedding. The main objective of this research was to establish the effect on ammonia emission of group housing and straw bedding, and eventually to find tools to reduce the emission. With straw bedding, the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide were also considered, because environmental goals are not served by pollution swapping. The results showed that group housing of sows does not increase ammonia emission compared to individual housing of sows. Given appropriate straw management, providing a straw bed reduces ammonia emission, and emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are not substantial. However more research is needed in order to understand the conditions for low greenhouse-gas emissions. Although the measured effect was modest, shifting feeding time might be a tool to reduce ammonia emission. A model was developed to estimate ammonia emission from a sow house with group housing and straw bedding as the sum of the emissions from straw, solid floors, slatted floors and pits after <b>urinations.</b> The results of simulations show that measures to reduce ammonia emissions are most effective if aimed at decreasing the emission from the solid floor and stimulating relatively more <b>urinations</b> on the straw bed. The model appeared to be a useful tool for designing straw-bedded sow group-housing with low ammonia emissions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{describe}} a clinical case of late-stage Parkinson’s disease (PD) with nocturnal symptoms and fluctuations and to present successful experience in using the three-component drug Stalevo (levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone) as a single dose prior to sleep. Patient V. aged 72 years took medical advice at the Department of Neurology, Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, for complaints of constrained movements, inability to turn in bed independently, painful muscle cramps, light sleep with nocturnal awakenings, and frequent (5 – 6 times) <b>urinations</b> at night. The first symptoms of the disease appeared 12 {{years ago when the}} patient began to notice sluggishness, altered handwriting, and clumsiness during small movements of the right hand. By taking into account symptoms (obvious nocturnal akinesia, overactive bladder, sleep disorders, and cramps) and the results of his examination, the patient was diagnosed with the akinetic-rigid form of PD (4 Hoehn-Yarh scores). Therapy was corrected as follows: the dose of amantadine remained the same (300 mg); its last administration is recommended to be at 16 : 00; the daily dose of levodopa was 700 mg; that of levodopa/benserazide was 550 mg/day (1 tablet × 3 / 4 tablet × 1 tablet). The evening intake of levodopa was changed for that of the three-component drug Stalevo (levodopa 150 mg/ carbidopa 37. 5 mg/entacapone 200 mg). Results. After 3 months, the patient was observed to have significant health improvement: reduced nocturnal and morning akinesia, better gait, a considerably smaller number of nocturnal <b>urinations</b> (less than once per night), regression of painful calf muscle cramps, and improved sleep. Conclusion. The three-component drug Stalevo (levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone) is effective in treating late-stage PD. Its use as a single dose before going to bed has led to regressive nocturnal symptoms, better sleep, and lower motor fluctuations.   </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of four water salinity levels on the ingestive behavior of non-castrated crossbred Santa Inês sheep. Thirty-two non-castrated crossbred Santa Inês sheep in feedlot, at seven months of age and initial average weight of 21. 76 ± 1. 25 kg, were used in the experiment. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four treatments and eight replicates. Four concentrations of salts in the water fed to the animals were evaluated: low (640 mg/l); medium (3, 188 mg/l); high (5, 740 mg/l) and very high (8, 326 mg/l) levels of total dissolved solids (TDS). For the ingestive behaviors, the animals were observed every ten minutes, for 24 hours, to determine the time spent feeding, ruminating and idle. Also, cud chewing and the average number of defecations and <b>urinations</b> and the frequency of water ingestion were determined. The time spent feeding, ruminating and idle were not changed by the salinity levels in the water. Dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber intake, total chewing time, total cud chews per day, number of daily meals, average duration of each meal and number of defecations per day did not change either. However, feeding and rumination efficiency in grams of DM/h, water intake and number of <b>urinations</b> were linearly affected, whereas the variables rumination efficiency in grams of NDF/h, grams of dry matter per cud, grams of neutral detergent fiber per cud, number of cuds, number of chews per cud and chewing time per cud presented quadratic effect. The different levels of total dissolved solids (640; 3, 188; 5, 740; and 8. 326 mg/l) in the water fed to the sheep did not cause alterations in their ingestive behavior. In conclusion, water with up to 8, 326 mg TDS/l can be an alternative strategic and seasonal method to water crossbred Santa Ines sheep. 201...|$|R
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, <b>urination</b> and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased <b>urination,</b> dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in <b>urination</b> such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
