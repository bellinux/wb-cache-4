25|$|Embezzlement is the <b>unlawful</b> <b>taking</b> of {{property}} {{by someone who}} it was entrusted to. For example, if a named person trusts their friend enough {{to allow them to}} hold their wallet, and the friend goes home without returning the wallet with the intention of keeping the money, the friend would have committed embezzlement.|$|E
25|$|Larceny is the <b>unlawful</b> <b>taking</b> {{of another}} person's {{property}} {{with the intention}} to deprive the owner of it. If the stolen object is above a large value, then it is considered a felony and is called a grand theft. A petty theft is stealing and object with a small value which would pass as a misdemeanor. If a person has a lost item in possession, and a reasonable method exists for finding the owner, they must return it or it would be considered larceny. For example, if one finds a wallet with an ID in it, it is their duty to find a method to {{return it to the}} owner. Shoplifting and attempted shoplifting fall under this category.|$|E

2500|$|Of course, the {{new system}} did not stop landowners from {{appealing}} the assessments made by the streets commissions [...] generally speaking, landowners who had inherited their property were more inclined to appeal assessments than were land speculators, who simply paid the assessments {{and waited for the}} values of their properties to rise, as they inevitably did. The outcomes of the landowner appeals, together with those of the lawsuits against the plan which had been filed as early as 1810, created a body of precedents by which the state law was administered.

40|$|In recent years, {{local governments}} in the United States have {{increasingly}} used eminent domain to promote economic development, raising concerns among property-right advocates over what those advocates view as unlawful, or what should be <b>unlawful,</b> <b>takings</b> of private property in order to benefit another private property owner. This philosophical and legal dispute reached a crisis point in the 2005 United States Supreme Court decision in Kelo v. City of New London. In that decision, the court narrowly upheld a Connecticut Supreme Court ruling granting the City of New London permission to redevelop land that had been seized from existing homeowners and transferred to another private party for economic development. The decision sparked an immediate public outcry and prompted forty-three states to consider some type of reform to protect property owners from similar actions by government. This thesis examines the legal, policy, and ethical implications that the Kelo case has had in the United States and in Nevada. It reviews the principal academic literature and case law concerning eminent domain in the United States, {{up to and including}} the Kelo decision, then specifically focuses on assessing the legal and policy responses of Nevada and other states to Kelo. It notes that while the post- Kelo reforms of some states have been highly effective, others have done little to safeguard property owners against Kelo -type takings. It briefly reviews the policy influence of Dewey and Locke in current approaches to eminent domain, and concludes that Nevada 2 ̆ 7 s post- Kelo approach is an effective model for limiting how eminent domain is used, while still achieving the obligations government has to protect its people...|$|R
5000|$|Section 20 {{gives the}} EHRC {{the power to}} carry out {{investigations}} when it has the [...] "suspicion" [...] of <b>unlawful</b> discrimination <b>taking</b> place.

In legal terms this is the difference between an irrationality test and a reasonable man test. In other words, a court could not declare an investigation unlawful unless it considered that the EHRC was carrying out an investigation where no reasonable person could have come to the same conclusion. Before a court could declare an investigation unlawful if it thought that the proverbial [...] "man on the Clapham Omnibus" [...] would not regard an employer as being a suspect [...] "discriminator".|$|R

40|$|The paper {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the English translation of the Italian bestseller ‘Gomorrah’, written in 2006 by young Neapolitan author Roberto Saviano. The significance and the impact that ‘Gomorrah’ had {{on a global scale}} can be inferred by the synoptic introduction to its UK edition: […] Roberto Saviano compiled the most thorough account to date of the Camorra and its chilling significant role in the global economy. […] the Camorra has an international reach and large stakes in construction, high fashion, illicit drugs and toxic-waste disposal. It exerts a malign grip on cities and villages along the Neapolitan coast and is the deciding factor in why Campania has the highest murder rate in all of Europe and why cancer levels there have skyrocketed in recent years. The fact that Saviano’s impassionate nonfiction fascinated and shocked readers in more than fifty countries across the globe inevitably raises questions about the cultural transfer of elements pertaining to Naples’ criminal culture that cannot easily be extricated from their local socio-economic context and which are mostly alien to the target reader. Interestingly enough, such transfer also occurs in the source text itself: some of the references contained in ‘Gomorrah’ may be regarded by many Italian readers as locally-bound i. e., ‘embedded’ in a less familiar Southern cultural framework populated by social and human depravities. Indeed, Saviano recently mentioned on a TV show that most of the Camorra news stays local, mainly because most crimes, killings and <b>unlawful</b> acts <b>taking</b> place in Campania are not sufficiently reported by national channels and therefore remain largely unknown to most Italians. As a response to this problem, ‘Gomorrah’ was conceived by its author as a wake-up call to break through the indifference that generally greets Camorra stories. So, in a way (although on a different scale), both the source text and the target text work in the same direction: they aim to raise public awareness about these lesser-know mobsters and warn against the dangers of a hidden though deadly machine constantly at work. One of Saviano’s aims is, in fact, not only {{to make it clear that}} the Mafia and the Camorra are two separate criminal organizations, but also that the Camorra now dwarfs both the Sicilian Mafia and southern Italy’s other crime organizations, in numbers, in economic power and in ruthless violence. Upon closer examination however, the English version appears tentative in giving the Camorra an autonomous cultural representation for the target audience. Despite the Camorra’s power and considerable scale, as well as its distinctive symbols, practices and well-defined hierarchies, the English version frequently relies on references to Sicilian Mafia and on Mafia-related classifications to ‘filter’ images and identities that pertain to the scenario of the Camorra. This clashes with the awareness-raising intent of the author and prevents the Camorra from gaining full representation as a criminal phenomenon whose repercussions are global and can no longer be overlooked...|$|R
60|$|They {{tried to}} persuade Lady Jane to accept the unreformed religion; but she {{steadily}} refused. On the morning when she was to die, she saw from her window the bleeding and headless body of her husband brought back in a cart from the scaffold on Tower Hill where he had laid down his life. But, as she had declined to see him before his execution, lest she should be overpowered and not make a good end, so, she even now showed a constancy and calmness {{that will never be}} forgotten. She came up to the scaffold with a firm step and a quiet face, and addressed the bystanders in a steady voice. They were not numerous; for she was too young, too innocent and fair, to be murdered before the people on Tower Hill, as her husband had just been; so, the place of her execution was within the Tower itself. She said that she had done an <b>unlawful</b> act in <b>taking</b> what was Queen Mary's right; but that she had done so with no bad intent, and that she died a humble Christian. She begged the executioner to despatch her quickly, and she asked him, 'Will you take my head off before I lay me down?' He answered, 'No, Madam,' and then she was very quiet while they bandaged her eyes. Being blinded, and unable to see the block on which she was to lay her young head, she was seen to feel about for it with her hands, and was heard to say, confused, 'O what shall I do! Where is it?' Then they guided her to the right place, and the executioner struck off her head. You know too well, now, what dreadful deeds the executioner did in England, through many, many years, and how his axe descended on the hateful block through the necks of some of the bravest, wisest, and best in the land. But it never struck so cruel and so vile a blow as this.|$|R

While Michaels and family were elsewhere in the home, Harmon, a parolee, entered through an unlocked door and removed Michaels' purse which contained her wallet and the keys to her 2011 Bentley GT. Following a high-speed police chase, Harmon crashed the Bentley into a light pole. After fighting with the responding officers, Harmon was placed under arrest. In September 2014, Harmon was convicted of <b>unlawful</b> driving or <b>taking</b> of a vehicle, evading an officer, resisting executive officers and misdemeanor hit-and-run driving.
