25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I want you to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not to be {{as it has been}} heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E
500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
2500|$|When I have {{a mental}} {{image of a}} triangle, for example, I don't just <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines {{as though they were}} present to my mind's eye. [...] And this is what I call having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a figure with a {{thousand}} sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura). (Descartes, Meditation VI: On the Existence of Material Objects and the Real Distinction of Mind from Body).|$|E

2500|$|The NCO strongholds {{were the}} towns {{to the east}} of Naples, such as Ottaviano, and Cutolo appealed to a Campanian rather than Neapolitan sense of identity, perhaps {{as a result of his}} poor peasant background. For instance, Cutolo is once {{reported}} as having said: [...] "The day when the people of Campania <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> better to eat a slice of bread as a free man than to eat a steak as a slave is the day when Campania will win." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fontcuberta {{reported}} that {{responses to the}} exhibition ranged [...] "from people who <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a farce and appreciate the satire and the humor of it, to people who understand it's a farce and are angry at you for trying to fool them, to people who believe it and are angry, to people who believe it and are delighted." [...] He said in another interview that during the 1989 exhibition in the Barcelona Museum of Natural Science, [...] "30% of the visitors aged 20 to 30, with university training, believed {{that some of our}} animals could have existed." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 April 1970, during another Shipbuilding Bill {{debate in}} the Commons, the Liberal MP Jo Grimond asked [...] "Is there any news about the site at Burntisland? ... I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> out of shipbuilding. Is {{it out of the}} {{industry}} altogether? Is it being used on prefabrication or for any other purpose?" [...] Harold Lever MP, Paymaster General, replied that the Burntisland yard [...] "is now satisfactorily in the East Scotland Group and quite active." [...] Grimond immediately asked [...] "Will it build again?", to which Lever replied [...] "I think it is building now. It is functioning well in another reasonably successful group." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dressed {{in a plain}} red sleeve {{with the}} stark black title in a {{battered}} typeface, the album cover was intended to reflect a no-nonsense, back-to-basics, [...] "never-say-die" [...] attitude, although {{it was noted that}} [...] "it ended up looking as threadbare as much of the public assumed Slade to be." [...] Upon asking if the album's artwork had been designed, Hill replied [...] "It's still being done, but I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to have a photo of a ticker-tape message on the front saying [...] "Return To Base", in computer-like lettering. But it should be a very basic cover – so that it ties in with the [...] "basic" [...] reference in the title." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some speakers, {{especially}} those in frequent contact with the English language have created a grammatical calque of the English you-impersonal. The English impersonal utilizes the second person pronoun you, e.g. You can't live if you don't eat. Here, the word you does not refer explicitly to the listener, but signifies a general statement. The same example is rendered in Finnish as Syömättä ei elä, where a separate grammatical impersonal (also known as passiivi) is used. When translated word-by-word, Sä et elä jos sä et syö, it will refer directly to the listener. Here the contraction sä of spoken language is used instead of the sinä of spoken language. Then, {{you will need to}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an Anglicism, or you can be offended by the commanding [...] "You there!" [...] tone produced. (There are also native examples of the same construction, so the origin of this piece of grammar may not always be English.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 Democratic Party Platform {{acknowledges}} a [...] "special {{relationship with}} Israel, grounded in shared interests and shared values, and a clear, strong, fundamental {{commitment to the}} security of Israel, our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy." [...] It also included: It is {{in the best interests of}} all parties, including the United States, that we take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of Israel. To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace, while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements. Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States. The creation of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations, together with an international compensation mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there, rather than in Israel. All <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949. Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.|$|E
