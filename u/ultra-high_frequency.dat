Similar test were carried out by Oslo Fire Department later that year, and {{they found that the}} radio system was insufficient for their needs. Oslo Fire Department concluded that the DNK tests were only successful because of the use of additional directional gateway/repeater-radio equipment. Because of this firefighters in Oslo continued to use the old <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequency</b> radios during indoor fires. Both the Norwegian Police Security Service's bodyguard service and the service for protection of the royal family have opted to not use the new radio system, citing poor coverage indoors and while lying on the ground, even in downtown Oslo. The services have stated that this does not allow for interoperability with other agencies, which is a drawback in case of major incidents. Also the joint rescue coordination centers, the Norwegian Air Ambulance and the 330 Squadron which operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters have opted out of using the system because of poor coverage. During the 2011 Norway attacks at Utøya, located in northern Buskerud, police officers from surrounding police districts were not able to communicate with local police because the area did not have coverage for the TETRA system.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the cochlear function {{of parents of}} individuals with autosomal recessive gene Gap Junction Protein Beta- 2 hearing loss by <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies</b> distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), compared with responses of a control group matched for age and gender. Methods: We studied 56 subjects aged from 20 to 58 years, divided into two groups. The study group comprised 28 parents of hearing-impaired patients due to autosomal recessive inheritance, 14 females aged 20. 0 - 55. 0 years (mean 32. 8 years) and 14 males aged 20. 0 - 58. 0 years (mean 35. 2 years). Control group was composed of normal hearing individuals, 14 males and 14 females age-matched to the study group. The subjects underwent tests for audiometry, tympanometry, and DPOAE in the frequency range of 9. 000 - 16. 000 Hz. Results: We found 64. 3 % of normal results of DPOAE in the study group compared to 91. 1 % in the control. There were significant differences between groups in the ears and DPOAE responses, and the mean level of response was in 10 dBNPS in study group and 14 dBNPS in the control.

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: Na deficiência auditiva não sindrômica de herança autossômica recessiva, causada por alteração no gene GJB 2 (Gap Junction Bet- 2 Protein), os pais de indivíduos com deficiência auditiva são portadores em heterozigose de um alelo recessivo que causa a surdez, porém, são assintomáticos, mas podem apresentar alterações auditivas precoces e discretas. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a função coclear em pais de indivíduos com deficiência auditiva de herança autossômica recessiva por meio das Emissões Otoacústicas Evocadas Produto de Distorção (EOA-PD) em frequências convencionais e em frequências ultra-altas, comparando as respostas do grupo controle pareadas por gênero e idade. MÉTODO: Foram avaliados 56 indivíduos, entre 20 a 58 anos de idade, divididos em dois grupos, o Grupo Estudo (GE), constituído por 28 pais de deficientes auditivos decorrentes de herança autossômica recessiva, sendo 14 mulheres com idade entre 20 a 55 anos (média 32, 8 anos) e 14 homens com idade entre 20 a 58 anos (média 35, 2), e o Grupo Controle (GC). formado por indivíduos sem queixa auditiva, composto por 14 homens e 14 mulheres com idades pareadas ao GE. Os indivíduos foram submetidos aos exames de Audiometria Tonal Liminar (ATL), Imitanciometria, incluindo a timpanometria e Reflexo Acústico (RA), e EOA-PD em frequências convencionais e em frequências ultra-altas. RESULTADOS: Não houve diferença estatisticamente significante entre as orelhas e grupos nos achados da ATL e RA, porém, nas respostas de EOA-PD, o GE apresentou diferença estatisticamente significativa em todas as frequências em comparação ao GC. A Correlação de Pearson entre a ATL e as EOA-PD, entre as orelhas e entre os grupos, mostrou correlação negativa entre as orelhas e grupos, indicando que, com o aumento no nível de resposta das EOA-PD, ocorre melhora nos limiares auditivos. A correlação de Pearson entre os resultados dos RA e as EOA-PD não demonstrou correlação significativa para ambos os grupos avaliados. A correlação de Pearson entre a idade e as EOA-PD, em frequências convencionais, mostrou correlação negativa significativa em algumas frequências, entretanto, não houve correlação entre a idade e as EOA-PD em frequências ultra-altas. Foi utilizado o intervalo de referência, diagramas de dispersão e análise discriminante para investigar-se se houve diferença entre as EOA-PD em frequências convencionais e em frequências ultra-altas, sendo que as EOA-PD em frequências convencionais mensuraram com maior precisão os sujeitos do GE, em relação às frequências ultra-altas. CONCLUSÃO: As EOA-PD, tanto para as frequências convencionais, quanto para as frequências ultra-altas, foram capazes de distinguir os indivíduos do GE e do GC, sugerindo que indivíduos heterozigotos para a mutação do gene GJB 2 podem apresentar dano no processo ativo das células ciliadas externas antes da manifestação clínica por meio dos resultados alterados na avaliação audiológica convencional. INTRODUCTION: In nonsyndromic {{hearing loss}} of {{recessive}} autosomal heritage, caused {{by changes in}} the gene GJB 2 (Gap Junction Bet- 2 Protein), parents of individuals with hearing loss are heterozygous carriers of a recessive allele which causes deafness, however, are asymptomatic, but may present early and mild hearing changes. OBJECTIVE: Assessing the cochlear function in parents of individuals with hearing loss of recessive autosomal heritage through Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) in conventional <b>frequencies</b> and in <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies,</b> comparing {{the responses of the}} control group paired by gender and age. METHOD: 56 individuals were assessed, aged between 20 and 58 years old, divided into two groups, the Study Group (GE), composed of 28 parents of hearing impaired people due to recessive autosomal heritage, 14 women being 20 to 55 years old (32. 8 years old average) and 14 men being 20 to 58 years (35. 2 years old average), and the Control Group (GC) formed by individuals without hearing complaints, composed of 14 men and 14 women being paired according to the age of GE. The individuals underwent examinations of Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA), Immittanciometry, including tympanometry and Acoustic Reflex (AR), and DPOAE in conventional <b>frequencies</b> and <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies.</b> RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the ears and the groups in the findings of PTA and AR; however, in the responses of DPOAE, the GE presented a statistically significant difference in all the frequencies compared to the GC. The Pearson Correlation between PTA and DPOAE, between the ears and between the groups, showed a negative correlation between the ears and the groups, indicating that, with the increase in the level of response of DPOAE, there is improvement in hearing thresholds. The Pearson Correlation between the results of AR and DPOAE showed no significant correlation for both groups assessed. The Pearson Correlation between age and DPOAE, in conventional frequencies, showed a significant negative correlation in some frequencies, however, there was no correlation between age and DPOAE in <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Reference range, scatter plots and discriminant analysis were used to investigate whether there was a difference between DPOAE in conventional <b>frequencies</b> and in <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies,</b> given that DPOAE in conventional frequencies measured with greater precision the individuals from GE, in relation to the <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies.</b> CONCLUSION: DPOAE, both for conventional <b>frequencies</b> and <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies,</b> were able to distinguish individuals from GE and GC, suggesting that heterozygous individuals for the mutation of GJB 2 gene may present damage in the active process of external ciliated cells before the clinical manifestation via altered results in the conventional hearing-aid assessment...|$|R

40|$|Background Hearing loss (HL) is a {{well-known}} feature of Fabry disease (FD). Its presence and characteristics have mainly been studied in adult patients, while only limited data {{are available on the}} presence and degree of HL in children with FD. This prompted us to study hearing sensitivity in pediatric FD patients. Methods All available audiograms of the Dutch and Norwegian children with FD were retrospectively collected. First, hearing sensitivity was determined by studying hearing thresholds at low, high, and <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies</b> in children with FD and comparing them to zero dB HL, i. e., healthy children. In addition, the presence and type of slight/mild HL (defined as hearing thresholds at low frequencies of 25 - 40 dB HL) and moderate to severe HL (hearing thresholds > 40 dB HL) at first visit were analyzed. If available, follow-up data were used to estimate the natural course of hearing sensitivity and HL in children with FD. Results One-hundred-thirteen audiograms of 47 children with FD (20 boys, median age at first audiogram 12. 0 (range 5. 1 - 18. 0) years) were analyzed. At baseline, slight/mild or moderate to severe HL was present in three children (6. 4 %, 2 boys). Follow-up measurements showed that three additional children developed HL before the age of 18. Of these six children, five had sensorineural HL, most likely caused by FD. Compared to healthy children (zero dB HL), FD children showed increased hearing thresholds at all frequencies (p 8 kHz). Hearing sensitivity at these <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies</b> deteriorated in a period of 5 years of follow-up. Conclusion A minority of children with FD show slight/mild or moderate to severe HL, but their hearing thresholds are poorer than the reference values for normal-hearing children. Clinical trials in FD children should demonstrate whether HL can be prevented or reversed by early treatment and should specifically study ultra-high frequencie...|$|R
