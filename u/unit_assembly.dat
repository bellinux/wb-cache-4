50|$|Reliability testing may be {{performed}} at several levels {{and there are}} different types of testing. Complex systems may be tested at component, circuit board, <b>unit,</b> <b>assembly,</b> subsystem and system levels.(The test level nomenclature varies among applications.) For example, performing environmental stress screening tests at lower levels, such as piece parts or small assemblies, catches problems before they cause failures at higher levels. Testing proceeds during each level of integration through full-up system testing, developmental testing, and operational testing, thereby reducing program risk. However, testing does not mitigate unreliability risk.|$|E

40|$|As {{everyone}} knows, assembly quality plays a {{very important}} role in final product quality. Since computer numerical control machine tool is a large system with complicated structure and function, and there are complex association relationships among quality characteristics in assembly process, then it is difficult and inaccurate to analyze the whole computer numerical control machine tool quality characteristic association at one time. In this article, meta-action <b>assembly</b> <b>unit</b> is proposed as the basic analysis unit, of which quality characteristic association is studied to guarantee the whole computer numerical control machine tool assembly quality. First, based on “Function-Motion-Action” decomposition structure, the definitions of meta-action and meta-action <b>assembly</b> <b>unit</b> are introduced.

30|$|In a VCIM system, {{there are}} three kinds of agents, namely {{resource}} agent, facilitator agent, and customer agent. The resource agent here could be manufacturing <b>unit,</b> <b>assembly</b> unit, material supplier, shipping provider, etc. VCIM systems work as follows. When a VCIM system receives a product order, the customer agent passes the product request to the facilitator agent. The facilitator agent then decomposes the product {{into a number of}} independent components. After that, the facilitator agent chooses some suitable resource agents for producing the decomposed components of the requested product and also chooses an assembly agent for assembling the product. In addition, the resource agent will ship the finished components as well as product to the required destinations to fulfil the product order (Zhou et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2003, 2004, 2004, 2007, 2005; Nagalingam et al. 2007).|$|E
