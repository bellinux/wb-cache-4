5000|$|A {{common type}} of ground loop is due to faulty {{interconnections}} between electronic components, such as laboratory or recording studio equipment, or home component audio, video, and computer systems. This creates inadvertent closed loops in the ground wiring circuit, which can allow stray 50/60 Hz AC current to flow through the ground conductors of signal cables. [...] The voltage drops in the ground system caused by these currents {{are added to the}} signal path, introducing noise and hum into the output. The loops can include the building's <b>utility</b> <b>wiring</b> ground system when more than one component is grounded through the protective earth ("third wire") in their power cords.|$|E
