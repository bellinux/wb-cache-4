The native {{structure of the}} <b>uredospore</b> wall limited the effectiveness of both techniques with this wall, but evidence for two distinct polysaccharides was obtained. A linear (1 → 3) glucan, containing minor quantities of (1 → 6) linkages, may account {{for most of the}} glucose in the <b>uredospore</b> wall. A second <b>uredospore</b> polymer was a glucomannan similar to one reported for other rust fungi in that it consisted of approximately equal numbers of β(1 → 3) and β(1 → 4) mannosidic linkages with glucose as a minor component at the nonreducing end. Branching, most likely by (1 → 6) mannose links, was low. In contrast to <b>uredospore</b> wall, considerably more germ tube polysaccharide was accessible to enzymes and to methylation. Methylation studies indicate that (1 → 3) glucose and mannose bonds occur predominantly. Evidence from hydrolysis with exo- (β) -(1 → 3) glucanase suggests distinct wall regions of β(1 → 3) glycan, highly branched by (1 → 6) bonds, as well as wall regions of a glucomannan with alternating (1 → 3) glucose and (1 → 3) mannose residues. Polymer heterogeneity was indicated by differences in the proportions of mannose, glucose, and galactose as reducing end groups in different solubility fractions.

Sonic oscillation was used to separate germ tubes from germinating uredospores of Uromyces phaseoli var. typica. Uniformly 14 C-labeled wall fractions from both structures were prepared by repeated low speed centrifugation and extraction with polar and nonpolar solvents. Based on amino acid analysis, approximately 6 and 16 % of the carbon from <b>uredospore</b> and germ tube walls, respectively, was present in amino acids readily accessible to protease. Covalent linkages between amino acid and carbohydrate of walls was indicated by analysis of fragments prepared by mild hydrolytic procedures and separated by column chromatography and paper electrophoresis. The existence of protein in wall structures may resolve some previous uncertainty about the occurrence of protein biosynthesis during germination of rust fungi. Glucose, mannose, and glucosamine were the only carbohydrate components identified in both germ tubes and <b>uredospore</b> walls but different percentages were observed (germ tubes 28 : 16 : 16; <b>uredospore</b> 6 : 36 : 6).

50|$|The disease {{cycle of}} Puccinia schedonardii does not vary from other rust disease cycles. This {{pathogen}} is heteroecious and exhibits a polycyclic disease cycle. Puccinia schedonnardii overwinters as teliospores that are produced in telia on the alternate host. In the spring, the teliospores germinate to produce basidiospores. The basidospores are then windblown to the cotton host where they enter via stomata. When basidiospores germinate, they produce a mycelium from which flask-shape pycnia {{as well as}} receptive hyphae are formed. From here, nothing happens until the pycniospores produced by the pycnia fertilize receptive hyphae of a different mating type. Over a period of five to ten days the dikaryotic mycelia formed by the joining of the receptive hyphae and the pycniospore grows through the cotton leaf to produce aecia. Aecia are the pustules seen on {{the leaves of the}} cotton. When conditions are right, and adequate moisture is achieved, aeciospores are released from the aecia. These aeciospores land on the alternate grass host and infect it via a germ tube. Eventually, a uredium is formed from this germ tube.

The plants were kept for 24 hours in a humid chamber at temperature of 23 degrees C, in light or dark conditions, using a factorial design. Subsequently, the plants were maintained for 14 days under a 12 -hour photoperiod. The disease severity and density were evaluated. For in vitro experiments, in light or dark conditions, the evaluation was done in terms of <b>uredospore</b> germination and appressorium formation. The wax content of adaxial and abaxial leaflets was analyzed quantitatively using chloroform extraction and ultrastructurally using scanning electron microscope. Higher density and severity were observed when the adaxial surface was inoculated, with later incubation of the plants in the dark, with no significant interaction between these factors. Spore germination in the dark (40. 7 %) was statistically different from spore germination in the light (28. 5 %). The same effect was observed with appressorium formation, in the dark (24. 7 %) and in the light (12. 8 %). The quantity and the ultrastructural aspects of epicuticular wax content did not show differences between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces; nor did they show any effect on infection by Phakopsora pachyrhizi in the soybean cultivar studied...|$|E
40|$|<b>Uredospores</b> of Puccinia graminis (Pers.) tritici (Eriks. and Henn.) were uniformly {{labeled with}} 14 C by {{permitting}} the host (Triticum aestivum L.) {{to carry out}} photosynthesis in 14 CO 2 {{during the process of}} spore production by the obligate parasite. The use of 14 C labeled spores provided advantages in a study of the utilization of endogenous substrates at frequent intervals with small amounts of spores under conditions conducive to germination...|$|R
40|$|Results {{presented}} in this paper establish the presence of inorganic polyphosphates in saprophytic cultures of the wheat stem rust fungus (Puccinia graminis tritici), and in non-infected and rust- infected primary leaves of wheat. Evidence for the presence of these compounds was based on acid-lability, non-adsorption to charcoal, metachromatic reaction with toluidine blue, paper chromatographic mobility and histochemical staining. Ten days after inoculation, rust-infected primary leaves of wheat contained eight times more inorganic polyphosphate than control leaves of the same age. Much of this polyphosphate was located in the stem rust <b>uredospores.</b> Further analysis of the <b>uredospores</b> revealed that approximately 90 % of the cold acid-soluble phosphorus which was not adsorbed to charcoal was in the form of inorganic polyphosphate. The corresponding figure for the saprophytic rust mycelium was 80 %. Rust-infected wheat leaves and saprophytic mycelium contained both high and low molecular weight polyphosphates. The low molecular weight polyphosphates were heterogeneous with respect to electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, the polyphosphates of non-infected wheat leaves were of low molecular weight only and were relatively homogeneous...|$|R
