The two stations are exactly {{east and west}} of each other separated by a horizontal distance of 3,300feet (5/8mi, 1km) and a vertical distance of 500feet (150m). The maximum vertical clearance between the tram and the ground is 175feet (53.4m).|$|E
5|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> of {{the incline}} has {{a gift shop}} that sells souvenirs and snack foods; a visitor center is also located {{adjacent}} to the station. The mechanical room housing the incline's electric motor and hoisting mechanism can be viewed from windows in the gift shop and {{the lobby of the}} visitor center. An observation deck providing views of the incline, the city, and the valley is located {{on the opposite side of}} the station from the visitor center. Two hiking trails allow visitors to walk the slope. One is a sculpture trail, with works created in 1989 by local artist James Wolfe, who used remnants of the Bethlehem Steel factory in Johnstown.|$|E
25|$|The Genting Skyway is a gondola lift {{connecting}} Gohtong Jaya and Resorts World Genting in Malaysia.

25|$|Due to {{mismanagement}} at {{the hands}} of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi cable car accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.|$|E
25|$|The Schauinslandbahn is a gondola lift in the Black Forest area of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It links a {{lower station}} in the {{municipality}} of Horben, {{near the city of}} Freiburg im Breisgau, with an <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> near the summit of the Schauinsland mountain. The line is operated by VAG Freiburg, the city transport operator for Freiburg. The same company operates that city's tram and bus network, including bus route 21 that links the lower station of the Schauinslandbahn to the terminus of tram route 2 at Günterstal.|$|E
25|$|In the Dunfermline area, a new south-to-west curve {{was built}} at Touch Junctions, {{enabling}} trains from the Forth Bridge to turn {{west to the}} original Dunfermline (<b>Upper)</b> <b>station.</b> Comely Park station in Dunfermline was renamed Dunfermline Lower. Burntisland had become a major port for the export of coal from the Fife coalfields. A direct line from Inverkeithing to Burntisland was needed, enabling trains crossing the Bridge to turn east and reach Burntisland, Kirkcaldy and the coastal towns. The junction at Inverkeithing was made a triangle so that coal trains from west and north of Dunfermline could run direct to Burntisland. These lines all opened in 1890.|$|E

25|$|The Ngong Ping 360 is a gondola lift on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. Intended {{to improve}} tourism to the area, the aerial lift was {{previously}} known as Tung Chung Cable Car Project before acquiring the Ngong Ping 360 brand in April 2005. It {{consists of the}} Ngong Ping Cable Car, {{formerly known as the}} Ngong Ping 360 Skyrail, and the Ngong Ping Village, a retail and entertainment centre adjacent to the cable car's <b>upper</b> <b>station.</b> Ngong Ping 360 connects Tung Chung, on the north coast of Lantau and itself linked to central Hong Kong by the Tung Chung Line, with the Ngong Ping area in the hills above. This is home to the Po Lin Monastery and the Tian Tan Buddha, both already significant tourist attractions in their own right. Before Ngong Ping 360's opening, the only access was via a mountain road and bus service.|$|E
500|$|Each tram car travels {{on a pair}} of 2inch (49mm) steel track ropes, totaling four cables. The track ropes {{combined}} are tensioned at {{over one}} million pounds (4.4 million newtons). A fifth cable—the haul rope—is a continuous loop which winds around the drive bullwheel at the lower station, connects to one car, winds through a counterweighted bullwheel at the <b>upper</b> <b>station,</b> then to the other car, before joining itself. [...] The haul rope length is over 7000feet (2100m).|$|E
500|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> is a {{freestanding}} {{steel and}} concrete tower 140 feet (42.7 m) above grade and houses the tram's counterweight. [...] It is structurally separate from nearby OHSU Hospital and {{connects to the}} hospital's ninth floor via a skybridge over SW Campus Drive, which winds {{through the middle of}} the University. Structural separation between the tram and the hospital is necessary to avoid vibrations from tram machinery interfering with delicate microsurgery performed in the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] ("Allocation codes") of {{the lower}} and <b>upper</b> <b>stations</b> are {{respectively}} 31-02 and 31-03. Code 31 corresponds to the Quartier Pigalle, or FUNB and FUNH.|$|R
50|$|Each {{section of}} the line is worked by coaches with 64 seats that are hauled by 40-millimetre-thick cables from their <b>upper</b> <b>stations.</b> The {{diameter}} of the electrically driven cable drums is 3.85 metres. The gradient of the line varies between 25 and 82 %.|$|R

500|$|The {{stations}} {{each had}} three platforms; a broad island platform in the centre for passengers waiting to board trains, and narrower outer platforms from which passengers exited the trains. Although the <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> {{was known as}} Hereson Road from the outset, the lower station was never officially named. It was known at various times as [...] "Olympia", [...] "Beach", [...] "Sands" [...] and [...] "Lower Terminus". The platforms and ticket offices were immediately outside {{the mouth of the}} tunnel at both stations.|$|E
500|$|Some critics, at {{the time}} of construction, cited the tram as an example of {{corporate}} welfare for OHSU with limited public benefit. [...] A 2001 study done by OHSU prior to the tram's being designed projected that the tram would have 4,700 riders per day by 2030, with less than one fifth (850) of those being non-OHSU users. [...] While the lower station has easy public access, access to the <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> requires navigating through the OHSU hospital. The Cascade Policy Institute, a local libertarian research group, criticized the project for being [...] "railroaded through the political process by small groups of private interests", and expressed doubt that tram construction would lead to new jobs.|$|E
500|$|Two cars {{traverse}} the slope; as one descends, the other ascends and {{acts as a}} counterweight. The cars are [...] wide, [...] tall, and [...] long, and are large enough to carry either 65people, 6motorcycles, or an automobile. While the cars {{are open to the}} elements, an enclosed seating area containing a bench is situated along the outer side of the incline. The cables connecting the cars are , 636 right regular lay, steel wire rope. They are wound around a , [...] drum that connects the cars together. The cable on the north track is [...] long, while the south cable is [...] shorter. Each car weighs , but they, and consequently the cables, can carry an additional load of [...] A [...] electric motor turns the drum, simultaneously winding and unwinding the cable, to power the incline. The Johnstown Inclined Plane is unusual in that the motor and winch are located at a 90-degree angle to the incline instead of directly underneath it. Operation of the incline is controlled via a foot pedal located in a booth in the <b>upper</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} rebuilt with new cars and an {{electric}} drive in 1960, whilst the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>stations</b> were rebuilt in 1975 and 1976 respectively. In 1991 {{the line was}} again modernised, with the provision of new cars with an increased passenger capacity and a faster line speed.|$|R

2500|$|The {{system was}} powered by two sealed water tanks with a {{capacity}} of [...] placed underneath the floor of each cabin. The cabin's tank was refilled at the <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> which allowed its descent under gravity with the combined weight of the passengers and the water, enabling the other carriage to ascend. A steam engine situated at the lower station worked the filling pumps at the <b>upper</b> <b>station.</b> The cabins had {{a capacity of}} forty-eight passengers in four closed compartments arranged like a staircase; the two end platforms were reserved for the driver and brakeman. These were retained for a brake system established on the rack railway. This system transported a million passengers a year for some thirty years.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{no direct}} {{transport}} interchange, except with the [...] "Montmartrobus" [...] {{which has a}} stop in the Rue du Cardinal-Dubois {{in front of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> and offers a free interchange.

Robert the Devil’s dam, Cast Off, had been barren for several years before being covered by Bertram and had been living semi-wild on the Cambridgeshire fens, near Soham. He was bred by Charles Brewer, a well-known bookmaker and was trained by Charles Blanton at <b>Upper</b> <b>Station</b> Road, Newmarket, Suffolk. Brewer sold a half share in the colt to Blanton, and the pair owned him in partnership, although Brewer was usually listed as his official owner.|$|E

50|$|Thanks to {{the efforts}} of Fr. Czeslaw Domel between 1973-1978, the {{community}} built the present two-story brick structure. It was consecrated on 22/10/1978 by Auxiliary Bishop Tadeusz Zawistowski. From 1995-2000, Fr. prob. Stanislaus Bokińca guided efforts that made murals in the church, and restored the <b>upper</b> <b>stations</b> of the cross from the old church.|$|R
60|$|In the Khasia {{mountains}} I found, {{from the}} mean of twelve stations and twenty-three observations, the multiplier as derived from {{the mean of}} the temperature at the <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> and at Calcutta, to be 75.2 degrees, and as deduced from the formula to be 73.1 degrees. Here, however, the equivalent in feet for 1 degree temp. is in summer very high, being 1 degree=385 feet. (See Appendix I.) The mean of all the elevations worked by the boiling-point is upwards of 140 feet below those worked by the barometer.|$|E
60|$|For {{practical}} purposes I found it sufficient {{to assume the}} Calcutta temperature of the air at the day and hour of observation {{to be that of}} the level of the sea at the place of observation, and to take out the multiplier, from the mean of this and of the temperature at the <b>upper</b> <b>station.</b> As, however, 330 feet is a near approach to what I have shown (Appendix I.) to be the mean equivalent of 1 degree for all elevations between 6000 and 18,000 feet; and as the majority of my observations were taken between these elevations, it results that the mean of all the multipliers employed in Sikkim for forty-four observations amounts to 65.1 degrees Fahrenheit, using the Calcutta and <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> observations, and 65.3 degrees on the assumption of a fall of 1 degree for every 330 feet. To show, however, how great an error may accrue in individual cases from using the formula of 1 degree to 330, I may mention that on one occasion, being at an elevation of 12,000 feet, with a temperature of the air of 70 degrees, the error amounted to upwards of 220 feet, and as the same temperature may be recorded at much greater elevations, it follows that in such cases the formula should not be employed without modification.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} {{observations are}} selected as having {{at the time}} been considered trustworthy, owing to the care {{with which they were}} taken, their repetition in several cases, and the presumed accuracy of the barometrical or trigonometrical elevation with which they are compared. A small correction for the humidity of the air might have been introduced with advantage, but as in most barometrical observations, the calculations proceed {{on the assumption that the}} column of air is in a mean state of saturation; as the climate of the <b>upper</b> <b>station</b> was always very moist, and as most of the observations were taken during the rains, this correction would be always additive, and would never exceed sixty feet.|$|E
