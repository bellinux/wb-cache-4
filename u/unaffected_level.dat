In the large-liquidity limit where both frictions are small, we derive explicit formulas for the asymptotically optimal trading rate and the corresponding minimal leading-order performance loss.

Title of diploma thesis: Effect of alpha-humulene on {{adhesion}} {{of breast}} cancer cell line MDA-MB- 231 α-humulene is a sesquiterpene contained in the essential oil of Chinese Bayberry (Myrica rubra), which has various biological effects. The aim of this thesis was to study the cell adhesion of tumor cell line MDA-MB- 231, {{and the effects of}} α-humulene on expression of cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of α-humulene on this cell line was verified. Effect of α-humulene on cell proliferation was evaluated by neutral red uptake test (NRU test) and by xCelligence system. Cell adhesion was also continuously monitored by xCelligence. Expression ganges of cell adhesion molecules upon α-humulene treatment were determined by Western blotting and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the protein and mRNA levels, respectively. The proliferation of the cells was significantly affected by α-humulene after 24 hour treatment (IC 50 13. 6 µg/ml). α-humulene alone caused slightly increased cell adhesion.

40|$|Estrogens play a {{protective}} role in coronary artery disease. The mechanisms of action are still poorly understood, although {{a role for}} estrogens in stimulation of angiogenesis has been suggested. In several cell types, estrogens modulate the Notch pathway, which is involved in controlling angiogenesis downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). The goal of our study was to establish whether estrogens modulate Notch activity in endothelial cells and the possible consequences on angiogenesis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with 17 b-estradiol (E 2) and the effects on Notch signalling were evaluated. E 2 increased Notch 1 processing as indicated by i) decreased levels of Notch 1 transmembrane subunit ii) increased amount of Notch 1 in nuclei iii) <b>unaffected</b> <b>level</b> of mRNA. Similarly, E 2 increased the levels of the active form of Notch 4 without altering Notch 4 mRNA. Conversely, protein and mRNA levels of Notch 2 were both reduced suggesting transcriptional repression of Notch 2 by E 2. Under conditions where Notch was activated by upregulation of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll 4) following VEGF-A treatment, E 2 caused a further increase of the active form of Notch 1, {{of the number of}} cells with nuclear Notch 1 and of Hey 2 mRNA.

Although tetherin could inhibit Vpu-deleted HIV- 1 release, it had negligible activity in restricting HCV JFH- 1 release from hepatocytes, which was evidenced by <b>unaffected</b> <b>levels</b> of intracellular/ extracellular HCV RNA and infectious virus.

40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 1 (DM 1) is {{an extremely}} variable genetic disorder showing an autosomal dominant inheritance that is characterised by myotonia, insulin resistance, cardiac conduction defects and cataracts. It {{is caused by a}} trinucleotide repeat expansion of CTG sequence located in the 3 ’-untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene on chromosome 19 at q 13. 3. The severity of symptoms ranges from mild adult onset to severe congenital form. A characteristic clinical feature of DM 1 is anticipation phenomenon where disease severity increases and age of onset decreases over successive generations. The DM 1 mutation is highly unstable in both the germline and soma, and showed to be an age-dependent, tissue-specific (skeletal muscles comprised the largest allele length of approximately thousand units) and expansion biased. The <b>unaffected</b> <b>level</b> of the repeat sequence falls between 5 - 37 repeats whereas the disease associated range starts from 50 repeats, reaching several thousand units. These properties account for the observed anticipation and contribute toward the tissue-specificity and progressive nature of the symptoms. The manifested phenotypes, symptoms severity and age at onset are extremely variable within and between families. This is mostly accounted for by the progenitor allele length (PAL) passed on from affected parents in addition to the level of somatic instability over time. Though, recent data have shown that additional sequence variations (CCG, CGG variant repeats) within the repeat and immediate flanking DNA are associated with additional symptomatic variation, modified stability and delayed age of onset. Furthermore, individual specific genetic factors have shown to be clustered within and between families as a heritable trait. Therefore, it has been verified that PAL, in addition to individual specific genetic variations are the main modifier of disease onset. More recently, it has been observed that mismatch repair (MMR) genes {{play a key role in}} modulating the dynamic of DM 1 mutation, and subsequently impact on the age at onset. Therefore, these genes serve as powerful trans-acting modifiers of repeat instability and subsequent severity. Also, sequestration and up-regulation of RNA binding proteins (MBNL 1, CELF 1 respectively) against the trapped mutant transcripts are the hall mark of DM 1 pathogenicity associated with alternative splicing defects that account for the variability of symptoms. Thus, sequence variations within these genes may underlie the genetic and phenotypic variability among DM 1 patients. The current diagnostic test for DM 1 only provides a qualitative value, and takes no account of the somatic instability and/or the presence of variations within or elsewhere in the genome. Thus, limited prognostic information is delivered to patients and their families. Although more elaborate genotyping approaches that measure the DM 1 degree of instability was developed, they remain labour intensive, time consuming and are not suited to routine clinical diagnostics. In this project, we have evaluated the utility of more rapid and higher throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (Ion PGM and PacBio platforms) to simultaneously sequence the DM 1 alleles of the Scottish patients, characterise the immediate flanking variants (5 ’-extra AAT and 5 ’-CCG variant repeats), elucidating the possible role of these variants on the DM 1 instability, and finally sequencing the potential trans-acting modifiers in a massive customised panel (Ion AmpliSeq). Though, the accurate genotyping of the DM 1 allele using NGS method remains challenging and cannot be used at the moment for accurate measurement of allele length. This is due to the sequencing biased nature towards shorter fragments resulting in differences of modal allele length measurement between PacBio and traditional SP-PCR methods. Additionally, Ion PGM platform was not successful at sequencing > 20 CTG repeats. To correct for the sequencing biased distribution towards shorter alleles and distinguish between possible somatic variants from sequencing errors, safe sequencing (SafeSeq) method was conducted by tagging each original parental molecule with unique identifier (UID) sequences via PCR followed by sequencing using MiSeq platform. As the UID assignment was successful in tagging different population of repeats lengths, unfortunately we were not able to confidently differentiate between true somatic mutants from possible repeat slippage events in earlier cycles of PCR. Thus, it was decided to modify the incorporation of UID sequences using ligation based approach instead of PCR, and better optimise the method for more accurate results in the future. The identification of the immediate 5 ’-extra AAT flanking variant of the DM 1 allele in a subset of the Scottish DM 1 patients with and without CCG variant repeats has led us to speculate the possible presence of a new sub derived DM 1 haplotype shared by a recent common ancestor in the Scottish population. In order to address this question, we were able to discriminate the normal allele haplotype of 11 - 13 repeats from > 20 CTG haplotype among 18 DM 1 patients whom were previously sequenced by Dr. Saeed Al ghamdi. These data have illustrated the most conserved haplotype around the DM 1 allele. Therefore, the corresponding region was included in a customised Ion AmpliSeq sequencing panel for future larger scale haplotype analysis, in order to provide insights about future DM 1 prevalence among the Scottish population. The data of this project highlighted the importance of using NGS technologies to characterise the structural pattern of the DM 1 allele containing variants that may impact on symptom severity. It also showed the successful sequencing of trans-acting genetic modifiers in massive parallel fashion. Over larger scale analysis, these data could be used for better genotype-phenotype correlation and stratify patients in future clinical trials...|$|E

Importantly, cells infected with influenza A virus also displayed mitochondrial PB 2. We show that an N-terminal motif composed of 120 amino acids is sufficient for localization of PB 2 to mitochondria. In particular, leucine residues at positions 7 and 10 were essential for mitochondrial targeting.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} whether protein import is defective in mitochondrial disease, {{we compared the}} rate of import and the expression of protein import machinery components in skin fibroblasts from control subjects and a patient with multiple mitochondrial disease (MMD). The patient exhibited a 35 % decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity and a 59 % decrease in cellular oxygen consumption compared to control. Western blot analyses revealed that patient levels of MDH, mtHSP 70, HSP 60, and Tom 20 protein were 57 %, 20 %, 75 % and 100 % of control cells, respectively. MDH and Tom 20 mRNA levels were not different from control levels, whereas mtHSP 70 mRNA were 50 % greater than control. Radiolabeled MDH was imported into mitochondria with equal efficiency between patient (44 % of total synthesized) and control (43 %) cells, although the total MDH synthesized in patient cells was reduced by about 40 %. The <b>unaffected</b> <b>levels</b> of mRNA and post-translational import into mitochondria, combined with reduced protein levels of MDH, mtHSP 70, and HSP 60 suggest a translational defect in this patient with MMD. This was verified by the 50 % reduction in overall cellular protein synthesis in the patient compared to control. Further, the similar import rates between patient and control cells suggest an important role for Tom 20, but a lesser role for mtHSP 70 in regulating protein import into mitochondria...|$|R

RhIL- 6 (150 mu g) was administered subcutaneously (s. c.) once daily for 42 consecutive days. Immunologic parameters were measured throughout therapy and at follow-up. No changes in {{white blood cell counts}} were noted. Lymphocyte subsets did not alter, nor did their expression of CD 25 and HLA-DR. Immunoglobulins were <b>unaffected.</b> <b>Levels</b> of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL- 1 beta remained below detection limits. Theoretically, subtle immunologic alterations might have been masked by increases in plasma volume, known tc occur after start of therapy.

However, the absence of appreciable increases in cell activation markers and in monokine levels indicates insufficient immune activation, probably underlying the lack of objective antitumor responses (6 x stable, 9 x progressive disease) in these patients.

IgG subclass deficiency is correctly diagnosed by measurement of all four IgG subclasses. The IgG 2 -subclass deficiency is most frequent, often together with decreased IgG 4 - and/or IgA-levels. The IgG 2 -subclass deficiency {{is associated with a}} diminished immune response to (bacterial capsular) polysaccharide antigens. Although the anti-polysaccharide response is generally believed to be IgG 2 -restricted, a causal relationship between a decrease in IgG 2 and disease is obscure. First, the precise meaning and contribution of IgG 2 to the opsonization of encapsulated microorganisms is incompletely known. Second, several healthy individuals completely lack one or more isotype/subclasses due to (pseudo-) deletions of the genes, but still produce protective antibody titers in the residual Ig isotype or subclass. Third, young children mount protective titers of specific IgG 1 antibodies against polysaccharides, whereas IgG 2 -subclass deficient children are prone to infection by encapsulated bacteria.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transductional {{targeting}} of adenovirus following systemic or regional delivery {{remains one of}} the most difficult challenges for cancer gene medicine. The numerical excess and anatomical advantage of normal (non-cancer) cells in vivo demand far greater detargeting than is necessary for studies using single cell populations in vitro, and this must be coupled with efficient retargeting to cancer cells. METHODS: Adenovirus (Ad 5) particles were coated with reactive poly[N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] copolymers, to achieve detargeting, and retargeting ligands were attached to the coating. Receptor-mediated infection was characterised in vitro and anticancer efficacy was studied in vivo. RESULTS: Polymer coating prevented the virus binding any cellular receptors and mediated complete detargeting in vitro and in vivo. These fully detargeted vectors were efficiently retargeted with the model ligand FGF 2 to infect FGFR-positive cells. Specific transduction activity was the same as parental virus, and intracellular routing appeared <b>unaffected.</b> <b>Levels</b> of transduction were up to 100 -fold greater than parental virus on CAR negative cells. This level of specificity permitted good efficacy in intraperitoneal cancer virotherapy, simultaneously decreasing peritoneal adhesions seen with parental virus. Following intravenous delivery FGF 2 mediated unexpected binding to erythrocytes, improving circulation kinetics, but preventing the targeted virus from leaving the blood stream. CONCLUSIONS: Polymer cloaking enables complete adenovirus detargeting, providing a versatile platform for receptor-specific retargeting. This approach can efficiently retarget cancer virotherapy in vivo. Ligands should be selected carefully, as non-specific interactions with non-target cells (e. g. blood cells) can deplete the pool of therapeutic virus available for targeting disseminated disease...|$|R

In terms of shape and absolute and relative size of the spinal canal, we find all of the Dmanisi and most of the vertebrae of KNM-WT 15000 are within the human range of variation except for the C 7, T 2, and T 3 of KNM-WT 15000, which are constricted, suggesting spinal stenosis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION MDV 3100 is a {{recently}} FDA-approved anti-androgen used {{for treatment of}} metastatic advanced prostate cancer. As learnt from first-generation anti-androgens, therapy with MDV 3100 will eventually lead to therapy-resistance. Understanding the mechanism responsible for MDV 3100 -resistance will provide useful in defining new therapeutic targets and predicting MDV 300 -response in patients. METHODS An in vitro model for MDV 3100 -resistance was generated by long-term therapy of LNCaP cells with 10 µM RD 162 /MDV 3100. Proliferation of the resistant LNCaP cells, named LNCaP-Rr, was no longer repressed by MDV 3100. RNA-seq analysis was applied to investigate changes in the transcriptome of these cells compared to the parental LNCaP cells grown under different conditions: medium with charcoal-stripped serum plus 1) vehicle, 2) DHT 10 nM and 3) DHT 10 nM and MDV 3100 10 µM. In this way, we aim to study the mechanism of MDV 3100 -resistance in more detail. RESULTS Striking changes were observed in the androgen-regulated expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression. While there was no prominent change in the mRNA level of RB 1, a clear change in the mRNA expression of E 2 F-transcription factors was observed. Moreover, almost 50 % of E 2 F target genes were affected in a similar way. Functionally, the affected genes are involved in cell cycle, DNA synthesis, replication and DNA damage repair. Further study at the protein level revealed a hyperphosphorylated RB 1 in the resistant cells but <b>unaffected</b> <b>levels</b> of E 2 F 1 and E 2 F 2.

Compared to the levels in untreated and saline-injected (SAI) animals, levels of CHH transcript, but not those of molt-inhibiting hormone (a CHH-family peptide), in the eyestalk ganglia of CHH dsRNA-injected (DSI) animals were significantly decreased at 24, 48, and 72 hour post injection (hpi), with concomitant changes in levels of CHH peptide in the sinus gland (a neurohemal organ) and hemolymph. Green fluorescence protein (GFP) dsRNA failed to affect levels of CHH transcript in the eyestalk ganglia of GFP DSI animals. Number of metabolites whose levels were significantly changed by CHH dsRNA was 149 and 181 in the muscle and 24 and 12 in the hepatopancreas, at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively. Principal component analysis of these metabolites show that metabolic effects of silencing CHH gene expression were more pronounced in the muscle (with the cluster of CHH DSI group clearly being separated from that of SAI group at 24 hpi) than in the hepatopancreas. Moreover, pathway analysis of the metabolites closely related to carbohydrate and energy metabolism indicate that, for CHH DSI animals at 24 hpi, metabolic profile of the muscle was characterized by reduced synthesis of NAD+ and adenine ribonucleotides, diminished levels of ATP, lower rate of utilization of carbohydrates through glycolysis, and a partially rescued TCA cycle, whereas that of the hepatopancreas by <b>unaffected</b> <b>levels</b> of ATP, lower rate of utilization of carbohydrates, and increased levels of ketone bodies.

One study found that word completion tasks were <b>unaffected</b> by <b>levels</b> of semantic encodings achieved using three words with various levels of meaning in common. Another found that typical level-of-processing effects are reversed in word completion tasks; subjects recalled pictures pairs more completely if they were shown a word representing a picture rather than asked to rate a picture for pleasantness (semantic encoding). [...] Typical level-of-processing theory would predict that picture encodings would create deeper processing than lexical encoding.|$|R
50|$|Superneutrality {{of money}} is a {{stronger}} property than neutrality of money. It holds {{that not only is}} the real economy <b>unaffected</b> by the <b>level</b> of the money supply but also that the rate of money supply growth has no effect on real variables. In this case, nominal wages and prices remain proportional to the nominal money supply not only in response to one-time permanent changes in the nominal money supply but also in response to permanent changes in the growth rate of the nominal money supply. Typically superneutrality is addressed in the context of long-run models.|$|R
40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate performance and estimates of microbial CP (MCP) supply in high moisture corn finishing diets with corn bran addition and different sources of degradable protein. Corn bran increased intake throughout the feeding period but decreased performance after day 42. Microbial efficiency and MCP were unaffected by corn bran addition, but MCP increased with increasing urea level. Performance was increased for the first 42 days when SBM was fed relative to urea, but microbial efficiency and MCP were <b>unaffected.</b> Supplemental DIP <b>level</b> did not affect MCP estimates. Estimates of MCP from allantoin were low and variable but did reflect differences that could be explained with performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe postbuckling {{deflection}} of {{an infinite}} beam that is bonded to a linear elastic foundation and {{is subjected to}} an internal compressive stress is analyzed. The nonlinear equilibrium equation that governs the problem considers extensional deformation of the beam. An analytic solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equation is presented and {{is found to be}} in good agreement with numerical simulations of the problem. The numerical simulations confirm that for a linear elastic foundation the postbuckling deflection is periodic. The analytic solution shows that the postbuckling wavelength is <b>unaffected</b> by the <b>level</b> of internal stress, and is equal to the wavelength at the critical state...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA high {{intake of}} dietary fat has been {{suggested}} to diminish mitochondrial functioning in skeletal muscle, possibly attributing to muscular fat accumulation. Here we show however, that an 8 -week high-fat dietary intervention did not affect intrinsic functioning of rat skeletal muscle mitochondria assessed by respirometry, neither on a carbohydrate- nor on a lipid-substrate. Interestingly, PPARGC 1 A protein increased by ∼ 2 -fold upon high-fat feeding and we observed inconsistent results on different markers of mitochondrial density. Mitochondrial ROS production, assessed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy remained <b>unaffected.</b> Intramyocellular lipid <b>levels</b> increased significantly illustrating that a reduced innate mitochondrial function is not a prerequisite for intra-muscular fat accumulation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{illustrates}} {{an application}} of experimental auction methods, using both experimental economics and experimental design, to evaluate consumer perceptions and willingness to pay (WTP) for fresh pork chops. We test and reject hypotheses that (a) market prices and consumers' WTP are <b>unaffected</b> by the <b>level</b> of attributes embodied in the pork chops, (b) appearance (based on photographs or actual product) and actual taste are equally good sources of consumer information, and (c) consumers are consistent in their preferences for fresh pork attributes. A major conclusion is that predicting consumer demand for fresh pork (or any fresh food) based on appearance without tasting is unproductive. Copyright 1996, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{seagrasses}} Halophila engelmannii, Halodule wrightii, and Syringodium filiforme {{were examined}} for their intrinsic sensitivity to ultraviolet-A-UV-A and ultraviolet-B-UV-B radiation. The effect of UV-A on {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR) was also determined. Ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B were studied with emphasis on the greater respective environmental consequence in terms of seagrass distribution and abundance. Results indicate that an intrinsic sensitivity to UV-A alone is apparent only in Halophila, while net photosynthesis in Halodule and Syringodium seems <b>unaffected</b> by the <b>level</b> of UV-A provided. The sensitivity of Halophila to UV-A in the absense of (PAR) indicates that the photosynthetic reaction {{does not need to}} be in operation for damage to occur. Other significant results are reported...|$|R
30|$|ROS {{production}} in colonic tissue followed a different pattern {{than in the}} liver. The largely <b>unaffected</b> MDA <b>levels</b> in operated animals compared to healthy controls {{were consistent with the}} unaltered mitochondrial function in our experiments. While a slight, continuous, time-dependent increase in the ROS production within both operated groups without a difference between the groups was observed, only the sham group reached the statistical significance over the controls after 96 [*]h. This increase could possibly be explained by the elevated TNF-α level after 96 [*]h, since TNF-α is known to accelerate ROS production [41]. However, TNF-α {{does not seem to be}} the sole factor influencing ROS levels since significant changes occurred only in sham animals but not in CASP animals and only in the colon. On the contrary, ROS {{production in}} the liver was significantly decreased after 96 [*]h after sham and CASP surgery due to an unclear mechanism that requires further investigation. In experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease, the authors observed elevated ROS production in the colon [42]. They used trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats, which probably leads to more pronounced inflammatory damage in colonic tissue than CASP and, therefore, possibly to increased ROS production.|$|R
