40|$|Based on the {{previously}} proposed concept Understanding Tree, this paper introduces two concepts: <b>Understanding</b> Graph <b>and</b> <b>Understanding</b> Map, <b>and</b> explores their potential applications. <b>Understanding</b> Graph <b>and</b> <b>Understanding</b> Map can be deemed as special cases of mind map, semantic network, or concept map. The two main differences are: Firstly, the data sources for constructing <b>Understanding</b> Map <b>and</b> <b>Understanding</b> Graph are distinctive and simple. Secondly, {{the relations between}} concepts in <b>Understanding</b> Graph <b>and</b> <b>Understanding</b> Map are monotonous. Based on their characteristics, applications of them include quantitatively measuring a concept's complexity degree, quantitatively measuring a concept's importance degree in a domain, and computing an optimized learning sequence for comprehending a concept etc. Further study involves evaluating their performances in these applications...|$|R

5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not know the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical <b>understanding</b> <b>and</b> then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased <b>understanding</b> <b>and</b> better predictions.|$|E

The unbalanced treatment of animal coloration in Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom encapsulates Thayer's partial <b>understanding</b> <b>and</b> his rejection of other theories.|$|E

5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an <b>understanding</b> <b>and</b> supportive environment.|$|E

Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E

He made his discoveries during his studies of the desert locust, whose solitary and gregarious phases had previously been thought to be separate species. He designated the two phases as solitaria and gregaria. These are {{also referred to as}} statary and migratory morphs, though strictly speaking, their swarms are nomadic rather than migratory.
