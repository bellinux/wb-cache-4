40|$|Abstract Background and Purpose: Regeneration and {{conversion}} of pure spruce plantations {{is a very}} important task for forest management in Europe. This subject is less marked in Croatia {{in view of the fact}} that in Croatia there are only 75, 000 ha of pure coniferous plantations, which are raised on <b>unstocked</b> <b>forest</b> <b>land.</b> In Croatia, no investigation has yet been carried out on the development of the stand structure, succession processes of autochthonous species and methods of reforestation and {{conversion of}} spruce plantations. This study is one of the first which deals with the aforementioned problems. Materials and Methods: Since 1956 five successive measurements (d b h and tree heights, tree-crown diameters, height of crown base, condition and position of a tree, horizontal crown projections, density and structure of regeneration, comparison of chemical and physical characteristics of soils between the plantation, natural stand and meadow) have been performed in a 161 -year-old spruce plantation on a permanent experimental plot (1 ha), in which no silvicultural treatments were carried out during the last 42 years. Results and discussion: The period of the last 42 years, during which there were no management interventions in the stand, is characterized by specific development of the stand structure. The fact is that in the old Norway spruce plantation there was a considerable potential for succession of autochthonous European beech and silver fir at the time of the first measurement in 1956. However, in spite of two thinnings performed at the beginning of the 48 -year long period (66 Norway spruce trees cut per ha) and 110 naturally removed spruce trees during the last 42 years (self-thinning), the processes of beech and fir succession were very slow. Conclusions: Results on slowed down development of the stand structure of an old spruce plantation, and on slowed down succession processes related to the absence of management interventions and delayed regeneration, are discussed in accordance with the results of spruce plantation management in Central Europe. Further investigations are necessary of the old spruce stand in two directions; under regime without silvicultural treatment (natural development) and under regime by different silvicultural methods...|$|E
40|$|Future {{forest cover}} changes were {{simulated}} under the business-as-usual (BAU), pessimistic and optimistic scenarios using the Markov-cellular automata (MCA) model in Pakxeng district, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR). The Markov chain {{analysis was used}} to compute transition probabilities from satellite-derived forest cover maps (1993, 1996, 2000 and 2004), while the “weights of evidence” procedure was used to generate transition potential (suitability) maps. Dynamic adjustments of transition probabilities and transition potential maps were implemented in a cellular automata (CA) model in order to simulate forest cover changes. The validation results revealed that <b>unstocked</b> <b>forest</b> and current forest classes were relatively well simulated, while the non-forest class was slightly underpredicted. The MCA simulations under the BAU and pessimistic scenarios indicated that current forest areas would decrease, whereas <b>unstocked</b> <b>forest</b> areas would increase in the future. In contrast, the MCA model projected that current forest areas would increase under the optimistic scenario if forestry laws are strictly enforced in the study area. The simulation scenarios observed in this study can be possibly used to understand implications of future forest cover changes on sustainable forest management in Pakxeng district...|$|R

40|$|Phenology-based multi-index {{with the}} random forest (RF) {{algorithm}} {{can be used}} to overcome the shortcomings of traditional deforestation mapping that involves pixel-based classification, such as ISODATA or decision trees, and single images. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate methods to identify specific types of deforestation in North Korea, and to increase the accuracy of classification, using phenological characteristics extracted with multi-index and random forest algorithms. The mapping of deforestation area based on RF was carried out by merging phenology-based multi-indices (i. e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference soil index (NDSI)) derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products and topographical variables. Our results showed overall classification accuracy of 89. 38 %, with corresponding kappa coefficients of 0. 87. In particular, for <b>forest</b> and farm <b>land</b> categories with similar phenological characteristic (e. g., paddy, plateau vegetation, <b>unstocked</b> <b>forest,</b> hillside field), this approach improved the classification accuracy in comparison with pixel-based methods and other classes. The deforestation types were identified by incorporating point data from high-resolution imagery, outcomes of image classification, and slope data. Our study demonstrated that the proposed methodology could be used for deciding on the restoration priority and monitoring the expansion of deforestation areas...|$|R

To characterize these changes, the individuals and organizations who purchased <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> from Minnesota's county land departments were surveyed using a mail questionnaire. The sale of county <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> {{did not appear to}} produce noticeable changes in timber harvesting or the level of investment in forest management. However, the level of professional forestry expertise overseeing the management of these lands declined considerably. Additionally, while nearly all <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> managed by county land departments {{is open to the public}} for recreation, more than half became posted to prohibit public trespass after it was sold.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{economics}} of conversion and fragmentation of <b>forest</b> <b>land.</b> The forestry economics literature has generally focussed on the management of a single stand for timber and nontimber forest benefits with little attention being paid to <b>forest</b> level <b>land</b> use decisions, and in particular forest stand interactions. As noted by Bowes and Krutilla (1989), the focus on a single stand may be a considerable weakness of the multiple-use <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use models given that the provision of nontimber forest benefits, such as biodiversity storage, watershed protection and micro-climatic maintenance, often depend on the setting of a single stand within a larger forest area. If this is the case, then decisions about <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use and allocation need {{to take account of}} the interaction between the stand and the total stock of <b>forest</b> <b>land.</b> The nature of the relationship between stand and total stock of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> is of central importance. In this paper, we define three cases that reflect a range of typical stand-stock relationships that may arise: those being constant, diminishing and increasing marginal returns to the scale of the total forest stock. We explore the <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use decision {{from the perspective of a}} social planner. Taking stand-total forest stock interactions effects into account has important implications for the choice of framework for the economic analysis as well as for the <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation decision. This paper shows that it is not just the level of forest conversion that may be affected by taking stand-stock interactions into account, but also the spatial distribution of the remaining patches of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> for the provision of non-timber forest benefits. The insights from this paper are particularly applicable to those tropical forest regions facing high rates of forest conversion and fragmentation. Policy implications, such as the establishment of minimum viable forest stocks, buffer zones and corridors, are discusse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Although forest {{devolution}} {{has become}} a major trend in forest governance in developing countries over the last two decades, there is increasing concern about the legitimacy of this well-intentioned policy. Examination of Vietnam’s <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation policy helps assess this concern. After the collapse of Vietnam’s state forestry in the late 1980 s, the Vietnamese government allocated <b>forest</b> <b>lands</b> to individuals, households and organizations for more effective forest protection and rehabilitation. Despite this expectation, the policy has been challenged by increasing conflicts between forestry agencies and local people over lands. This paper uses a case study in Tay Ninh province, South Vietnam, to examine the legitimacy of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation, with particular focus on local support for the policy.
