5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E

5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E

These mass movements may also be opportunistic, in search of food, rather than seasonal. A 2008 study of an <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> outbreak of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in British Columbia found that beetles were capable of flying 30–110km per day in densities of up to 18, 600 beetles per hectare.|$|E
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> numbers of {{eggs in a}} nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E

25|$|Edison/Mitofsky {{conducted}} an exit poll {{on behalf of}} the National Election Pool which is the only source of data on voter demographics in California in the 2008 election. The statistical trends from the exit poll of 2,240 voters suggested that an array of voters came out both in opposition to and in support of Proposition 8, with no single demographic group making up most of either the Yes or No vote. The National Election Pool poll showed that support for Proposition 8 was strong amongst African American voters, interviewed in the exit poll with 70% in favor, more than any other racial group. Their support was considered crucial to the proposition's passing, since African Americans made up an <b>unusually</b> <b>larger</b> percentage of voters that year, due to the presence of Barack Obama on the ballot. Polls by both the Associated Press and CNN mirrored this data, reporting support among black voters to be at 70% and 75%, respectively.
