5|$|A North–South divide {{remains in}} {{education}} at all levels. There {{is a significant}} attainment gap between Northern and Southern schools, even after controlling for the economic difference across the country, and pupils in the three Northern regions {{are less likely than}} the national average to achieve five higher-tier GCSEs. Northern students are <b>under-represented</b> at Oxbridge, where three times as many places go to Southerners as to Northerners, and other Southern universities while Southerners are <b>under-represented</b> at leading Northern universities such as Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is <b>under-represented</b> because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MCA {{assessed}} the NEP {{and other government}} policies from a Chinese point of view. Its findings expressed concern {{over a number of}} problems, including alleged disrespect of the citizenship of the Malaysian Chinese and the Malay-dominated civil service, claiming the NEP's goal of eradicating identification of race with economic function had been abrogated. In addition, it was argued that non-Malays were <b>under-represented</b> in Parliament and the Cabinet because of gerrymandering; mostly Malay rural Parliamentary constituencies outnumbered heterogeneous urban constituencies, despite the total population of urban constituencies exceeding that of rural ones. However, UMNO avoided directly confronting the MCA over the issue.|$|E

5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 and serves to introduce into Parliament alternative, independent and non-partisan views from minorities and experts. This is said to effectively raises the level of political discourse. Women, for example, who are usually <b>under-represented</b> in parliament, may be appointed as an NMP to provide alternate views. A special select committee of Parliament nominates candidates to be appointed as NMPs by the President {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet. In 2010, the number of NMPs was increased from six to nine. NMPs share the same powers and privileges as NCMPs.|$|E
5|$|About the film's {{comparison}} with the novel, Chopra {{said in an interview}} that, as compared to its 1953 namesake film by Bimal Roy, the story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them one and a half years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasising <b>under-represented</b> characters from the novel. In a separate interview, Chopra admitted that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. When speaking about cinematic adaptation, Chopra gave due credit to Sarkar, and Natarajan Subramaniam (the film's cinematographer), for providing the vintage visuals. Saif Ali Khan once said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. When the film's crew did not find the depiction appealing, the filming began with the 60s look.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{question}} of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan {{at the expense of}} East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be <b>under-represented</b> in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League, which invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called Bangladesh (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.|$|E
5000|$|Campbell also {{represented}} northern Virginia legislators in who complained that reapportionment after the 1960 census continued to <b>under-represent</b> the growing northern Virginia suburbs. The United States Supreme Court in Davis v. Mann agreed, {{leading to the}} famous [...] "one man, one vote" [...] rationale.|$|R
50|$|Terrestrial {{biodiversity}} {{is thought}} to be up to 25 times greater than ocean biodiversity. A recently discovered method put the total number of species on Earth at 8.7 million, of which 2.1 million were estimated to live in the ocean. However, this estimate seems to <b>under-represent</b> the diversity of microorganisms.|$|R
50|$|In {{several of}} Estrich's books, {{including}} Sex & Power and The Case for Hillary Clinton, she discusses her {{experience as a}} survivor of rape. Her book Real Rape talks {{about the history of}} rape law in the United States. In 2004, Estrich challenged Los Angeles Times editorial page editor Michael Kinsley for <b>under-representing</b> women on the editorial page.|$|R
5|$|In 1652, the English {{parliament}} {{declared that}} Scotland {{was part of}} the Commonwealth. Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always <b>under-represented</b> and had little opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwell's problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become the subject of an act until 1657. The military administration in Scotland, led by General George Monck, was relatively successful. It managed to enforce law and order, suppressing the banditry of the Moss-troopers and enforcing a form of limited religious toleration, but by introducing English judges largely suspending the Scots law. In 1653–55 there was a major Royalist rising in the Highlands led by William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn and John Middleton, which was defeated at the Battle of Dalnaspidal on 19 July 1654.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and <b>under-represented</b> in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
5|$|The ADO {{is seeking}} to expand the number of Indigenous Australians it {{recruits}} and improve their retention rate. Restrictions on Indigenous Australians' ability to enlist in the military existed until the 1970s, though hundreds of Indigenous men and women had joined the military when restrictions were reduced during the world wars. By 1992 the representation of Indigenous Australians in the ADF was equivalent to their proportion of the Australian population, though {{they continue to be}} <b>under-represented</b> among the officer corps. Two of the Army's three Regional Force Surveillance Units (NORFORCE and the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment) are manned mostly by Indigenous Australian reservists. In 2015 Indigenous Australians made up around 1.5% of ADF personnel, which is smaller than the Indigenous share of the total Australian population.|$|E
50|$|The first {{official}} Lingua sites, launched by June 2007, were Chinese (both Simplified and Traditional), Bangla, Farsi, Spanish, Portuguese and French. The project has since grown rapidly {{in size and}} scope, having 35 sites active as of June 2013. Global Voices is translated in all the top Languages used on the Internet but also include <b>under-represent</b> and indigenous languages, such as Aymara.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{of social}} stigmas attached, many people denied having African ancestry, and after African descended Caribbean workers arrived in Honduras, an active {{campaign}} to denigrate all people of African descent, made persons of mixed race anxious to deny any African ancestry. Hence official statistics quite uniformly <b>under-represent</b> {{those people who}} have ancestry in favor of a [...] "two race" [...] solution.|$|R
50|$|Surveys {{like the}} NCVS cited above strive to measure rapes {{that do not}} get {{reported}} to authorities or prosecuted. Some official reports <b>under-represent</b> the prevalence of rape because {{a significant number of}} rapes go unreported or do not advance to prosecution. A 2014 report by the Department of Justice estimated that 34.8% cases of sexual assaults are reported to the authorities.|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the GRC scheme is to entrench minority representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being <b>under-represented</b> in Parliament. In fact, statistics show that all PAP minority candidates have won regularly {{and that the only}} two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a minority candidate. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish. Technically, as the size of GRCs has increased, the minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament, their political clout has also been reduced.|$|E
5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of <b>under-represented</b> community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{exhibition}} was to address the biases museums have, often omitting or <b>under-representing</b> oppressed peoples and focusing on [...] "prominent white men". Wilson took the existing museum’s collection and reshuffled them to highlight the history of African-American and Native American Marylanders. This reassembly created a new viewpoint of colonization, slavery and abolition {{through the use of}} satire and irony.|$|R
25|$|Manning {{arrived at}} Newport in July 1763 and was {{introduced}} to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would <b>under-represent</b> the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery {{was adopted by the}} Assembly on March 3, 1764.|$|R
50|$|The {{legislative}} {{functions of}} government are vested in the County Council. The County Council consists of seven members, five {{of whom are}} elected from single-member districts; {{the other two are}} elected at-large. This method tends to produce a council with members weighted toward the majority population, and members need to ensure they do not <b>under-represent</b> the minority. As of 2014, Councilman John Cannon is the current Council President.|$|R
25|$|Legislative {{powers are}} vested in the People's Assembly, which {{consists}} of 35 elected members. The last parliamentary elections were held on 10/24 March 2012.

50|$|To {{make the}} index investable, hedge funds {{must agree to}} accept {{investments}} on the terms given by the constructor. To make the index liquid, these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable. This means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds. Most seriously, they <b>under-represent</b> more successful managers, who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} five-form classification probably <b>under-represents</b> {{the variation}} within Papio. Some commentators argue {{that at least}} two more forms should be recognized, including the tiny Kinda baboon (P. cynocephalus kindae) from Zambia, DR Congo, and Angola, and the gray-footed baboon (P. ursinus griseipes) found in Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and northern South Africa. However, current knowledge of the morphological, genetic, and behavioral diversity within Papio is too poor to make any final, comprehensive judgment on this matter.|$|R
5000|$|During the 2016 Democratic Primary, Gloria Steinem made comments, {{for which}} she later apologized, {{suggesting}} that female voters who supported Sanders did so as a strategy for meeting [...] "boys." [...] Critics of the American mainstream media argue that the Bernie Bro is a myth that exaggerates the impact of Internet trolling and <b>under-represents</b> the political agency of young women. Sanders supporters argued that the term represents a straw man characterization used to delegitimize critics of Clinton.|$|R
