5000|$|Headgear {{for service}} uniforms {{consisted}} of two types, {{similar to those in}} use in the Army's ground forces, in olive drab for winter wear and khaki for summer. The garrison cap, commonly called the [...] "flight cap" [...] in the air forces, had been authorized for all ranks since 1926 to facilitate the wearing <b>of</b> radio <b>headsets</b> during flights. The [...] "curtain" [...] had piping for enlisted men in the USAAF branch colors of orange and ultramarine blue. The caps of warrant officers were piped with black and silver cord; commissioned officers had black and gold piping except for general officer caps, which used gold cord. The oval service cap was fitted with a spring stiffening device called a grommet, and prior to World War II uniform regulations authorized officers to remove the grommet to permit the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>headsets.</b> This style became widely popular during World War II as a symbol of being a combat veteran, and was known as a [...] "50-mission crush" [...] cap. The service cap however was no longer generally issued to enlisted men after 1942.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{hands-free}} communication {{has led to}} an increased popularity in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>headsets</b> with mobile phones. Comfort and portability concerns have led to the desire for headsets with a small form factor. Unfortunately, this size constraint typically requires that the microphone be placed farther from the user’s mouth, making it highly susceptible to environmental noise. One long term goal of our work is to develop a headset that can achieve the sound capture performance of a close-talking microphone located at the user’s mouth, while maintaining the desired compact size. Toward this end, we have designed a <b>headset</b> consisting <b>of</b> three air microphones and a bone-conductive sensor. The speech enhancement is performed in two stages, a fixed beamformer followed by a single-channel adaptive post-filter. Unlike other techniques, the beamformer is calibrated in a purely data-drive manner. We present preliminary experimental results using real data collected in multiple environments. The proposed approach results in significant improvements in both speech recognition accuracy and SNR. 1...|$|R

50|$|Headsets are {{available}} in single-earpiece and double-earpiece designs. Single-earpiece headsets are known as monaural headsets. Double-earpiece headsets may support stereo sound, or use the same audio channel for both ear-pieces. Monaural headsets free up one ear, allowing interaction with others and awareness <b>of</b> surroundings. Telephone <b>headsets</b> are monaural, even for double-earpiece designs, because telephone offers only single-channel input and output. For computer or other audio applications, where the sources offer two-channel output, stereo headsets are the norm; <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>headset</b> instead <b>of</b> headphones allows <b>use</b> for communications (usually monaural) in addition to listening to stereo sources.|$|R

40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) is {{a nascent}} {{technology}} platform {{that through the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>headsets</b> immerses users into feeling {{as though they are}} transported to a new world (or space) with a sense of presence and the fidelity of real life. The VR industry is expected by many to disrupt how we consume and experience media as well as reimagine countless industries including filmmaking, gaming, entertainment, education and healthcare. The rise of immersive reality technology platforms like VR can be juxtaposed with the rising state of crisis that exists in the Autism Services System (ASD) in Ontario for both youth and adults. Currently in Ontario there is a complex system of services where many individuals need various degrees of support and treatment with few and difficult to navigate supports available for some and not for all. This includes assistance for aging adults with ASD and other developmental disabilities. The core of human services systems such as Ontario’s ASD system are the lived experiences of families/caregivers who navigate multiple services/ supports and provide care for their diagnosed loved ones. This major research project will explore the potential for VR technology {{to play a role in}} capturing and sharing the lived experience of families to impact the design of services within human services systems in Ontario through the lens of the ASD system. The project will conclude by offering implications and directions for future research...|$|R

5000|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly was {{critical}} of the production. He felt that The Passion [...] "had {{the potential to be}} divisive instead of uniting, an ecstatic religious experience for many, one more powerfully alienating experience for everyone else". However, the soundtrack was panned for its questionable thematic relevance and drew comparisons to Moulin Rouge!, as [...] "Calling All Angels" [...] gave [...] "affecting voice" [...] to Gethsemane, but [...] "Demons" [...] had [...] "offered only pat, unsatisfying explanation for Judas' betrayal." [...] The portrayals were criticized for having [...] "boy band video camaraderie", no depth, and no actual [...] "acting" [...] beyond [...] "poses of earnestly generated emotion". Jensen also criticized the fact that The Passion consisted primarily of pre-recorded numbers despite being promoted as a live musical, and that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>headsets</b> in these scenes were meant to mislead viewers. Jensen described Perry's narration as being [...] "like a more subdued Ryan Seacrest counting down the minutes to New Year's", but were repetitive and [...] "cliché". He also noted that the procession interviewees had [...] "poignant stories, for sure," [...] but that [...] "Turner's cheeriness and get-to-the-point hurriedness bent them all toward the rah-rah product endorsements." [...] Jensen praised the Pontius Pilate scenes as being the [...] "most 'live' dramatic moment" [...] of the special, noting the [...] "inspired" [...] choice of [...] "We Don't Need Another Hero", and Seal's [...] "soaring rendition" [...] of [...] "Mad World". The resurrection scene, in which Jencarlos performed Katy Perry's [...] "Unconditionally" [...] from the roof of a Westin hotel near the stage to signify the resurrection <b>of</b> Jesus, was <b>used</b> to exemplify the shortcomings of The Passion as a whole, noting that [...] "a more effective final image would have been to place Jesus on the ground and moving among in his people as he did after his resurrection and as the Holy Spirit did on Pentecost. Instead, by setting Jesus apart from the audience, The Passion created a metaphor for how so many people experience God—far away; hard to see—and a metaphor for a TV spectacle full of simplistic passion but failed as engaging play." ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{different}} aspects of augmented reality audio (ARA). In ARA applications, the natural sound environment is enriched {{with the addition of}} virtual sounds, and their mixture is presented to the listener using headphones. A typical configuration has microphones placed outside of the headphones, and these natural environmental signals are combined with virtual source renderings. This work focuses on the concept <b>of</b> <b>using</b> an insert-type <b>of</b> <b>headset</b> with integrated microphones as a platform for ARA applications and environments. Subjective and objective measurements were performed to yield optimum equalization for the headset design. Based on the measurement results, an ARA system composed <b>of</b> a <b>headset</b> and mixer unit is proposed. The sound quality and usability of the system is further evaluated in laboratory and real-life situations. Furthermore, a novel method for acoustic positioning and head tracking is introduced. By placing a set of anchor sound sources in the environment, an ARA headset can be used to determine sound propagation times from the anchor sources to the headset microphones. When the sound source locations are known a priori, this information can be further processed to estimate the user position and orientation. In addition to the positioning method, different sound signaling systems for anchor sound sources are also studied...|$|R
