5|$|Whitetip reef {{sharks are}} rarely {{aggressive}} towards humans, {{though they may}} investigate swimmers closely. However, spear fishers {{are at risk of}} being bitten by one attempting to steal their catch. This species is caught for food, though ciguatera poisoning resulting from its consumption has been reported. The IUCN has assessed the whitetip reef shark as Near Threatened, noting its numbers are dwindling due to increasing levels of <b>unregulated</b> <b>fishing</b> activity across its range. The slow reproductive rate and limited habitat preferences of this species renders its populations vulnerable to overfishing.|$|E
5|$|Flag-of-convenience {{registries}} are criticized, {{mostly by}} trade union organizations based in developed countries, {{especially those of}} Europe.

Seafarers from developed countries must make themselves competitive if they wish to take advantage and practice in a global environment. , thirteen flag states have been found by international shipping organizations to have substandard regulations. A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows shipowners to be legally anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offer substandard working conditions, and negatively impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and <b>unregulated</b> <b>fishing.</b> , ships of thirteen flags of convenience are targeted for special enforcement by countries that they visit. Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labor pool.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{porcupine}} ray consists {{mainly of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes, which it digs {{up from the}} sea floor. It is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The porcupine ray has long been valued for its rough and durable skin, which {{was made into a}} shagreen leather once used for various utilitarian and ornamental purposes, such as to cover sword hilts and shields. It is caught incidentally by coastal fisheries. Because it must be handled carefully due to its thorns, its commercial significance is limited. <b>Unregulated</b> <b>fishing</b> has led to this species declining in many parts of its range, and thus has been listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is taken}} by {{fisheries}} operating off Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and likely elsewhere, using longlines, gillnets, and trawls. The meat and liver are eaten, though sharks from certain areas present a substantial risk of ciguatera poisoning (especially the liver, which contains {{a much higher}} concentration of the toxin than the meat). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as its numbers have dropped in recent decades due to increasing, and thus far <b>unregulated,</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure in the tropics. Its restricted habitat, low dispersal, and slow reproduction are factors that limit this shark's capacity for recovering from overfishing. On the Great Barrier Reef, populations of whitetip reef sharks in fishing zones have been reduced by 80% relative to no-entry zones. Furthermore, populations in no-take zones, where boats are allowed but fishing prohibited, exhibit levels of depletion comparable to fishing zones due to poaching. Demographic models indicate that these depleted populations will continue to decline by 6.68.3% per year without additional conservation measures.|$|E

Additionally the ICG is in the charge of defusing naval mines, most of which were laid during the Second World War, and monitoring fisheries in International waters outside of the Icelandic Economic zone in order to blacklist any vessel partaking in <b>unregulated</b> <b>fishing</b> and thus bar them from receiving services from any member of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in order to make <b>unregulated</b> <b>fishing</b> unprofitable.

25|$|While {{governments can}} create {{regulations}} to control people's behaviours {{this can be}} undermined by illegal fishing activity. Estimates {{of the size of}} the illegal catch range from 11 to 26 million tonnes, which represents 14-33% of the world's reported catch. Illegal fishing can take many forms. In some developing countries, large numbers of poor people are dependent on fishing. It can prove difficult to regulate this kind of overfishing, especially for weak governments. Even in regulated environments, illegal fishing may occur. While industrial fishing is often effectively controlled, smaller scale and recreational fishermen can often break regulations such as bag limits and seasonal closures. Fisherman can also easily fish illegally by doing things such as underreporting the amount of fish they caught or reporting that they caught one type of fish while actually catching another. There is also a large problem with surveillance of illegal fishing activity. In 2001, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), passed the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and <b>Unregulated</b> <b>Fishing</b> (IPOA-IUU). This is an agreement with the intention to stop port states from allowing boats to dock that participated in illegal, unreported or <b>unregulated</b> <b>fishing.</b> It also gives details for port states on effective measures of inspecting and reporting illegal fishing. Some illegal fishing takes place on an industrial scale with financed commercial operations.|$|E

500|$|While flag of {{convenience}} ships {{have been involved with}} some of the highest-profile oil spills in history (such as the Maltese-flagged , the Bahamian-flagged , the Marshallese-flagged Deepwater Horizon, and the Liberian-flagged SS Torrey Canyon, [...] and [...] ) the most common environmental criticism they face regards illegal fishing. These critics of the flag {{of convenience}} system argue that many of the FOC flag states lack the resources or the will to properly monitor and control those vessels. The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) contends that illegal, unreported and <b>unregulated</b> <b>fishing</b> (IUU) vessels use flags of convenience to avoid fisheries regulations and controls. Flags of convenience help reduce the operating costs associated with illegal fishing methods, and help illegal operators avoid prosecution and hide beneficial ownership. As a result, flags of convenience perpetuate IUU fishing which has extensive environmental, social and economic impacts, particularly in developing countries. The EJF is campaigning to end the granting of flags of convenience to fishing vessels as an effective measure to combat IUU fishing.|$|E
2500|$|For chelonians inhabiting {{the eastern}} Pacific, {{including}} the Galápagos green turtle, the threats are the same. [...] The main factor leading to decline {{in this area}} was the intense and <b>unregulated</b> <b>fishing</b> operations run {{off the coast of}} Mexico between 1950 and 1970. In many countries in Central and South America, the meat of sea turtles is considered a delicacy and they are to this day poached and hunted directly. The mortality of the sea turtles near their foraging area of the Baja California peninsula is around 7800deaths yearly, which has led many organizations to rally for governmental protection of this area for the species. Around 9 out of 100 individuals survive a year in the waters of the Baja California peninsula; this in an intense foraging ground for all population in the eastern Pacific.
