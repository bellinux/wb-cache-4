25|$|Doctor of Medical Science (Dr.Med.Sc.); Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Cardiac surgery, Cardiology, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Radiology, Anaesthesiology. Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, <b>Urology,</b> Renal Medicine, Forensic Medicine, Gastroenterology, Paediatric surgery, Rehabilitation Medicine.|$|E
25|$|Among his {{developments}} in <b>urology</b> were his technique to puncture the bladder (cytotomy), various methods of removing urinary calculi, {{external and internal}} urethrotomies, the subcutaneous ligation of varicocele veins using the fisherman's knot, and genital operations.|$|E
25|$|Students {{study the}} allied specialties: eye, ear, nose and throat diseases, <b>urology,</b> neurology, tuberculosis, venereal diseases, {{orthopaedics}} and traumatology, skin diseases, {{mental health and}} psychiatry, oro-maxillo-facial surgery, radiology, radiotherapy, nuclear medicine, anaesthesiology, thoracic surgery, and paediatric surgery.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, {{there will}} be {{discrepancies}} between the preferences of the student and programs. Students may be matched to programs very low on their rank list, especially when the highest priorities consist of competitive specialties like radiology, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, otolaryngology, radiation oncology, and <b>urology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{areas of}} {{research}} at the Center include: Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Allergy, Endocrinology, Nephrology, Hemato-oncology, Hepato-oncology, Infection, Rheumatology, Orthopedics, General Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics & Gynecology, ENT, Family Medicine, Rehabilitation Medicine, Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, Dermatology, Neurology, Psychiatry, Diagnostics, Pathology, Radiology, Radiological Oncology, Ophthalmology, <b>Urology,</b> Nuclear Medicine.|$|E
25|$|Treatments in {{nephrology}} {{can include}} medications, blood products, surgical interventions (<b>urology,</b> vascular or surgical procedures), renal replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation) and plasma exchange. Kidney problems can have {{significant impact on}} quality and length of life, and so psychological support, health education and advanced care planning play key roles in nephrology.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{review and}} {{practice}} guideline {{published by the}} European Association of <b>Urology</b> concluded that the clinical trial data provides Grade 1a evidence that duloxetine improves but does not cure urinary incontinence, and that it causes {{a high rate of}} gastrointestinal side effects (mainly nausea and vomiting) leading to a high rate of treatment discontinuation.|$|E
25|$|Concentrations of oxy- and {{deoxyhemoglobin}} can {{be measured}} continuously, regionally and noninvasively using NIRS. NIRS can be used both on the head as on muscles. This technique is often used for research in e.g. elite sports training, ergonomics, rehabilitation, patient monitoring, neonatal research, functional brain monitoring, brain computer interface, <b>urology</b> (bladder contraction), neurology (Neurovascular coupling) and more.|$|E

The James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health ranked {{nationally in}} all ten designated specialties in the U.S. News & World Report.|$|E
25|$|An MD or a DNB (general {{medicine}} or paediatrics) {{is the basic}} requirement for specialisation in Cardiology, Nephrology, Neonatology, Gastro-enterology, Neurology except for Clinical Hematology (Pathology or general medicine), etc., while an MS or a DNB (general surgery, ENT or Orthopaedic surgery) is the basic requirement for Neurosurgery, <b>Urology,</b> Cardio-thoracic & Vascular Surgery, Gastrointestinal Surgery, Paediatric Surgery, Plastic Surgery, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{intersex}} surgery is {{intertwined with the}} development of the specialities of pediatric surgery, pediatric <b>urology,</b> and pediatric endocrinology, with our increasingly refined understanding of sexual differentiation, {{with the development of}} political advocacy groups united by a human qualified analysis, and in the last decade by doubts as to efficacy, and controversy over when and even whether some procedures should be performed.|$|E
25|$|Receiving {{his medical}} degree from Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College (GSVM) in Kanpur city of Uttar Pradesh, India, Tewari {{graduated}} with honors in 1984 with 17 gold academic medals to credit. He received his training in <b>urology</b> from Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) in India under the mentorship of Professor Mahendra Bhandari and completed the McH and DNB program in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Other {{services}} {{include a}} specialty surgery unit {{to care for}} orthopedic, <b>urology,</b> neurology and other surgery patients, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services, critical care unit, interventional radiology, and inpatient and outpatient medical imaging.

25|$|Clover became house {{surgeon to}} James Syme upon {{graduation}} in 1846. He became Resident Medical Officer at University College Hospital in 1848, and was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1850. Originally Clover developed {{an interest in}} the field of <b>urology.</b> He practised as a surgeon, inventing two instruments for the crushing and removal of bladder stones. Ill health caused him to give up in 1853 and he turned to general practice.|$|E
25|$|Claudian died on October 16, 1962 at an <b>urology</b> hospital, {{where he}} was being looked after by Zoe. Two lengthy works on the {{sociology}} of literature remained in manuscript form; one deals with classical French theater, another with 19th-century French prose. (Fragments appeared in 1957–1958 in Iașul Literar and in Studii și Cercetări Științifice.) In 1972, Editura Minerva released Senin ("Halcyon"), Zoe Claudian's selection from her husband's poetry, written in a lyrically intellectual style, with problems posed in an ironic and philosophical manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{separate}} residencies has proliferated {{and there are}} now dozens. For many years the principal traditional residencies included internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, <b>urology,</b> physical medicine and rehabilitation, and psychiatry. Some training once considered part of internship has also now been moved into the 4th year of medical school (called a subinternship) with significant basic science education being completed before a student even enters medical school (during their undergraduate education before medical school).|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{medical school}} teaches {{physicians}} {{a broad range}} of medical knowledge, basic clinical skills, and supervised experience practicing medicine in a variety of fields, medical residency gives in-depth training within a specific branch of medicine. A physician may choose a residency in anesthesiology, ophthalmology, cardiothoracic surgery, dermatology, emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, obstetrics and gynecology, otolaryngology, pathology, pediatrics, plastic and reconstructive surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, radiology, radiation oncology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, general surgery, <b>urology</b> or other medical specialties.|$|E
25|$|There is {{disagreement}} in surgical textbooks regarding {{which side}} of the recipient’s pelvis to use in receiving the transplant. Campbell's <b>Urology</b> (2002) recommends placing the donor kidney in the recipient’s contralateral side (i.e. a left sided kidney would be transplanted in the recipient's right side) to ensure the renal pelvis and ureter are anterior in the event that future surgeries are required. In an instance where there is doubt over whether there is enough space in the recipient’s pelvis for the donor's kidney, the textbook recommends using the right side because the right side has a wider choice of arteries and veins for reconstruction. Smith's <b>Urology</b> (2004) states that either side of the recipient's pelvis is acceptable; however the right vessels are 'more horizontal' with respect to each other and therefore easier to use in the anastomoses. It is unclear what is meant by the words 'more horizontal'. Glen's Urological Surgery (2004) recommends putting the kidney in the contralateral side in all circumstances. No reason is explicitly put forth; however, one can assume the rationale {{is similar to that of}} Campbell, i.e. to ensure that the renal pelvis and ureter are most anterior in the event that future surgical correction becomes necessary.|$|E
