40|$|The {{design of}} {{rectangular}} dielectric resonator antennas (DRA) with <b>ultrawide</b> <b>bandwidths,</b> {{in the range}} of 60 - 110 %, is described. The DRA exploits multiple low-Q modes with overlapping bandwidths to achieve a wide contiguous bandwidth. This is achieved using a full-length, low-permittivity inset between a higher permittivity dielectric volume and a ground plane. With the proposed dielectric arrangement and a feed inside DR, it is possible to efficiently couple a sufficient number of such overlapping modes to a 50 Ω feedline. The volume of such DRAs is also reduced by means of a finite planar conducting wall. These advantages led to an example design with a bandwidth that is significantly wide {{and at the same time}} has a smaller DR volume than conventional DRAs.

We study apodization in detail for many regimes of interest, including low-gain difference frequency generation (DFG), high-gain optical parametric amplification (OPA), and high-efficiency adiabatic frequency conversion (AFC). Our analysis is also applicable to second-harmonic generation, sum frequency generation, and optical rectification. In each case, a systematic and opti-mized approach to grating construction is provided, and different apodization techniques are compared where appropriate.

This paper provides a unified performance analysis of various TR schemes by developing an analytical framework based on the sampling expansion approach. Specifically, we derive the uncoded bit error probability (BEP) of different TR signaling schemes, including TR and differential TR (DTR) signaling valid for a broad class of fading channels. We consider both AcRs and modified AcRs with noise averaging. We further develop a quasi-analytical method {{as well as an}} approximate analytical method to extend the BEP analysis to include the effect of narrowband interference (NBI). We show that the approximate analytical method is particularly useful in obtaining BEP expressions that provide insight into the effect of NBI.

In this paper, the BER performance of the hybrid DS-TH UWB systems using the proposed detection scheme is investigated, assuming communications over UWB channels modeled by the Saleh–Valenzuela channel model.
