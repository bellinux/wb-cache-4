40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to elucidate from a macroscopic perspective {{the characteristics of the}} rapid development of irrigation and drainage systems and paddy fields on the Sanjiang Plain. The entities involved in this project were stratified: on the first stratum was a national project for comprehensive land development; on the second stratum was the Bureau of Agricultural Reclamation, which manages state farms, and its Agricultural Reclamation Administration branch; and on the third stratum was zhigong farmers. The existence of these stratified entities was a condition made necessary by the nature of this project, i. e., development of a large wetland. Being at a point where three major rivers meet, the Sanjiang Plain is a flood plain, and so major infrastructure development was required, thereby necessitating this national project for flood control. The unique existence of the local government, which administers the political as well as the economic vehicle of state farms, also contributed to the promotion of agricultural development. It was also the existence of zhigong farmers, who assumed superiority and had the economic accumulation which brought this project to success that helped to stabilize rice production with an <b>underground</b> water <b>irrigation</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract：The {{effect of}} initial water content on water {{transport}} characteristics in injection irrigation is analyzed through an indoor experiment of injection irrigation in different initial water contents. The research shows the following results. The {{relationship between the}} cumulative infiltration and time accords with power function. The higher the initial water content is, the bigger the cumulative infiltration {{is in the same}} time. The wetting front is a semi-circle with its center below the water outlet, the transport velocity of which slows down with the passing of time. The transport velocity of vertical section crossing the middle of the two outlets approaches that of vertical section at the middle point of the central line of the two outlets. The higher the initial water content is, the shorter the time of the transport velocity of the two sections similar to each other is. The water wetted range is comparatively wider, and the water content is comparatively higher below the outlet, and it is reverse above the outlet. The higher the initial water content is, the wider the wetted range is and the higher the water content of the soil being the same distance from the outlet is. The above research provides a basis for supplementing the theories and technologies of injection irrigation.

40|$|United States rice {{producers}} are currently con-fronted with both low sales prices and high produc-tion costs. Weak export demand (related {{to the strong}} value of the U. S. dollar) and development of higher-yielding, long grain varieties (Rister and Grant) are contributing to the low price situation. A major component of high production costs is irriga-tion water. Two types of irrigation delivery systems are cur-rently being utilized in the Texas Rice Belt (extend-ing along the Gulf Coast from the Texas- Louisiana border to 100 miles west of Houston) : (a) conven-tional surface canals and (b) subsurface pipeline systems. Surface canals {{have been used for}} many years and are commonly in use today. Water losses in surface canal delivery systems, however, range from 25 % to 65 % (Griffin, Perry, and McCauley, p. 63), thus indicating the potential advantages of a more efficient water delivery system, such as an <b>underground</b> pipeline <b>irrigation</b> delivery system. Problem Statement Perry, Rister, and Griffin have identified many of the benefits associated with underground pipeline investments and the effects these benefits have on the value of underground pipeline investments. Among these benefits are increased water delivery efficiencies of underground pipeline relative to sur-face canal delivery systems and the ability to use the underground system in delivering water to vari-ous row crops when rice is not produced. In addi-tion, land previously used for surface laterals may be put into production, and labor used to maintain those laterals can be eliminated or allocated to other uses. Although the benefits associated with under-ground pipeline systems can be quite substantial, the costs must also be considered. Perry, Rister, and Griffin did not analyze the associated invest...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} preliminary analyses {{conducted over}} two specific cotton plots shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1. AVIRIS low altitude imagery and experimental cotton plots. October is typically {{the time of}} the year for cotton picking in the SJV. About three weeks prior to picking the irrigation is stopped in preparation for the application of a defoliant agent. Defoliated cotton is more easily harvested. The flight date of 10 October was after irrigation had stopped, but before application of the defoliant agent. In practice, this would be too late in the season to affect any economic benefit. Also, because irrigation was stopped, the onset of water stress affects the data. However, these data provide great scientific value by allowing development and testing of analysis techniques that may be used to map subtle localized conditions across plots of specific crops. 3. Ground Work Throughout the growth season which started in late May 1998, multispectral imagery was collected over the fields using the Shafter Airborne Multispectral Remote Sensing System (SAMRSS) instrument. This sensor package consists of three 10241024 CCD cameras equipped with filters simulating the first four TM bands. A fourth thermal infrared camera was also used.

50|$|The {{irrigation}} systems of Tajikistan cover 737,700 ha of land, of which 300,000 ha are zones of machine irrigation. They are subdivided into 4 categories {{according to the}} technical equipment: 1) modern irrigational systems (282,000 ha), 2) {{irrigation systems}} with main channels without anti-filtration cover {{and the lack of}} hydrotechnical facilities (202,000 ha), 3) irrigation systems with rehabilitated networks and large main channels (200,000 ha), 4) irrigation systems which are not adequately equipped (53,700 ha). Pumping stations serve 40% of the irrigated areas, 64% of which are in the Sughd Province. An estimated 20% of irrigated lands in Tajikistan suffer from water shortages caused by poor regulation of river flows. In the area of the Istravshan (30,000 ha), only 55% of water demands are met. In Kyzyl-Su-Yah-Su basin in Kulob area (60,000 ha) receives only 65% of required water. The same situation prevails for 12,000 ha of land in Hisor. Agricultural irrigation techniques have remained unchanged {{over the past few years}} and are principally performed through furrows. Before 1990, only 3,500 ha of land received water through flexible pipes that delivered it to furrows and rain water irrigation was used for 296 ha.

30|$|The {{following}} {{point and}} non-point sources could have contributed nitrates to the groundwater of the Banana Plain and the Mount Cameroon area—(1) Fertilizer use: the fertilizer consumption rate is relatively higher {{in these areas}} due to well-established agro-industrial farming system of bananas. Commonly used fertilizers in the banana plantations are NPK, urea and potash which are applied on a monthly basis, whereas lime amendments are applied on a 2 -year basis and rotation with other crops (pineapple) is sometimes used (Opfergelt 2008). (2) Freely drained, well-aerated, deep, fertile loam soils: the soil of these areas is typically ash and pumice deposits from volcanic cones and sandy or sandy clay with high coarse texture. Such soils have high water filtration rate and possibly contribute in nitrate leaching to <b>underground</b> waters. (3) <b>Irrigation</b> mechanisms: the two areas are rich in agro-industrial production of banana and other export crops (rubber and palm oil) based on a well-developed system of sprinkler irrigation. High irrigation rate may contribute to nitrate leaching in soils of these areas. Due to intensive agro-industrial activities, nitrogenous fertilizer consumption rate is comparatively higher in these areas than in other agro-zones of the country (Jayne et al. 2003). These nitrogenous fertilizers are easily converted to NO 3 − when applied to the soil. Nitrates are highly soluble and easily leachable on irrigation (Kundu et al. 2008). It is therefore concluded that heavy fertilizer consumption, highly coarse soils, high irrigation rates and well-developed sprinkler irrigation network are some factors responsible for NO 3 − leaching to groundwater of the studied areas alongside the infiltration of wastewater from sanitation facilities into groundwater.|$|R
