5|$|The Montana {{class would}} have <b>used</b> <b>aircraft</b> for {{reconnaissance}} and for gunnery spotting. The {{type of aircraft}} used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned, but in all probability they would have used either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk. The aircraft would have been floatplanes launched from catapults on the ship's fantail. They would have landed {{on the water and}} taxied to the stern of the ship to be lifted by a crane back to the catapult.|$|E
5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which <b>used</b> <b>aircraft</b> to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Following Hungary's {{membership}} of NATO in 1999, {{there were several}} proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying second-hand aircraft options as well as modifying the nation's existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and <b>used</b> <b>aircraft</b> from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the US. Although the Hungarian government initially intended to procure the F-16, in November 2001 {{it was in the}} process of negotiating a 10-year lease contract for 12 Gripen aircraft, with an option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease period.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320neo family {{aircraft}} {{ordered in}} 2011 {{were to be}} delivered starting 2015. However, due to a delay in the production and delivery of these aircraft, IndiGo dry-leased a total of 22 <b>used</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{to cope with the}} demand. On 15 October 2014, IndiGo expressed its intention to order a further 250 A320neo aircraft worth US$25.7 billion at list prices. On 15 August 2015, IndiGo confirmed the order for 250 A320neo aircraft for $26.5 billion. The order also provides IndiGo the flexibility to convert some A320neos to A321neos that can seat more passengers and fly on longer routes. The order of 250 jets was Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft. Indigo received the first A320neo in March 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling <b>used</b> <b>aircraft</b> parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} model XA remains popular on the <b>used</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{market and}} aircraft for sale command high prices. Long operational {{use and the}} rigours of land and water operation have resulted in weak points in the design being identified as many older aircraft have suffered from bent wing trailing edges, wing root tube brackets, flying wire shackles and tail boom tubes. Cracked aft vertical stabilizer tubes and main bulkheads are also common. All of these deficiencies can be repaired in <b>used</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although with no set date, Boeing {{expects to}} build, {{possibly}} in the 2018-2023 timeframe, a 787 freighter version.

25|$|One of {{the most}} widely <b>used</b> <b>aircraft</b> in former Comecon countries, the number in active service is {{decreasing}} because of political intention and noise restrictions. The model has seen long-term service with some 42 countries, with some European airlines having scheduled as many as 12 daily takeoffs and landings per plane. In addition to regular passenger service, it has also been used in various air force, army and navy support roles; for pilot and navigator training; and for aviation research and test projects. In recent years, a number of Tu-134s have been converted for use as VIP transports and business jets. A total of 854 Tu-134s were built of all versions (including test bed examples) with Aeroflot as the largest user; by 1995, the Tu-134 had carried 360 million passengers for that airline.|$|E

[...] From the 1960s through the 1980s, work from the various regional hurricane offices was consolidated into the National Hurricane center. Its name was changed to the Tropical Prediction Center in 1995, before reassuming its National Hurricane Center name in 2010.

The Miami Hurricane Warning Office (HWO) moved from Lindsey Hopkins Hotel to the Aviation Building [...] to the northwest on July 1, 1958. Forecasts within the hurricane advisories were issued one day into the future in 1954 before being extended to two days into the future in 1961, three days into the future in 1964, and five days into the future in 2001. The Miami HWO moved to {{the campus of the}} University of Miami in 1964, and was referred to as the NHC in 1965.

On , the company was rebranded as Nigeria Airways. At this time the airline <b>used</b> <b>aircraft</b> leasing as a common practice: Boeing 707s that flew the Lagosâ€“London route were leased from Laker Airways and Ethiopian Airlines until a new Boeing 707-320C was incorporated into the fleet and deployed on the route in August 1971, and in October 1971 a Boeing 737 was leased from Aer Lingus. Another Boeing 707-320C was ordered in 1972, along with two Boeing 737-200s. A Boeing 707 was leased from Aer Lingus in April 1972 for deployment mainly on the Lagosâ€“London route, with the provision of crew and maintenance. [...] In October 1972, a Fokker F28 entered the fleet on a lease agreement with Fokker, and later on aircraft of this type were ordered. In late 1972, a contract for management assistance was signed with TWA, with the American carrier providing specialists in different managerial, commercial, and financial fields for five years, but the contract was never excersised. Nigeria Airways took delivery of three Boeing 707s in February 1973; they were put into service on the Lagosâ€“London run immediately. Two Boeing 737s, with registrations 5N-ANC and 5N-AND, were delivered in the early 1970s.|$|E
