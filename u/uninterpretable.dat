60|$|For of all {{the strange}} and frantic and incomprehensible and <b>uninterpretable</b> books which the {{imagination}} of man has created, surely this one is the prize sample. It is written with a limitless confidence and complacency, and with a dash and stir and earnestness which often compel the effects of eloquence, even when the words {{do not seem to}} have any traceable meaning. There are plenty of people who imagine they understand the book; I know this, for I have talked with them; but in all cases they were people who also imagined that there were no such things as pain, sickness, and death, and no realities in the world; nothing actually existent but Mind. It seems to me to modify the value of their testimony. When these people talk about Christian Science they do as Mrs. Fuller did: they do not use their own language, but the book's; they pour out the book's showy incoherences, and leave you to find out later that they were not originating, but merely quoting; they seem to know the volume by heart, and to revere it as they would a Bible--another Bible, perhaps I ought to say. Plainly the book was written under the mental desolations of the Third Degree, and I feel sure that none but the membership of that Degree can discover meanings in it. When you read it you seem to be listening to a lively and aggressive and oracular speech delivered in an unknown tongue, a speech whose spirit you get but not the particulars; or, to change the figure, you seem to be listening to a vigorous instrument which is making a noise which it thinks is a tune, but which, to persons not members of the band, is only the martial tooting of a trombone, and merrily stirs the soul through the noise, but does not convey a meaning.|$|E

50|$|The {{formative}} list, {{sometimes called}} the lexicon (this term will be avoided here) in Distributed Morphology includes all the bundles of semantic and sometimes syntactic features that can enter the syntactic computation.

These bundles of features {{do not have any}} phonological content; phonological content is assigned to them only at spell-out, that is after all syntactic operations are over. The Formative List in Distributed Morphology differs, thus, from the Lexicon in traditional generative grammar, which includes the lexical items (such as words and morphemes) in a language.|$|E
50|$|The Mu’tazalites {{produced}} the first Greek-inspired Islamic school of thought, championing {{the idea of}} reason and rational morality. The Ash'arites evolved as a group in direct opposition to the Mu’tazalites. The Ash'arites opposed the Mu’tazalites on several levels. They argued that the Qur'an was coeternal with Allah, rendering it inalterable and <b>uninterpretable</b> by man. Whereas the Mu’tazalites held that God was reasonably required to reward and punish as he had promised, the Ash'arites argued that God {{is not required to}} do anything, since such requirements must necessarily limit him. Ash’arites insisted that any apparent inconsistencies in the Qur'an must not be questioned. In contrast, the Mu’tazalites believed that analyzing these inconsistencies is in accordance with man’s necessity to reason: since God is not intuitive or physical, we must reason to his existence.|$|E
5000|$|A {{subset of}} the Lexicon, i.e. some {{combination}} of interpretable and <b>uninterpretable</b> features, and category-neutral lexical roots (e.g. √CAT) enter the computation. These features specify structural relations, which are satisfied via {{the operation of the}} traditional syntactic operations, such as Merge, Move or Agree. For example, if node A has a plural feature, while node B has no value assigned to the feature plural, then node B could become +plural if it is in the right configuration with node A for Agree to apply. The category-neutral roots combine with a categorizer e.g., N-, A-, V- and turn into a respective category noun, adjective or verb. Once all relations specified by the features present in the numeration are satisfied, the syntactic derivation is complete; there is a configuration of terminal nodes, with different combinations of features and their values, and roots but without phonological content assigned to these nodes. At spell-out, the traditional division to Logical Form (LF) and Phonetic Form (PF) of the Y-model takes place.|$|E
5000|$|Wilson's work {{is based}} on the {{assumption}} that people are not always aware of why they feel the way they do. Bem's self-perception theory makes a similar assumption.The theory is concerned with how people explain their behavior. It argues that people don't always know why they do what they do. When this occurs, they infer the causes of their behavior by analyzing their behavior in the context in which it occurred. Outside observers of the behavior would reach a similar conclusion as the individual performing it. The individuals then draw logical conclusions about why they behaved as they did."Individuals come to [...] "know" [...] their own attitudes, emotions, and other internal states partially by inferring them from observations of their own overt behavior and/or the circumstances in which this behavior occurs. Thus, to the extent that internal cues are weak, ambiguous, or <b>uninterpretable,</b> the individual is functionally in the same position as an outside observer, an observer who must necessarily rely upon those same external cues to infer the individual's inner states." [...] (Bem, 1972, p.2)The theory has been applied to a wide range of phenomena. Under particular conditions, people have been shown to infer their attitudes, emotions, and motives, in the same manner described by the theory.|$|E
50|$|Benvenuto has {{addressed}} fields apparently {{very different from}} one another - social psychology, philosophy of language, political philosophy, psychoanalysis, political theory - in the nineties he began to structure a predominant project that touches upon all these fields: to replace the primacy of reflection on Truth (typical of Western culture) with a reflection that aims at the Real. In this way he seeks a third way between the two predominant and opposing Western cultures: positivist epistemology (concerned with the truth conditions of propositions) on the one hand, and hermeneutics (concerned with disclosing a Truth that unravels throughout human history) on the other. He adopts the concept of Real from Jacques Lacan, but broadens its meaning, including in it everything that remains external (origin and remainder) to every structure of sense, whether scientific, aesthetic, ethical and political. The Real is the background upon which every scientific theory, every artistic production, the psychoanalysis of each subject, every ethic arrangement, revolves and it is always in excess of all these “discourses”. Thus, the Real of every scientific theory is the Chaos that sets itself as the limit and background of every causative process. The Real in psychoanalysis is the background to the drives, the bodily, irreducibly individual background before which all interpretation stops. In particular (for example in La strategia freudiana Freudian Strategy and in Perversionen Perversions) he has engaged in an original reinterpretation of Freudian theory and of psychoanalysis in general, as founded on a precise metaphysics of “the signifying flesh”. Freud’s interpretative and explicative tissue, however, also refers to something <b>uninterpretable</b> and inexplicable: the drive as an opaque non-signifying source of subjectivity.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, in an {{unprecedented}} move, the Editor of the Journal of Clinical Psychology agreed to publish, without peer review, five articles on TFT of Callahan’s choosing; these were: Callahan, 2001b and 2001c; Pignotti & Steinberg, 2001; Sakai et al., 2001; and Johnson et al., 2001. [...] In lieu of peer review, critiques were published alongside each article. [...] The critics agreed {{that each of the}} five studies contained serious flaws that rendered them <b>uninterpretable</b> by them. They pointed out flaws which included: selecting only successful cases; focusing on a diversity of problems; failure to use a control group; failure to control for placebo effect, demand characteristics and regression to the mean; lack of valid assessment measures; use of the SUD as the only measure of efficacy other than HRV; using an out of context physiological measure (HRV) in an inappropriate manner; and lack of a credible theory. One of the critics, Harvard psychology professor Richard J. McNally, noting the lack of evidence for TFT, stated that “Until Callahan has done his homework, psychologists are not obliged to pay any attention to TFT.” [...] Psychologist John Kline wrote that Callahan’s article “represents a disjointed series of unsubstantiated assertions, ill-defined neologisms, and far-fetched case reports that blur boundaries between farce and expository prose”. [...] One of the original authors of the non-peer reviewed studies later retracted her conclusions and has reversed her earlier favorable position on TFT. [...] The only other studies adduced in support of TFT are ones that were reported on in Callahan’s newsletter, The Thought Field, and an uncontrolled study on Voice Technology consisting of radio show call-ins in a proprietary archive of a journal of collected papers on applied kinesiology. Callahan's claims about the TFT Voice Technology having unique properties and being on a par with hard science were not supported in a controlled experiment that used random sequences vs. TFT VT.|$|E
40|$|Background—Coronary CT {{angiography}} (CCTA) is {{an excellent}} tool for noninvasive assessment of coronary arteries in low- to intermediate-risk individuals. However, the accuracy of CCTA heavily depends on image quality. Our objective was to develop and validate a tool to predict pre-CCTA risk of obtaining an <b>uninterpretable</b> result in symptomatic patients. Methods and Results—Among 8585 symptomatic patients, we identified variables independently associated {{with the presence of}} at least 1 <b>uninterpretable</b> major coronary segment to create the <b>uninterpretable</b> risk score (URS). This risk score was developed using both clinical variables and patient variables acquired at the time the CCTA was performed (heart rate and coronary calcium). The URS was then prospectively validated among an additional 915 symptomatic patients. The URS was predictive of <b>uninterpretable</b> results in both the development and the validation cohorts. For every 4 -point increase in the URS (range, 0 to 12), the rate of at least 1 <b>uninterpretable</b> coronary segment per 100 CCTA studies increased 1. 5 fold. Increased heart rate and coronary artery calcium score were predictive of <b>uninterpretable</b> CCTA study results. <b>Uninterpretable</b> results were associated with 3 -month outcomes in the development cohort. Conclusions—The URS can categorize patients who are likely to have at least 1 <b>uninterpretable</b> major coronary segment on CCTA. This may aid in appropriate patient selection for CCTA and avoiding radiation exposure in those likely to have an <b>uninterpretable</b> study...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{standard}} typology of items associated with negation (negative quan-tifiers, negative polarity items, n-words), we argue that Slovene negative pronouns are n-words. They form a special subcategory of negative quantifiers marked with an <b>uninterpretable</b> negative feature. The <b>uninterpretable</b> negative feature requires that it be checked and deleted in overt syntax. This is accomplished by the operation Agree, with the <b>uninterpretable</b> negative feature being checked against the inter-pretable negative feature of an overt negator in the Negative Phrase and deleted. Once their <b>uninterpretable</b> feature is deleted, n-words are free to undergo any fur-ther syntactic operations required {{in the course of}} the derivation. The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 is a brief outline of the theoretical framework which forms the background to this paper. Section 2 deals with n-words in Slavic; in 2. 1 we sketch out previous generative analyses of n-words in Serbian/Croatian, Polish and Russian, and then focus on Slovene n-words, examining their basic descriptive properties and comparing them with those in the afore-men-tioned Slavic languages, negative polarity items and negative quantifiers in English...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{recent work}} by Tsimpli (2003) and Tsimpli and Dimitrakopoulou (to appear) an {{explicit}} claim is {{made about the}} nature of end-state grammars in older second language (L 2) learners: <b>uninterpretable</b> syntactic features that have not been selected during first language (L 1) acquisition will not be available for L 2 grammar construction. Interpretable syntactic features, on the other hand, remain available (as well as the computational procedures and principles of the language faculty), even those not selected by the L 1. The present study investigates this hypothesis in relation to the acquisition of the <b>uninterpretable</b> feature that forces -movement in interrogatives in English. Nineteen L 1 speakers of Japanese (a -in-situ language that lacks the movement-forcing feature) who are highly proficient speakers of English were asked to interpret bi-clausal multiple -questions in English (like). Their responses were compared with those of a native speaker control group. It is argued that the results are consistent with the unavailability of the <b>uninterpretable</b> feature. Two conclusions are drawn: first, that there is a critical period for the selection of <b>uninterpretable</b> syntactic features for the construction of mental grammars; second, that despite the observation of target-like performance by L 1 Japanese speakers on English -interrogatives reported in a number of existing studies, caution is required in interpreting target-like performance as evidence that L 2 speakers have the same underlying grammatical representations as native speakers...|$|E
