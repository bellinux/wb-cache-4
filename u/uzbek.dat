5|$|In retaliation, the Pakistani {{military}} {{launched a}} series of air-strikes targeting terrorist hideouts in the areas bordering Afghanistan. At least 25 militants were killed on 10 June. The figure also included foreign militants killed. Two drone attacks on 12 June killed <b>Uzbek,</b> Afghan and local militants. On 15 June the Pakistani military intensified air-strikes and bombed eight foreign militant hideouts, killing as many as 140 militants (most <b>Uzbek,</b> including persons linked to the airport attack and airport attack commander and mastermind Abu Abdur Rehman Almani) in North Waziristan.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{diplomatic}} contact continued {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and {{the ravages of}} the Black Death in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed. A few marital alliances between Christian rulers and the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, such as when the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor <b>Uzbek</b> (1312–1341).|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 2010, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) {{announced}} that <b>Uzbek</b> judoka Shokir Muminov {{had been stripped}} of his silver medal in the 81kg bout after he tested positive for methylhexanamine. The two bronze medalists, Japan's Masahiro Takamatsu and Kazakhstan's Islam Bozbayev, were promoted as silver medalists.|$|E
25|$|Bukhari and Turkistani were {{labels for}} all the <b>Uzbeks</b> in general while {{specific}} names for <b>Uzbeks</b> from different places were Farghani, Marghilani, Namangani, and Kokandi. Kokandi was {{used to refer to}} <b>Uzbeks</b> from Ferghana.|$|R
25|$|Turkey {{is home to}} 45,000 <b>Uzbeks.</b> In the 1800s Konya's north Bogrudelik {{was settled}} by Tatar Bukharlyks. In 1981 Afghan Turkestan {{refugees}} in Pakistan moved to Turkey to join the existing Kayseri, Izmir, Ankara, and Zeytinburnu based communities. Turkish based <b>Uzbeks</b> have established links to Saudi-based <b>Uzbeks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ethnic {{composition}} of Kulob region is: 85% Tajiks, 13% <b>Uzbeks,</b> 2% others. In Qurghonteppa the breakdown is 59% Tajiks, 32% <b>Uzbeks</b> and three percent Russian.|$|R
5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} writing system and the debates {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes. Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin script is supported by {{those who wish to}} bring the country closer to Uzbekistan, which has adopted the Latin-based <b>Uzbek</b> alphabet. The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish to maintain the status quo, and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Kyrgyzstan saw an {{outbreak}} of ethnic violence in which as many as 2,000 people, primarily Uzbeks, were killed, {{and hundreds of thousands}} displaced. Following the violence, dozens of <b>Uzbek</b> community and religious leaders were arrested by the Kyrgyzstani government and accused of inciting ethnic violence, among them Azimzhan Askarov, who had been filming killings and arson attacks during the riots. Askarov then distributed the video to international media and accused the Kyrgyz military of complicity in the killings.|$|E
5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with <b>Uzbek</b> officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country prefers not to pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with {{the country would be}} slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan it may persuade Uzbekistan to join in the future. Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2010 The term [...] "SART" [...] {{was used}} in ethnic {{conflict}} between Kirghiz and <b>Uzbeks</b> on Southern Kirghistan to indicate less mongoloid race, <b>Uzbeks</b> from Kirghiz.|$|R
25|$|Much of the Turkic {{population}} of Central Asia has significant Caucasoid and Mongoloid ancestry. The genetic distances {{between the different}} populations of <b>Uzbeks</b> scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and <b>Uzbeks</b> have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the <b>Uzbeks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another big {{community}} is the Central Asian community, which includes <b>Uzbeks,</b> Tajiks, Roma (Lyuli branch) and Kyrgyz. Some of the <b>Uzbeks</b> and Tajiks own cafés or fast-food restaurants; they sell dried apricots, popular among Kazan citizens.|$|R
5|$|At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Riner {{competed in}} the men's heavyweight event. He {{received}} a bye into {{the second round of}} the competition before beating Anis Chedli of Tunisia and Kazakhstan's Yeldos Ikhsangaliyev to advance to the semi-finals. In the semis he was beaten by <b>Uzbek</b> judoka Abdullo Tangriev on the golden score, meaning Riner had to enter the repechage rounds. In the repechage he defeated Andreas Tölzer and João Schlittler to reach a bronze medal final against Lasha Gujejiani of Georgia; Riner took the bronze medal by a score of one ippon, one yuko and one koka to nil. In December 2008 he won his second World Championship gold medal at the Open weight Championships held in Levallois-Perret, France, by beating Alexander Mikhaylin of Russia in the final.|$|E
5|$|Streltsov {{was dropped}} from the Soviet team {{for the first three}} {{national}} team matches of 1968. After featuring in a home friendly win over Belgium in April, he made his final appearance for the USSR in the 2–0 1968 European Championship quarter-final first leg loss to Hungary on 4 May 1968. The Soviets beat Hungary 3–0 in Moscow a week later, without Streltsov, to qualify for the final tournament on aggregate. Streltsov was left out of the tournament squad, and never played for the USSR again; after his final appearance, his international tally stood at 25 goals in 38 matches. Torpedo won the Soviet Cup during the 1968 season, overcoming <b>Uzbek</b> side Pakhtakor Tashkent 1–0 in the final. Streltsov retained his title of Soviet Footballer of the Year after scoring the highest seasonal total of his career, 21 (in the league), but was moved back to midfield before the 1969 season and did not score in 23 league matches during his final two years. He retired from football in 1970, at the age of 33, leaving his final league record for Torpedo over both spells standing at 99 goals from 222 games.|$|E
25|$|The {{medium of}} {{instruction}} at the <b>Uzbek</b> Gymnasium is <b>Uzbek.</b> In addition to <b>Uzbek,</b> students also study three other languages, namely English, Kyrgyz, and Russian. Like {{in many other}} Uzbek-language schools in Kyrgyzstan, the future of teaching in <b>Uzbek</b> remains uncertain at the <b>Uzbek</b> Gymnasium.|$|E
50|$|Authorities harassed and {{attacked}} lawyers representing clients, predominantly ethnic <b>Uzbeks,</b> {{with regard to}} the ethnic violence. Lawyers reported that local authorities prevented them from seeing their clients, let alone helping them. Officials insulted and threatened lawyers defending ethnic <b>Uzbeks</b> on repeated occasions.|$|R
50|$|According to a 2002 global opinion poll, 85% of <b>Uzbeks</b> {{view the}} United States favorably, {{compared}} with only 10% who viewed the U.S. negatively. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 40% of <b>Uzbeks</b> approve of U.S. leadership, with 22% disapproving and 39% uncertain.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Uzbeks</b> are {{increasingly}} withdrawing into themselves. They {{say they are}} marginalized by the Kyrgyz majority, forced out of public life and the professions. Most Uzbek-language media have been closed, and prominent nationalists often refer to <b>Uzbeks</b> as a diaspora, emphasizing their separate and subordinate status.|$|R
25|$|The modern <b>Uzbek</b> {{language}} is largely {{derived from the}} Chagatai language which gained prominence in the Timurid Empire. The position of Chagatai (and later <b>Uzbek)</b> was further strengthened {{after the fall of}} the Timurids and the rise of the Shaybanid <b>Uzbek</b> Khaqanate that finally shaped the Turkic language and identity of modern Uzbeks, while the unique grammatical and phonetical features of the <b>Uzbek</b> language as well as the modern <b>Uzbek</b> culture reflect the more ancient Iranian roots of the <b>Uzbek</b> people.|$|E
25|$|Lately Kyrgyz {{authorities}} {{have been taking}} measures to remove the <b>Uzbek</b> language from public life and have been pushing to forcibly switch <b>Uzbek</b> schools to Kyrgyz. There are not enough school textbooks in <b>Uzbek</b> and the Kyrgyz government is unwilling provide them, claiming {{that it does not}} have enough funds. As Kyrgyz officials strongly oppose the use of textbooks printed in Uzbekistan, currently the majority of <b>Uzbek</b> schoolchildren in Kyrgyzstan study in <b>Uzbek</b> using Kyrgyz textbooks. In addition, in the early 2010s the number of teaching hours allocated to Kyrgyz language and literature lessons at <b>Uzbek</b> schools has been significantly increased at the expense of <b>Uzbek</b> language and literature lessons.|$|E
25|$|The {{medium of}} {{instruction}} at Amir Temur Secondary School is <b>Uzbek.</b> In addition to <b>Uzbek,</b> students also study three other languages, namely English, Kyrgyz, and Russian. Like {{in many other}} Uzbek-language schools in Kyrgyzstan, the future of teaching in <b>Uzbek</b> remains uncertain at Amir Temur Secondary School.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} horizontal inequality {{between two}} conflictive ethnic groups, the Kyrgyz and the <b>Uzbeks</b> in Kyrgyzstan, by employing the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. This technique {{has a long}} tradition in labour economics but has not been used in the literature that links ethnic inequality and violent conflict. We measure welfare differentials between Kyrgyz and <b>Uzbeks</b> and find that, depending on the welfare indicator used, <b>Uzbeks</b> are either better off or worse off than Kyrgyz. Specifically, we find that <b>Uzbeks</b> are not better off, if welfare is measured in terms of household expenditure. They are, however, clearly more prosperous in terms of the value and the size of their houses - at least in urban areas, where most <b>Uzbeks</b> reside. The picture is mixed when we use ownership of assets as a welfare measure. We conclude that the choice of welfare indicator is essential in studies of horizontal inequality, as it is most likely the more visible aspects of life that drive people's perceptions about other ethnic groups' standard of living. Decomposing welfare differentials between Kyrgyz and <b>Uzbeks</b> shows that the gap in expenditure is due to differences in group characteristics, such as household composition and ownership of livestock, whereas the gap in assets and house values remains unexplained...|$|R
25|$|Many Turkic {{speaking}} refugees, <b>Uzbeks</b> and Turkmens, from Afghanistan {{have settled}} in Pakistan permanently. They are also <b>Uzbeks</b> and Turkmen refugees that {{have moved from}} Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and settled in Pakistan. Turkey also provides scholarships to large number of Pakistani students to study in Turkish universities.|$|R
25|$|Mosques in Uzbekistan {{are funded}} by Saudi-based <b>Uzbeks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Although all {{applications}} of modern Central Asian ethnicities {{to people of}} Babur's time are anachronistic, Soviet and <b>Uzbek</b> sources regard Babur as an ethnic <b>Uzbek.</b> At the same time, during the Soviet Union <b>Uzbek</b> scholars were censored for idealising and praising Babur and other historical figures such as Ali-Shir Nava'i.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>Uzbek,</b> Kyrgyz, and Russian {{classes at}} the school. Like in many other Kyrgyzstani schools with Uzbek-language classes, the future of {{teaching}} in <b>Uzbek</b> remains uncertain at Alisher Navoiy Secondary School.|$|E
25|$|Shokirjon Toʻychiev {{served as}} {{principal}} of the <b>Uzbek</b> Gymnasium from 2000 until 2010. He was succeeded by Habibullo Sattorov, who headed the school until 2014. Since 2014 Bumayram Xolmatova has served as {{principal of the}} <b>Uzbek</b> Gymnasium.|$|E

2500|$|In 1510 Shah Ismail sent a large {{force of}} the Qizilbash to Transoxiania to fight the <b>Uzbeks.</b> The Qizilbash {{defeated}} the <b>Uzbeks</b> and secured Samarkand [...] at the Battle of Marv. However, in 1512, an entire Qizilbash army was annihilated by the <b>Uzbeks</b> after Turcoman Qizilbash had mutinied against their Persian wakil and commander Najm-e Thani at the Battle of Ghazdewan. This defeat {{put an end to}} Safavid expansion and influence in Transoxania and left the northeastern frontiers of the kingdom vulnerable to nomad invasions, until some decades later.|$|R
40|$|In June 2010 {{outbreaks}} of violence between Kyrgyz and <b>Uzbeks</b> {{began in the}} Kyrgyzstani cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad and quickly spread to neighbouring towns. The mass aggression ended relatively quickly, but individual acts of brutality primarily aimed at <b>Uzbeks</b> have continued; the number of <b>Uzbeks</b> leaving the region for work appears to be rising quickly. McBrien reflects on {{the link between the}} increase in labour migration and the ethnic violence of June 2010 in a small town that has been her primary fieldsite for the past eight years...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Uzbek</b> Gymnasium accepts more academically-inclined students. Students {{must take}} {{entrance}} exams to enroll. While the <b>Uzbek</b> Gymnasium provides general education like other secondary schools in Isfana, {{students of the}} gymnasium take more classes and have to study harder.|$|E
25|$|Niyazi {{also participated}} in the {{controversial}} <b>Uzbek</b> language reforms of the 1920s which were meant to codify a literary <b>Uzbek</b> language {{in place of the}} older, fading Chagatai. In addition to <b>Uzbek,</b> Niyazi knew many other languages, including Arabic, Persian, Russian, and Turkish. His works generally dealt wish social issues, such as women's rights, social inequality, and the prevalence of superstition. Niyazi was tragically stoned to death in the town of Shohimardon by Islamic fundamentalists for his anti-religious activities.|$|E
25|$|Moscow's {{control over}} Uzbekistan {{weakened}} in the 1970s as <b>Uzbek</b> party leader Sharaf Rashidov brought many cronies and relatives into positions of power. In the mid-1980s, Moscow attempted {{to regain control}} by again purging the entire <b>Uzbek</b> party leadership. However, this move increased <b>Uzbek</b> nationalism, which had long resented Soviet policies such as the imposition of cotton monoculture and the suppression of Islamic traditions. In the late 1980s, the liberalized atmosphere of the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev (in power 1985–91) fostered political opposition groups and open (albeit limited) opposition to Soviet policy in Uzbekistan. In 1989, a series of violent ethnic clashes, involving Uzbeks, brought the appointment of ethnic <b>Uzbek</b> outsider Islam Karimov as Communist Party chief.|$|E
50|$|In 1510 Shah Ismail sent a large {{force of}} the Qizilbash to Transoxiania to fight the <b>Uzbeks.</b> The Qizilbash {{defeated}} the <b>Uzbeks</b> and secured Samarkand at the Battle of Marv.

50|$|The <b>Uzbeks</b> now {{not only}} {{recovered}} the country {{which they had}} lost in Transoxiana, but also made incursions into Greater Khorasan|Khurasan, ravaging {{the northern part of}} the province. Shah Ismail I, on hearing of this disaster, resolved to return. On his approach the <b>Uzbeks</b> retreated in alarm. He caused several of the officers who had escaped from the battle to be seized and some of them to be executed for deserting their commander. Certain inhabitants of the province, accused of having shown attachment to the <b>Uzbeks</b> and their creed and of having vexed the Shias, were consumed in the fire of his wrath. The fatal battle of Ghazdewan, the destruction of Babur's Persian allies, and the numbers and power of the <b>Uzbeks</b> seemed to leave him no hopes of again ascending the throne of Samarkand and Bukhara. Babur had now resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana, and although he dreaded an invasion from the <b>Uzbeks</b> to his West, his attention increasingly turned towards India and its lands in the East.|$|R
50|$|In 1506 Husayn died, and Badi' {{took the}} throne. However, he quickly became {{embroiled in a}} {{conflict}} with his brother Muzaffar Husain. In the midst of this, the <b>Uzbeks</b> under Muhammad Shaybani were threatening the realm. Babur, who had marched from Kabul {{in an effort to}} assist Husayn, arrived in Herat and stayed there for a while, but noted the weakness of the brothers and left without making battle with the <b>Uzbeks.</b> The next year, the <b>Uzbeks</b> captured Herat, bringing an end to Timurid rule there, and the brothers fled. Muzaffar died shortly after. Badi' went to Kandahar to muster forces and marched against the <b>Uzbeks,</b> but was defeated. He then came to the court of Ismail I of Persia, where he was given lands surrounding Tabriz and 3650 gold shorafins a year. He helped influence Ismail's decision to undertake an expedition against the <b>Uzbeks</b> in 1510. Badi' stayed seven years at Tabriz until it was conquered by Ottoman Sultan Selim I, at which point he travelled to Istanbul, where he died during the plague in 1514.|$|R
