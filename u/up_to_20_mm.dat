40|$|ADP sulphurylase from baker's yeast was {{purified}} and its properties were studied. The enzyme is very heat-labile and its activity shows linear kinetics over narrow {{ranges of}} time and protein concentration. It is not activated by metals and is inhibited by thiol-reactive compounds. The enzyme, which replaces inorganic sulphate in adenosine 5 ′-sulphatophosphate with Pi to yield ADP, also catalyses an exchange of Pi into ADP. Kinetic {{studies show that the}} enzyme has a high affinity for adenosine 5 ′-sulphatophosphate, although concentrations in excess of 1. 0 mm are inhibitory.

40|$|Introduction: We can use pre {{auricular}} {{and post}} auricular skin as a pull through flap for upper antihelix defects reconstruction. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective case-series study, which {{was done in}} the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Ward. In this study, 15 patients (3 women, 12 men), ranging from 45 to 72 years old (mean, 58 years) underwent operation with pull through banner flap for reconstruction of upper antihelix (7 cases) and triangular fossa with superior and inferior crura (5 cases) caused by BCC or SCC excision. Reconstruction of upper antihelix defects <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>20</b> × 30 <b>mm</b> with post auricle pull through flap and reconstruction of triangular fossa <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>20</b> × <b>20</b> <b>mm</b> with pre auricle pull through flap were done. Results: Our study showed that pull through flap with superior pedicle from post auricular and preauricular area was an effective method for reconstruction of upper ear antihelix defects. Conclusion: We advocate that the pull through flap with superior pedicle from post auricle and pre auricle is an excellent choice for reconstruction of upper antihelix ear reconstruction in both crura and triangular fossa...|$|R
