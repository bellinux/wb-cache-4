5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified with radiation hardening, ensuring only a near miss could damage it. This would mean that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, Alvarez {{returned}} to the United States with an offer from Robert Oppenheimer to work at Los Alamos on the Manhattan project. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the University of Chicago working with Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General Leslie Groves asked Alvarez {{to think of a}} way that the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> find out if the Germans were operating any nuclear reactors, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly xenon 133. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering. It would become extremely important after the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the Young Turks' press conference, Taylor privately met Khánh at the latter's office. He complained about the {{dissolution}} of the HNC and said it did not accord with the values of the alliance and the loyalty Washington expected of Saigon. He added that the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> not cooperate with two governments at once: a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility. Khánh testily replied that Vietnam was not a satellite of the US and compared the situation to the US support of the successful coup against Diệm, saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated. Khánh had hinted that he felt the Americans were about to have him deposed like Diệm, who was then assassinated, but this rankled Taylor, who had argued against the regime change. Taylor then bemoaned Khánh, saying he had lost confidence in the Vietnamese officer, recommending Khánh resign and go into exile. He also said military supplies currently being shipped to Vietnam would be withheld after arriving in Saigon and that American help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended.|$|E

25|$|For many Latin Americans, the Bay of Pigs Invasion {{served to}} {{reinforce}} the already widely held belief that the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> not be trusted. The invasion also illustrated that the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> be defeated, and thus, the failed invasion encouraged political groups across the Latin American region {{to find ways to}} undermine US influence.|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} later, however, the {{situation}} changed dramatically. European Union member states {{decided it was}} important to have a satellite-based positioning and timing infrastructure that the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> not easily turn off in times of political conflict.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Bush Administration {{officials}} advanced a parallel legal argument using the earlier resolutions, which authorized force {{in response to}} Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 660 and 678, and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>could</b> legally compel Iraq's compliance through military means.|$|E
25|$|The Marines succeeded, recapturing {{the whole}} region and even {{fighting}} insurgents {{all the way to}} the Syrian border, where they were forced to stop (Syrian residents living near the border heard the American bombs very clearly during the operation). The vast majority of these armed and trained insurgents quickly dispersed before the <b>U.S.</b> <b>could</b> bring the full force of its firepower on them, as it did in Fallujah.|$|E
25|$|Iraq {{had been}} {{listed as a}} State sponsor of {{terrorism}} by the U.S. since 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>could</b> provide material support to Iraq in its war with Iran. Hussein's regime had {{proven to be a}} problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, physics was revolutionised with {{developments}} in the understanding of the nature of atoms. In 1898, Pierre and Marie Curie discovered that pitchblende, an ore of uranium, contained a substance—which they named radium—that emitted large amounts of radioactivity. Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy identified that atoms were breaking down and turning into different elements. Hopes were raised among scientists and laymen that the elements around <b>us</b> <b>could</b> contain tremendous amounts of unseen energy, waiting to be harnessed.|$|E
25|$|The {{shift toward}} a more pluralistic {{distribution}} of economic power led to increasing dissatisfaction with the privileged role of the U.S. dollar as the international currency. As in effect the world's central banker, the U.S., through its deficit, determined the level of international liquidity. In an increasingly interdependent world, U.S. policy greatly influenced economic conditions in Europe and Japan. In addition, as long as other countries were willing to hold dollars, the <b>U.S.</b> <b>could</b> carry out massive foreign expenditures for political purposes—military activities and foreign aid—without the threat of balance-of-payments constraints.|$|E
25|$|The 1778 Treaty of Alliance, {{promising}} {{the defense}} of French territory in the American continent, failed to {{be observed by the}} United States as soon as 1793, when France entered in conflict with Great Britain in the Caribbean. All the <b>U.S.</b> <b>could</b> do was to maintain neutrality, but this neutrality was so negative as to forbid the French the right to equip and arm privateers in American ports, or the right to dispose of French prizes in the United States. These reluctances in effect marked the end of the alliance.|$|E

25|$|On October 19, the EXCOMM formed {{separate}} {{working groups}} {{to examine the}} air strike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the EXCOMM shifted to the blockade option. However, reservations about the plan continued to be voiced {{as late as the}} October 21, the paramount concern being that once the blockade was put into effect, the Soviets would rush to complete some of the missiles. Consequently, the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> find itself bombing operational missiles if blockade failed to force Khrushchev to remove the missiles already on the island.|$|E
25|$|The US {{interest}} rates were also affected by France's decision {{to raise their}} {{interest rates}} to attract gold to their vaults. In theory, the U.S. would have two potential responses to that: Allow the exchange rate to adjust, or increase their own interest rates to maintain the gold standard. At the time, the U.S. was pegged to the gold standard. Therefore, Americans converted their dollars into francs to buy more French assets, the demand for the U.S. dollar fell, and the exchange rate increased. The only thing the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> do {{to get back into}} equilibrium was increase interest rates.|$|E
25|$|According to the US, as {{the rebels}} {{approached}} the capital, James B. Foley, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, {{got a phone}} call from a high-level aide to Aristide, asking if the <b>U.S.</b> <b>could</b> protect Aristide and help facilitate his departure if he resigned. The call prompted a series of events that included a middle-of-the-night phone call to President Bush and a scramble to find a plane to carry Aristide into exile. He traveled voluntarily via motorcade to the airport with his own retinue of security guards, including some contracted Americans. Before takeoff, Aristide gave a copy of his resignation letter to Foley's aide.|$|E

25|$|On {{other aspects}} of American foreign policy, Lantos spoke out against waste, fraud and abuse in the multibillion-dollar U.S. {{reconstruction}} program in Iraq, and warned that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>could</b> lose Afghanistan to the Taliban if the Bush administration failed to take decisive action to halt the current decline in political stability there. Lantos was against U.S. military aid to Egypt as the Egyptian military had failed {{to stop the flow}} of money and weapons across the Egyptian border to Hamas in Gaza, and Egypt had not contributed troops to the peacekeeping efforts in Afghanistan and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Due to the murder, the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> claim {{jurisdiction}} {{under the}} passive personality principle and try the terrorists under its 1790 Crimes Act (although its Supreme Court had questioned in U.S. v. Palmer (1818) if the act extended to non-citizens). But with the suspects {{turned over to}} Italian hands to try the terrorists the US would've {{had to use the}} normal processes of extradition. Even had the Americans done so Italy could've easily claimed its own right of jurisdiction as primary as the ship flew under an Italian flag, began its voyage in Italy, and the terrorists had come aboard in an Italian port.|$|E
25|$|During the Thaksin government, {{the number}} of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as the overall {{prevalence}} rate noticeably declined. Although successful in expanding access to HIV medication, there have been concerns that a free trade agreement with the <b>US</b> <b>could</b> endanger Thailand's ability to produce generic HIV treatments. Thaksin allowed the estimated 2.3million migrant workers in Thailand to register and seek health coverage under the Thai national healthcare system. They were also eligible for work permits {{at the end of the}} registration period, entitling them to full labour protection. Democrat Party Labour Group Committee Pongsak Plengsaeng criticised the move, claiming that it would lead to unemployment amongst Thais.|$|E
