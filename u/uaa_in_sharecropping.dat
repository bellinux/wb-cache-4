Ever rising {{deployment}} of Unmanned Aerial Assets (<b>UAAs)</b> <b>in</b> complex military and rescue operations require novel and innovative methods for intelligent planning and collision avoidance among {{a high number}} of heterogeneous, semi-trusted flying assets in well specified and constrained areas [1]. We have studied the free flight concept {{as an alternative to the}} classical, centralized traffic control. In free flight the unmanned aerial assets are provided with flight trajectory that has been elaborated without consideration of other flying objects that may occupy the same air space. The collision threads are detected by each of the aircraft individually and the collisions are avoided by an asset-to-asset negotiation. Multi-agent technology is very well suited as a technological platform for supporting the free-flight concept among the heterogeneous <b>UAAs.</b> <b>In</b> this chapter we present AGENTFLY, multi-agent system for free-flight simulation and flexible collision avoidance. 1...|$|R

Specifically, {{we examine the}} impact of eradication policies when opium is used as a means of obtaining credit, and when the crops are produced <b>in</b> <b>sharecropping</b> arrangements. The theoretical analysis suggests that when perfect credit markets are available, an increased risk of having the opium poppy eradicated will lead to less land being allocated to opium poppy. Thus, with perfect credit markets, the eradication policy is likely to have the intended effect of lowering opium crop production. However, when opium is sold on futures markets as a means of obtaining credit, the effects of opium eradication are no longer clear-cut: in some cases the outcome may actually increase the land allocated to opium poppy.

40|$|Site-specific {{incorporation}} of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) into proteins {{is a valuable}} tool for studying structure–function relationships, incorporating biophysical probes, and elucidating protein–protein interactions. In higher eukaryotic cells, the methodology is currently limited to {{incorporation of}} a single <b>UAA</b> <b>in</b> response to a stop codon, which is known as nonsense suppression. Frameshift suppression is a unique methodology for incorporating <b>UAAs</b> <b>in</b> response to quadruplet codons, but currently, it is mostly limited to in vitro protein translation systems. Here, we evaluate the viability of frameshift suppression in Xenopus oocytes. We demonstrate UAA incorporation by using yeast phenylalanine frameshift suppressor (YFFS) tRNAs that recognize two different quadruplet codons (CGGG and GGGU) in vivo. Suppression efficiency of the YFFS tRNAs increases nonlinearly {{with the amount of}} injected tRNA, suggesting a significant competition with endogenous, triplet-recognizing tRNA. Both frameshift suppressor tRNAs are less efficient than the amber suppressor tRNA THG 73 (Tetrahymena thermophila G 73), which has been used extensively for <b>UAA</b> incorporation <b>in</b> Xenopus oocytes. However, the two YFFS tRNAs are more "orthogonal" to the Xenopus system than THG 73, and they offer a viable replacement when suppressing at promiscuous sites.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) -cluster of differ-entiation 3 (CD 3) signaling complex {{plays an important}} role in initiation of adaptive immune responses, but weak interactions have obstructed delineation of the individual TCR-CD 3 subunit interactions during T cell signaling. Here, we demonstrate that unnatural amino acids (UAA) can be used to photo-cross-link subunits of TCR-CD 3 on the cell surface. Incorporating <b>UAA</b> <b>in</b> mammalian cells is usually a low efficiency process. In addition, TCR-CD 3 is composed of eight subunits and both TCR and CD 3 chains are required for expression on the cell surface. Photo-cross-linking of UAAs for studying protein complexes such as TCR-CD 3 is challenging due to the difficulty of transfecting and expressing multisubunit protein complexes in cells combined with the low efficiency of UAA incorporation. Here, we demonstrate that by systematic optimization, we can incorporate <b>UAA</b> <b>in</b> TCR-CD 3 with high efficiency. Accordingly, the incorporated UAA can be used for site-specific photo-cross-linking experiments to pinpoint protein interaction sites, as well as to confirm interaction sites identifie...|$|R

40|$|Unnatural {{amino acid}} (UAA) {{incorporation}} is an invaluable technique that is seeing increased use. THG 73 is an amber suppressor tRNA used to incorporate > 100 residues at the UAG, amber stop codon, in Xenopus oocytes. We {{have found that}} yeast Phe frameshift suppressors (YFFS) can incorporate UAAs at the CGGG and GGGU quadruplet codons in vitro and in vivo, allowing simultaneous incorporation of three <b>UAAs</b> <b>in</b> the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The YFFS are more “orthogonal” than the amber suppressor tRNA, THG 73, but the frameshift suppressors incorporate UAAs less efficiently than THG 73. A library of tRNAs derived from THG 73 has produced an amber suppressor that is “orthogonal” and suppresses similarly to THG 73. An analogous opal suppressor tRNA allows incorporation of UAAs at the UGA, opal stop codon. The use of the amber, opal, CGGG, and GGGU codons should allow for the simultaneous incorporation of four <b>UAAs</b> <b>in</b> vivo. Bioorthogonal labeling of UAAs is useful for the addition of large fluorophores. We incorporated p-AcPhe at α 70 of the nAChR and labeled with biotin and Cy 5. 5 hydrazide. Biotin and Cy 5. 5 hydrazide consistently labeled three proteins on oocytes not expressing α 70 p-AcPhe and isn’t useful for site-specific labeling of ketone containing <b>UAAs</b> <b>in</b> oocytes. We explored the known subunit stoichiometry of the nAChR (2 α:β:γ:δ) expressed in oocytes and detected each subunit with the HA tag by Western blot. The α-subunit is present {{in excess of the}} other subunits in a ratio of ≈ 3 : 1, which is expected to be 2 : 1.

We heterogeneously incorporated UAAs into the nAChR and detected changes in function by shifts in EC 50. Many UAAs altered the function of the nAChR. Incorporation of photo-reactive UAAs allowed for detection of cross-linking by Western blot. Heterogeneously incorporated UAAs also altered the functional nAChR expression on the surface of oocytes. Site-specific and heterogeneous incorporation of multiple UAAs are useful techniques for novel experiments to explore protein function, FRET experiments, cross-linking, and protein expression...|$|R

We previously reported that in Mycoplasma capricolum, a relative of Gram-positive eubacteria, codon CGG did not appear in coding frames, including termination sites, and tRNA(ArgCCG) pairing with codon CGG, was not detected. These facts suggest that CGG is a nonsense (unassigned and untranslatable) codon [...] i. e., not assigned to arginine or to any other amino acid. We have investigated whether CGG is really an unassigned codon by using a cell-free translation system prepared from M. capricolum.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 78 - 81). This thesis attempts {{to investigate the}} changing features of 18 th century Ottoman agricultural production {{in the context of}} commercialization. New emerging landowners, long-termed usufruct of arable lands and the sharecropping system are analyzed in conjunction with one another respectively. It discusses the implications of the titles held by individuals who purchased arable lands and claims that the Empire’s inability to maintain the classical state structure intact from the second quarter of the 17 th century had particular impact on long-termed land usufruct and on the emergence of new land owners whose profession was not cultivation. It is argued in this thesis that in the 18 th century, there was an inclination towards purchasing arable lands by individuals who resided in towns and city-quarters. It is argued that these new landowners made use of these fields, which were held long-term, by engaging <b>in</b> <b>sharecropping</b> contracts with villagers to receive a surplus of income. The main argument of this thesis is supported by analyzing empirical data composed of court cases regarding land sales and sharecropping contracts. This will display the inclinations of individual who purchased fields and engaged <b>in</b> <b>sharecropping</b> contracts. The empirical data used consists of 5 court registers: 3 of them belong to Konya and the remaining 2 to Antakya. This thesis aims to present an alternative perspective to previously conducted research by analyzing the commercialization phenomenon of agricultural production in the 18 th century by suggesting that the sharecropping system was an important aspect of obtaining extra agricultural produce through the process of commercialization. by Bedirhan Laçin.
