During thermoforming at 600 ℃, the elastic recovery can be suppressed effectively and the shape distortion resulted from springback processes can be eliminated, but the anisotropy characteristics of the titanium alloy sheets can not be changed, so forming at high temperature can not solve all the shape distortion problems except the distortion occurred for the reason of springback, <b>unhomogeneous</b> deformation in thickness still exists. 1...|$|E

In whole platelets, indomethacin reduced the increase in cyclic GMP induced by the nitric oxide-donors (NO-donors) sodium nitroprusside (NaNP) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) in a dose-dependent way, its IC 50 being 13. 7 [*]μM and 15. 8 [*]μM, respectively. Of the other cyclooxygenase inhibitors tested, only indoprofen reduced the increase in cyclic GMP induced by both NO-donors in a dose-dependent way (IC 50 = 32. 7 [*]μM, NaNP and 25. 0 [*]μM, SNAP), while acetylsalicylic acid (up to 1000 [*]μM) and diclofenac (up to 100 [*]μM) were ineffective.

Indomethacin (10 [*]μM), indoprofen (30 [*]μM), diclofenac (100 [*]μM) and acetylsalicylic acid (1000 [*]μM) showed a comparable efficacy in inhibiting platelet thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) production, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of indomethacin and indoprofen on the increase in cyclic GMP induced by both NO-donors was not mediated by inhibition of cyclooxygenase.

40|$|A {{contribution}} to the upcoming EPJA Special Volume on Nuclear Symmetry EnergyThough generally agreed that the symmetry energy plays a dramatic {{role in determining the}} structure of neutron stars and the evolution of core-collapsing supernovae, little is known in what concerns its value away from normal nuclear matter density and, even more important, the correct definition of this quantity in the case of <b>unhomogeneous</b> matter. Indeed, nuclear matter traditionally addressed by mean-field models is uniform while clusters are known to exist in the dilute baryonic matter which constitutes the main component of compact objects outer shells. In the present work we investigate the meaning of symmetry energy in the case of clusterized systems and the sensitivity of the proto-neutron star composition and equation of state to the effective interaction. To this aim an improved Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium (NSE) model is developed, where the same effective interaction is consistently used to determine the clusters and unbound particles energy functionals in the self-consistent mean-field approximation. In the same framework, in-medium modifications to the cluster energies due to the presence of the nuclear gas are evaluated. We show that the excluded volume effect does not exhaust the in-medium effects and an extra isospin and density dependent energy shift has to be considered to consistently determine the composition of subsaturation stellar matter. The symmetry energy of diluted matter is seen to depend on the isovector properties of the effective interaction, but its behavior with density and its quantitative value are strongly modified by clusterization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Physical {{properties}} of motorcycle tire structures {{are considered to}} help select a good and true-to-life mechanistic model suitable for finite element analysis of tires. Rubber and bias-ply layered-cord together make the inflated <b>unhomogeneous</b> tire structure anisotropic and geometrically highly nonlinear. A mathematical model made. of 3 -D solid and truss elements i discussed, and presented as realisnc and adequate to accommodate the anisotropy and nonlinearity inherent in the tire problem. Various loading cases, including a cambered tire with inflation pressure and vertical oad on contact patch, are studied and evaluated for force and moment acting on the tire. The results are very kncouraging and satisfactory. ~RODU~ION The carcass and the tread {{are two of the}} major por-tions that constitute a tire. The tread is the portion that is in contact with the road surface. It forms a contact patch to support the vertical loads, and gov-erns the lateral slip and adhesion against the road surface. The configurations of tread are usually peri-odically axis~met~c, i. e. the same pattern recurs at circumferential intervals. The mechanical {{properties of}} tread will inevitably affect the deformation of the carcass to some extent. However, in this study, the mathematical model will not include the tread for simplicity. In the tire deformation analysis, the tire carcass is often treated as a homogeneous anisotropic shell of revolution and local homogenuity is assumed. In such cases, the individual plies and cords are not depicted any more. The anisotropic properties of the cord-rubber laminae or laminates can be calculated by techniques developed in mechanics of composite ma-terials and the tire carcass behavior expressed by shell theory. However, in reality, a tire carcass is made of finite number of plies and is not homogeneous. Also, the cords are not invisibly small in size nor countless in number...|$|E
40|$|Amato reform (' 92), Dini reform (' 95), Prodi reform (' 98), Maroni-Berlusconi reform (' 04) : in {{the last}} 15 years all governments have {{modified}} the Italian pension system. What has changed? What will change? Why? What are the goals? In the chaos of reforms the only certainty for the citizens seems that future pensions will be lower than present ones. But [...] . how lower will they be? Who has really "won" the reform match? In the general reduction in performance, who has "lost less"? And above all, is the era of reforms in Italy over {{or is it just}} the first half of a "film"? In the following pages, I will try to answer to all these questions. In the first part, I will analyze the characteristics of the Italian pension system before the 90 's reforms to understand how they have affected the pension system system. In the second part, I will try to foresee the effects these reforms will have in the next decade through a microsimulation model. This model has been created with an innovative procedure based on an integrated (and non sequential) simulation of events. This new approach should guarantee more efficiency with respect to the traditional one even though there are some technical complications in its implementation. Two main results have been obtained. The first one is that actuarial equity is mainly achieved by homogenising regimes and by raising the minimum requisites for being eligible for pension (' 92 reform) more than through the introduction of defined contributions (' 95 reform). The second result is that excessive lowering of benefits affects negatively on actuarial equity weakening a basic principle established by the reforms themselves. Practically, the non-division of assistance from pension system and the low level of performance determine <b>unhomogeneous</b> benefits. From a pure actuarial defined contribution system point of view, it is unjustified. Without praising how much good has been achieved till date, the new reforms should be aimed at overcoming these precise obstacles. ...|$|E
