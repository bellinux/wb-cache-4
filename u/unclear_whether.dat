5|$|A. v. gracilipes {{inhabited}} Culebra Island {{and is now}} extinct. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> it was {{substantially different}} from the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Austin Hobart Clark {{reported}} that juvenile Cuban macaws were green, {{though he did}} not provide any source for this claim. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> green birds spotted on the island were in fact juvenile Cuban macaws or if they were instead feral military macaws (Ara militaris).|$|E
5|$|Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, later {{stated that}} his client was upset because a fellow soldier had lost a leg in an {{explosion}} on 9 March. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the bombing cited by Browne {{was the same as}} the one described by the villagers.|$|E
50|$|The wording is <b>unclear</b> on <b>whether</b> Satan {{is asking}} Jesus to {{miraculously}} transform the stones himself, {{or if he}} is asking Jesus to command God to do so.|$|R
50|$|The company {{issued a}} number of {{telegraph}} stamps which are of interest to philatelists. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> the stamps were ever used as only unused copies are known.|$|R
25|$|Solving {{differential}} equations {{is not like}} solving algebraic equations. Not only are their solutions often <b>unclear,</b> but <b>whether</b> solutions are unique or exist at all are also notable subjects of interest.|$|R
5|$|Currently, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> {{waves are}} an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves {{have been found}} to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Dozens of {{communities}} across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines, and, in some instances, entire nativity scenes, Washington, D.C. journalist Daniel Nasaw reports for the British newspaper The Guardian. He observes {{that it is}} <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> such theft is on the rise, as it is not tracked by federal law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the listed species, a distinctive Charadrius plover known as the white-faced plover has been seen in Thailand in recent years. It is at present <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> {{it is a new}} species or a subspecies of Kentish plover.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{correlated}} with Parkinson's disease and related syndromes. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> {{this is due}} more to Parkinson's or the drugs used to treat it, such as carbidopa/levodopa (levocarb).|$|R
2500|$|In {{the season}} 7 Curb Your Enthusiasm episode [...] "Seinfeld", George has married (and divorced) {{a woman named}} Amanda in the time since the finale. It's <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> these events are {{considered}} canon in the Seinfeld series.|$|R
50|$|Government {{newspaper}} Al-Ahram {{said that}} one of its offices, which is opposite to the hotel and base that were hit, was completely destroyed during the attacks. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> the office was a target of the assault or not.|$|R
5|$|In his 1995 revision, Nelson {{refers to}} {{putative}} hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.apiculatus, citing the 1978 paper {{in which he}} published putative hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.forrestii. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the reference to A.apiculatus is an error or a fourth putative hybrid.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the {{operations}} were successful, {{due to the}} complexity of their execution, poor weather, and lack of response from German forces. It is possible that they contributed to the overall confusion of D-Day as part of the wider Bodyguard plan.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> {{the story}} of the Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or if it had been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.|$|E
40|$|Meta-analyses link {{childhood}} {{trauma to}} depression, mania, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> these outcomes truly represent distinct disorders following childhood trauma, or that childhood trauma {{is associated with}} admixtures of affective, psychotic, anxiety and manic psychopathology throughout life. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a Blue Boar {{cafeteria}} located on Euclid Avenue in downtown Cleveland in the 1930s. It is <b>unclear</b> on <b>whether</b> there was any connection between that location and the Louisville company. According to one source, it was patterned after Louisville's Blue Boar.|$|R
30|$|In the literature, even {{international}} recommendations remain <b>unclear</b> as to <b>whether</b> to use scintigraphy or CTA {{for pregnant}} patients.|$|R
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E
5|$|Many major {{web sites}} patched the bug or {{disabled}} the Heartbeat Extension {{within days of}} its announcement, but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> potential attackers were aware of it earlier {{and to what extent}} it was exploited.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus also {{contains}} agents which appear to damage chromosomes; it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these have carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Two compounds {{that have been}} identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter {{is responsible for the}} brownish discolouration upon bruising.|$|E
5|$|The insects {{captured}} by the glandular trichomes {{are too small to}} serve any role in pollination. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> these plants evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental nutrient availability or simply a defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts.|$|R
50|$|The {{village of}} Kunreuth had {{probably}} been mentioned in the founding document (Gründungsbuch) {{of the church of}} St. James at Bamberg which dates to 1109. Lords of Kunreuth are first recorded in 1308. What is <b>unclear</b> is <b>whether</b> there was already a castle in existence at that time.|$|R

It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> these plants evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental nutrient availability or simply a defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts.|$|R
5|$|People who are {{asymptomatic}} (for instance, those diagnosed through {{family screening}} or {{only as a}} result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate.|$|E
5|$|Screenings of Subway Sadie {{occurred}} {{as late as}} January 12, 1928. As of November 2007, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> a print of the film exists; it has likely become a lost film. A poster of the film {{can be seen at}} the New York Transit Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Persian troops present at Thermopylae is {{therefore}} as uncertain {{as the number}} for the total invasion force. For instance, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae, or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly.|$|E
50|$|The company {{issued a}} number of stamps which are of {{interest}} to philatelists and are still {{some of the most}} common British telegraph stamps found. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> the stamps were ever used as only unused copies are known. The stamps carried the year in the corners.|$|R
25|$|Within Western culture, {{the study}} of vocal {{pedagogy}} began in Ancient Greece. Scholars such as Alypius and Pythagoras studied and made observations {{on the art of}} singing. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> the Greeks ever developed a systematic approach to teaching singing as little writing on the subject survives today.|$|R
50|$|Although it is uncertain, it is {{believed}} that the surviving panels of the original composition were each divided into three registers. Thus making it <b>unclear</b> about <b>whether</b> or not scenes from other tombs are actually part of the story of the Book of the Earth or if they are separate.|$|R
5|$|The opening {{theme is}} {{repeated}} throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's {{position in the}} song; it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|A {{building}} {{close to}} the western border of the Žirmūnai elderate, an example of Socialist historicism built soon {{after the end of}} World War II, was the home of the Tėvynė ("Motherland") Cinema until the early 1990s; it has been hosting the New York musical theatre and club since 2004. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> this building will be demolished to make way for underground parking lots or saved by virtue of its inclusion into the Registry of Cultural Values.|$|E
5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though it was <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
50|$|UT841, a {{possible}} third toxin isolated in 2001, {{has been shown}} to affect brain metabolism in chicks. However, the authors are <b>unclear</b> on <b>whether</b> UT841 may actually be the same compound as Contractin A, since both have the same molecular weight of 18,000 Da and an almost identical N-terminal sequence.|$|R
