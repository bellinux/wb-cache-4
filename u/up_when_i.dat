25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me <b>up.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{attended}} {{many different}} schools, including Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario. She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and I only got to see him during the school holidays. But I {{think it was an}} advantage that they split <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was very young, so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E
500|$|Firmly contesting Carr's argument, {{journalist}} John Battelle {{praised the}} virtues of the web: [...] "hen I am deep in search for knowledge on the web, jumping from link to link, reading deeply in one moment, skimming hundreds of links the next, when I am pulling back to formulate and reformulate queries and devouring new connections as quickly as Google and the Web can serve them <b>up,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am performing bricolage in real time over the course of hours, I am 'feeling' my brain light up, I and [...] 'feeling' like I'm getting smarter". Web journalist Scott Rosenberg reported that his reading habits are the same as they were when he [...] "was a teenager plowing [...] way through a shelf of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky". In book critic Scott Esposito's view, [...] "responsible adults" [...] have always had to deal with distractions, and, in his own case, he claimed to remain [...] "fully able to turn down the noise" [...] and read deeply.|$|E

500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period when I grew <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E
500|$|He commented later: [...] "I took an {{appointment}} to the bench, as did a number of liberal judges, {{and we had to}} uphold the law of the country. It was a moral dilemma to do that, but the approach was that it was better to fight from inside than not at all. The moral dilemma came <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had to apply the law." [...] He noted in 1992 that most South African judges [...] "applied such [...] laws without commenting upon their moral turpitude." [...] A number, including Goldstone, were more outspoken – a policy that he felt aided the credibility of the courts. There was a fine dividing line between applying moral standards and promoting political doctrines, but Goldstone believed that [...] "in my view, if a judge is to err, it should be on the side of defending morality." [...] He took the view that [...] "judges have a duty to act morally, and if they're dealing with laws which have an unjust effect, I think it's their duty – if they can, within the powers they've got legitimately – to interpret the laws and give judgments which will make them less harsh and less unjust." [...] Being a judge in apartheid-era South Africa was a challenge, but it had its rewards; [...] "I hated in the morning the thought of having to do this for another day, [...] {{by the end of the}} day, I was exhilarated at the reaction and how important the work was." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Harrison's song [...] "This Guitar" [...] (1975), a lyrical {{sequel to}} his Beatles track [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] (1968), {{references}} {{the magazine in}} its second verse: [...] "Learned to get <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> fall / Can even climb Rolling Stone walls". The song was written in response to some highly unfavorable reviews from Rolling Stone and other publications for Harrison's 1974 North American tour and the Dark Horse album.|$|E

2500|$|In the quarter-finals O'Sullivan took 71 {{minutes to}} {{whitewash}} Selby 5–0, compiling two breaks of 135 and outscoring Selby 522–46. After the match O'Sullivan said [...] "My safety was good, so was my thinking, {{and so was}} my break-building. It's as well as I have played in the tournament." [...] Another whitewash occurred when Wattana was defeated 0–5 by Hunter, a match eight minutes longer than O'Sullivan's, whom he would face in the semi-finals. After the match Hunter said [...] "I was racing Ronnie. I could see from the scoreboard that he was 3–0 <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was leading 2–0." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said and I immediately hung <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> realized my mistake. That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor seen her in or out of the county workplace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rich {{struggled}} throughout 1979 having hits with United Artists and Epic. His singles were moderate hits that year, {{the biggest}} of them on either UA or Epic was a version of [...] "Spanish Eyes", which became a top-20 country hit. Rich appeared as himself in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie, Every Which Way but Loose, in which he performed the song [...] "I'll Wake You <b>Up</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Get Home". This song hit number three on the charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to Elektra Records, and released a number-12 single, [...] "A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through" [...] {{in the fall of}} that year. One more top-40 hit followed, the Gary Stewart song [...] "Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream" [...] early in 1981, but Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight. For over a decade, Rich was silent, living off his investments in semiretirement and only playing occasional concerts. He also played a bit part in the 1981 movie Take This Job and Shove It which yielded his last charted single, [...] "You Made It Beautiful".|$|E
