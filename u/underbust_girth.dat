40|$|Since 1935, the bra sizing {{system has}} been based on bust girth and <b>underbust</b> <b>girth.</b> Woman's breast is however a very complex 3 D geometry, the {{existing}} sizing system based on just two girth measurements may be inappropriate in the categorization of breast sizes for bras. Through analyzing the nude breast measurements from 456 subjects aged between 20 and 39, we hereby propose a new bra sizing system for Chinese women. The new sizing system uses <b>underbust</b> <b>girth</b> and the breast depth width ratio as the classifying parameters. They were identified through principal component factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis as the two most critical parameters out of 98 measurements obtained from 3 D body scanning and 5 supplementary manual measurements as well as other relevant breast parameters including breast angles, distance, width, thickness, volume and curvature. Relevance to industry: The existing bra sizing system is inadequate in classifying breast sizes for bras. This paper presents a method for classifying nude breast shape for establishing a new bra sizing system. The application of the new sizing system will be important to improve fitting comfort in intimate apparel. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Starting from mid 2004, European clothes vendors will {{switch to}} a new {{standard}} system for designating the size of garments. This new system is defined in EN 13402 and based on body dimensions measured in centimeters. EN 13402 - 1 defines a standard list of body dimensions, namely head girth, neck girth, chest girth, bust girth, <b>underbust</b> <b>girth,</b> waist girth, hip girth, height, inside leg length, arm length, hand girth, foot length, and body mass. For each type of garment, the EN 13402 - 2 standard specifies a primary dimension, a body measurement in centimeters (or body mass in kilograms) that shall be used in designating its size. For some types of garment, where a single size is not adequate to select the right product, a secondary dimension is added. For use on language-neutral clothes labels, EN 13402 - 1 specifies a pictogram for each body dimension. The BodyDim MetaPost package helps TEX users in the simple generation of these pictograms as Embedded PostScript files. An example pictogram generated by BodyDim i...|$|E
