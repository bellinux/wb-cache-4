40|$|Abstract: The path {{generation}} for a redundant sensor guided coal <b>unloading</b> <b>crane</b> {{is discussed}} in this paper. After using much of task specific knowledge to restrict the possible Tool Center Point (TCP) trajectories to a feasible subspace, two approaches are analyzed to optimize the dig head trajectory in this subspace: a Fuzzy Logic and a Dynamic Programming based trajectory generation. Experimental results are presented for a CCD-camera guided hydraulic manipulator tracking an optimized unload trajectory...|$|E

The same is true for trunk lines to dry ports and for the dry ports themselves as well as for the Akaki-Kaliti Cargo Terminals. This is necessary due to the interference of the overhead catenary with loading / <b>unloading</b> <b>cranes.</b> The electric locomotives on those sections will be replaced by diesel power shunting locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|The new harbour {{facilities}} include a 350 m unloading pier in 20 ft water depth, {{capable of handling}} vessels up to [...] A second 200 m loading and unloading pier can handle vessels up to [...] Each pier has two <b>unloading</b> <b>cranes</b> with a joint capacity of 3,000 tons/hour. The unloading pier conveyor belt has a capacity of 2,500 tons/hour, and the loading /unloading pier conveyor has a capacity of 1,500 tons/hour.|$|R
5000|$|The old harbour is {{suitable}} for [...] capacity ships with 295 m loading quay and 405 m coal and ore unloading quay. There are three cranes that have capacities of 1,000, 1,400 and 1,500 tons/hour on the unloading quay.

50|$|On 12 January 2010, a 7.0 {{magnitude}} earthquake struck, and crippled the port. The {{access road}} to the docks buckled, and slabs of concrete rose six feet above grade. Derrick cranes were thrown into the harbour; the shipping container <b>unloading</b> <b>cranes</b> were left leaning with their bases submerged. The seawall on some slips crumbled, and quayside areas slumped sideways into the harbor, carrying shipping containers into the water. The main pier on {{the northern end of}} the port was completely destroyed, with the cranes in the water, and the terminal collapsed. The south pier was severely damaged.|$|R

50|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} of cargo has traditionally been handled by stevedores, also known as longshoremen, wharfies, etc. Today, {{the vast majority of}} non-bulk cargo is transported in intermodal containers, which are loaded and <b>unloaded</b> using specialized <b>cranes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Straight deckers without self-unloading gear {{are loaded}} and <b>unloaded</b> by gantry <b>cranes</b> or Hulett Unloaders. These giants use a {{clamshell}} bucket and counterweight system to scoop the cargo {{out of the}} holds, one scoop load at a time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{method of}} loading coal for export in the Alexandra Dock system was by hoists, in which loaded railway wagons are lifted from ground level, {{in order to}} tip the {{contents}} into the ships' holds. General cargoes were loaded and <b>unloaded</b> by hydraulic <b>cranes,</b> which had capacities from 3 to 30 tons.|$|R
50|$|The City of New Orleans {{was built}} by Kure Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Kure City, Japan, in 1959. It is {{believed}} she only made approximately a hundred trips before service to Cuba was suspended. In addition to the car ferries, the company purchased from Seatrain Lines, Seatrain New Orleans, a four-deck ship built by Swan, Hunter, and Wigham Richardson of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 1928. She ran from Belle Chasse (New Orleans) to Havana. Cars were loaded and <b>unloaded</b> by <b>crane</b> and cradles. She was renamed Sea Level by the WIF&SS Co. and continued in service from Belle Chasse.|$|R

25|$|In September 1989, the 120,000 ton collier M.S. Leon entered port with 85,000 tons of coal. The coal was <b>unloaded</b> by <b>crane</b> {{unto the}} {{conveyor}} {{and taken to}} the Coal Company {{at the rear of}} the Ashdod power station. The big ship was brought into port by modern Voit-Schneider type tugboats, which have an exceptional maneuverability and a bollard pull of 35 and 45 tons respectively. Bringing 160,00 G.R.T. ships into the port (at partial load capacity) is a considerable accomplishment in view of the fact that the Port of Ashdod was intended for navigation by ships of maximum deadweight of 30,000 tons (before the port was expanded in the 2000s).|$|R
50|$|Sliding-roof wagons were {{developed}} for the DB in the 1950s. From a design perspective they were initially just a development of the classic lidded wagon. However, {{they were no longer}} intended for bulk goods, but for awkward, moisture-sensitive part-load goods. The latter could be loaded and <b>unloaded</b> vertically by <b>crane,</b> the sliding roof enabling half the available length of the wagon floor to be available at one time.|$|R
50|$|Container Berth: Used {{to handle}} {{standard}} intermodal containers. Vessels are loaded and <b>unloaded</b> by container <b>cranes,</b> {{designed specifically for}} the task. These berths will feature large areas of land for container handling near the berth and will also have significant equipment on dock to facilitate rapid movement of containers {{on and off the}} vessels. Alongside the quay there is often a large flat area used to store both the imported and exported containers.|$|R
50|$|Workstation {{gantry cranes}} {{are used to}} lift and {{transport}} smaller items around a working area in a factory or machine shop. Some workstation gantry cranes are equipped with an enclosed track, while others use an I-beam, or other extruded shapes, for the running surface. Most workstation gantry cranes are intended to be stationary when loaded, and mobile when <b>unloaded.</b> Workstation Gantry <b>Cranes</b> can be outfitted with either a wire rope hoist or a lower capacity chain hoist.|$|R
50|$|Loading and discharging: Bulk liquids must be pumped - the {{development}} of efficient pumps and piping systems was vital to {{the development}} of the tanker. Steam engines were developed as prime-movers for early pumping systems. Dedicated cargo handling facilities were now required ashore too - as was a market for receiving a product in that quantity. Casks could be <b>unloaded</b> using ordinary <b>cranes,</b> and the awkward nature of the casks meant that the volume of liquid was always relatively small - therefore keeping the market more stable.|$|R
50|$|The main cargo is {{imported}} {{iron ore}} and coal brought from overseas via Rotterdam and the Rhine. The iron ore and coal is transported in unpowered barges and <b>unloaded</b> by Gantry <b>cranes</b> onto conveyor belts leading {{the coking plant}} at Duisberg via grinding and/or sizing equipment {{in the case of}} coal, and to blending equipment or storage in the case of iron ore, both ultimately destined for the steel furnaces of Thyssen Krupp. The unloading systems are monitored, assisted, or controlled by computer, with the bulk flows monitored on an IT system.|$|R
50|$|The {{contract}} for the placement of granite on the eastern terminus plaza and eastern approaches was awarded to the John Swenson Granite Co. of Concord, New Hampshire, and to the North Carolina Granite Co. Shipments of granite began arriving immediately afterward, and a stoneyard was constructed just south of B Street NW near the Lincoln Memorial to receive it. Granite arrived via rail at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad freight yard on K Street NW, and was trucked to the site. A 9 ST <b>crane</b> <b>unloaded</b> the stone on B Street. Nearly all the granite was on-site by June 30.|$|R
30|$|After a containership has berthed at {{the seaside}} of a terminal, the STS <b>cranes</b> start <b>unloading</b> the {{incoming}} containers {{according to the}} <b>unloading</b> plan. STS <b>cranes</b> can use a normal spreader, enabling them to handle one container at a time, or more advanced spreaders (e.g. the twin-lift and tandem-lift) to handle multiple containers {{at the same time}} (Stahlbock and Voß 2008). The Super Post Panamax STS cranes, the current standard for unloading the largest containerships, are able to make approximately 32 lifts per crane per hour (APM Terminals 2014). This allows an STS crane to handle 32 – 64 TEUs per hour with a normal spreader and up to 128 TEUs per hour with a tandem-lift spreader.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} {{afternoon}} on the Friday of 11 March, a consignment of gunpowder barrels was being <b>unloaded</b> by <b>crane</b> from a lighter (a barge) moored at the dock close to Wood Quay. Shortly after one o'clock, as the wooden crane was shifting four barrels of gunpowder towards the quay, catastrophe struck. 140 barrels of gunpowder that had been resting on the river side were engulfed by a massive explosion, transforming the quayside into a scene of devastation. The crane and crane house, which were sited by the barrels, were torn asunder, and {{the force of the}} blast was felt far across the city. Nearby, many houses owned by merchant families facing the River Liffey were consumed by the blast, some of them collapsing, others badly defaced. Such was the force of the blast that some buildings in the suburbs of the city were damaged as debris rained down across Dublin. The dozens of riverside labourers who were unlucky enough to be working in the area had no chance of survival: body parts were found scattered hundreds of yards from the crater left by the explosion.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{the term}} {{was used in the}} {{traveling}} carnivals of 19th-century United States, almost interchangeably with roustabout. By the 1930s the terms had transferred to the oil drilling industry. In the United Kingdom's oil industry starting in the 1970s, roughneck specifically meant those who worked on the drill floor of a drilling rig handling specialised drilling equipment for drilling and pressure controls. In practice, these workers ranged from unskilled to highly skilled, depending subjectively on the individual worker's aptitude and experience. By contrast, a roustabout would perform general labor, such as loading and <b>unloading</b> cargo from <b>crane</b> baskets and assisting welders, mechanics, electricians and other skilled workers. The word roughneck was in use in the U.S. oil drilling industry even earlier and had a similar meaning.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the panel}} track is laid, a work train (pulled by diesel locomotives) {{can bring in}} the {{sections}} of continuous welded rail {{that will be used}} for the permanent way of this first track. The rail comes from the factory in lengths varying from 200 m (660 ft) to 400 m (1310 ft). Such long pieces of rail are just laid across several flatcars; they are very flexible, so this does not pose a problem. A special <b>crane</b> <b>unloads</b> the rail sections and places them {{on each side of the}} temporary track, approximately 3.5 m (12 ft) apart. This operation is usually carried out at night, for thermal reasons. The rail itself is standard UIC section, 60 kg/m (40 lb/ft), with a tensile strength of 800 newtons per square millimetre or megapascals (116,000 psi).|$|R
5000|$|Richmond Green, {{which has}} been {{described}} as [...] "one of the most beautiful urban greens surviving anywhere in England", is essentially square in shape and its open grassland, framed with broadleaf trees, extends to roughly twelve acres. On summer weekends and public holidays the Green attracts many residents and visitors. It {{has a long history of}} hosting sporting events; from the 16th century onwards tournaments and archery contests have taken place on the green, while cricket matches have occurred since the mid 18th century, continuing to the present day. Until recently, the first recorded inter-county cricket match was believed to have been played on Richmond Green in 1730 between Surrey and Middlesex. It is now known, however, that an earlier match between Kent and Surrey took place in Dartford in 1709.To the west of the Green is Old Palace Lane running gently down to the river. One of the oldest roads in Richmond, it was originally a route from the river, where goods were loaded and <b>unloaded</b> by <b>crane,</b> to the [...] "tradesman's entrance" [...] to Richmond Palace. Adjoining to the left is the renowned terrace of well-preserved three-storey houses known as Maids of Honour Row.

5000|$|... "Black Gold", {{a replica}} of an {{oilfield}} roughneck, a general laborer who loads and <b>unloads</b> cargo from <b>crane</b> baskets and keeps the drilling equipment clean, is located next to the cotton exhibit. The roughneck was employed in the early 1930s by the Sinclair Oil and Gas Company. A recording explains how a farm family growing primarily cotton and corn faced economic travail in Mississippi but relocated to Claiborne Parish to benefit from opportunities in the {{oil and natural gas}} boom. [...] "Oil changed our lives forever. We owe a lot to the men, mud, and mules that made it happen," [...] concludes the recorded message. In 1921, oil was discovered in Homer; another strike followed that same year in Haynesville in northern Claiborne Parish near the Arkansas state line. The boom continued through the 1930s and brought many guests to the Hotel Claiborne, which opened in 1890.|$|R

5000|$|In 1976, Excambian was {{donated by}} Charles Blair, {{original}} Chief Pilot of the VS-44, to the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida. In 1983, the Navy transferred the aircraft on permanent loan to the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The heavily corroded Flying Boat was then shipped by barge from the Gulf of Mexico to Bridgeport, CT. <b>Unloaded</b> by <b>crane,</b> it was trucked {{a short distance}} to the Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford, CT. A temporary Nissen hut-style hangar was erected {{at the airport in}} front of hangars three and four for the project. This put the VS-44A less than 1000 feet away from the original hangar she was built in, across the street at the (then) Avco Lycoming Engine Plant. In 1987 the restoration of the Excambian began, and it was decided to restore the rare flying boat to its post-WWII American Export Airlines livery. The restoration was conducted by a team of highly trained volunteers, many of them former Sikorsky workers who had originally built the VS-44As there 50 years ago. The combined support from Sikorsky and Avco Lycoming was crucial for the success of the restoration. On June 18, 1997, after ten years of restoration, the VS-44A was transferred to the New England Air Museum. It was there, that the plane was assembled and painted. In October 1998 a ceremony was held to dedicate the aircraft. The [...] "Excambian" [...] is the last remaining American-built commercial trans-ocean four-engine flying boat. After the project had been completed, the restoration team located in Stratford began looking at creating their own museum.

Today the museum is located in building 6, the former Chance Vought R&D Experimental hangar.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of non-bulk cargo is transported in intermodal containers. The containers arrive at a port by truck, rail or another ship and are stacked in the port's storage area. When the ship that will be transporting them arrives, the containers that it is offloading are <b>unloaded</b> by a <b>crane.</b> The containers either leave the port by truck or rail or are put in the storage area until they are put on another ship. Once the ship is offloaded, the containers it is leaving with are brought to the dock by truck. A crane lifts the containers from the trucks into the ship. As the containers pile up in the ship, the workers connect them to the ship and to each other. The jobs involved include the crane operators, the workers who connect the containers to the ship and each other, the truck drivers that transport the containers from the dock and storage area, the workers who track the containers in the storage area as they are loaded and unloaded, as well as various supervisors. Those workers at the port who handle and move the containers are likely to be considered stevedores or longshoremen.|$|R
