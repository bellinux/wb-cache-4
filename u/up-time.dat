Careful modeling allows highly fault-tolerant distributed data applications to be constructed at the least cost. Failure and repair rates of components are often as-sumed to be exponentially distributed.

By applying an appropriate test statistic, some samples were found to have a realistic chance of being drawn from an exponential distribution, while others can be confidently classed as non-exponential. Data were collected from a large number of hosts via the Internet.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} approximating the failure frequency of large-scale composite $k$-terminal reliability systems. In such systems, the nodes ($k$ of which are terminals) are connected through components which are subject to random failure and repair processes. At any time, a system failure occurs if the surviving system fails to connect all the k terminals together. We assume that each component's <b>up-times</b> and down-times follow statistically independent stationary random processes, and these processes are statistically independent across the components. In this setting, the exact computation of failure frequency {{is known to be}} computationally intractable (NP-hard). In this work, we present an algorithm to approximate the failure frequency for any given multiplicative error factor that runs in polynomial time in the number of (minimal) cutsets. Moreover, for the special case of all-terminal reliability systems, i. e., where all nodes are terminals, we propose an algorithm for approximating the failure frequency within an arbitrary multiplicative error that runs in polynomial time in the number of nodes (which can be much smaller than the number of cutsets). In addition, our simulation results confirm that the proposed method is much faster and more accurate than the Monte Carlo simulation technique for approximating the failure frequency.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Increasingly, {{large amounts}} of data are being stored in a {{distributed}} manner over wide area networks. Such large scale networks often employ heterogeneous nodes, with heterogeneity taking the form of available battery power and/or network <b>up-times,</b> among other things. Examples of such networks include networks of smartphones, sensor networks, and computing clouds. At the core of such distributed, heterogeneous networks is a necessity to accommodate nodes' varying accessibility to resources and to reduce network load by providing short paths between where data is stored and needed, while ensuring {{a high level of}} data robustness. This work focuses on resource and location awareness for robust data management in decentralized, potentially peer-to-peer networks. A structured network approach was chosen in order to provide availability guarantees for stored data. Two novel distributed hash tables (DHTs) Resource Based Finger Management (RBFM) and Hierarchical Resource Management (HRM), which are based on the existing DHT Chord, were developed with O(logN) routing complexity. These DHTs use different structural overlay approaches and provide a foundation for examining the suitability of varying numbers of hierarchical layers and the strengths of flat vs. hierarchical overlay structures for resource and location awareness. Mathematical analysis and simulative evaluations demonstrate how the novel approaches’ resource awareness improves node lifetimes and lookup success rates twofold, while a higher number of hierarchy layers decreases node lifetimes. A replication technique is also tailored to the structure of the proposed DHTs, providing an increase in resource and location awareness as well as a reduction in the overall replication load. Mathematical analysis demonstrates that the number of replicas necessary to provide a given availability probability is significantly reduced while the remaining replica load is transferred from weak to strong nodes...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} years, many {{articles}} {{have been written}} about NWOW, "the New Way of Working", in the Dutch business landscape. NWOW is based on several well-known underlying business concepts (e. g. teleworking and results driven management), which together can provide many benefits for employees and the knowledge intensive organization itself. At the same time, organizations have recognized knowledge as their most valuable and strategic resource in order to sustain competitive advantage. However, only little research has been devoted to the influences of NWOW on knowledge sharing. This thesis research starts with clarifying what NWOW is, how it is defined, what the fundaments are and how it arose. After a literature review a working definition of NWOW has been proposed. Experts on the topic of NWOW and knowledge sharing have been interviewed to gain a thorough understanding of the main concepts, which resulted in five propositions and the discussion about a new generation of knowledge sharing. Three case studies have been conducted in order to measure general behavior towards knowledge retrieval and knowledge sharing at Centric B. V., Royal Dutch DSM N. V. and Enexis B. V., all of which are running pilot projects on NWOW. The results of this qualitative research show that NWOW has been perceived as positive by all participating employees. NWOW participants share knowledge more virtually than not NWOW participants. More informal opportunities to share can be recognized among NWOW participants. Sensitive knowledge is shared more virtually by NWOW participants and sharing knowledge with a group shows a shift in choosing a wider variety of channels. Meetings between NWOW participants become shorter and more productive. However, the organization of meetings becomes more ad hoc. Furthermore, this research finds no differences in knowledge retrieval since the introduction of NWOW. Participants still rely the heaviest on personal networks when searching knowledge. ICT becomes even more a crucial service in an organization when implementing NWOW: more people are going to work time and location independent, relying heavier on knowledge sharing facilities, which makes maximum <b>up-times</b> of ever growing complex ICT systems, more important than ever...|$|R
40|$|Background: Infection with Human Papillomavirus, HPV, {{is one of}} the world's {{most common}} sexual {{transmitted}} infections. The virus causes genital warts (condyloma) but certain virus types can cause cancer. The most common cancer type caused by the virus is cancer of the cervix. Nowadays there is a screening program for women between 23 and 60 years of age where Pap smears of the cervix is taken to discover abnormalities at an early stage. Cervical cancer is very common {{all over the world and}} this screening program saves many lives, but not in the less developed countries since the screening program is too expensive. A vaccine has been developed against the four most common HPV- types 6, 11, 16 and 18, and the vaccine costs less than the screening program, so it is now possible to save lives worldwide. The vaccine contains virus-like particles, VLP's, synthesized by L 1 -proteins from HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. HPV 6 and 11 are associated with the sexual transmitted disease condyloma, and HPV 16 and 18 can cause cancer in the cervix among women, but also other kinds of anogenital cancer types. Today, the HPV vaccine is included in the general vaccination program for girls in 5 th and 6 th grade in Sweden, but not for boys. The risk to get infected with the virus is equal between girls and boys and this has raised the question whether or not boys should be included in the general HPV-vaccination program as well. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether or not there is evidence that suggest vaccinating other populations than young girls. Methods: The study is a literature study of clinical trials collected from the database PubMed. Results: Many clinical trials, where the vaccine efficacy among young initially HPV-naive girls have been evaluated, have been performed. They show that the vaccine is effective in preventing HPV-infection in this population. In a population with older participants, that have been sexually active and, thereby, are likely to have been infected with the virus, the vaccine's efficacy is more unknown. Clinical trials have been made in populations like this, with participants with initially unknown HPV-status, and the vaccine shows efficacy against infection with the HPV type, or types, that the individual is not already infected with. Clinical trials have also been made among boys and young men and the vaccine's efficacy is noninferior among men compared with the vaccine efficacy among girls and young women. Conclusions: Those findings support the inclusion of boys in the general vaccination program. They also show that already infected individuals can take benefit from the vaccine since it is not very likely that they are infected with all four vaccine types. But, before a gender neutral vaccination can be recommended, and before vaccination of already infected individuals is suggested, more and larger studies must be made. The new trials should also have longer follow <b>up-times</b> to determine whether a refill vaccination in the future will be needed...|$|R
40|$|Lecture {{given by}} Marc SteichenLiquid metal salts (LMS) are ideal {{electrolytes}} for high-speed metal electroplating [1, 2]. In these ionic liquids, the metal ions {{are the main}} component of the cations, leading to very high metal concentration, specifically when compared to common metal salts dissolved in conventional ionic liquids. LMS present good mass transport properties and allow high current densities during electroplating. Furthermore, no decomposition reactions are observed at high cathodic overpotentials, as the cathodic limit of the LMS corresponds to the metal deposition. In this work, we report on the synthesis of new cationic zinc(II) and tin(II) complexes with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Tf 2 N) anions and their application to the high-speed electrodeposition of metal stack precursors for the rapid and low-cost fabrication of earth-abundant and non-toxic Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 (kesterite) based thin film solar cells. The new LMS have been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, rheology, elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In the case of the Zn-LMS, the cations consist of six-coordinate Zn(II) centers ligated by one or two different N-alkylimidazole ligands (N-methylimidazole, MeIm; N-ethylimidazole, EtIm). Depending on the ligand composition, the melting point of the heteroleptic Zn(II) -LMS [Zn(MeIm) 6 -x(EtIm) x][Tf 2 N] 2 can be tuned, ranging from 65 °C to 20 °C. Oxygen-donor ligands, like diglyme (G 2, 1 -methoxy- 2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) ethane), ethanol (EtOH) and pyridine-N-oxide (pyO) were found to form stable Sn-LMS with low melting temperatures, below 80 °C. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the cations contain Sn(II) centers that are tri- or tetra-coordinate. The electrochemical behavior of the liquid metal salts has been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentio- and chronoamperometry on platinum and molybdenum electrodes. [Zn(EtIm) 6][Tf 2 N] 2 and [Sn(G 2) (EtOH) ][Tf 2 N] 2 have been used together with [Cu(MeCN) 4][Tf 2 N] [1] for the rapid electrodeposition of stacked Cu-Sn-Zn metal precursor layers on molybdenum substrates. High current densities above 200 mA cm- 2 allowed short metal deposition in less than one minute. The metal precursors were annealed by Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) under selenium and tin selenide atmosphere at high temperature and converted to the p-type semiconductor absorber Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4. The low-cost fabrication process of chalcogenide absorbers in ionic liquids by electrodeposition and annealing (EDA) takes normally up to 60 minutes [3]. With this new EDA process, device-quality Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 absorber layers can be formed in a total processing time of less than five minutes. In combination with long <b>up-times</b> of the deposition baths, the short processing times are important for large-scale PV module production. The morphology and composition of the Cu-Sn-Zn metal precursors and the absorber layers were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). The crystallinity was analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The optoelectronic properties of the absorbers were evaluated by photoluminescence, Raman and absorption spectroscopy. Latest results on Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 solar cells, formed via this high-speed EDA process will be presented. References: [1] Schaltin, S.; Brooks, N. R.; Binnemans, K.; Fransaer, J. J. Electrochem.
