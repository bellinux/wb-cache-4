It is to be noted that the model is applicable for a <b>unipolar</b> <b>device</b> only. But the comparison with the NiO system is limited to a single system using a numerical solver. This is a major shortcoming in this particular model regarding the non-availability of exact experimental characteristics data comparison from other sources to calibrate the model. It means that the fitting parameters have not been tested for a variety of characterization data or other models as well. So, it is difficult to judge the accuracy and viability of the model even though it uses some interesting concepts to explain the switching process in unipolar devices.|$|E

The driving volume markets for power electronics devices correspond to the systems working on 127, 240 and 400 V energy supply networks, setting the device voltage handling to 300, 600, and 1200 V respectively. We have limited the scope hereafter to the 600 V typical target, for which SiC Schottky rectifiers are now commercially available from at least 3 sources. The key physical properties for any semiconductor material used as the active layer of a <b>unipolar</b> <b>device</b> for power electronics are the breakdown field and carriers mobility. The bulk values are very similar for SiC and GaN. Two main other key issues are related to quality of the ohmic and Schottky contacts. For the ohmic contacts, adequate solutions have been found for both SiC and GaN. Surprisingly, on hetero-epitaxial GaN layers on sapphire despite of the very high crystal defects density (≥ 109 cm- 2), the ideality factor of the best Schottky contacts seems very promising. On the other hand, improving this ideality factor and the reverse leakage current for Schottky contacts on GaN layers grown on silicon substrate remains a fierce challenge. For the SiC Schottky rectifiers, cost and availability of the SiC substrates appear as the main residual limiting factor...|$|E

This has entailed {{the study of}} heavily doped silicon characteristic which comprises important regions of the multilayer bulk unipolar devices. The devices covered are Camel diodes, P-plane barrier diodes and open-base bipolar transistors. Two operating modes are distinguished: the punchthrough mode, and the non punch-through (bipolar) mode. A combination of thermionic and diffusion mechanisms {{is used in the}} current - voltage analysis. Minority carrier transport at the polysilicon - monosilicon interface is also studied in polysilicon emitter bulk unipolar diodes with the emphasis having been placed on the influence of heavy doping; the aim being the development of a useful predictive tool for the study of these structures in which transistor action can be obtained due to the mechanism of barrier height modulation via minority-carrier injection. The validity of the analysis is evaluated by comparison with available experimental results.

40|$|With {{the growing}} demand of low and medium voltage {{switch-mode}} power supplies (SMPS) {{for use in the}} state-of-the-art integrated circuits, the development of output rectifiers with low forward voltage drop and low reverse leakage current becomes essential. In low voltage SMPS applications (1 to 5 V), the on-state loss of the fast recovery p-i-n diode or the Schottky diode contributes greatly to the total power loss in power supplies. This is due to their forward threshold voltage. One possible way to achieve low on-state losses is to reduce or remove the forward threshold voltage. The first part of this thesis is mainly devoted to a novel Regenerative diode structure based on Silicon material. Its main advantages are reduction or removal of forward threshold voltage and much improved reverse characteristics without the necessity of a gate control like in synchronous rectifiers. The silicon <b>unipolar</b> <b>device</b> application is, however, restricted to relatively low voltages because of on-state and blocking problems at device blocking capabilities above 200 V. For high voltage applications (> 200 V), SiC Schottky or JBS rectifiers have demonstrated a good differential on state resistance and reasonable blocking behavior. In principle, one could try to construct a Regenerative diode like device based on SiC material, but poor hole mobility and much less developed integrated device technology seem to discourage such efforts. However, the second part of this thesis work presents a simulation study on a Si/ 6 H-SiC heterojunction. The p-Si/N- 6 H-SiC heterojunction diode behaves like a Schottky diode but with much lower threshold voltage than that of the 6 H-SiC SBD.

40|$|Due {{to their}} ability to achieve a wide range of {{resistance}} states, ion-conducting devices are ideal for use in artificial neural networks [1] and in threshold logic gates where they have been both successfully simulated [1] and implemented at the circuit level [2]. One of the potential types of ion-conducting device is a <b>unipolar</b> <b>device</b> that exhibits differential negative resistance, the IC-DNR device [3, 4]. This device has the most promise for successful application in systems requiring good control over the programmed resistance state since it can be programmed easily within a continuous range of resistances simply by using a varying voltage amplitude pulse with single polarity [4]. In this work, we have characterized the programming conditions of an IC-DNR device comprised of layers of Ge 40 Se 60 and Ag 2 Se. Electrical characterization tests were performed with an Agilent B 1500 A equipped with a fast waveform generation unit which allows for impedance matching during measurement. In a continuously variable device, such as the IC-DNR device, it is critical that device characterization is performed with a clean pulse containing minimal reflections (typically seen when a fast pulse is applied to a non-matched load). Since the reflected signals will also program the device, their presence in the test precludes accurate device characterization. Our results show that while the devices do not each achieve the same resistance state with the same programming conditions, a response that is typical of the amorphous materials used in these devices, they do exhibit repeatability in programming trends. As an example, a programming pulse may program a device to a lower resistance in each device, within a certain percentage of the original resistance state, but the starting and ending resistance values could be different. With the device resistance programming control exhibiting well-defined trends, the device has applicability in systems where fine control over resistance is required, but where application of multiple pulses to achieve that resistance are acceptable. Experiments performed on the IC-DNR devices include pulse width and amplitude programming tests, data retention, and endurance...|$|E
40|$|The {{superior}} {{characteristics of}} silicon carbide, compared with silicon, have suggested considering this {{material for the}} next generation of power semiconductor devices. Among the different power switches, the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) can provide a very low forward voltage drop, a high current capability and a fast switching speed. However, in order to compete on the market, it is crucial to a have high current gain and a breakdown voltage close to ideal. Moreover, the absence of conductivity modulation and long-term stability has to be solved. In this thesis, these topics are investigated comparing simulations and measurements. Initially, an efficient etched JTE has been simulated and fabricated. In agreement with the simulations, the fabricated diodes exhibit the highest BV of around 4. 3 kV when a two-zone JTE is implemented. Furthermore, the simulations and measurements demonstrate a good agreement between the electric field distribution inside the device and the optical luminescence measured at breakdown. Additionally, an accurate model to simulate the forward characteristics of 4 H-SiC BJTs is presented. In order to validate the model, the simulated current gains are compared with measurements at different temperatures and different base-emitter geometries. Moreover, the simulations and measurements of the on-resistance are compared at different base currents and different temperatures. This comparison, coupled with a detailed analysis of the carrier concentration inside the BJT, indicates that internal forward biasing of the base-collector junction limits the BJT to operate at high current density and low forward voltage drop simultaneously. In agreement with the measurements, a design with a highly-doped extrinsic base is proposed to alleviate this problem. In addition to the static characteristics, the comparison of measured and simulated switching waveforms demonstrates that the SiC BJT can provide fast switching speed when it acts as a <b>unipolar</b> <b>device.</b> This is crucial to have low power losses during transient. Finally, the long-term stability is investigated. It is observed that the electrical stress of the base-emitter diode produces current gain degradation; however, the degradation mechanisms are still unclear. In fact, the analysis of the measured Gummel plot suggests that the reduction of the carrier lifetime in the base-emitter region might be only one of the causes of this degradation. In addition, the current gain degradation due to ionizing radiation is investigated comparing the simulations and measurements. The simulations suggest that the creation of positive charge in the passivation layer can increase the base current; this increase is also observed in the electrical measurements. QC 2012052...|$|E

Compared to the several emerging devices, RRAM devices are more scalable [14 – 18], have high density [19 – 24], consume low power [25 – 29], are faster [30 – 33], have higher endurance and retention [34 – 37] and highly CMOS compatible [38 – 42]. RRAM devices {{are one of the most}} popular non-volatile memory technologies with extensive study being undertaken to understand their mechanism and develop models to realize the device operation and design accurate and simple device structure. The devices are simple two-terminal metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure and switch between two resistance states low-resistance state (LRS) and high-resistance state (HRS). A LRS suggests the device is in the SET or ON state. A contrasting HRS means the device is in the RESET or OFF state. Through this switching of resistance states in the device, the data bit is stored [43 – 45]. RRAM devices can be classified into bipolar and <b>unipolar</b> <b>devices,</b> depending on the polarity of switching. In <b>unipolar</b> switching, the <b>devices</b> switch in the same polarity bias, whereas in bipolar switching, bias of both the polarities is required.|$|R
