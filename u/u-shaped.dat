5|$|Glaciation {{took place}} around the volcano roughly 6700 years BP, carving out <b>U-shaped</b> valleys. At the {{southwest}} {{flank of the}} island, a crater, likely a maar, can be found amid an alluvial plain.|$|E
5|$|Other {{geographical}} features {{inside the}} park include: <b>U-shaped</b> valleys, 660 tropical glaciers (the largest glaciated area in the tropics), 300 glacial lakes and high plateaus intersected by ravines with torrential creeks.|$|E
5|$|Mud plume feeding is {{a feeding}} {{technique}} {{performed by a}} small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a <b>U-shaped</b> plume of mud {{in the water column}} and then rushing through the plume to capture fish.|$|E
5|$|Outlaw Run {{consists}} of two trains, each featuring twelve pairs of riders. Riders, who must be 48 inches (122cm) or taller to ride, are restrained in their individual fiberglass seats with a <b>U-shaped</b> lap bar. Unlike most roller coaster trains, which have polyurethane wheels, Outlaw Run features steel wheels.|$|E
5|$|Several ice ages {{shaped the}} land through glacial erosion, {{creating}} <b>u-shaped</b> valleys and depositing boulder clays, {{especially on the}} western seaboard. The last major incursion of ice peaked about 18,000 years ago, leaving other remnant features such at the granite tors on the Cairngorm mountain plateaux.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{at the end}} of a <b>U-shaped</b> {{fitting out}} basin, the crane was used to {{construct}} some of the largest ships of the 20th century, including the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth 2. The Category A Listed historical structure was refurbished in 2007 as a tourist attraction and shipbuilding museum.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two large}} lava valleys on the island's {{southwest}} side which are <b>u-shaped.</b> The oldest of these flows are of Pleistocene age composed of basaltic trachyandesite and basaltic andesite, with smaller amounts of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine, and hornblende.|$|E
5|$|It {{shares the}} same nesting biology as S.speciosus. All cicada killers are ground-nesting insects and nest aggregations can contain up to {{hundreds}} of nests, each with a single provisioning female. Their tunnel is mainly made in well-drained, bare sandy soil, frequently under sidewalks, but is generally in full sunlight. Approximately 90% of its life is spent underground as a larva. It rarely infests grounds that are rich in vegetation {{in order for them}} to get more sun. Mounds are easily recognizable by their distinctive <b>U-shaped</b> digging entrance.|$|E
5|$|Pinkham Notch (elevation 2032ft. / 619 m) is a {{mountain}} {{pass in the}} White Mountains of north-central New Hampshire, United States. The notch {{is a result of}} extensive erosion by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Wisconsinian ice age. Pinkham Notch was eroded into a glacial <b>U-shaped</b> valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential, Wildcat, and Carter-Moriah ranges. Due to the volatility of the area's climate and rugged character of the terrain, a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout the notch.|$|E
5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the Chetco River {{watershed}} was created approximately 130million {{years ago when}} the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved <b>U-shaped</b> valleys and cirques during the last ice age, and several alpine lakes still exist today.|$|E
5|$|This {{area of the}} Andes {{was subject}} to {{glaciation}} in the past, which has left traces especially in adjacent valleys. These valleys are <b>U-shaped</b> or have {{the form of a}} trench, shapes associated with glacial action. The older volcanics of Laguna del Maule have been disproportionately eroded by glacial action. Slopes around Laguna del Maule are covered by colluvium including talus slopes.|$|E
5|$|Unlike fruit bats, {{the vampire}} bats have short, conical muzzles. It also lacks a nose leaf, instead having naked pads with <b>U-shaped</b> grooves at the tip. The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, also has {{specialized}} thermoreceptors on its nose, which aid the animal in locating {{areas where the}} blood flows close to the skin of its prey. A nucleus {{has been found in}} the brain of vampire bats that has a similar position and similar histology to the infrared receptor of infrared-sensing snakes.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is <b>U-shaped</b> rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|As part of post-war reclamation, the old pier was demolished. Work {{commenced}} in February 1954 {{on a new}} pier on the new waterfront {{designed in}} a modern utilitarian style. The structure {{was described as a}} <b>U-shaped</b> plan, with an open-sided superstructure. It consisted of tiled reinforced concrete base and pillars, and was modelled after previous piers in the area. Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing. Five sets of stairs allowed boat passengers to board and disembark, three located on the north side, one on the east and one on the west.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a <b>U-shaped</b> cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance {{standing in front of}} a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due to the amount of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E
5|$|Excavation for the {{powerhouse}} {{was carried}} out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. A <b>U-shaped</b> structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before {{the last of the}} concrete was poured that May. The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted {{at the time of the}} formal dedication on September 30, 1935—a crew of 500men remained to finish it and other structures. To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about , topped with layers of sand and tar.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} <b>U-shaped</b> valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the Little Ice Age, which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the Little Ice Age, the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had <b>U-shaped</b> folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E
5|$|M-123 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the eastern Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. It {{is one of only}} a few highways in Michigan that curve around and form a U-shape. In fact, M-123 has three intersections with only two state trunklines; it meets M-28 twice {{as a result of its}} <b>U-shaped</b> routing. M-123 also has a rare signed concurrency with a County-Designated Highway in Michigan; in Trout Lake, there is a concurrency with H-40. All of M-123 north of M-28 is a Scenic Heritage Route within the Michigan Heritage Route system.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among the ribs and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports the theory that these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a <b>U-shaped,</b> downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales were also {{found among the}} gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore. Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into <b>U-shaped</b> glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars) are broad and long, extending {{to the front}} margins of the first upper molar (M1). Wilfredomys has even longer incisive foramina, extending between the molars, but the foramina are shorter in J.ossitenuis and J.pictipes. The palate itself is wide and short, with its back margin between the M3s. Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates, extending beyond the third molars. Fine openings (foramina) are present on the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared; J.anoblepas lacks a spine {{in the middle of}} the back margin, as is present in Rhipidomys. Wilfredomys has the back margin <b>U-shaped</b> instead and has a longer palate, with the back margin behind the M3s.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard <b>U-shaped</b> turn before it hit the building.|$|E
5|$|West to east {{trending}} canyons provide {{easier access}} by foot {{into the heart}} of the range as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass, which is south of the park. Carved by a combination of glacier activity as well as by numerous streams, the canyons are at their lowest point along the eastern margin of the range at Jackson Hole. Flowing from higher to lower elevations, the glaciers created more than a dozen <b>U-shaped</b> valleys throughout the range. Cascade Canyon is sandwiched between Mount Owen and Teewinot Mountain to the south and Symmetry Spire to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake. North to south, Webb, Moran, Paintbrush, Cascade, Death and Granite Canyons slice through Teton Range.|$|E
5|$|Like bryozoans and phoronids, brachiopods have a lophophore, a {{crown of}} tentacles whose cilia (fine hairs) create a water current {{that enables them to}} filter food {{particles}} out of the water. However a bryozoan or phoronid lophophore is a ring of tentacles mounted on a single, retracted stalk, while the basic form of the brachiopod lophophore is <b>U-shaped,</b> forming the brachia ("arms") from which the phylum gets its name. Brachiopod lophophores are non-retractable and occupy up to two-thirds of the internal space, in the frontmost area where the valves gape when opened. To provide enough filtering capacity in this restricted space, lophophores of larger brachiopods are folded in moderately to very complex shapes—loops and coils are common, and some species' lophophores resemble a hand with the fingers splayed. In all species the lophophore is supported by cartilage and by a hydrostatic skeleton (in other words by the pressure of its internal fluid), and the fluid extends into the tentacles. Some articulate brachiopods also have a brachidium, a calcareous support for the lophophore attached {{to the inside of the}} brachial valve.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A <b>U-shaped</b> reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E
5|$|The {{color pattern}} varies geographically. The head has two well-marked dark bands: {{one on the}} crown and the other between the eyes. On {{the sides of the}} head, there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is {{yellowish}} white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground-color varies from straw yellow, to light brown, to orange or reddish brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18–22 backwardly-directed, dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail. Usually these bands are roughly chevron-shaped, but may be more <b>U-shaped</b> in some areas. They also form 2–6 light and dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered dark spots. Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the lateral edges.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} of the {{building}} was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a proscenium stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a <b>U-shaped</b> balcony and the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening of a student eatery called The Hoot on the west side. The ceiling was made from decorated plaster and dentils evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story—called UpC—is now an open space capable of seating 600 people when chairs are added; it also features multimedia equipment and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists accept Allosaurus as {{an active}} {{predator}} of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on Stegosaurus, including an Allosaurus tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a Stegosaurus tail spike, and a Stegosaurus neck plate with a <b>U-shaped</b> wound that correlates well with an Allosaurus snout. Sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of scavenging, based {{on the presence of}} scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones. However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, Allosaurus was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods. Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. Robert T. Bakker, comparing Allosaurus to Cenozoic sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although Allosaurus did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a saw-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The <b>U-shaped</b> frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
