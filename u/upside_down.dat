5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> when they sink. Arkansas settled <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of the starboard side is present, but severely compacted.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{clock is}} set at three or nine o'clock. The point of the clocks was to teach the viewer to view the sundial at the end <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before his {{match with}} Bret Hart, Lawler {{introduced}} a woman obviously younger than himself as his mother, and wished her a happy Mother's Day. Moments before the contest, Hart revealed that his knee injury was fake. During the contest, referee Earl Hebner became tied <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> in the ropes after being distracted by Shinja. While Hebner was tied <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> Hakushi interfered and performed a diving headbutt to Hart. Lawler won the match when he rolled-up Hart for the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|Painted turtles defend {{themselves}} by kicking, scratching, biting, or urinating. In contrast to land tortoises, painted turtles can right themselves {{if they are}} flipped <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say {{that he might have}} been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> after the surrender and this has been repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E
5|$|Her wreck was {{discovered}} in the mid-1970s, <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> off the Croatian island of Premuda. She has been declared a protected site by the Croatian Ministry of Culture and casual diving is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Some ships {{had sought}} shelter {{along the coast}} in Michigan or along the Goderich to Point Edward coast but few survived the {{powerful}} north winds. Three of the larger ships were found <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> indicative of extremely high winds and tall waves.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting the flower spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> may facilitate this process.|$|E
5|$|At the , Webber {{crashed into}} the back of Heikki Kovalainen's Lotus, sending the car flying through the air, {{collecting}} a track advertising board and landing <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b> The car then bounced back and {{crashed into the}} tyre barrier at high speed. Webber received only minor injuries, but retired from the race.|$|E
5|$|Her wreck was {{discovered}} in 1991 and rests in pieces, {{some of which are}} <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> {{on the floor of the}} North Sea. Queen Mary is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 as it is the grave of 1,266 officers and men.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 and 2014, MacFarlane {{produced}} {{one season}} of a live-action sitcom called Dads. The series, revolves around Eli, played by Seth Green, and Warner, played by Giovanni Ribisi, two successful guys in their 30's whose world is turned <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> when their dads {{move in with}} them. MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild executive-produced the series, with Sulkin and Wild writing.|$|E
5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E
5|$|Delight {{currently}} lies at {{a maximum}} depth of , broken into several sections. Her centre is <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> her bow is broken off, and the stern is upright. As the wreck is {{designated as a}} protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 {{it is illegal to}} enter the wreck without a licence or to interfere with the wreck or debris field in any way.|$|E
5|$|One {{beneficial}} effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling {{of the former}} USS Spiegel Grove. Spiegel Grove was sunk in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary {{in an attempt to}} create an artificial reef. However, the ship turned over and landed on the bottom <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b> Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|E
5|$|Rongorongo glyphs {{were written}} in reverse boustrophedon, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line. When reading one line, the lines above and below it would appear <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> {{as can be seen}} in the image at left.|$|E
5|$|Tecumseh was sunk on 5 August {{during the}} Battle of Mobile Bay when she struck a mine. The ship capsized and rests <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> {{northwest}} of Fort Morgan. The Smithsonian Institution surveyed her wreck in 1967 {{with the intent}} of raising it, but ultimately decided against the project when proffered funding was withdrawn. Several other plans to raise the wreck have been made, but all have fallen through.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} filmed {{in three days}} in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. The scenes were {{designed}} to recreate the parties that the band attended while recording Rock Steady in Jamaica. Young's scene {{was based on an}} actual event, where he won US$200 on a dare to hang <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> and naked on the rings at a club in New York City. Dumont's scene, filmed at Casa Mexicana, is inspired by a similar scene from the 1981 Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
5|$|Winter knows from Yates that Irwin's {{ultimate}} goal is to raise the American flag <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> a classic signal of distress. Irwin's men create havoc but ultimately are confronted by overwhelming numbers of guards, armed with live ammunition. Irwin orders the prisoners to stand down and elects to personally hoist the flag. After Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as he lifts the flag.|$|E
5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Dunst co-starred in Juan Diego Solanas' {{science fiction}} romantic drama <b>Upside</b> <b>Down</b> {{opposite}} Jim Sturgess. She co-starred opposite Isla Fisher, Rebel Wilson and Lizzy Caplan in Leslye Headland's romantic comedy Bachelorette, produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. In 2012, she co-starred opposite Sam Riley, Kristen Stewart and Garrett Hedlund in the adventure drama On the Road as Camille Moriarty, based on Jack Kerouac's {{novel of the}} same name. She made a cameo appearance in the short film Fight For Your Right Revisited. It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{tales of}} vetalas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, {{are found in}} old Sanskrit folklore. Although most vetala legends have been {{compiled}} in the Baital Pachisi, a prominent story in the Kathasaritsagara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. The vetala is described as an undead creature who, like the bat associated with modern-day vampirism, hangs <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> on trees found on cremation grounds and cemeteries. Pishacha, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Most spiders that hunt actively, {{rather than}} relying on webs, have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs. These tufts, known as scopulae, consist of {{bristles}} whose ends are split into as many as 1,000 branches, and enable spiders with scopulae to walk up vertical glass and <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> on ceilings. It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces. Spiders, like most other arachnids, keep at least four legs on the surface while walking or running.|$|E
5|$|Several of the animal's {{physical}} features are adaptions to climbing through trees. It uses its tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey. It has semiplantigrade feet, switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when arboreal) and a digitigrade-like one (when terrestrial). The soles of its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads. The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree. Captive juveniles {{have been known to}} swing <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.|$|E
5|$|She {{was next}} seen by Navy divers, the same year, lying <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> with her bow {{on the rim}} of the {{underwater}} bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There was no sign of the superstructure or the big guns. The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone. They were able to see the barrels of the forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Galaxy is set {{in outer}} space, where Mario travels through {{different}} galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by completing missions, defeating a boss, or reaching a particular area. Each galaxy contains planetoids and orbiting structures for the player to explore. Each astronomical object has its own gravitational force, allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the planetoids, walking sideways or <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b> The player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in 3D, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2-dimensional plane.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 work-ins {{took place}} from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork {{at the top of the}} tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} types of belts produced for the Confederate Military during the Civil War. There were literally dozens {{of types of}} buckles used and produced by or for the Confederacy. The buckles ranged from single plates with hooks, to two piece interlocking buckles, to simple roller buckles and countless other variations. Many buckles use plates that bore the state seal or motto of their home states. The vast majority used simple roller buckle plates of the type found on a common dog collar. As the War progressed, more and more men used captured US belt plates, often wearing them <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|They harass smaller raptors such as swamp harriers, {{whistling}} kites, brahminy kites and ospreys, {{forcing them}} to drop any food that they are carrying. Other birds victimised include silver and Pacific gulls, cormorants and Australasian gannets. There is one record of a white-bellied sea eagle seizing a gannet when unsuccessful in obtaining its prey. They may even steal food from their own species, including their mates. The white-bellied sea eagle attacks these birds by striking them with outstretched talons from above or by flying <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> underneath the smaller predator and snatching the prey, all the while screeching shrilly. Southern fur seals have also been targeted for their fish.|$|E
5|$|Trogloraptor spin simple webs {{with only}} a few strands, hung from the roofs of caves. Griswold et al. stated that the claws may have a {{significant}} function in capturing prey. Similar to the Nelson cave spider of New Zealand (Spelungula cavernicola, a gradungulid), Trogloraptor probably dangle <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> from their webs, snatching at passing flying insects with their claws. However their exact prey remains unknown. Captured live specimens were raised in climate-controlled laboratory conditions in an effort to find out. These specimens were offered moths, crickets and other spiders as food; but these were declined and the specimens starved after two weeks. This may indicate a preference for very specific prey.|$|E
5|$|Working for Clair Brothers, Jackson toured with Elvis Presley, mixing {{monitors}} while independent engineer Bill Porter mixed {{front of}} house (FOH) for the audience. Clair Brothers supplied all the audio gear; Jackson designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show. To make {{more room for}} audience seating, he also used a sound reinforcement system that was not mounted on scaffolding but hung with steel chain above the audience from overhead beams, using chain hoists rigged <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> to raise the loudspeakers from the floor—a now-common method used by licensed riggers. Jackson {{has said that he}} made a number of concert recordings during this period, all unreleased.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> from their feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way}} that allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines {{what it would be like}} if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{had been}} exposed to the {{combined}} French and Spanish fire for four hours, and had lost two masts and more than 140 men killed and wounded. In an effort to preserve the lives of his crew, Ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks, but at 14:00 fires broke out on the ship and Ferris, isolated by Saumarez's withdrawal, surrendered his ship. French boarding parties extinguished the fires and rehung the struck ensign <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> to signify that Hannibal had surrendered. However, in the Royal Navy an inverted flag is a signal of distress, and at least one British ship's boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to Ferris before the misunderstanding was realised.|$|E
