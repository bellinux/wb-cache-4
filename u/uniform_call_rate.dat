Methods: Behavioural trial of male courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> and measurements of males’ physiological performance. Covariance analysis exploring the determinants of courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: We found that endurance was strongly positively associated with the courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> However, neither the lytic activity nor the resting metabolic rate correlated with courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> Together with body mass and family effects, endurance explained over 77 % {{of the variance in}} courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> Hence, only physically fit individuals can perform sexual displays well...|$|R

Second, we also find that after zero-interest rate policy, mutual inter-temporal relations between <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> changes and GDP changes are seen as the US Taylor rule suggests, although the linkage between <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> changes and CPI changes is not seen.

Here, we demonstrate for free-ranging Campbell's monkeys that the <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> of four different alarm series (termed H, K, K +, and B series) vary systematically as a function of context, associated behaviour, and identity of the caller. K + series were given more rapidly to predation than non- predation events, K + and K series more rapidly to visual than auditory predator detection, and H series more rapidly while counterattacking an eagle than staying put. Finally, there were individual differences in B series, suggesting that <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> potentially provides listeners with cues about the caller's anti-predator behaviour, event type experienced, and his identity...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{numbers of}} whales present {{in an area}} from {{recorded}} <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> could be a useful conservation tool. We recorded southern right whale Eubalaena australis vocalisations and presence in Walker Bay on the south coast of South Africa. In all, 45 sessions with synchronous acoustic and visual data were analysed to determine <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> directly (overall <b>call</b> <b>rate,</b> OCR) and {{in relation to the}} number of whales sighted (<b>call</b> <b>rate</b> per whale, CPW) and number of groups sighted (<b>call</b> <b>rate</b> per group, CPG). The OCRs were examined in the presence of varying numbers of whales, using a log-linear model to investigate the dependence of the <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> on whale density. The number of whales present exerted a strong quadratic effect on the OCR, which peaked at around 15 whales and decreased to a low rate as whale presence approached a maximum, for all calls combined and for four of their constituent 13 call types: a quadratic trend was present to varying degrees among the remaining call types. Both quadratic and linear trends were absent when OCR was assessed against number of groups present, possibly because group size increased with increasing density of whales. A linear regression on the CPW and CPG suggested that there was a negative inverse relationship with the number of whales and groups present respectively. These findings are important in that, while they preclude the estimation of absolute numbers from <b>call</b> <b>rates,</b> they imply that, under the conditions prevailing in Walker Bay, southern right whales were aware of the presence, arrival and departure of other animals in their vicinity and adjusted their vocal behaviour accordingly.

40|$|The <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> of {{repetitive}} alarm calls {{produced by}} Richardson’s ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii) conveys {{the extent of}} threat during predator encounters. It remains unknown, however, whether changes in <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> communicate predator movements. That is, does an increasing <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> indicate an approaching predator and a decreasing rate the opposite? We presented free-living squirrels with moving predator models and recorded their responses. Vigilant behaviour increased more when predators approached versus retreated, suggesting that squirrels recognize the changes in threat associated with predator movements. Squirrels rarely produced alarm calls during these encounters, however, suggesting that squirrels do not rely entirely on alarm vocalizations to assess {{the threat posed by}} potential predators. Receivers of manipulated calls did not respond differentially to alarm calls containing an increasing or decreasing rate of syllable production. Thus, while rate may encode information about the extent of threat, Richardson’s ground squirrels do not communicate predator movements via changes in <b>call</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R
