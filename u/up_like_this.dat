30|$|We should, however, {{indicate}} that the differences among the approaches identified in Table  1 largely emanate from the different goals of typology within the frameworks as well as differences {{in the definition of}} ‘theory’ and the relationship between theory and language description and/or typology.

5000|$|The benga style - its rhythms - has {{a certain}} {{sweetness}} which comes from the bass and solo guitars. It is a flavor people like. When you hear benga, you cannot help but dance.
