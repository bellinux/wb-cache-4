40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of forest carbon sequestration to a cost-efficient EU climate policy from 2010 to 2050 under conditions of uncertainty. We note {{that there is a}} trade-off between sequestration and alternative <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> such as bioenergy and timber production. A dynamic and probabilistic cost-minimization model is developed, which includes fossil fuel use within the EU Emissions Trading System and forest management in the EU- 27 countries. The results suggest that if policy makers wish to meet emissions targets with 80 % certainty, this goal will be eight times more expensive than when they were unconcerned with uncertainty. Policy makers’ risk attitudes affect forest management strategy primarily through the inclusion of wood products, where potential carbon emissions reductions are high but also highly uncertain. Excluding wood products from a climate strategy can be expensive if policy maker are insensitive to uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Member of the {{political}} Commission and Agricultural Commitlee of PSU (Parti Socialiste Unifié) Arthur DUMONCEAU suggests a new organization for managing the french forest. The policy of the Forestry Administration to acquire additional land for forests has been of little consequence to the large landowners, but il has had {{a negative effect on}} small farmers who seek additional agricultural land. Also, the enterprise for encouraging greater national self sufficiency has not succeeded in achieving the desired import-export balance for wood products. The author suggests thal more decentralized control over forests management might contribute to a better utilization of the french forests. Multi-purpose decentralized center in local communities could better provide a balanced approach to alternative <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests,</b> for wood products, for fuel, for recreation and so on. And such local management may help to alleviate unemployment in agricultural areas. But, of course, the author recognizes that his proposal involves many changes in the general politic...|$|E

40|$|Nature {{has been}} shown to be {{beneficial}} to our overall health and well-being. We are all connected to nature and it is important to maintain this vital connection for our health and well-being. Spending time outside in nature or urban parks {{has been shown}} to positively affect a person’s emotions and improve their sense of well-being. Access to nature balances circadian rhythms, lowers blood pressure, reduces stress and increases absorption of Vitamin D. Increasingly, evidence demonstrates that contactwith the living world around us is an important part of healing and recovery. The natural world’s role in human well-being is an essential, yet often forgotten, aspect of healthcare. Of particular importance are the benefits one can derive through interaction with natural environments. Reincorporating the natural world is practiced to move healthcare toward being more “green”. Spiritual well-being is enhanced through the experience of greater interconnections, and it occurs when interacting with the natural world.

30|$|Disappearance {{of natural}} {{features}} (quality) in managed forests is usually accompanied by {{decline in the}} area of natural forests (quantity) (Fig. 1). In Fennoscandia, the decline of natural forests has been a long process, including various historical <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests.</b> However, the decline and the fragmentation of the remaining natural forest profoundly accelerated with the rise of forest industry and intensification of forest management after World War II (Esseen et al. 1997; Keto-Tokoi and Kuuluvainen 2014). The result of this historical processs {{is that most of the}} remaining natural protected forest is situated in the northern low-productivity areas (Angelstam and Andersson 2001), whereas only small fragments of isolated natural forest remain protected in southern areas. This makes rehabilitation of natural forest habitats and establishment of functional protection area networks in southern high biodiversity forests difficult and expensive, notably as it would probably require patient large-scale restoration of managed forest designated as new protected areas (Angelstam and Andersson 2001; Halme et al. 2013). Such a situation highlights the importance of the quality of the managed forest matrix in attaining ecosystem management goals (Lindenmayer and Franklin 2002).|$|E

40|$|In many countries, Forest Law is {{expected}} to control the <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests.</b> To fulfill the objects of the law, {{it is important that}} the people understand the legal concepts. The aim of this paper is to discuss the influence on the forests if there was a difference between local and legal concepts on land ownership, through analyzing the people's behavior on forests in the Union of Myanmar. She established her forest law in the 19 th century, but is recently losing her forests rapidly. The Constitution declares that all land is state owned, and forests are managed by the Forest Department. According to the Forest Law, cultivation in Reserved Forest is prohibited. The people did not identify the regulations, and the local customs were still followed, in which they admit the first person to ‘own’ the piece of land, and resulted in deforestation [...] The reasons why local concepts remained might be because some exceptions were made in the law, the numbers of people and capital to manage the forests are not enough, and, the law was applied case by case. To make the law more effective, efforts to understand the law as well as to know the people's behavior, and to amend the law to meet various interests regarding the forests, might be required...|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean region {{presents}} specific {{climate and}} ecological characteristics determined by geographical position, morphology and socio-cultural issues. Variety and diversity represent {{two of the}} main features, fully mirrored by high biodiversity rates, {{the large number of}} endemisms and the multiple functions played by forests. Today forest cover is the result of deep interactions between abiotic (e. g. climate and limiting soil-relief) and biotic factors. Among the second ones human activity has contributed to the transformation and shaping of forest landscapes, leading to degradation and fragmentation of forest ecosystems. Traditional wood and non-wood <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests,</b> together with the predominance of grazing activity within the forests and the repeated occurrence of natural and/or human induced fires have modeled a patchy landscape, composed of different types of vegetation in different states of maturity. However different forest characteristics in terms of cover, trends, ownership and dependency can be observed in different Mediterranean sub-regions. Around 73 % of Mediterranean forests are concentrated in the Northern sub-regions that also host nearly 79 % of the total wood volume and 75 % of the total biomass. Outside the Northern sub-regions no country with a forest cover rate higher than 20 % can be found.

40|$|Almost all the {{boreal forests}} in the Scandinavian {{peninsula}} {{have been influenced by}} human societies, and, therefore, natural, original forests are very rare. In this article, the interaction between the old traditional forest uses and the present management practices are analysed and discussed. Historical uncontrolled use, slash-and-burn agriculture and overexploitation of forests for saw milling industry led to the establishment of regulations, forest acts, forestry education and forest management plans to prevent devastation during the 19 th century. The various <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> include their direct land use, preservation of landscapes, building of forest structures, historical sites, human recreation (i. e., establishing mental relationships between people and the forest), forest settlements and rural development. Current boreal forest management is based on a multifunctional approach as applied by a "close-to-nature" management style. This management style is premised upon the notion that "everyman's right" allows them to freely roam the forest on foot or by bicycle and enjoy activities such as pick berries and mushrooms in the forests. Currently being discussed are new approaches regarding commercial use of ecosystems on private land {{as it relates to the}} "everyman's right" to enjoy the forest. Within the context of the modern lifestyle, forests help people recover from stress and provide physical inactivity.
