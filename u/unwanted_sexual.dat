5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after <b>unwanted</b> <b>sexual</b> encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between the use of preventive software on the home computer and <b>unwanted</b> exposure to <b>sexual</b> material online. Methods: The Youth Internet Safety Survey- 2 was a national, RDD telephone survey conducted in March-June 2005. Eight hundred households (one caregiver and one child between the ages of 10 and 17 years) with home Internet access answered questions pertaining to Internet prevention activities in the household and adolescent behaviors and exposures online. Results: <b>Unwanted</b> exposure to <b>sexual</b> material occurred in 32 % of youth in homes with pop-up/spam blockers and 25 % of youth in homes with filtering, blocking, or monitoring software on the home computer, compared to 43 % of households without preventive software installed on the home computer. Among otherwise similar youth, pop-up/spam blockers installed on the home computer were significantly associated with 59 % lower odds of reporting <b>unwanted</b> exposure to <b>sexual</b> material on the home computer; and filtering, blocking, or monitoring software was significantly associated with 65 % lower odds. When data were stratified by youth sex, associations between preventive software and unwanted exposure were similar for boys and girls. When stratified by age, preventive software was associated with significantly reduced risk of unwanted exposure for 10 - 12 -year olds and 13 - 15 -year olds, but not for 16 - 17 -year olds. Conclusion: Although these correlational analyses are far from providing conclusive evidence that preventive software protects children from <b>unwanted</b> exposure to <b>sexual</b> material online, findings suggest that caregivers of boys and girls 15 years of age and younger who want to reduce the likelihood of <b>unwanted</b> exposure to <b>sexual</b> material on the home computer should consider including preventive software-especially filtering, blocking, or monitoring software-in their Internet safety plan. Practice implications: Practitioners should partner with caregivers in developing an Internet safety plan, including proactive caregiver-youth discussions about expected Internet behavior appropriate for their household...|$|R

25|$|The {{difference}} between bullying {{and sexual harassment}} is the added context of sexuality. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that interferes with a student’s ability to learn, work, achieve or participate in activities. This can include <b>unwanted</b> <b>sexual</b> advances, sexual touching, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal,and physical actions of a sexual nature. This includes spreading sexual rumors, making sexual comments, jokes, gestures, vandalism, pictures, written materials, rating students sexually and circulating Web content of a sexual nature.|$|E

Aside from initiation of the sexual act through physical force, sexual abuse occurs {{if a person is}} unable to understand the nature or condition of the act, unable to decline participation, or unable to communicate unwillingness to engage in the sexual act. This could be because of underage immaturity, illness, disability, or the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or due to intimidation or pressure.|$|E

40|$|There are {{widespread}} {{concerns that}} on the internet, adolescents are especially vulnerable and take more risks than adults. However, research supporting this concern is still missing. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore whether (a) <b>unwanted</b> online <b>sexual</b> solicitation, (b) risky sexual online behavior, and (c) the perception of risks and benefits of risky sexual online behavior vary for males and females in adolescence and adulthood. We conducted an online survey with a representative sample of 1765 Dutch adolescents (grouped as 12 - 13 -, 14 - 15 -, and 16 - 17 -year olds) and 1026 Dutch adults (grouped as 18 - 29 -, 30 - 50 -, and 50 - 88 -year olds). Results indicated that adolescents were more at risk of becoming a victim of <b>unwanted</b> online <b>sexual</b> solicitation than adults. However, they did not engage in more online sexual risks than adults. As expected, females were sexually solicited more often than males but took fewer online sexual risks than males. Across all adolescent and adult age groups, perceived risks of risky sexual online behavior were high while perceived benefits were low. Contrary to earlier theories, adolescents did not perceive fewer risks or more benefits of risky sexual online behavior than adults...|$|R

25|$|Soon this {{movement}} expanded {{outside of the}} youth realm and became a more widespread Muslim practice.

40|$|The {{relationships}} among self-labeled sexual orientation, sexual preferences, and sexual behaviors {{were examined in}} samples from Taiwan and the USA. Subsamples matched on gender, age, and marital status were created to reduce sexual orientation cell size discrepancies and demographic differences. Sexual orientation self-label, the Kinsey Scale of Sexual Orientation, and a modified version for preference {{were used to assess}} participants' sexual orientation, behavior, and preference, respectively. Additional measures included an adaptation of the Early Sexual Experiences Checklist, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist for psychological distress. For both Taiwan and USA subsamples, heterosexual participants reported significantly greater congruence between sexual orientation identity and preference than did nonheterosexual participants. A high proportion of the Taiwan sample were celibate, precluding analyses of congruence between sexual orientation identity and sexual behavior. Congruence between sexual behavior and preference in the USA sample was negatively correlated with psychological distress. In a cross-cultural comparison between the Taiwan and USA women (n = 176), the two samples reported similar congruence between sexual orientation identity and preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that heterosexual participants' sexual orientation label was more &# 8220;public, &# 8221; (more categories of people who knew the participants' sexual orientation), than was nonheterosexuals' in both Taiwan and the USA. In Taiwan, heterosexual and nonheterosexual participants reported similar proportions who were celibate. A gender difference within the USA subsample included that men reported significantly greater congruence than did women regarding sexual orientation identity and congruence between behavior and preference. Analyses comparing self-labeled sexual orientation groups on <b>unwanted</b> childhood <b>sexual</b> experiences and age of earliest voluntary sexual activity were not significant. This study's limitations included small numbers of bisexual (USA n = 27, Taiwan n = 17) or homosexual (USA n = 35, Taiwan n = 9) participants, prohibiting distinctions between them. Recommended future research includes examining the self-labeling process, Asian American student sexual behaviors, and incorporating frequency and intrusiveness when assessing <b>unwanted</b> childhood <b>sexual</b> experiences...|$|R
40|$|The sexual objectifi cation {{of women}} is a common {{practice}} in Western countries (Calogero, 2013), where {{it is believed that}} being a woman implies being treated as a sexual object or a body to be looked at and evaluated (Noll & Fredrickson, 1998). Sexual objectifi cation refers to the reduction of a woman to her body or body parts, with the misperception that the body or body parts refl ect the whole person (Bartkly, 1990). In our society, women’s bodies are often objectifi ed by the media and in social interactions through appearance-related comments, unwanted touching and degrading acts of a sexual nature (Davidson, Gervais, Canivez, & Cole, 2013). Objectifi cation theory, as formulated by Fredrickson and Roberts (1997), explains that sexual objectifi cation experiences often occur in different contexts {{and is one of the}} most common relationships between men and women. These experiences are classifi ed as follows: body evaluation, which can be defi ned as an observer’s analysis and evaluation of a woman’s body; and <b>unwanted</b> explicit <b>sexual</b> advances, which involve a behavior of explicit advances of a sexual nature without a woman’s consent, such as sexual harassment (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). The importance of the study of both types of objectifi cation behavior is suffi ciently supported by empirical evidence because one in two women will experience some form of sexual harassment during their lifetimes (Pina, Gannon, & Saunders, 2009). For example, it has been shown that the evaluation of women’s bodies is related to the tendency to assign less-human traits to women (Hefl ick, Goldenberg, Cooper, & Puvia, 2011), which may facilitate severe sexual violence (Rudman & Mescher, 2012). On the other hand, <b>unwanted</b> explicit <b>sexual</b> advances are not themselves sexual harassment behavior, and it has been amply demonstrated that their occurrence has serious psychological, physical and social consequences for the victims (Expósito, Herrera, Valor-Segura, Herrera, & Lozano, 2014; Neall & Tuckey, 2014). Taken together, the various manifestations of sexual objectifi cation can be considered as manifestations of sexis...|$|R
