5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{the portion of}} NY321 south of Forward Road was co-designated as part of NY20SY, a largely {{alternate}} routing of US20 between Skaneateles and Manlius via Syracuse. Past Sweets Corners, NY20SY continued north on a previously <b>unnumbered</b> roadway to NY5 at Bennetts Corners, where it joined NY5 east into Camillus. The NY20SY designation was removed in 1961, leaving Bennetts Corners Road from Forward Road to NY5 as an <b>unnumbered</b> roadway once again.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, three {{sections}} of modern NY63 received posted route {{numbers for the}} first time. From Wayland to Dansville, the road was the westernmost part of NY52. What is now NY63 was <b>unnumbered</b> from Dansville northwest to Hampton Corners, where NY36 entered from the west on current NY408 and followed the path of NY63 to Geneseo. The road was <b>unnumbered</b> again until Pavilion, at which point NY62 joined {{from the south and}} utilized all of current NY63 and CR63-1 to reach the Lake Ontario shoreline in Yates. By 1926, all numbered portions of current NY63 were state-maintained, as were the <b>unnumbered</b> parts from Geneseo to Piffard and from Groveland to Hampton Corners.|$|E
5|$|Numbers 324 and 325 were unused, {{and the six}} bodies {{buried at}} sea by the Carpathia also went <b>unnumbered.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{last five}} of these were <b>unnumbered,</b> {{at least on the}} covers.|$|E
5|$|NY47, meanwhile, {{became part}} of the new NY8 in the 1930 renumbering, {{allowing}} the NY47 designation to be reassigned to a previously <b>unnumbered</b> roadway along the western shore of Lake George between NY8 in Hague and US9 in Lake George village. At the same time, NY10 was realigned south of Long Lake and replaced with NY9K from Saratoga Springs to Lake George while the roadway connecting Ticonderoga to Westport {{became part of}} NY22 after NY30 was reassigned elsewhere in the state. The segment of modern NY9N from Westport to Elizabethtown, previously <b>unnumbered,</b> was designated NY195.|$|E
5|$|M-227 {{came into}} {{existence}} nearly 35years {{after the completion of}} I-69 in southern Michigan and, except for the section of old US27, was long a collection of <b>unnumbered</b> local surface roads. It was designated as a part of Governor John Engler's Rationalization program on October 1, 1998 and first signed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1930, {{the modern}} routing of NY30 carried {{a large number}} of designations. Between Margaretville and Grand Gorge in the town of Roxbury, what is now NY30 was {{designated}} as part of NY19. From Mayfield north to Malone, most of the current routing of NY30 carried a designation. The portion from the modern junction of NY30 and NY30A in Mayfield to Speculator was part of NY54. From Speculator to Indian Lake, NY30 was the northernmost segment of NY80. Between Indian Lake and Long Lake, NY30 comprised the western half of NY10A. Past Long Lake, NY30 was part of NY10 north to the modern junction of NY30 and NY186 west of Harrietstown. From NY186 to modern NY86 in Paul Smiths, the present alignment of NY30 was <b>unnumbered.</b> Between Paul Smiths and Malone, NY30 was part of NY3. The remainder of NY30 was <b>unnumbered.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} half of NY38A {{was originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY26 in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY26 was broken up into several routes, including NY38A, a new route assigned to NY26's former alignment between Moravia and Skaneateles and a previously <b>unnumbered</b> highway from Skaneateles to Auburn.|$|E
5|$|When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, {{what is now}} PA 997 {{between the}} Maryland border and Waynesboro was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 44 while {{a section of the}} current route south of Roxbury became part of Legislative Route 264. At this time, an unpaved road ran between Waynesboro, Mont Alto, and Fayetteville. PA 997 was signed in 1928 from Mont Alto, where an <b>unnumbered</b> paved road continued south to Waynesboro, north to US 30 in Fayetteville, following Mont Alto Road. Upon designation, the entire length of PA 997 was paved. The present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of PA 316, which was paved, while PA 433 was designated onto the unpaved road between Lurgan and Roxbury. PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg, heading north on North Franklin Street and Letterkenny Road to Pleasant Hall before heading west to Upper Strasburg, northeast to Roxbury, east to Newburg, and south to Shippensburg. Upon designation, PA 333 was paved between Chambersburg and Pleasant Hall and Newburg and Shippensburg and was unpaved between Pleasant Hall and Newburg. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea. By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, following a paved road. The same year, PA 333 was shifted east to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury that was under construction, running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, while PA 996 was designated onto the paved road between Scotland and US 11 in Green Village. The former alignment of PA 333 became PA 633 (now PA 533) between Pleasant Hall and Upper Strasburg and an <b>unnumbered</b> road between Upper Strasburg and Roxbury. At this time, the road between Mont Alto and Scotland was an <b>unnumbered,</b> unpaved road, the road between Green Village and Culbertson was an <b>unnumbered,</b> paved road, and the road between Roxbury and McCrea was an <b>unnumbered,</b> unpaved road.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, when Wisconsin {{initially}} numbered its highway system, {{the route}} of what later became US141 followed two separate state highways: WIS17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WIS16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US141 in Wisconsin were numbered WIS15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WIS38 between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an <b>unnumbered</b> secondary highway. In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but the state {{did not have a}} highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M-12. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WIS69, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was used. In 1919, the WIS38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line. The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WIS17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WIS17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an <b>unnumbered</b> roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS57 at the state line.|$|E
5|$|NY251 was {{truncated}} to {{its present}} terminus in Scottsville on July 1, 1977, {{at which time}} NY386 was extended south along the former routing of NY251 to Scottsville. Reference markers for NY251 are still posted along its former routing. NY386 utilized a previously <b>unnumbered</b> portion of Elmgrove Road between NY31 and NY33 to reach NY251's former alignment. This part of NY386 is maintained by Monroe County as the unsigned County Route158 (CR158).|$|E
5|$|NY37 was {{assigned}} in 1930 to {{the portion of}} the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway between Redwood and Malone as well as to a previously <b>unnumbered</b> roadway between Watertown and Redwood. The Redwood–Malone portion was originally part of NY3 when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY37 has since been rerouted in areas, primarily near Ogdensburg and Massena.|$|E
5|$|NY376 follows Raymond Avenue {{for about}} a mile (1.6km) to the hamlet of Arlington. Here, it meets US44 and NY55, both of which follow a one-way couplet along Haight Street (eastbound) and Maple Street (westbound) through the city of Poughkeepsie. In between the two streets, NY376 intersects Main Street (CR114). The route ends upon {{intersecting}} westbound US44 and NY55, {{at which point the}} routing of NY376 becomes an <b>unnumbered</b> town road named Van Wagner Road.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 1941, the {{southern}} SH-30 was extended {{further to the}} south. The highway proceeded east from Hollis along US-62, then, at Gould, turned south along what was previously an <b>unnumbered</b> farm-to-market road. The route turned back east to end at SH-34 and SH-44 in Eldorado. This extension encompassed all of the present-day western SH-5. By January 1942, however, this extension of SH-30 would be split off to form the new SH-90.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the National Hurricane Center {{determined}} if the non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas {{developed into a}} tropical or subtropical storm, it would be named Odette. In post-season analysis, the center considered classifying the system as an <b>unnumbered</b> tropical depression, though lack of sufficient characteristics of a tropical depression prevented the classification. If Nicholas had attained hurricane status, {{it would have been}} one of eight tropical cyclones to reach hurricane status in October in the deep tropical Atlantic since 1900.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1930, {{what became}} NY8 in the {{renumbering}} carried multiple designations along its routing. In 1924, the segment of Genesee Street in Utica that became NY8 was designated {{as part of}} NY5 and NY12. Additionally, the portion of NY8 from Wevertown to Chestertown became part of NY10. The segment from the modern intersection of US9 and NY8 to Chestertown was also designated as part of NY6. By 1926, what became NY8 from Sidney to New Berlin and from Bridgewater to downtown Utica was designated as NY44. Between New Berlin and Bridgewater, NY44 followed what is now NY80 through Edmeston to West Burlington and NY51 from West Burlington to US20. It continued west to Bridgewater by way of an overlap with US20. From Utica to Wells, the 1930 routing of NY8 was part of NY54, which continued south from Wells to Fonda via modern NY30 and NY30A. Between Chestertown and Ticonderoga, NY8 was designated NY47. Until the renumbering, what became NY8 was unbuilt from Deposit to Masonville and <b>unnumbered</b> from Masonville to Sidney. Additionally, the segments from New Berlin to Bridgewater and from Wells to Wevertown were <b>unnumbered.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Solnhofen Specimen (<b>unnumbered</b> specimen) was {{discovered}} in the 1970s near Eichstätt, Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum in Solnhofen, it originally was classified as Compsognathus by an amateur collector, the same mayor Friedrich Müller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, Wellnhoferia grandis. It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} set of New York state routes were {{assigned}} in 1924, SH417 became part of NY6 while SH104 and SH5404 were included in NY24 and SH1224 was designated as part of NY30. NY6 was replaced by US9 while NY30 was co-designated as US4 between Glens Falls and Whitehall in 1927 following the creation of the U.S. Highway System in late 1926. The remainder of modern NY149 was <b>unnumbered</b> prior to 1930.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the portion}} {{of what is now}} NY370 from Cato to Liverpool was state-maintained by 1926, it {{remained}} <b>unnumbered</b> until the late 1920s. At that time, the section west of then-NY31 (now NY48) in Baldwinsville became NY37. The designation proved to be short-lived as it was renumbered to NY370 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY40 was split into several different routes. From Cato to just east of Red Creek, old NY40 became part of the new NY370, which also extended southeastward to NY57 in Liverpool. The small segment of former NY40 from NY3 to Upton Road was included in NY3E (later US104).|$|E
5|$|By 1926, {{the piece}} of current NY9N from Hague to Ticonderoga was {{designated}} as the easternmost leg of NY47, which continued west to Chestertown on modern NY8. In 1927, most of NY6 north of Round Lake was replaced by US9 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York. The lone exception was between Elizabethtown and Keeseville, where US9 followed a previously <b>unnumbered</b> highway to the east instead. The bypassed section of NY6 between the two locations was redesignated as NY9W at this time. NY9W was renumbered to NY9N {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, eliminating the alphanumerical duplication between itself and US9W.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route46, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Coopers Plains in Steuben County to Trumansburg in Tompkins County via Watkins Glen. East of Watkins Glen, Route46 proceeded generally northeastward through Burdett, Reynoldsville and Mecklenburg {{on its way}} to Trumansburg. On March1, 1921, the Route46 designation was reassigned to another highway in Allegany and Steuben counties as part of a partial renumbering of the legislative route system. The section of pre-1921 Route46 between Mecklenburg and Perry City went <b>unnumbered</b> until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when it became part of NY79.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{the portion}} of NY38 between Owego and Freeville was {{designated}} as New York State Route42 while the segment from Freeville to Moravia was {{the southern part of}} New York State Route26, a highway that continued north from Moravia to Syracuse. NY38 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, utilizing all of pre-1930 NY42, the Freeville–Moravia portion of NY26, and a previously <b>unnumbered</b> highway north to Sterling. Originally, NY38 extended south into the village of Owego by way of an overlap with NY96. It was truncated to its current southern terminus by 1994.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY48 {{was assigned to}} a previously <b>unnumbered</b> roadway between downtown Syracuse and Oswego. From Van Buren north to Oswego, NY48 roughly followed its modern alignment; south of Van Buren, NY48 was routed on State Fair Boulevard and Geddes Street to terminate at NY5, then routed on Erie Boulevard. The route was realigned slightly within Syracuse between 1938 and 1940 to use portions of Hiawatha Boulevard and West Genesee Street (as well as a new portion of State Fair Boulevard) to meet NY5 at the modern intersection of Erie Boulevard and Genesee Street.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 44 was {{replaced}} by US 130 north of the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach in Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there. However, US 130 was moved to new freeway alignments around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville. The bypassed alignments of US 130, originally <b>unnumbered,</b> eventually became Route 44. After I-295 {{was built in the}} 1960s, it bypassed the portion of the US 130 freeway in Bridgeport and was designated along the US 130 freeway north to Westville and around Carneys Point. US 130 was moved back onto its old alignment in Carneys Point, replacing that portion of Route 44.|$|E
5|$|NY33 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s to {{the portion of}} its modern alignment east of NY5 in Batavia. West of Batavia, what is now NY33 was <b>unnumbered</b> and only partially state-maintained. At the time, state maintenance of this segment began at the Buffalo city line and ended at current NY77 in Corfu. The Corfu–Batavia segment {{was taken over by}} the state of New York in the late 1920s, and NY33 was extended west over the now entirely state-maintained Genesee Street to Main Street (NY5) in downtown Buffalo as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E
5|$|On January1, 1949, NY31 was rerouted between Middleport and Medina to use NY31A {{between the}} two locations. NY31A was {{truncated}} to its current western terminus in Medina as a result. It was substantially extended , however, to a new eastern terminus in Brockport. The highway was rerouted east of Millville to follow a series of previously <b>unnumbered</b> roads through Barre and Clarendon to Monroe County, where it supplanted NY31D from the county line eastward. NY31A was truncated slightly to its current eastern terminus in the early 1980s after NY31 was rerouted to bypass Brockport {{to the west and}} south on NY31A and Redman Road.|$|E
5|$|Remain in Light {{was named}} the best album of 1980 by Sounds, ahead of The Skids' The Absolute Game, and by Melody Maker, while The New York Times {{included}} it in its <b>unnumbered</b> shortlist of the 10best records issued that year. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists, notably at number two, behind The Clash's London Calling, by Robert Christgau, and at number six by NME. It featured at number three—behind London Calling and Bruce Springsteen's The River—in The Village Voices 1980 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregates the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1918, the Wisconsin Highway Commission erected highway numbers along state-maintained roadways. The highway {{across the}} state from St. Croix Falls to Armstrong Creek was {{numbered}} WIS14 at that time. The remainder {{of what is now}} US8 was <b>unnumbered</b> secondary highways, and WIS14 continued north of Armstrong Creek to Florence. When Michigan numbered its highway system the following year, the future US8 {{was not included in the}} system. In Minnesota, US8 would follow what was Constitutional Route46, which was designated in a state constitutional amendment adopted on November 2, 1920; that roadway originally ran between Forest Lake and Chisago City through Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} realignment that occurred {{at this time}} was in the North Country, where NY3 was shifted onto its current alignment between Watertown and Plattsburgh. From Tupper Lake east to Plattsburgh, most of what became NY3 was previously part of NY10. The NY10 designation remained in place from Tupper Lake east to Upper Saranac Lake, forming an overlap with NY3; however, it was completely replaced by NY3 from Saranac Lake east. Between Upper Saranac Lake and Saranac Lake, the routing of NY3 was previously <b>unnumbered,</b> as was the routing from Watertown to Tupper Lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the route date back to 1914 when its routing was {{included}} {{as part of a}} spur route of Route30, a cross-state, unsigned legislative route. The spur route was eliminated in 1921, and the road went <b>unnumbered</b> until 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of NY3. Most of NY3 west of Rochester was replaced by NY31 in the mid-1930s, and NY31 was realigned onto its present, more southerly alignment between Middleport and Medina in 1949. Its former canalside alignment became NY31E at this time. Most of NY31E is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, two sections in Niagara County and Medina are locally maintained.|$|E
5|$|The {{segment of}} modern NY32 between Albany and Mechanicville was {{designated}} {{as part of}} NY6 in 1924. From Mechanicville to Hudson Falls, the current routing of NY32 became part of NY30. By 1926, the portion {{of what is now}} NY32 from Harriman to Newburgh was designated NY58. From Newburgh to Albany, NY32 remained <b>unnumbered</b> at the time. When U.S. Routes were first assigned in New York in 1927, the portion of NY6 from Albany to Waterford was designated as the northernmost portion of US9W. In Waterford, US9W merged with US9E and continued north as US9 to Mechanicville, where US9 turned west onto modern NY67.|$|E
5|$|US 5 {{begins on}} State Street at exit 5 of Interstate 91 in New Haven. State Street {{continues}} southwest into downtown as a local, <b>unnumbered</b> street. US 5 starts {{out as an}} undivided four-lane road becoming two lanes just before crossing into Hamden. State Street continues north through Hamden and the industrial section of North Haven, closely paralleling the Amtrak railroad tracks {{on the west side}} of the Quinnipiac River. It has an interchange with Route 40 in this area. US 5 then turns right at the intersection with Bishop Street in North Haven and crosses the Quinnipiac River, the railroad tracks, and I-91 (at exit 11) overlapped with Route 22 on a four-lane wide road.|$|E
5|$|When NY47 {{was first}} {{commissioned}} in the Rochester area , it was routed along previously <b>unnumbered</b> roadways, with its northwest terminus {{located at the}} intersection of NY31 (Lyell Avenue) and Howard Road in Gates. NY47 took Howard Road south, passing through Gates Center and intersecting NY33 before crossing the then-New York Central Railroad main line (now the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision) at-grade. The route remained on Howard Road until the intersection of Howard Road and Chili Avenue (NY33A), which also included Brooks Avenue at this juncture of time. NY47 turned east onto Brooks Avenue and proceeded toward the Greater Rochester International Airport, joining the current routing of NY204 at Beahan Road (now Old Beahan Road).|$|E
