60|$|One was a Scarecrow. That {{means he}} was a suit of blue Munchkin clothes, stuffed with straw, on top of which was {{fastened}} a round cloth head, filled with bran {{to hold it in}} shape. On the head were painted two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth. The Scarecrow had never been much of a success in <b>scaring</b> <b>crows,</b> but he prided himself on being a superior man, because he could feel no pain, was never tired and did not have to eat or drink. His brains were sharp, for the Wizard of Oz had put pins and needles in the Scarecrow's brains.|$|R

"At IGIA (Indira Gandhi International Airport), {{several steps}} {{have been taken}} to control the bird menace, which include {{positioning}} of 25 zone guns along the runway, deployment of 50 bird chasers, installation of reflective tapes, bursting of crackers, <b>scare</b> <b>crow</b> devices on jeeps, regular grass cutting and pesticide spraying," [...] the Indira Gandhi International Airport management stated.

60|$|The two Miss Allertons are charmingly quaint and kind, two dear little {{hard-working}} old maids, who {{are ready}} to lavish all the heart which might have gone out to husband and to children upon an invalid stranger. Truly, the old maid is a most useful person, one of the reserve forces of the community. They talk of the superfluous woman, but what would the poor superfluous man do without her kindly presence? By the way, in their simplicity they very quickly let out the reason why Saunderson recommended their farm. The Professor rose from the ranks himself, and I believe that in his youth he was not above <b>scaring</b> <b>crows</b> in these very fields.|$|R

Even before that, attendance for some families was sporadic with boys taking time off school to earn a little money by pig keeping and <b>bird</b> <b>scaring.</b> Attendance in late July was generally very low, presumably because it was harvest time. In common with many rural schools of the period, girls tended to stay on longer than boys.|$|R
50|$|Kisaki {{began his}} career as a roadie for <b>SCARE</b> <b>CROW</b> in 1992. In 1993, he joined his first band, Levia.

When Phantasmagoria formed, it was announced as Kisaki's final band. Thus, when the group broke up in 2008, Kisaki retired from performing to concentrate on managing Under Code Production and producing. Despite this, on February 1, 2010, Kisaki announced that he was planning to end his retirement and form a new band. In the summer of 2010, the new band was revealed to be Lin -the End of Corruption World (凛 -the end of corruption world-).|$|R
50|$|A local legend, first {{recounted in}} Leisure Hour (1887) by {{a writer who}} claimed to have heard it from the {{principal}} actor, tells of a cottager's son from Holme who while employed <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> on Holme Fen one Sunday in February, 1851, wandered from his post and sank up to his armpits in the reed beds of Whittlesey Mere. Obscured from view, he remained stuck for 19 hours, which he ascertained from the sound of the bells of All Saints Church, Conington, until a fellow villager found him by chance, extricated him and returned him to his parents.|$|R
40|$|Streamer {{lines are}} the most {{commonly}} prescribed seabird bycatch mitigation measures for longline fisheries {{and one of the}} most effective (a primary measure). Streamer lines were an innovation of Japanese tuna fishermen to prevent bait loss to birds. They are inexpensive, simple and require no modification to fishing gear. What are streamer lines? A streamer line (also called a tori or <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> line) is a line with streamers that is towed from a high point near the stern as baited hooks are deployed (Figure 1). As the vessel moves forward, drag on the line creates an aerial segment (extent) from which streamers are suspended at regular intervals. With streamer lines, the aerial extent is critical when attempting to <b>scare</b> <b>birds</b> away from baited hooks. A towed object is used to create additional drag to maximise the aerial extent. The goal is to maintain th...|$|R

40|$|When {{falconry}} {{is employed}} at airfields, not all birds can be induced to leave. Most do, but some {{do not go}} far, then return soon after the patrolling falconer drives away. There is evidence that falcon silhouettes cause fear responses in passerines, some corvids and waterfowl. Dr. Conrad Lorenz towed a silhouette of a goose over young fowl with little response. When the same silhouette was towed in a reverse direction, these same chicks exhibited fear response. Falcon decals are placed on windowpanes to prevent wild birds from colliding into them. Dr. Jeffrey R. Jenkins D. V. M. indicated that since the decals were installed that bird collisions with his office windows had ceased. Hunters use huge plastic goose decoys to attract wild geese. These decoys are so large that they also are blinds for two hunters. The large size of the decoys have on most occasions been found to attract more geese than the standard 2 ̆ 2 spread 2 ̆ 2 of life size goose decoys. The converse could be true also. A large falcon silhouette/kite could be flown towed behind the falconers vehicle in between live falcon flights. Because of the large size and increased visibility of the <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> kite, it need not be towed at such a height that it would become a navigational hazard to aircraft. Twenty five feet may be high enough. There is currently a <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> kite/helium balloon on the market employed in agriculture. There may {{be a way to}} employ these kites at airfields...|$|R
