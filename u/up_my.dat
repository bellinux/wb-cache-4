5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind that I {{was not one}} bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that {{while there is a}} lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E

25|$|I {{had to read}} {{extensively}} textbooks on physics, Celtic symbolism, unicorns, medieval watermarks, megalithic archaeology; {{study the}} writings of Jung; brush <b>up</b> <b>my</b> Plato; visit Avebury, Silbury and Coventry Cathedral; {{spend a lot of}} time with demolition gangs on slum clearance sites; and listen to the whole of Britten's War Requiem nearly every day.|$|E

25|$|During a Monday Night Football {{telecast}} on September 15, 2008, Kornheiser made {{a comment}} about a clip of the ESPN Deportes crew's call of a Felix Jones touchdown, saying, “I took high-school Spanish, and that either means ‘nobody is going to touch him’ or ‘could you pick <b>up</b> <b>my</b> dry cleaning in the morning.’” Later in the broadcast, Kornheiser apologized on-air for the remark.|$|E
25|$|I thought I was in with {{a chance}} but I didn't want to build <b>up</b> <b>my</b> hopes. The way I worked it out, {{it was to be}} me or Ken MacLeay and I knew I had a few years {{experience}} on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E
25|$|My {{sense of}} duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown {{pathological}} state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave <b>up</b> <b>my</b> practice {{in the first years}} of my married life and occupied myself solely with chemistry and writing.|$|E

They had all broken their promise.|$|R

25|$|Blowfish's key {{schedule}} starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values {{derived from}} the hexadecimal digits of pi, which contain no obvious pattern (see nothing <b>up</b> <b>my</b> sleeve number). The secret key is then, byte by byte, cycling the key if necessary, XORed with all the P-entries in order. A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P1 and P2. The same ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and the new ciphertext replaces P3 and P4. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish encryption algorithm will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys - about 4KB of data is processed.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I {{was at the time}} {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E
25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make <b>up</b> <b>my</b> body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of the}} cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.|$|E
