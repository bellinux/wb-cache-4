40|$|A new {{approach}} is hereby presented {{to study the}} influence of surface properties on ultrafine alumina (Al 2 O 3) particles towards a fluidized performance by changing the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3) surface hydrophobic degree. A number of variables that affects fluidization performance of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3), including hydrophobicity has been studied. The minimum full fluidization velocities (U-mff), average bed pressure drop (Delta P-a), standard deviation in pressure drop (sigma(p)) and so on, {{has been found to}} depend on the hydrophobic degree, which {{is a function of the}} <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3) surface properties. After treatment of the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3) with a surfactant, the liquid-solid contact angle on the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3) raises, thus changing the interaction between the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3) and also between the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3) with the micro-fluidized bed wall surface. Furthermore, some changes in important parameters such as particle size (simple agglomerate size), bulk density, flow function plots, maximum wall friction angle, BET parameters and so on were also evaluated. The fluidization of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> is attractive, if the interaction forces between the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3) and also between the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3) with the micro-fluidized bed wall surface can be artificially controlled. Moreover, it is possible to achieve a better fluidization performance on the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (Al 2 O 3). However, more investigation is required to improve the fluidization performance of the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. </p...|$|R

Therefore, this study is aimed to provide an understanding of the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particle</b> TD in the terminal bronchioles for the development of future therapeutics.

The non-linear behaviour of pressure-drops is observed, which could aid the health risk assessment system for patients with respiratory diseases. Numerical results also showed that ultrafine particle-deposition efficiency (DE) in different lobes is different for various physical activities.

Besides the regulation of levels of known toxic substances (e. g. Cr (VI)), the classification of dusts for regulatory purposes has thus far depended on broad definitions of particle size, mainly used to distinguish only between inhalable and respirable particles. In the past, <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (less than 0. 1 µm diameter) (PM 0. 1) were often regarded as a non-issue, because it was believed that significant doses would not deposit in the lungs. A growing body of scientific data is indicating that <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> are more toxic than their coarse counterparts. Increased toxicity can be related to the unique dosimetric aspects of the deposition and disposition of inhaled <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles.</b> Secondly, <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> have a larger surface area per given mass. The increased surface area can act as a carrier for co-pollutants, specifically transition metals (including chromium) that could form a coat on the particle surfaces during particle formation.

After intratracheal instillation of both <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> and larger particles of TiO 2, we found a highly increased interstitial access of the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> combined with a large acute inflammatory reaction as determined by lung lavage parameters. An additional experiment revealed that intratracheal instillation of phagocytized <b>ultrafine</b> TiO 2 <b>particles</b> (inside AM) prevented both the pulmonary inflammatory reaction and the interstitial access of the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles.</b> Another experiment showed that the influx of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) into the alveolar space unexpectedly decreased with higher doses of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles,</b> whereas alveolar epithelial permeability (protein leakage) increased. The divergence between PMN influx into the alveolar space and changes in alveolar epithelial permeability implies that they are separate events. Pulmonary inflammatory parameters determined by lung lavage analysis correlated best with the surface area of the retained particles rather than with their mass, volume, or numbers. Because higher doses resulted in an increased interstitialized fraction of particles, we suggest that inflammatory events induced by particles in the interstitial space can modify the inflammation in the alveolar space detectable by lung lavage. Our results demonstrate the dual role of AM for modifying particle-induced lung injury, i. e., both preventing such injury and contributing to it. We conclude that the increased pulmonary toxicity of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> is related to their larger surface area and to their increased interstitial access.

In this paper, experimental and modeling results on the heterogeneous condensation of water vapor on <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> produced by an ethylene-air flame are reported. The tests have been carried out in a lab-scale facility based on the use of a evaporating liquid film growth tube. Different experimental protocols have been proven and experimental tests have been carried out to estimate the effect of several process parameters, as liquid film temperature and contact time, on the efficiency of heterogeneous condensation. In addition, this paper reports a semi-empirical model that has been used to interpret the experimental data by means of considerations on mass and energy balances in the growth tube and on water nucleation and growing of condensing water on the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{contribute}} to the assessment of exposure levels of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> in the urban environment of Lisbon, Portugal, due to automobile traffic, by monitoring lung deposited alveolar surface area (resulting from exposure to <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles)</b> in a major avenue leading to the town center during late spring, as well as in indoor buildings facing it. Data revealed differentiated patterns for week days and weekends, consistent with PM 2. 5 and PM 10 patterns currently monitored by air quality stations in Lisbon. The observed ultrafine particulate levels may be directly correlated with fluxes in automobile traffic. During a typical week, amounts of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> per alveolar deposited surface area varied between 35 and 89. 2 mu m 2 /cm 3, which are comparable with levels reported for other towns in Germany and the United States. The measured values allowed for determination of the number of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> per cubic centimeter, which are comparable to levels reported for Madrid and Brisbane. In what concerns outdoor/indoor levels, we observed higher levels (32 to 63 %) outdoors, which is somewhat lower than levels observed in houses in Ontario...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{is focused on the}} {{characterization}} of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> emitted in welding of steel using mixtures of Ar+CO 2, and intends to analyze which are the main process parameters which may have influence on the emission itself. It was found that the amount of emitted <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (measured by particle number and alveolar deposited surface area) are clearly dependent from the distance to the welding front and also from the main welding parameters, namely the current intensity and heat input in the welding process. The emission of airborne <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> seem to increase with the current intensity as fume formation rate does. When comparing the tested gas mixtures, higher emissions are observed for more oxidant mixtures, that is, mixtures with higher CO 2 content, which result in higher arc stability. The later mixtures originate higher concentrations of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>particles</b> (as measured by number of particles by cm 3 of air) and higher values of alveolar deposited surface area of particles, thus resulting in a more hazardous condition regarding worker's exposure. © 2014 Sociedade Portuguesa de Materiais (SPM).
