50|$|<b>Union</b> <b>leaders</b> {{refused to}} accept a new {{contract}} citing multiple issues, including pensions, healthcare, work assignments, job security, and wages. According to Verizon, employees received $130,000 a year in wages and benefits. <b>Union</b> <b>leaders</b> claimed that the average total was $74,000 a year. Verizon offered workers a 7.5 percent salary increase. <b>Union</b> <b>leaders</b> responded by stating that the increase would be negated because workers {{would have to pay}} an increased amount for deductibles and premiums, prescriptions, and co-pays.|$|R
5|$|William George Meany (August 16, 1894 – January 10, 1980) was an American labor <b>union</b> <b>leader</b> for 57 years. He was the {{key figure}} in the {{creation}} of the AFL-CIO and served as the AFL-CIO's first president, from 1955 to 1979.|$|E
5|$|Eugene Victor Debs (November 5, 1855 – October 20, 1926) was an American <b>union</b> <b>leader,</b> {{one of the}} {{founding}} members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or the Wobblies), and five times the candidate of the Socialist Party of America for President of the United States. Through his presidential candidacies, as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns sits in {{his office}} {{awaiting}} the <b>union</b> <b>leader,</b> who mysteriously disappeared after promising {{to clean up the}} union, so that they can discuss the proposed union contract. While perusing the contract, Mr. Burns becomes disgusted with the union demands and reminisces about simpler times in which disgruntled workers were simply walled up in coke ovens. Mr. Burns then decides to take on the union, and revokes their dental plan.|$|E
40|$|How do local <b>union</b> <b>leaders</b> view {{manpower}} {{training programs}} for hard-core-disadvantaged blacks? How do they perceive their members 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards these training programs? Do unions block the implementation of job training, or do they support it? What are the <b>union</b> <b>leaders</b> 2 ̆ 7 views on special treatment and double work standards for the hard-core-disadvantaged black trainees? How difficult do <b>union</b> <b>leaders</b> {{think it will be}} for these trainees to achieve the educational standards set by the firms? We, along with Myron D. Fottler, explored some aspects of these questions in fairly intensive interviews with 51 local and regional <b>union</b> <b>leaders</b> in western New York. Thirty-six union respondents had experience with similar on-the-job training. Fifteen had never been involved in such manpower training programs...|$|R

5|$|Cristina Fernández {{was born}} on 19 February 1953, at Tolosa, a suburb of La Plata, capital of the Buenos Aires Province. She is the {{daughter}} of Eduardo Fernández and Ofelia Esther Wilhelm. Eduardo Fernández, a bus driver, was anti-Peronist, and Wilhelm was a Peronist <b>union</b> <b>leader.</b> Wilhelm was a single mother. Fernández married her and moved into her house when Cristina was two years old. Most details about her childhood, such as her elementary school, are unknown. She attended high school at Popular Mercantil and Misericordia schools.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a <b>union</b> <b>leader</b> during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under a football field, a homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} social, cultural, ethnic, and {{linguistic}} factors {{contributed to the}} sparking of unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine {{in the aftermath of}} the early 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Following Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, resurfacing historical and cultural divisions and a weak state structure hampered the development of a unified Ukrainian national identity. In eastern and southern Ukraine, Russification and ethnic Russian settlement during centuries of Russian rule caused the Russian language to attain primacy, even amongst ethnic Ukrainians. In Crimea, ethnic Russians have comprised the majority of the population since the deportation of the indigenous Crimean Tatars by Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>leader</b> Joseph Stalin following the Second World War. This contrasts with western and central Ukraine, which were historically ruled by a variety of powers, such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austrian Empire. In these areas, the Ukrainian ethnic, national, and linguistic identity remained intact.|$|E

5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the <b>union</b> <b>leader</b> for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Chandrakumar is {{attacked}} by his company's labourers {{because he had}} suspended their <b>union</b> <b>leader.</b> Divya brings him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged from the hospital, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has {{fallen in love with}} him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets Chandrakumar gave her shortly after their marriage but, irritated by what he sees as Divya's immaturity, Chandrakumar asks her to return to her parents home and books her trip. At the railway station, Chandrakumar gives Divya the divorce papers that she had requested as a wedding gift. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him, and they reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law {{and let his}} party membership lapse. There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested in joining the Liberal Party of Canada. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 {{to see if he}} was interested in running as a federal candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, <b>union</b> <b>leader</b> Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local <b>union</b> <b>leader</b> was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Danny Greene and his {{childhood}} friends Billy McComber and Art Sneperger are longshoremen at the Cleveland docks. Meanwhile, the members are exploited by corrupt union boss, Jerry Merke {{and the leadership}} of the ILA union urges Greene to run against him. Meanwhile, Sneperger can't pay a gambling debt to Cleveland Mafia Capo John Nardi. In return for Sneperger's debt being forgiven, Greene supplies Nardi's crew with goods stolen from the docks. Merke finds out, demands a cut of Greene's profits, and then sends an enforcer to kill him. Instead, Greene beats up the enforcer, then beats up Merke, throws the <b>union</b> <b>leader</b> out of his office, and is later elected union president. He improves the working conditions at the docks while continuing his dealings with Nardi.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so far as a figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. She changed {{the style of the}} government making it more authoritarian, and more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the <b>union</b> <b>leader</b> Hugo Moyano, and increased the political clout of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more than her husband had. The popularity of the Kirchners had been in a decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections by a landslide.|$|E

5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As <b>union</b> <b>leader,</b> Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Arizona senator {{subsequently}} {{resumed his}} familiar {{position as a}} political underdog, riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, {{with none of the}} top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate. McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire– the scene of his 2000 triumph– and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire <b>Union</b> <b>Leader,</b> and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.|$|E
5|$|Political {{activism}} in the Rhondda {{has a deep}} link with trade unions and the socialist movement but was initially slow to develop. In the 1870s the Amalgamated Association of Miners won support, but was destroyed by employer hostility. The Cambrian Miners’ Association was more successful {{and the creation of}} the South Wales Miners' Federation after the 1898 coal strike, gave the South Wales miners a reputation for militancy, in which the Rhondda Valley played its part. As part of the Redistribution Act of 1885 the Rhondda was granted its first seat in Parliament which was won by the moderate trade <b>union</b> <b>leader</b> William Abraham, who was notably the only working-class member elected in Wales. Socialism and syndicalism ideals grew throughout the 20th century and industrial struggle reached a crescendo in the 1910-11 Tonypandy Riots. A year later Tonypandy saw the publication of Noah Ablett’s pamphlet The Miners' Next Step. Tonypandy was at the centre of further public disorder when, on 11 June 1936 at Dewinton Field, a large group of people gathered to confront the open-air address by Tommy Moran, propaganda officer of the British Union of Fascists. The crowd, recorded as between 2,000 and 6,000 strong, turned violent and police were forced to protect Moran's Blackshirt bodyguard. Seven local people were arrested.|$|E
