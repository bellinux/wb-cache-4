500|$|Jackson {{was well}} known for having large bags <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> which he had surgically removed shortly after his retirement. He stated {{that it was a}} matter of [...] "vision, not vanity", as the bags had been {{impairing}} his sight. Jackson lists his interests as music, reading, travel, skiing, and tennis.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} Buxton painted circles <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> with {{cigarette}} ashes, {{and soon the}} rest followed with ghoulish black makeup and outlandish clothes. [...] The band moved to Los Angeles and became known for its provocative, theatrical shock rock stage show. [...] In an incident during a performance at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in 1969, Cooper threw a live chicken into the audience, who tore it to shreds.|$|E
500|$|Krusty's {{design has}} {{undergone}} several subtle changes {{since the early}} years. For the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Krusty's design was permanently enhanced and {{he was given a}} different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> in order to distinguish him from Homer. In the episode [...] "Lisa's Wedding", which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty's design was significantly altered to make him look considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx.|$|E
5000|$|Great Britain captain Ellery Hanley {{sustained}} a cut <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> during the match which required 12 stitches.|$|R
5000|$|During his {{freshman}} season, McKnight painted [...] "I need $" [...] <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> blacks to signify {{his desire to}} play professional football in the NFL.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. He {{would keep}} it <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> as it were. Why not? It is natural. A fellow doesn't put his swag underground, unless there's {{a very good}} reason for it." ...|$|R
500|$|Although he {{does not}} provide the voice, Arnold Schwarzenegger is President of the United States rather than then-President George W. Bush because, {{according}} to Groening, [...] "in two years... the film [...] out of date". Brooks was nervous about the idea, noting that [...] " [...] opinion polls were way down", and has said that they [...] "were [...] he'd make a political comeback". The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger, {{but one of the}} staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character Rainer Wolfcastle as President. This idea was developed, with the design of Wolfcastle, himself also a caricature of Schwarzenegger, being given more wrinkles <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and a different hairstyle.|$|E
500|$|According to Greaney, the animators {{originally}} designed future Bart as [...] "cool and fun" [...] and made several designs {{where he was}} [...] "slim, attractive, and hip." [...] Greaney did not think any of these designs {{went along with the}} personality he and the other the writers had assigned to future Bart, so he told the animators to draw the character with belly fat, a ponytail, sags <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and one earring. Scully said on the audio commentary that he thought the design of Bart looked [...] "great", though he added that it was [...] "slightly disturbing" [...] to see the older versions of Homer and Marge in the episode, and joked that it is [...] "a little bit sad to watch cartoon characters age." ...|$|E
500|$|McClure {{was based}} on the typical [...] "washed up" [...] Hollywood actor. B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as {{inspiration}} for his name and certain character aspects. Writer Mike Reiss later met Doug McClure's daughter, who revealed that her father had found the homage funny. His children would call their father [...] "Troy McClure" [...] when his back was turned. According to show creator Matt Groening, Phil Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull [...] "the maximum amount of humor" [...] out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance {{is similar to that of}} Hartman himself. When he was designed, McClure was given an extra line <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to suggest that the character had gotten a facelift.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, mon Dieu, Michie, {{they are}} vair' difficile. They {{are not like}} Englis' beauties, there is {{the father and the}} mother, and--the convent." [...] And Xavier, who had a wen <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> laid <b>his</b> finger on it.|$|R
60|$|There fell a tense silence. For some {{seconds the}} three {{regarded}} one another. The Prince eyed Bert steadfastly, and Bert quailed <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> Slowly the Prince {{rose to his}} feet and the bird-faced officer jerked up beside him. Bert remained squatting.|$|R
6000|$|... "And at me," [...] said Walter, [...] "as if he {{were about}} to shake his head and rebuke me for some {{suspected}} iniquity. But so does the original. I shall never feel quite comfortable <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> till we stand before him to be married." ...|$|R
500|$|To {{show the}} side effects Focusyn had on Bart, the animators made slight changes to his face as the episode progressed. It is first seen in the scene where Bart is reading [...] "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Pre-teens": a cheek line is added just <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{to suggest that he}} is {{starting}} to change. In another scene, Bart can be seen speed reading and later on, the animators drew him with [...] "mini-pupils". The staff discussed whether Bart's pupils would be bigger or smaller than normal while he is on the drug. The writers settled on smaller pupils and, according to Kirkland, [...] "several model sheets were going {{back and forth over the}} fax machines" [...] until the staff were satisfied with the size of Bart's pupils while influenced by the drug. In fact, psychostimulants used to treat ADHD are more likely cause pupils to become bigger (dilated).|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the whole second season, Goldman wrote that [...] "Their was [...] some {{complaints}} that the season finale was a bit too rushed, with a lot of information offered all at once. Yet while that's a bit valid, it's also an exciting and surprising finale, that actually offers some bigger shocks than season 1." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a mostly positive review, praising the reveal of Beaver as the murderer while being slightly critical of his reveal as Veronica's rapist. He wrote that [...] "as twists go, this was a good one" [...] and that [...] "Kyle Gallner makes the transition from goofy, kind of pathetic little brother to insane mastermind quite well—the circles <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> specifically, which seemed to indicate anxiety before suddenly indicated darkness and insanity when seen in a new light." [...] Regarding the rape reveal, the reviewers wrote that [...] "On a narrative level, I was fine with it...it's still a big problem in an emotional sense. In general, rape is a difficult subject, and to see it used as a plot device creates problems on its own." [...] Kaiser summed up his review by writing, [...] "'Not Pictured' acts as an effective capstone for a chaotic season. Sure, it doesn't entirely work, but overall, it gets the job done with emotion and flair." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Michel Duchesneau, {{immediately}} after the work's première, Delage could still enjoy the esteem of the master Debussy, whose work had convinced him to devote himself to music. [...] According to Paul Landormy, [...] "Debussy, entused over his Poèmes hindous, asked him one day to play them to him with the music <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] He nearly collapsed..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Molière {{directed}} her education and {{she grew up}} <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> Armande married Molière in 1662, when he was 40 and she 17. Together, they had three children: Louis (19 January11 November 1664), Marie Madeleine Esprit (3 August 166523 May 1723) and Pierre Jean-Baptiste Armand (15 September11 October 1672).|$|R
60|$|In {{the verse}} {{the name of}} Mosby is {{invested}} {{with some of those}} associations with which the popular mind is familiar. But facts do not warrant the belief that every clandestine attack of men who passed for Mosby's was made <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> or even by his knowledge.|$|R
60|$|He {{struck a}} light {{and looked at the}} bed. Haldin was lying on his back as before, only both <b>his</b> hands were <b>under</b> <b>his</b> head. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> were open. He stared at the ceiling.|$|R
2500|$|Lynott {{then left}} the family home and moved into a flat in Clontarf, where he briefly joined 'Kama Sutra'. It was in this band that he learned his {{frontman}} skills, and worked out how to interact with an audience. In early 1968, he teamed up with bassist Brendan 'Brush' Shiels to form Skid Row. Shiels also wanted Brian Downey to play drums in the band, but Downey wasn't interested in the band's style, so the job went to Noel Bridgeman instead. The band signed a deal with Ted Carroll, who would later go on to manage Thin Lizzy, and played a variety of covers including [...] "Eight Miles High", [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and several numbers by Jimi Hendrix. Because Lynott did not play an instrument {{at this point in}} his career, he instead manipulated his voice through an echo box during instrumental sections. He also took to smearing boot polish <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> on stage, which he would continue to do throughout Lizzy's career later on, and regularly performed a mock fight with Shiels onstage to attract the crowd. In mid 1968, guitarist Bernard Cheevers quit to work full-time at the Guinness factory in Dublin, and was replaced by Belfast-born guitarist Gary Moore.|$|E
2500|$|Cappon {{was known}} for his {{conservatism}} as a coach. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, the uniforms never changed, having small sewn-on numbers and no player names. [...] He considered a fast break as a lack of discipline and would not allow his players to shoot before five or ten passes had been completed. [...] In 1995, former Princeton player Selden Edwards wrote an article on Cappon's influence at Princeton. [...] Edwards, a junior varsity player in the Cappon era, wrote that [...] "Cappy was Princeton basketball to anyone even vaguely familiar with the teams of that era." [...] Edwards described Cappon's physical appearance this way: [...] "In 1959, the fall I arrived at Princeton, Cappy was in peak form, a character who knew he was a character. He was in his early sixties, and his body {{looked as if it had}} been sculpted in ice cream and left in the sun. He was bald, the skin on his face drooped, he had deep shadows <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> His voice was gravelly, and he enunciated as if he had wads of Kleenex in his mouth. He always said exactly what he meant, and his language was delightfully salty. Legend had it that he had been a great athlete at Michigan, but by the 1960s no one could imagine that. He was grumpily personable and totally without pretension." ...|$|E
2500|$|Polk's {{time in the}} White House {{took its}} toll on his health. Full of enthusiasm and vigor when he entered office, Polk left office {{exhausted}} by his years of public service. He lost weight and had deep lines {{on his face and}} dark circles <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He is believed to have contracted cholera in New Orleans, Louisiana, on a goodwill tour of the South after leaving the White House. He died of cholera at his new home, Polk Place, in Nashville, Tennessee, at 3:15pm on June 15, 1849, three months after leaving office. He had never joined any church, but received a deathbed Methodist baptism. Initially buried in what is now Nashville City Cemetery, due to a legal requirement related to his infectious disease death, he was moved to a tomb on the grounds of Polk Place (as specified in his will) less than a year later. Polk's last words illustrate his devotion to his wife: [...] "I love you, Sarah. For all eternity, I love you." [...] She lived at Polk Place for 42 years after his death and died on August 14, 1891. His mother, Jane Knox Polk, died on January 11, 1852. In 1893, the bodies of President and Mrs. Polk were exhumed and relocated to their current resting place {{on the grounds of the}} Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville. Polk Place was demolished in 1900. In 2017, state legislative action was considered to relocate the Polk's remains to his father's home in Columbia, Tennessee.|$|E
50|$|The 'Teardrop' rapist (identity unknown) {{is a man}} {{responsible}} for 35 sexual assaults on women, including minors, in Los Angeles, California. The assaults began in 1996 and have continued through 2012. He {{is believed to be}} a Hispanic male with a light complexion, and received his nickname from at least one teardrop tattoo <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lish Davis evidently {{saw that}} there was bad blood between the alleged detective and Seth's roommate, and at once forced the boys on the front seat to move nearer {{together}} until he had room to sit where he could keep all of them <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> a proceeding which caused the amateur fireman great relief of mind.|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} hope {{we would be}} able to set off in a boat alone, and it was quite {{positive}} we would not dare do so while Hunt was holding us <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> therefore had we missed an opportunity of serving the Cause, as well as paved the way, perhaps, for our own arrest as spies.|$|R
60|$|I {{spread out}} the notes <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He blinked, but resolutely lifted his voice.|$|E
60|$|A cold hand {{clutched}} at his heart. His world was falling to pieces, crumbling <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Sicilian {{leaned over}} the table. There were gray rims <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and even his lips had lost their color.|$|E
60|$|Sheen was in. There was a {{ridge of}} purple <b>under</b> <b>his</b> left <b>eye,</b> {{but he was}} {{otherwise}} intact.|$|R
60|$|The prizefighter's brutal {{nature was}} roused. Woman or no woman, {{he would show}} the murmuring crowd {{what it meant to}} cross the path of the Tinman. She had struck him. She must take the consequence. No one should square up to him with impunity. He swung his right with a curse. The bonnet {{instantly}} ducked <b>under</b> <b>his</b> arm, and a line of razor-like knuckles left an open cut <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wolffy is a middle-aged, hen-pecked husband. He {{wears an}} orange cap {{with a yellow}} patch and has a scar <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> He lives with his {{demanding}} wife, Wolnie, in a castle {{on the outskirts of}} Lamb village. Wolffy is usually motivated solely by the fear of his wife. He is constantly under her demand to bring home goats for food.|$|R
60|$|He {{drew his}} dressing-gown {{a little closer}} around him. The hollows <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> seemed to have grown deeper since the morning.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Caryll {{produced}} the certificate again. He beckoned Rotherby, {{and held the}} paper <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "What date is there--the date of birth?" ...|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{he turns}} {{a blind eye}} to the misbehaviour of the boys <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> and teaches the {{children}} using his method of Twisterism, which is somehow related to Astrology and the signs of the Zodiac. However, he is later ordered by the school's new governor to adopt stricter policies, eventually turning St. Michael's into a military academy, with Twist holding an officer's rank.|$|R
6000|$|But {{that ancient}} mariner {{might have been}} excused his {{insensibility}} to the treasure as it rolled away. For, <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> at the same moment, accurately within his range of observation, coming full into the sphere of his startled and intensely wide-awake look-out, were Florence and Susan Nipper: Florence looking up into his face half timidly, and receiving the whole shock of his wooden ogling! ...|$|R
