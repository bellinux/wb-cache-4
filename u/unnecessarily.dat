5|$|A {{month later}} the villagers {{said they felt}} cheated by the UP {{government}} since permission to build it was still not given; they blamed the Samajwadi Party leaders for <b>unnecessarily</b> punishing her. They said that the party leaders should have got them permission to build the mosque at that time, preventing this incident from happening.|$|E
5|$|If Gage did not dip {{his hand}} <b>unnecessarily</b> {{in the public}} till, he did engage in the {{relatively}} common practices of nepotism and political favouritism. In addition to securing advantageous positions for several people named Gage or Kemble, he also apparently assisted in the placement {{of some of his}} friends and political supporters, or their children.|$|E
5|$|Physical trauma {{including}} tearing, friction or bumping of {{the piercing}} site, which may cause edema and delay healing. The risks can be minimized by wearing properly sized jewellery and not changing it <b>unnecessarily,</b> by not touching the piercing more than required for aftercare, and by being conscious of environmental factors (such as clothing) that may impact the piercing.|$|E
5|$|By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River {{against the advice of}} his officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized this strategy as <b>unnecessarily</b> aggressive.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, yes, I {{think it}} has in terms {{of some of the}} stuff they did in the Middle East {{supporting}} the pro-democracy demonstrators. But a lot of bad things too, <b>unnecessarily</b> harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as <b>unnecessarily</b> confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E
5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of <b>unnecessarily</b> extending {{the state of emergency}} (and related curfews) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E
5|$|The left-handed Darling was {{a strong}} driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket. His fellow players thought that was {{sometimes}} <b>unnecessarily</b> defensive in his approach to batting {{and that he was}} at his best when driving hard. His South Australian and Australian team mate George Giffen thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is {{unrecorded}} when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted {{to prevent them from}} being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to <b>unnecessarily</b> deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had <b>unnecessarily</b> caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Justice of Singapore, Chan Sek Keong, {{suggested}} extrajudicially {{during a}} 2010 lecture that Singapore courts may not apply the sufficient interest test {{with the same}} rigour as the UK courts. A more stringent application of the sufficient interest test would be {{in line with the}} green-light approach that the courts adopt in administrative law. Under this approach, the Government commits itself to good administrative practices while the courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules for the executive to adhere to. Accordingly, the courts may adopt a more discriminating standing test to discourage litigation that will <b>unnecessarily</b> curtail the executive's ability to carry out good governance.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{recommended}} co-operation between countries across the cheetah's range to minimise {{the conflict between}} cheetahs and human beings. A 2016 study showed that ecotourism can have a significantly {{positive impact on the}} conservation of the cheetah. Although the requirement of space for the habitat would have to be compromised in most cases, establishment of private reserves for cheetahs and ensuring the absence of predators and poachers could be a successful conservation measure. Additionally, the financial benefits accrued and the awareness generated can further aid the cause of the cheetah. At the same time, the animals should not be <b>unnecessarily</b> handled or disturbed, as cheetahs are particularly sensitive to human interference.|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean Parliament is unicameral in nature, {{consisting}} of a single legislative body tasked with making laws. However, {{the notion of a}} second legislative chamber was considered on two separate occasions. In 1954, a constitutional commission headed by Sir George William Rendel rejected a proposal for a second chamber composed solely of minority representatives, citing its unsuitability in a tiny state like Singapore and arguing that it might end up being <b>unnecessarily</b> bureaucratic. It also asserted that such an upper House might potentially be detrimental to social cohesion. This issue was also considered by the Wee Chong Jin Commission, which rejected it on similar grounds.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is <b>unnecessarily</b> elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{refused to}} allow his slaves to be sold without their permission. This policy was {{economically}} inefficient, resulting in an <b>unnecessarily</b> large work force. In his will, he provided that his slaves should be freed {{after the death of}} his wife. However, Martha chose to free them at the end of 1800, fearing that her life was not safe in their hands because her death would make them free. Most of the former slaves were unable to find suitable work after being freed and lived in poverty. Part of this was due to Virginia passing laws against educating blacks and restricting the rights of free blacks.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} frustrated {{at the lack of}} progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled from the roof of the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of <b>unnecessarily</b> killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E
5|$|Liu {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a separate phylogenetic analysis in 2017. They criticized {{the analysis of}} Rieppel and colleagues as having <b>unnecessarily</b> repeated several characters in their data, thus imbuing the repeated characters with undue weight in the analysis. In their own analysis, Liu and colleagues used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from an analysis by Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially chimeric taxa such as Cosesaurus, Kadimakara, Trachelosaurus, and Malerisaurus. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that Dinocephalosaurus {{was a member of}} the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a clade containing Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos. The analyses also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit to the exclusion of Prolacerta. The tree from the parsimony-based analysis is reproduced above, at right.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out <b>unnecessarily</b> by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E
5|$|Peng was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Mao's rise to power during the January 1935 Zunyi Conference. Peng continued to consolidate the communists' base area after arriving in Shaanxi, campaigning in neighboring Shanxi and Gansu. In April 1937, Peng was named vice commander-in-chief of all Chinese communist forces, outranked only by Zhu De, who was named commander-in-chief. Peng's promotion was supported by Lin Biao, who had been actively supporting Peng for promotions to senior leadership as early as May 1934. In early 1935 Lin responded to widespread discontent within the Red Army over Mao's evasive tactics (which were perceived inside the Red Army as <b>unnecessarily</b> exhausting) by publicly proposing that Peng take overall command of the Red Army; but Mao, who had recently been promoted to the position, attacked Peng and Lin for challenging him and successfully retained his position.|$|E
5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios for fast tissues were <b>unnecessarily</b> conservative, as calculated values indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow tissues (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher values were found for the fast tissues. These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute tissues were not relevant to the development of DCS. Based on these conclusions, a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute tissues.|$|E
5|$|The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia {{struck the}} pilot house of Monitor and exploded, driving {{fragments}} {{of paint and}} iron through the viewing slits into Worden's eyes and temporarily blinding him. As {{no one else could}} see to command the ship, Monitor was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and Monitor returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although Minnesota was still aground, the falling tide meant that she was out of reach. Furthermore, Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, Monitor returned, only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight. Convinced that Virginia was quitting, with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship <b>unnecessarily,</b> Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for <b>unnecessarily</b> sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War, Norway {{enforced}} {{a policy}} to disallow allied aircraft to operate further north than Bardufoss and Andøya, {{in an effort to}} minimize tension with the Soviet Union. Specifically, allied aircraft were not permitted to operate east of the 24th meridian east, which was just west of Banak, thus hindering use of the airfield. This was motivated in part to not <b>unnecessarily</b> provoke the Soviet Union, with which Norway shared a land border, and in part because increased allied military presence could decrease the popular support for NATO membership. The restrictions were strengthened following the 1960 U-2 incident, in which a US spy aircraft en route to Bodø was shot down over Soviet territory. During the mid-1960s, NATO unsuccessfully attempted to convince Norwegian authorities to move the allied operational border from the 24th to the 27th meridian east.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{survived the}} last 15 {{minutes on the}} first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the {{hesitant}} Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, Morris <b>unnecessarily</b> played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. Morris fell {{when he tried to}} force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just as he did in the first innings. However, Morris dropped the catch. Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{was again}} {{temporarily}} elevated to command of his division, now designated {{part of the}} XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac, at the Battle of Antietam. His division's three brigades were led by junior officers who had survived Cedar Mountain. Even though XII Corps commander Brig. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield was killed shortly after the fighting began, Greene led a crushing attack against the Confederates near the Dunker Church, achieving the farthest penetration of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's lines than any Union unit. Under immense pressure, Greene held his small division (only 1,727 men engaged {{at the start of}} the day) in advance of the rest of the army for four hours, but eventually withdrew after suffering heavy losses. While the division was posted to Harpers Ferry, Greene took a three-week sick leave. Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard speculated that Greene, like many of his fellow officers, was sickened by the stench of dead and wounded at Antietam. When he returned, there was a new division commander, Brig. Gen. Geary. Greene was disgruntled that Geary, with only a few days seniority over him, was selected for the post; Geary had been wounded at Cedar Mountain and his combat record was not as good, but his political connections and a sentiment that a wounded officer should not be set back in his career <b>unnecessarily,</b> gave him the nod.|$|E
5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have <b>unnecessarily</b> neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E
5|$|Wiseau {{has been}} secretive about {{exactly how he}} {{obtained}} the funding for the project, but he did tell Entertainment Weekly that he made {{some of the money}} by importing leather jackets from Korea. According to Sestero in his book The Disaster Artist, Wiseau was already independently wealthy at the time production began, having amassed a fortune over several years of entrepreneurship and real estate development in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco. The budget for The Room reached , all of which was spent on production and marketing. Wiseau has stated that the reason the film was relatively expensive was because many members of the cast and crew had to be replaced, and each of the cast members had several understudies. According to Sestero, Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming that <b>unnecessarily</b> inflated the film's budget, such as building sets for sequences that could have been filmed on location, purchasing unnecessary equipment, and filming identical scenes multiple times using different sets. Sestero further wrote that the film's budget skyrocketed as a result of minutes-long dialogue sequences taking hours or days to shoot due to Wiseau's inability to properly remember his lines or move to the appropriate place on camera.|$|E
