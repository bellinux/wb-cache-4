500|$|A war widow after barely {{five weeks}} of marriage, Kay Hughes was inconsolable in her loss: [...] "I wept <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cry no more". Flying Officer Butch {{ran out of the}} mess on the day of his master's death, and was never seen again. Following a service at St James', Sutton-on-Hull, on 13September 1940, Hughes was buried in the churchyard at RowG, Grave4. A week later, Kay {{discovered}} she was pregnant, but eventually miscarried. She subsequently drove ambulances for the British war effort. News of his son's marriage came as [...] "a complete surprise" [...] to Percy Hughes, who only learned of his daughter-in-law's existence from the Australian Air Board's casualty letter. Having married three more times after Hughes' death, Kay died on 28June 1983 and, in accordance with her wishes, her ashes were buried with her first husband, whose headstone was amended to read [...] "In loving memory of his wife Kathleen".|$|E
500|$|Because the Fugitive Slave Law {{had made}} the {{northern}} United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. In his third autobiography, Douglass wrote: [...] "On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with me <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> collect sufficient money to get them on to Canada. It was the largest number I ever had at any one time, and I had some difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter...." [...] The number of travelers and the time of the visit make it likely that this was Tubman's group.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} I derived some consolation {{from the}} thought that at any rate {{for the next four}} and twenty hours the lovely creature would be safe.

60|$|Though I knew {{it must be}} day, {{there was}} {{scarcely}} more than a green twilight around me, ever deepening, <b>until</b> at last <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but dimly discern the upper windows of the palace, and all sound waned but the roar of distant falling water.|$|R

5000|$|Listening {{to the six}} {{recordings}} {{made over}} his two-week trip to Johannesburg, the process of composing lyrics around the recordings was difficult: I would play the tracks over and over again, improvising melodies <b>until</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> perceive patterns in the music that would enable me to write matching verses. It was very difficult, because patterns that seemed as though they should fit together often didn't. I realized that in African music, the rhythms are always shifting slightly and that {{the shape of a}} melody was often dictated by the bass line rather than the guitar. Harmonically, African music consists essentially of three major chords — that's why it sounds so happy — so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write almost any melody I wanted in a major scale. I improvised in two ways — by making up melodies in falsetto, and by singing any words that came to mind down in my lower and mid range.|$|R

60|$|For a long while, {{over an hour}} I should think, I {{sat there}} outside the hut, or walked to and fro. <b>Until</b> {{darkness}} came <b>I</b> <b>could</b> occupy myself with contemplating the scenery of the encircling hills, which {{is among the most}} beautiful in Zululand with its swelling contours and rich colouring. But after it had set in only my thoughts remained, and these I found depressing.|$|R

"She {{has brought}} {{me up with}} the {{intention}} of my rejoining my countrymen, as soon as I became a man; for she did not see how, <b>until</b> then, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> earn my living among strangers. She taught me as much as she knew of the language and religion of the English and, when I was twelve, took me down to Bombay and left me, for some two years and a half, in the house of Mrs. Sankey, a lady who taught some of the children of officers there. When I left Bombay I was able to speak English as well as other English boys of my age.|$|R

50|$|The battle {{began with}} useless {{artillery}} cross-fire, because the projectiles {{buried in the}} sand and didn't explode. According to Velázquez' plan, around 10 am Amengual's division began the march over the Allied left, while the II Division moved towards the center with its units on a single line, and Barbosa marched over Montero. Amengual engaged first, because Barceló was ordered to wait <b>until</b> the <b>I</b> Division <b>could</b> take the left flank.|$|R
60|$|Now, as I have hinted, {{under the}} {{teaching}} of Jorsen, who saved me from degradation and self-murder, yes, and helped me with money <b>until</b> once again <b>I</b> <b>could</b> earn a livelihood, I have acquired certain knowledge and wisdom of a sort that are not common. That is, Jorsen taught me the elements of these things; he set my feet upon the path which thenceforward, having the sight, I {{have been able to}} follow for myself. How I followed it does not matter, nor <b>could</b> <b>I</b> teach others if I would.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fact is that}} we are all minimalists—at least, when {{it comes}} to the patriarchal period and the settlement. When I began my PhD studies more than three decades ago in the USA, the 'substantial historicity' of the patriarchs was widely {{accepted}} as was the unified conquest of the land. These days it is quite difficult to find anyone who takes this view.In fact, <b>until</b> recently <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find no 'maximalist' history of Israel since Wellhausen. ... In fact, though, 'maximalist' has been widely defined as someone who accepts the biblical text unless it can be proven wrong. If so, very few are willing to operate like this, not even John Bright (1980) whose history is not a maximalist one according to the definition just given. Lester L. Grabbe.|$|R
60|$|I knew no fear. My pulses throbbed and {{my heart}} beat ponderously but rapturously as I watched the vision growing more and more {{distinct}} <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make out the pale face of ineffable sweetness and the veiled eyes.|$|E
60|$|While thus acting {{the simple}} I was making ready for {{whatsoever}} plan Darius wanted to carry into effect, for I studied {{the outside of}} the jail <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell within a foot of how much rope would be needed.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not disturb}} her. The minutes passed, the light waned <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see her no longer, and yet I {{knew that she}} had not moved. The strange sympathy between us kept me silent until I heard her voice calling my name.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{tradition}} that, before his death, the Emperor Constantine I bestowed upon him the honorary title of Patriarch; however, Byzantium did not become {{the capital of the}} Empire until 330 (when it was renamed New Rome or Constantinople), and the see was not elevated to a patriarchate <b>until</b> 451.Metrophanes <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not partake in the first Ecumenical Council, which was held at Nicaea, due to age and ill health (he was already bedridden). He sent instead Alexander, the first among his presbyters, an honest man, whom he destined as his successor.

6000|$|Such was {{the account}} Marble {{afterwards}} gave {{me of the}} termination of the dialogue. Sleep, sleep, sleep! Never did men enjoy their rest more than we did {{for the next five}} hours, the ship being as silent as a church on a week-day, during the whole time. For myself, I can safely say I heard nothing, or knew nothing, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> was awakened by a violent shake of the shoulder. Supposing myself to have been aroused for an ordinary watch at sea, I was erect in an instant, and found the sun's rays streaming into my face, through the cabin-windows. This prevented me, for a moment, from seeing that I had been disturbed by Captain Marble himself.

6000|$|Outside, {{however, the}} sun was shining brightly, and we {{departed}} immediately to explore Cambridge and announce our important presences to the proper authorities.... We went into Boston to dine.... It was not until nine o'clock in the evening that we returned and the bottom suddenly dropped out of things. He who has tasted that first, acute homesickness of college will know what I mean. It usually comes at the opening of one's trunk. The sight of the top tray gave me a pang I shall never forget. I would not have believed that I loved my mother so much! These articles had been packed by her hands; and in one corner, among the underclothes on which she had neatly sewed my initials, lay the new Bible she had bought. [...] "Hugh Moreton Paret, from his Mother. September, 1881." [...] I took it up (Tom was not looking) and tried to read a passage, but my eyes were blurred. What was it within me that pressed and pressed <b>until</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear the pain of it no longer? I pictured the sitting-room at home, and my father and mother there, thinking of me. Yes, I must acknowledge it; in the bitterness of that moment I longed to be back once more in the railed-off space on the floor of Breck and Company, writing invoices....|$|R
60|$|At last I bethought me of {{the pits}} from which I had just emerged. Why not secrete her there <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> return and fetch her away in safety and for ever from this awful place. I {{explained}} my plan to her.|$|E
60|$|Cautiously I edged {{about the}} far side of the trees <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> obtain a view of the spot from which the spear must have come, and when I did I saw the head of a man just {{emerging}} from behind a bush.|$|E
6000|$|... "But why not put as {{many miles}} {{between us and}} this place as is possible?" [...] I cried, with no slight show of irritation, for the imminence of the danger set every nerve {{tingling}} <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of nothing save the most hurried flight.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me as though some cruel, unseen thing had crept into the house to stand ever between them, {{so that they might}} never look into each other's loving eyes but only into the eyes of this evil shadow.

Now beside my mother it would whisper in her ear; and the next moment, stealing across to my father, answer for him with his voice, but strangely different. I used to think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear it laughing to itself as it stepped back into enfolding space.|$|R

Of course, they can imprison me for a time if I refuse to tell, but I would rather stay in gaol for a year than say aught that might set them upon the track of Captain Madden. It was not until the day he left me in Holland that I knew his name, for of course the men always called him captain, and so did I." ...|$|R
