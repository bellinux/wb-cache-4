Slug can cause damage and unnecessary shut down of process equipment. To handle slug,finger type slug catcher {{is used as}} it is a liquid receiving facility designed to handle large volume of liquid and to stabilize it. Finger type slug catcher used the gravity settling separation method to separate the gas and liquid phase of the flow. Finger type slug catcher can be massive in size,and the gas recovery percentage is difficult to maximize. <b>Unbalance</b> <b>mass</b> distribution of the natural gas inside the slug catcher contribute to the low gas recovery inside the slug catcher. The objective of this research is to increase the mass distribution of the flow on the original slug catcher design hence increasing the efficiency of the separation. A base model is design for the original finger type slug catcher using Gambit and several modifications can be added from there named modify design. The proposed modification for the original slug catcher design is the addition of one equalizer header and the T-junction separation at inlet manifold.

Among the broad ranges of faults that cause synchronous vibration, <b>mass</b> <b>unbalance</b> and bow are the most common faults present in the rotor and hence their detailed understanding is required. In the present study, a rotor model having both <b>mass</b> <b>unbalance</b> and bow is analyzed to find the influence of these faults on the synchronous response. The synchronous response of a rotor is a function of influence coefficients due to <b>mass</b> <b>unbalance</b> and bow.

The correction unbalance vector required to balance the rotor at its first bending critical speed is computed using these analytically derived influence coefficients and the rotor responses measured at a speed much lower than the first bending critical speed.

For feedback control, sliding mode control and the line of sight (LOS) stabilization are used for compensation of the nonlinearities, model uncertainties, friction and disturbances from outside environment. Although our mechanisms are carefully designed with statically balance, the center of the gravity will changed due to the configuration change during moving of the gimbal relative to an aerial vehicle. The disturbance torque from <b>unbalance</b> <b>mass</b> and gimbal geometry is unavoidable under the effect of the vibration of the aerial vehicle, which will lead to degrade the system’s accuracy.

The finite element rotor system is composed of a shaft with one disk, two flexible bearing supports and a ball bearing element where the non-linearities are due to both the radial clearance and the Herztian contact between races and rolling elements. A numerical analysis is performed to analyze the non-linear behavior of this bearing rotor by using the Harmonic Balance Method with appropriate condensation located only on the non-linear coordinates of the system {{in order to minimize}} computer time. The condensation process reduces the original non-linear rotor system by focusing only on the solution of the non-linear equations of the Fourier coefficients associated with the system's non-linear components.

The studies indicate that the coupled dynamic responses of the rod fastening rotor bearing system under rub-impact and initial permanent deflection exhibit a rich nonlinear dynamic diversity, synchronous periodic- 1 motion, multiple periodic motion, quasi-periodic motion and chaotic motion can be observed under certain conditions.

Past modeling and control algorithms {{were based on the}} assumption of rigidity in the flywheel?s bearings and the satellite structure. This dissertation provides {{simulation results}} and theory which eliminates this assumption utilizing control algorithms for active vibration control (AVC), flywheel shaft levitation and integrated power transfer and attitude control (IPAC) that are effective even with low stiffness active magnetic bearings (AMB), and flexible satellite appendages. The flywheel AVC and levitation tasks are provided by a multi input multi output (MIMO) control law that enhances stability by reducing the dependence of the forward and backward gyroscopic poles with changes in flywheel speed. The control law is shown to be effective even for (1) Large polar to transverse inertia ratios which increases the stored energy density while causing the poles to become more speed dependent and, (2) Low bandwidth controllers shaped to suppress high frequency noise. These two main tasks could be successfully achieved by MIMO (Gyroscopic) control algorithm, which is unique approach. The vibration control mass (VCM) is designed to reduce the vibrations of flexible appendages of the satellite. During IPAC maneuver, the oscillation of flywheel spin speeds, torque motions and satellite appendages are significantly reduced compared without VCM. Several different properties are demonstrated to obtain optimal VCM. Notch, band-pass and low-pass filters are implemented in the AMB system to reduce and cancel high frequency, dynamic bearing forces and motor torques due to flywheel mass imbalance.

40|$|The {{manuscript}} contains 29 double-spaced pages, 3 {{tables and}} 8 figures Basically, a reciprocating compressor {{consists of three}} main mechanical subsets: the hermetic housing, the crankcase and the rotor-crankshaft assembly. The counterweight mass located on the rotor-crankshaft is designed to balance the eccentric masses of the slider-crank mechanism which predominate {{in comparison to the}} residual distributed <b>unbalance</b> <b>masses</b> due to manufacturing. However, excessive vibration levels can be observed. The objective of the study is to perform a reliable finite element model for balancing the compressor by taking into account the dynamic behavior of the three subsets. The rotor-crankshaft assembly is considered as a flexible body, while the crankcase and the housing are assumed to be rigid. The rotor-crankshaft model is updated by using experimental modal analysis at rest. The characteristics of the fluid film bearings are speed of rotation dependant. The forces of the pressure and of the slider-crank mechanism are expanded by using Fourier transformation. The Influence Coefficient Method is used to investigate several balancing solutions to reduce the vibratory levels of the target plane located on the three main subsets. The experiments carried out show that this multi-stage balancing procedure is rather more efficient than a classical approach based only on the dynamic balancing of the rotor crankshaft assembly.

In this final project, main structure of milling machine is modelyzed using ANSYS Workbench 11. 0 to obtain dynamic behavior of milling machine. Modal analysis was carried out to obtain the natural frequencies and its mode shapes and harmonic response analysis was used to determine frequency response of the structure.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of the {{excessive}} vibration in rotating machines is the rotor <b>mass</b> <b>unbalance.</b> If a machine vibration due to <b>mass</b> <b>unbalance</b> exceeds the alarm limits, then it may lead to machine failure. Therefore, rotating machines should be regularly checked to ensure that they are properly balanced. Currently, industries use the influence coefficient (IC) balancing technique for in situ machine balancing. The accepted practice is to use the vibration measurements in both vertical and horizontal directions at the machine-bearing pedestals together with the tachometer signal to estimate the machine rotor <b>unbalance</b> (both <b>mass</b> and phase angle). It is generally believed that the use of the machine vibration measurements in the vertical and horizontal directions represents better machine dynamics, and hence the estimated unbalance is likely to be more accurate. However, this paper applies the same concept of the IC method but with a reduced number of vibration sensors (one sensor per bearing pedestal at 45 ° instead of two sensors at the vertical and horizontal directions). The use of one sensor per bearing pedestal at 45 ° from both vertical and horizontal directions is likely to have responses from both directions. The {{reduction in the number of}} sensors by half will definitely save the instruments and their maintenance cost and reduce the computational effort in the signal processing significantly. The proposed concept is applied on a small-size laboratory rig with two balancing planes. The paper presents the unbalance estimations by using the measured vibration responses in both the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously and using vibration responses measured at 45 °...|$|R
