40|$|Inflammation is {{a central}} {{component}} of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron promotes oxidative stress and inflammatory response in animals and promotes progressive CKD. Parenteral iron provokes oxidative stress in patients with CKD; however, its potential to provoke an inflammatory response is unknown. In 20 veterans with CKD, 100 mg iron sucrose was administered intravenously over 5 min and <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rate</b> and plasma concentration of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) were measured at timed intervals over 24 h. Patients were then randomized to placebo or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) 600 mg b. i. d. and the experiment was repeated at 1 week. Iron sucrose markedly increased plasma concentration and <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rate</b> of MCP- 1 at baseline and at 1 week visits (P< 0. 0001 for time effect). Urinary excretion peaked at 30 min and plasma concentration at 15 min. Plasma MCP- 1 concentration fell from 164 ± 17. 7 to 135 ± 17. 7 pg/ml with NAC, whereas it remained unchanged from 133 ± 12. 5 to 132 ± 17. 7 pg/ml with placebo (P= 0. 001 for visit × antioxidant drug interaction). There was a reduction in MCP- 1 <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rate</b> from visit 1 to 2.

40|$|A rapid, {{specific}} radioimmunoassay {{has been}} used to measure Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (TH glycoprotein) in urine. The apparent concentration increased with increasing dilution of urine in water, reaching a plateau at 1 in 20. This increase was greater the higher the osmolality and TH glycoprotein concentration and the lower the pH of the original sample. A dilution of 1 in 100 was chosen for routine assay. Whole urine was centrifuged and the dissolved precipitate and supernatant assayed to quantify the proportion of TH glycoprotein of TH glycoprotein initially present in highly aggregated form. This correlated positively and significantly with increasing osmolality, decreasing pH and increasing TH glycoprotein concentration. When the urine was diluted 1 in 100 in water, no TH glycoprotein was precipitated by centrifugation and the measured concentrations were unaffected by alterations of urine pH or calcium concentration or by addition of sodium dodecyl sulphate. Parallelism was demonstrated between the diluted samples and the disaggregated standard preparation. Recovery of added standard to diluted urine varied between 96 and 114 %.

It seems {{to be due to}} the fact that the velocity of absorption of the drug in digestive canals and the rate of acetylization in the bodies, when administered after meals, somewhat differ from pre-meal administration. After long period administration, no particular difference has been observed as compared with the data obtained in the initiatory period, insofar as the present experiments are concerned. The quantity of discharge in the faeces after administration of 10 g daily, devided into 5 doses, is relatively small, and the cumulation in the blood is also slight. Consequently, it seems to be a matter of course that the individual differences of <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rate,</b> mainly depend on the rate of retention in the organs, as well as the rate of acetylization. The highest blood PAS concentration, after intravenous injection is far higher than that after oral administration...|$|E
40|$|Background: In IRCU it is {{uncertain}} whether variation of urinary protein, especially non-albumin protein (N-Alb-P), {{is due to the}} presence of stones or reflects al-teration of oxidative metabolism. Aims: To validate in a tripartite cross-sectional study of 187 ambulatory male patients, undergoing a stan-dardized laboratory programme, whether stones im-pact on N-Alb-P or the state of oxidative metabolism interferes with IRCU pathophysiology. Methods: In part 1 the strata low and high of fasting <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rate</b> per 2 h of N-Alb-P, malonedi-aldehyde, hypoxanthine, xanthine, pH and other urine components were compared, and association with re-nal stones in situ evaluated; in part 2 the co-variatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} submaximal {{exercise}} on systemic nitric oxide (NO) formation, as assessed {{by measuring the}} <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rates</b> of NO- 3 and of cyclic GMP, were compared in 10 endurance-trained and 6 untrained male subjects. <b>Urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rates</b> of NO- 3 (by gas chromatography) and cyclic GMP (by radioimmunoassay) were assesse before and after a 30 min exercise test dlt 60 % of each subject's individual maximal work capacity in hourly intervals. <b>Urinary</b> NO- 3 <b>excretion</b> in untrained and trained subjects was comparable at rest (104 ± 35 vs. 110 ± 19 μmol/mmol creatinine, p=n. s.). It more than doubled during exercise in both groups (to 236 ± 88 μmol/mmol creatinine in untrained and to 252 ± 39 μmol/mmol creatinine in trained subjects, each p< 0. 01) and rapidly decreased to baseline within 2 hours after the test. Resting <b>urinary</b> cyclic GMP <b>excretion</b> was fourfold higher in the athletes than in the untrained subjects (21 ± 5 vs. 6 ± 1 nmol/mmol creatinine, p< 0. 05). During exercise it increased about twofold in both groups (to 52 ± 12 and 10 ± 1 nmol/mmol creatinine, respectively, each p< 0. 01), and returned to baseline after its end. There was a correlation between urinary cyclic GMP and NO- 3 excretion (p < 0. 05) in both groups. We conclude that acute submaximal exercise increases the formation of NO in man, as reflected by the increased <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> of NO- 3 and cyclic GMP. This {{may contribute to the}} vasodilation during physical exercise, and at least partly explain the beneficial effects of physical training in patients with cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|Vasopeptidase {{inhibition}} and Ang-(1 - 7) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. BackgroundOmapatrilat, a new vasopeptidase inhibitor, inhibits {{the activity}} of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 (NEP). Because these two enzymes participate in the degradation of the vasodilator and natriuretic peptide, angiotensin-(1 - 7) [Ang-(1 - 7) ], we assessed whether omapatrilat treatment is associated with changes in the plasma and <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rates</b> of the angiotensins. MethodsWe investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (0. 24 kg body weight) the effect of omapatrilat on plasma and urinary concentrations of angiotensin (Ang) I, Ang II and Ang-(1 - 7) during 17 days of administration of either the drug (N = 15, 100 μmol/kg/day) or vehicle (N = 14) in the drinking water. Hemodynamic and renal excretory function studies were associated with histological examination of the expression of Ang-(1 - 7) in the kidneys of both vehicle and omapatrilat-treated SHRs. ResultsOmapatrilat induced a sustained lowering of systolic blood pressure (- 68 mm Hg) without changes in cardiac rate. The mild positive water balance produced by omapatrilat did not cause natriuresis or kaliuresis, although it {{was associated with a}} significant decrease in urine osmolality. Blood pressure normalization was accompanied by increases in plasma Ang I (2969 %), Ang II (57 %), and Ang-(1 - 7) (163 %) levels, paralleling pronounced increases in <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rates</b> of Ang I and Ang-(1 - 7) but not Ang II. Detection of Ang-(1 - 7) immunostaining in the kidneys of five other SHR exposed either to vehicle (N = 3) or omapatrilat (N = 2) ascertained the source of the Ang-(1 - 7) found in the urine. Intense Ang-(1 - 7) staining, more pronounced in omapatrilat-treated SHR, was found in renal proximal tubules throughout the outer and inner regions of the renal cortex and the thick ascending loop of Henle, whereas no Ang-(1 - 7) -positive immunostaining was found in glomeruli and distal tubules. ConclusionsOmapatrilat antihypertensive effects caused significant activation of the renin-angiotensin system associated with increases in <b>urinary</b> <b>excretion</b> <b>rates</b> of Ang I and Ang-(1 - 7). Combined studies of Ang-(1 - 7) metabolism in urine and immunohistochemical studies in the kidney revealed the existence of an intrarenal source, which may account for the pronounced increase in the <b>excretion</b> <b>rate</b> of the vasodilator heptapeptide. These findings provide further evidence for a contribution of Ang-(1 - 7) to the regulation of renal function and blood pressure...|$|R
40|$|Increased <b>urinary</b> albumin <b>excretion</b> <b>rates</b> are {{associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations (1 — 3). In studies of microalbuminuria, it is of crucial importance to exclude other confounding factors that influence uri-nary albumin excretion. Bacteriuria {{is considered to be}} a potential cause of transient increased albuminuria (4, 5). The effect of bacte-rial growth in vitro has been tested and gross microbiological con-tamination of urine over a 14 day period at room temperature did not consistently affect albumin concentration (6). However, the im-pact of in vivo bacterial-contamination remains to be elucidated. It is remarkable that patients with bacteriuria are generally excluded from studies on microalbuminuria despite a lack of documentation on the subject. Furthermore, the exclusion criteria used in these studies are highly variable. Some authors demand a sterile urine (7). Others accept small numbers of bacteria (e. g. less than 108 / 1) or an urinary dipstick with a negative test for leukocytes (8). In several studies, the possible influence of urinary tract infection has not been considered. A consensus concerning bacterial growth and <b>urinary</b> albumin <b>excretion</b> would be desirable. In order to evaluate the influence of bacteriuria on the <b>urinary</b> albu-min <b>excretion</b> <b>rate</b> we have examined 524 timed overnight urine samples obtained from 389 patients attending a medical out-patient Tab. 1 <b>Urinary</b> albumin <b>excretion</b> <b>rate</b> related to different cate-gories of bacterial growth in the urine Tab. 2 <b>Urinary</b> albumin <b>excretion</b> <b>rate</b> in healthy subjects with more than 108 bacteria per litre before and after antibiotic treatment Urine samples with no bacterial growth Urine samples with bacterial growth: total 107 bacteria per litre 108 bacteria per litre> 108 bacteria per litre No. of urine sample...|$|R
