40|$|Urban {{trees are}} a {{dominant}} natural element in cities; they provide important ecosystem services to urban citizens and help urban areas adapt to climate change. Many rationales {{have been proposed}} to provide a purpose for <b>urban</b> forest <b>management,</b> {{some of which have}} been ineffective in addressing important ecological and social management themes. Among these rationales we find a values-based perspective, which sees management as a process where the desires of urban dwellers are met. Another perspective is climate change adaptation, which sees management as a process where urban forest vulnerability to climate change is reduced and resilience enhanced. Both these rationales have the advantage of complementing, enhancing, and broadening <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> objectives. A critical analysis of the literature on public values related to urban forests and climate change adaptation in the context of urban forests is undertaken to discuss what it means to adopt these two issues in <b>urban</b> forest <b>management.</b> The analysis suggests that by seeing <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> as a process by which public values are satisfied and urban-forest vulnerabilities to climate change are reduced, we can place issues such as naturalization, adaptive management, and engaging people in management at the centre of <b>urban</b> forest <b>management.</b> Focusing <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> on these issues may help ensure the success of programs focused on planting more trees and increasing citizen participation in <b>urban</b> forest <b>management.</b> <b>Urban</b> forest management; Urban forest values; Climate adaptation; Climate vulnerabilit...|$|R
40|$|<b>Urban</b> water <b>management</b> {{involves}} <b>urban</b> {{water supply}} (import, treatment {{and distribution of}} water), <b>urban</b> wastewater <b>management</b> (collection, treatment and disposal of urban sewage) and <b>urban</b> storm water <b>management.</b> Declining groundwater tables, polluted and declining sources of water, water scarcity in urban areas, unsatisfactory urban {{water supply and sanitation}} situation, pollution of receiving water bodies (including the ground water), and urban floods have become the concerns and issues of sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management.</b> This paper proposes a model for urban stormwater and sewage management which addresses these concerns and issues of sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management.</b> This model proposes segregation of the sewage into black water and greywater, and urban sub-watershed level stormwater-greywater management systems. During dry weather this system will be handling only the greywater and making the latter available as reclaimed water for reuse in place of the fresh water supply. During wet weather, the system will be taking care of (collection and treatment) both the storm water and the greywater, and the excess of the treated water will be disposed off through groundwater recharging. Application of this model in the Patiala city, Punjab, INDIA for selected urban sub-watersheds has been tried. Information and background data required for the conceptualization and design of the sub-watershed level <b>urban</b> stormwater-greywater <b>management</b> system was collected and the system has been designed for one of the sub-watersheds in the Patiala city.

Pelourinho and Carmo came subsequently, created {{as a consequence of the}} growing need of space that the religious orders had. With the rapid expansion, the neighborhoods grew and many of them were clustered in the same area, so today there are not accurate records as to their exact number. For <b>urban</b> <b>management</b> purposes, the city is currently divided on 17 political-administrative zones. However, due to their very cultural relevance and to postal conveniences, the importance of the neighborhoods of Salvador remains intact.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{urban forest}} is a diverse and dynamic {{resource}} that is {{inextricably linked to}} the surrounding community. A comprehensive <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> plan helps communities create a shared vision and develop a set of goals and actions that serve as a municipality's guide for management. Using content analysis and an evaluative framework, {{this study examined the}} comprehensiveness of 39 <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> plans in Washington State. Nearly all plans address the management of trees, but few plans specifically address the community's role in <b>urban</b> forest <b>management.</b> Public participation in the plan writing process significantly influenced the overall comprehensiveness of the plans, supporting the claim that <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> should be an inclusive, community-wide process. Most Washington plans lack detailed implementation guidelines and nearly all plans lack a written strategy for monitoring and measuring performance. Plan content varies depending on municipalities' unique management objectives, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate in the development of an <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> plan. However, the results suggest that an adaptable framework and set of criteria would be useful to municipalities as they plan for managing this diverse and complex resource...|$|R

40|$|Climate change, {{urbanisation}} {{and land}} subsidence increase {{the vulnerability of}} urban areas to flooding and droughts. Despite the availability of reliable and cost effective technologies, the actual implementation remains limited to small scale demonstration projects. Part 1 of this thesis describes how innovations in <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> can contribute to reduce the vulnerability of cities. Examples are the use of local water resources, the urban surface water as energy source and floating urbanization. Next to showing the technical feasibility, observations are made {{from the perspective of}} an action researcher on factors that contribute to the application and mainstreaming of these innovations. Part 2 of this thesis complements the case study specific view ‘from the inside’ with a perspective ‘from the outside’. To unravel the mechanisms of technology application in <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> this study included a literature survey, in-depth interviews, discussions, seminars, workshops and a national web-based survey on innovation among urban water managers. This thesis brings together the results of these activities. The study identifies two key conditions for application of urban water innovations in practice.

40|$|Sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> is an {{increasingly}} important socio-political objective, however implementation remains ad hoc. While numerous tools and technologies {{have been developed to}} achieve sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management,</b> significant socio-institutional barriers remain. These impediments include, among others, institutional fragmentation, poor political leadership and technological lock-in. Exacerbated by a lack of theory and conceptual frameworks to link sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> principles with on-ground execution, these barriers contribute to low levels of system-wide implementation capacity. Institutional capacity building is advocated in the sustainable urban water literature as a strategy to facilitate implementation; however, institutional capacity building has limited ability to provide an overview of regime operation, considered critical for enabling system-wide change. Focusing on processes, actor agency and institutions, the field of governance studies provides a useful perspective for understanding holistic regime operation and change. Yet the environmental governance literature remains contested; many scholars support a network or market governance approach while others advocate for hybrid approaches. Moreover, the governance systems needed for enabling sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> have been given limited attention. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to develop a guiding framework for sustainable urban water governance. Through an emergent research design, systematically drawing on the perspectives of scholars and leading Australian urban water sustainability practitioners, likely attributes of a sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> regime were identified. The attributes were focused through the lens of individual, organisational, inter-organisational relationships, and administrative and regulatory regime components. A comparison of the scholarly and practitioner perspectives, together with governance, regime and institutional literatures, explored which governance modes are most likely to enable sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management.</b> Overall, this investigation revealed a suite of likely sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> regime attributes that are substantially different from traditional and contemporary practice highlighting the considerable regime change required to enable sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management.</b> The scholars supported a network governance approach, similar to current adaptive governance and conceptual scholarly <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> projections, with interdependent actor relations and largely informal administrative arrangements. In comparison, the practitioners advocated hybrid governance arrangements comprising hierarchical and network modes, including a formal administrative framework, with mutually dependent and interconnected actor relationships to facilitate implementation of site specific sustainable <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> solutions. Both scholars and practitioners supported using a variety of policy instruments, including market governance instruments. The outcomes of this investigation suggest the hybrid governance approach supported by practitioners extends current scholarship by providing detailed information on regime attributes and operation, which can provide insight for practical implementation of network governance approaches which are supported in current <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> and adaptive governance literature. Additionally, the hybrid approach offers suggestions for successfully integrating the three ideal governance modes and reducing potential tension among the modes. In practice, the proposed framework could be used to design capacity building programs and policy initiatives drawing on mixed governance approaches. To extend this research and improve insight into regime operation and governance dynamics, future research testing the tentative sustainable urban water governance framework in other locations is required...|$|R
