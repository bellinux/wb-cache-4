5|$|Pelvic and vaginal <b>ultrasounds</b> {{are helpful}} in the {{diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, <b>ultrasounds,</b> or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than <b>ultrasounds.</b> Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E
5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or <b>ultrasounds</b> is generally not needed.|$|E

30|$|<b>Ultrasound</b> {{training}} {{in medical school}} is not ubiquitous despite references of <b>ultrasound</b> being the stethoscope of the twenty-first century. The technology has outpaced the current education, and this <b>ultrasound</b> program was developed to provide an experience and exposure to <b>ultrasound</b> during medical school. The medical student <b>ultrasound</b> digital portfolio is a means for students to collate their <b>ultrasound</b> experience and have documentation of their exams in a digital format as proof of <b>ultrasound</b> experience for residency. Graded <b>ultrasound</b> exposure for medical students allows repeated opportunities to become comfortable with the <b>ultrasound</b> equipment and the protocols for scanning patients. Students are given direct feedback and suggestions for improvement by the proctors and facilitators at each hands-on session. Students were also assessed {{by a combination of}} online quizzes (optional and required depending on the particular program), written exams, and practical hands-on exams which allow for a more standardized evaluation of the students' knowledge and provide a gauge for each student to monitor their progress. The primary proctors for the various <b>ultrasound</b> programs are directly trained by the <b>Ultrasound</b> Director. Med 4 students in the Honors <b>Ultrasound</b> course have completed 3 [*]years of <b>ultrasound</b> training under the mentorship of the <b>Ultrasound</b> Director and work with the EM residents who also receive one-on-one teaching and instruction from the <b>Ultrasound</b> Director as well as utilize the same online resources for educational enhancement. This creates uniformity and consistency in the educational methods used for instruction. By each instructor teaching consistent <b>ultrasound</b> techniques throughout the various <b>ultrasound</b> programs, the repetition provides for more efficient teaching.|$|R

25|$|Ultrasound-assisted {{extractive}} electrospray ionization {{mass spectrometry}} (EESI-MS) {{has been developed}} at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) by Zhu et al., (2008) for a rapid detection of melamine in untreated food samples. <b>Ultrasounds</b> are used to nebulize the melamine-containing liquids into a fine spray. The spray is then ionised by extractive electrospray ionisation (EESI) and analysed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). An analysis requires 30 seconds per sample. The limit of detection of melamine is a few nanograms of melamine per gram of milk.|$|E
25|$|Brown rats {{are capable}} of {{producing}} ultrasonic vocalizations. As pups, young rats use different types of ultrasonic cries to elicit and direct maternal search behavior, {{as well as to}} regulate their mother's movements in the nest. Although pups will produce <b>ultrasounds</b> around any other rats at 7 days old, by 14 days old they significantly reduce ultrasound production around male rats as a defensive response. Adult rats will emit ultrasonic vocalizations in response to predators or perceived danger; the frequency and duration of such cries depends on the sex and reproductive status of the rat. The female rat will also emit ultrasonic vocalizations during mating.|$|E
30|$|It {{appears that}} {{interest}} in <b>ultrasound</b> in medical education {{will continue to}} grow and more schools nationally and globally will integrate <b>ultrasound</b> into their curricula. At present there is no consensus curriculum for <b>ultrasound</b> education. There are two organizations, however, that have joined forces to conduct an international consensus conference on <b>ultrasound</b> education. The Society of <b>Ultrasound</b> in Medical Education (SUSME) is an academic society committed to fostering collaboration and communication across multiple disciplines to promote <b>ultrasound</b> education globally [56]. SUSME has hosted three conferences on Anatomy and Physiology <b>Ultrasound</b> Education and with the World Interactive Network Focused on Critical <b>Ultrasound</b> (WINFOCUS) has hosted three World Congresses on <b>Ultrasound</b> in Medical Education [57]. WINFOCUS has been a world leader in promoting point-of-care <b>ultrasound</b> practice and has hosted multiple International Consensus Conferences to better define <b>ultrasound</b> use and establish standards in critical areas of medical practice [58 – 60]. Together these two organizations are well-positioned for the important task of undertaking a global consensus process among <b>ultrasound</b> education and practice leaders from multiple disciplines, organizations, and regulatory bodies to help define essential elements of <b>ultrasound</b> education.|$|R

25|$|Because {{ultrasound}} imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), {{they are generally}} considered safer {{and are therefore more}} common in obstetrical imaging. The progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed, allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies. Growth can be assessed over time, important in patients with chronic disease or pregnancy-induced disease, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.). Color-flow Doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart, heart valves and major vessels. Stenosis, for example, of the carotid arteries may be a warning sign for an impending stroke. A clot, embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs, can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs, resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. <b>Ultrasounds</b> is useful as a guide to performing biopsies to minimise damage to surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis.
