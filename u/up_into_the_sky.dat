25|$|The Dark-Sky Association {{was started}} {{to reduce the}} light going <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> which reduces {{visibility}} of stars (see Skyglow below). This is any light which is emitted more than 90° above nadir. By limiting light at this 90° mark they have also reduced the light output in the 80–90° range which creates most of the light trespass issues.|$|E
25|$|The world tree, {{with its}} {{branches}} reaching <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and roots {{deep into the}} earth, {{can be seen to}} dwell in three worlds - a link between heaven, the earth, and the underworld, uniting above and below. This great tree acts as an Axis mundi, supporting or holding up the cosmos, and providing a link between the heavens, earth, and underworld. In European mythology, the best-known example is the tree Yggdrasil from Norse mythology.|$|E
25|$|The film {{ends with}} a montage of {{characters}} who stop {{in the middle of}} everyday chores to look <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Dixieland music is once again played as the camera is put on the wing of an airplane. A large formation of B-52 bombers appears {{in front of the camera}} as they fly menacingly in over a large city. This bookends with the opening scene where a man wakes up and tells the audience that he had a nightmare about bombers coming.|$|E

25|$|In {{one of the}} tales, {{the demon}} traps Rostam while the hero is asleep, and carries him <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> He then asks Rostam whether he would prefer to be thrown upon a mountain, or into the sea. Rostam, aware that the demon's mind is perverse (cf. In the Pahlavi texts above), asks to be thrown upon a mountain, and the demon in {{response}} throws him into the sea. Rescuing himself from the waters, Rostam recovers his horse and confronts the demon again, subsequently beheading it.|$|E
25|$|Starting March 11, 2002, eighty-eight {{searchlights}} {{were installed}} and arranged to form two beams of light shooting straight <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> This {{was called the}} Tribute in Light, and was originally lit every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, the lights were lit on the two-year anniversary of the attack and have been lit on each subsequent September 11 since then. In February 2005, the New York City Medical Examiner's office ended its process of identifying human remains at the site.|$|E
25|$|After a while, the {{old lady}} {{returned}} to the cave and noticed Yūkei's departure, whereupon her appearance transformed into that of a fearsome onibaba and then started to give chase at a furious speed. The onibaba caught up and was right behind Yūkei. In this time of desperation, Yūkei took out his statue of Nyoirin Kan'non Bosatsu (a form of Guanyin) from his pack and started to desperately chant a sutra. As he did so, the Bosatsu statue started to dance <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> forming a shining demon-slaying pure white bow and a vajra (indestructible substance) arrow that shot and slew the onibaba.|$|E
5000|$|These are not kasa-obake, but in folktales, as an {{umbrella}} yōkai, in the Higashiuwa region, Ehime Prefecture, {{there is a}} story that a rain umbrella would appear in valleys on rainy nights, and those who see it would cower {{and not be able to}} move their feet. Also, in Mizokuchi, Tottori Prefecture (now Hōki, Saihaku District), there is a yōkai called yūreigasa (幽霊傘, [...] "ghost umbrella") that has one eye and one foot like the kasa-obake, but it is said that on days of strong wind, they would blow people <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skies.</b>|$|R

25|$|Impressive {{groves of}} {{turpentine}} (Syncarpia glomulifera) and blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) trees {{may be seen}} growing straight <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> forming an open canopy with widely spaced trunks. In these characteristic areas they are generally considered open forest, {{they may have a}} grassy understory, a sclerophyll shrubbery or alternatively they may have a rainforest subcanopy or a rainforest understory with growth being densest nearest to the valley floor or permanent watercourses. In these turpentine forests often hundreds of cabbage palms (Livistona australis) may be seen growing in dense tall thickets which are rarely touched by fire or they may exist as young plants in open grassy spaces which are burnt regularly enough not to form visible trunks. Rainforest pockets are dominated by jackwood and sassafras. The lilli pilli (Acmena smithii) produces a fruit edible raw. Another common species is the coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum) which were used extensively from Australian rainforests to manufacture horse-drawn coaches.|$|E
500|$|A {{reflective}} {{stainless steel}} panel with a diapering pattern curves around the L-shaped building and an [...] "urban curve" [...] of zinc wraps the main theater {{at the front}} of the building, contrasting with the brick walls of the school, the design and materials of which reflect those used in the building's neighborhood. The box office is a red, smokestack-shaped structure that projects a beam of light <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> The four-story, disabled accessible building of [...] combines arts and academic spaces on each floor, arranged by grade, with the youngest students on the lowest floor. The main entrance features student sculptures selected by contest. An [...] "Avenue of the Arts", with gallery space for more student artwork, links the 750-seat main Corbett Theater, the 350-seat Mayerson Theater, and a 120-seat black box theater. The Corbett Theater has an [...] stage, a hydraulically operated orchestra pit, and is acoustically isolated from the rest of the building. An outdoor amphitheater is also planned.|$|E
500|$|On the November 3 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, the Hardys {{successfully}} defended their titles against The Tribunal. After the match, the Hardys {{were attacked by}} the masked trio known as Death Crew Council (DCC), with Matt later suffered (kayfabe) amnesia after being knocked off a forklift {{by one of the}} DCC members. On the December 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, Matt returned to the ring, ambushing DCC by using their entrance theme; he would accept DCC's title challenge. The Hardys faced Bram and Kingston, and Matt would pin Kingston to retain the titles. In the following weeks, the Hardys would issue an open challenge for the tag team titles. On December 15, during special episode [...] "Total Nonstop Deletion", they were once again successful in retaining. Brother Nero hit Crazzy Steve with the Twist of Fate, who then fell into a volcano (that had appeared on the compound in the weeks leading up the event), and was shot <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> landing in the ring. Matt then covered him to win the match. Hardy had previously debuted the Itchweeed character earlier in the episode, defeating Chet Sterling.|$|E

60|$|In about {{a second}} I {{begun to see}} I'd woke up a pretty ugly customer, Peters. In less than ten seconds that comet was just a blazing cloud of red-hot canvas.

Neither can anybody begin to describe the way that monstrous craft begun to crash along. And such another powwow--thousands of bo's'n's whistles screaming at once, and a crew like the populations of a hundred thousand worlds like ours all swearing at once. Well, I never heard the like of it before.|$|R

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Insane Clown Posse albums, The Tempest is {{not connected}} to the Dark Carnival mythology, which {{formed the basis for}} ICP's [...] "Joker's Cards" [...] series, which began in 1992 with Carnival of Carnage and concluded with the albums [...] and Hell's Pit; however, it references themes, concepts and songs from previous albums. Joseph Bruce (Violent J) said that The Tempest is a concept album in its own right. Bruce describes the album's concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls people into a hurricane as well as a roller coaster. According to Bruce, [...] "That's a lot like riding on a violent roller coaster, I'd assume. You get jerked to the left, jerked to the right, sucked way <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and then you go shooting down to the floor, and then you jerk up to the left and then you whip around to the right. Well, The Tempest is a storm {{in the form of a}} roller coaster." [...] As a result of this concept, the album focuses on a variety of different moods.|$|E
500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{on the high seas}} in the Caribbean during the 17th century during a {{conflict}} among colonists. When a major event occurs, Mike hears the sound of a typewriter in the sky. Mike's reality literally changes each time the author makes a change to the story. Mike realizes that during times when he hears the audible sounds of the typewriter, his actions and words are not of his own volition, and when such sounds are absent he is able to make decisions for himself. Mike {{falls in love with a}} woman in the story, and grows frustrated after realizing that she is just another of Hackett's fictional creations. At the end of the work, Mike returns to New York, and is left with lingering doubts whether he is still a character in someone else's story. He muses whether a [...] "typewriter in the sky" [...] is creating the world. Mike looks <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> in search of this mystical device or its controller: [...] "Abruptly Mike de Wolfe stopped. His jaw slackened a trifle and his hand went up to his mouth to cover it. His eyes were fixed upon the fleecy clouds which scurried across the moon. Up there– God? In a dirty bathrobe?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Battlefield" [...] was {{directed}} by Philip Andelman [...] and filmed at the Golden Oak Ranch in California. On June 3, 2009, a thirty-second preview of the video was released online. The complete video premiered online on June 7, 2009. The video begins with a shot of a black car parked {{in the middle of}} a field. Sparks appears to be sitting in a car, dressed in black, as she sings the first verse. Intercut scenes of Sparks laying down in the field wearing a white dress are then shown. During the second verse, she exits the car and walks towards the camera. As the second chorus kicks in, Sparks is surrounded by smoke. During the song's bridge, she warns her love interest to get his armour, as she appears to be surrounded by flashing lights and smoke. Then intercut scenes of Sparks singing into the camera in front of a black backdrop are shown. The video then shows Sparks lifting her right arm in the air as missiles shoot <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> The video ends by showing Sparks covered in smoke. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the video shows that Sparks is [...] "definitely growing up". Maura of Idolator wrote that the video [...] "is a simple affair that allows her to get into maximum drama mode." ...|$|E
60|$|She leant {{back on a}} thick heather bush as she spoke, and indulged {{herself in}} that most enjoyable and restful of occupations, on a bright warm day, namely, looking {{straight}} <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sunny <b>sky</b> and contemplating <b>the</b> soft fleecy clouds that float there, changing their forms slowly but continually.|$|R
50|$|Prisons are {{designed}} around {{the fact that}} the strings reach <b>up</b> endlessly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Rather than cells, the prisoners are confined underneath huge horizontal grids, and the range of mobility allowed by their strings is limited by small square openings in the grid through which the strings are inserted and locked within.|$|R
60|$|And if {{the story}} of Moses had been of man's invention, we should have heard--I think, from what we know of the fables, 'myths' as they call them now, which nations have invented about themselves, and their own early history, we may guess fairly what we should have heard--how Moses brought <b>the</b> Jews <b>into</b> <b>the</b> land of Canaan, and {{established}} his laws, and reigned over them, and died in honour and great glory--if he died at all, and was not taken <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skies,</b> and changed <b>into</b> a star, or into a god; {{and how he was}} buried with great pomp; and how his sepulchre did remain among the Jews until that day; and probably how men worshipped at it, and miracles were worked at it, and so forth.|$|R
500|$|To {{close the}} film, Disney wanted {{for a piece}} that was [...] "emotionally equivalent" [...] to the Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria {{segments}} that closed Fantasia. Disney chose The Firebird as the piece to use after [...] "half a dozen" [...] others were scrapped, including Symphony No. 9 by Beethoven and the [...] "Hallelujah Chorus" [...] from Messiah by Handel. Disney thought {{of the idea of}} the Earth's destruction and renewal after passing Mount St. Helens following its eruption in 1980. French twins Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi from Disney's Paris studio were hired to direct the segment. The Sprite is a Dryad-like creature from Greek mythology. Her form changes six times; she is introduced as a Water Sprite who plants flowers as a Flower Sprite. She becomes a Neutral Sprite where her growth trail stops and an Ash Sprite when the forest has been destroyed. The segment ends with her as a Rain-Wave Sprite, followed by the Grass Sprite. The segment originally ended with the Sprite {{in the form of a}} flowing river that rises <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and transforms into a Sun Sprite, but this was abandoned. The antlers on the elk were produced with CGI and placed on top of its body that was drawn traditionally. The segment was produced using Houdini animation software.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of episode two onwards, {{as part of the}} opening credits, Mr. Bean falls from the sky in a beam of light, accompanied by a choir singing Ecce homo qui est faba ("Behold the man who is a bean"), recorded by Southwark Cathedral Choir in 1990. These opening sequences were initially in black and white in episodes two and three, and were intended by the producers to show his status as an [...] "ordinary man cast into the spotlight". However, later episodes showed Mr. Bean dropping from the night sky in a deserted London street against the backdrop of St Paul's Cathedral. At the end of episodes three and six he is also shown being sucked right back <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> in the respective background scenes (black scene in episode 3 and street scene in episode 6). Atkinson has acknowledged that Bean [...] "has a slightly alien aspect to him". In an episode of the animated series, [...] "Double Trouble", the alien aspect of him was used in a storyline, in which he is taken inside a spacecraft with [...] "aliens" [...] who look exactly like him and even have their own plushy toys. In an obvious homage towards the end, the aliens send him back home in a beam of light and music similar to the opening of the original Mr. Bean series. Whether Bean is an extraterrestrial is not made clear.|$|E
500|$|The Jet VTOL {{ship from}} Ultramans Science Patrol descends {{out of the}} sky toward Earth, as a school girl, {{carrying}} her randoseru, observes from behind a tree. The Science Patrol offer the girl a cup of water and ask her to deliver it to [...] "DAICON". The girl salutes and races away, but she quickly experiences trouble as Punk Dragon blocks her path. He summons a mecha from Starship Troopers, and it and the girl begin battling. The girl tosses the mecha aside and Gomora rises from the earth. Using a booster concealed in her backpack, the girl flies <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and evades Gomora's blast, with the mecha flying after her. They continue their battle in mid-air. A blow from the mecha sends the girl falling, imperiling her cup of water. At the last moment, she has a vision of the Science Patrol and regains consciousness. She snatches the cup before it crashes to the ground. Resuming her battle with the mecha, she catches one of its missiles and hurls it back at the mecha, causing a huge explosion. The destroyed mecha launches a rocket, summoning Godzilla with the Ideon symbol. With King Ghidorah and Gamera chasing her, the girl flies through the air with her jet-propelled backpack. A Star Destroyer, a TIE fighter, and Martian fighting machines from the film The War of the Worlds (1953) cross the background. Reaching into her backpack, the girl pulls out a bamboo ruler, which magically becomes a lightsaber. After slicing an Alien Baltan in half, the girl launches a number of miniature missiles from her backpack. Hit by one of the missiles, a Maser Tank from the Godzilla series catches fire. The Atragon breaks in two as the Yamato, the USS Enterprise, an X-wing fighter and Daimajin explode in complete chaos. The girl pours her cup of water on a shriveled daikon buried in the ground. As the daikon absorbs the water, it turns into the spaceship Daicon. Bathed in light, and now wearing a naval uniform, the girl boards the ship, where the film's producers, Toshio Okada and Yasuhiro Takeda, sit at the controls. As the landing gear retracts, Daicon departs for {{the far reaches of the}} universe.|$|E

After a little he said: 'I must see the sun again--the sun!' and the next moment he was feverishly calling: 'China! Give me China--Peking!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Eichendorff {{summed up}} the Romantic epoch stating that it [...] "soared like a {{magnificent}} rocket sparkling <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and after shortly and wonderfully lighting up the night, it exploded overhead into a thousand colorful stars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Apocryphal {{accounts}} {{concerning the}} Lost Tribes, based {{to varying degrees}} on biblical accounts, have been produced by both Jews and Christians {{since at least the}} 17th century. An Ashkenazi Jewish tradition speaks of these tribes as Die Roite Yiddelech, [...] "The little red Jews", cut {{off from the rest of}} Jewry by the legendary river Sambation, [...] "whose foaming waters raise high <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> a wall of fire and smoke that is impossible to pass through".|$|E
2500|$|The English poet Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a work {{sometime}} around 1380 {{in which the}} poet himself is carried by an eagle <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> near to the stars, to {{a place called the}} House of Fame, where he finds ancient writers and poets such as Orpheus and Simon Magus still living. The eagle then takes Geoffrey to a strange building built of [...] "twigges" [...] that revolves so frighteningly that the poet fears that even the eagle will have difficulty landing him safely into it; the building flies through the air like a stone ball from a siege engine. But the eagle carries Geoffrey safely into this revolving house and the poem ends in an ellipsis.|$|E
60|$|Towards the north, the Mausoleum of Augustus, towering proudly <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{brilliant}} <b>sky,</b> at once {{attracts the}} attention.
