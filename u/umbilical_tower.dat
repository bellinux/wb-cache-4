These arms carry electrical, hydraulic, {{environmental}} control, and other support functions to the vehicle through umbilical lines. The swing arms retract at T-0 seconds {{to prevent them from}} hitting the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|NASA stacked or {{assembled}} the Saturn V on a Mobile Launcher Platform (MLP), {{which consisted of}} a Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> (LUT) with nine swing arms (including the crew access arm), a [...] "hammerhead" [...] crane, and a water suppression system which was activated prior to launch. After assembly was completed, the entire stack was moved from the VAB to the launch pad using the Crawler Transporter (CT). Built by the Marion Power Shovel company (and later used for transporting the smaller and lighter Space Shuttle), the CT ran on four double-tracked treads, each with 57 'shoes'. Each shoe weighed [...] This transporter was also required to keep the rocket level as it traveled the [...] to the launch site, especially at the 3 percent grade encountered at the launch pad. The CT also carried the Mobile Service Structure (MSS), which allowed technicians access to the rocket until eight hours before launch, when it {{was moved to the}} [...] "halfway" [...] point on the Crawlerway (the junction between the VAB and the two launch pads).|$|E
50|$|Finally, a new 240 ft <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> and Block II {{swing arm}} {{were used for}} the first time in {{preparation}} for future Block II Saturn I flights.|$|E
50|$|Several {{facilities}} {{have been proposed}} to be built at the Third Launch Pad. They include a vehicle assembly building, mobile pedestals, <b>umbilical</b> <b>towers,</b> emergency exits, ground escape system, crew ingress and egress systems, safety bunkers, material handling equipment and related electrical systems.|$|R
50|$|The legacy Atlas-Centaur <b>umbilical</b> <b>towers</b> of both pads were {{demolished}} in 2006. The {{mobile service}} towers were both demolished in controlled explosions on June 16, 2007. Tower B was demolished at 13:59 GMT (09:59 EDT) and tower A followed twelve minutes later at 14:11 (10:11 EDT).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{removal of the}} <b>umbilical</b> <b>towers,</b> each Shuttle-era MLP was extensively reconfigured {{with the addition of}} two Tail Service Masts, one {{on either side of the}} Main Engine exhaust vent. These 31 ft masts contained the feed lines through which liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) were loaded into the shuttle's external fuel tank, as well as electrical hookups and flares that were used to burn off any ambient hydrogen vapors at the launch site immediately prior to Main Engine start.|$|R
50|$|MLP-3, {{the oldest}} of the three Apollo-era launch structures, also {{underwent}} extensive remodeling for use with the shuttle. These modifications included the removal of the <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower,</b> the reconfiguring of three exhaust holes, and amendments to the electrical and mechanical ground support systems.|$|E
50|$|Beside {{the vehicle}} is a Fixed <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> (FUT), which has two (VAFB) or three (CCAFS) swing arms. These arms carry electrical, hydraulic, {{environmental}} control, and other support functions to the vehicle through umbilical lines. The swing arms retract at T-0 seconds {{to prevent them from}} hitting the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The Crawlerway was {{designed}} to support {{the weight of a}} Saturn V rocket and payload, plus its Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> and Mobile Launcher Platform, atop a Crawler-transporter during the Apollo Program. It was used from 1981 - 2011 to transport the lighter Space Shuttles to their launch pads.|$|E
50|$|LC-12's first launch was Atlas 10A on January 10, 1958. During {{the second}} half of the year, a larger <b>umbilical</b> service <b>tower</b> was built in {{preparation}} for the C series Atlas tests, flown from December 1958 to August 1959.|$|R
50|$|On 24 September 1959, {{the first}} Atlas-Able, 9C, {{exploded}} during a static firing test at LC-12, after a turbopump {{on one of}} the engines failed triggering a complete engine shutdown. The damaged turbopump continued to allow oxidizer to flow, feeding the fire beneath the vehicle. About a minute later the rocket suffered a structural failure, collapsed and exploded. The entire service <b>tower</b> and both <b>umbilical</b> <b>towers</b> were knocked over and the concrete launch stand caved in. Because damage to LC-12 was so extensive, it did not host another launch until Missile 56D in May 1960. The large service tower was not rebuilt following the explosion of Atlas 9C. It then hosted more ICBM tests along with the second and third Atlas Able probes.|$|R
5000|$|The Saturn IB {{was used}} between 1973 and 1975 for three manned Skylab flights, and one Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight. This final {{production}} run {{did not have}} alternating black and white S-IB stage tanks, or vertical stripes on the S-IVB aft tank skirt, which were present on the earlier vehicles. Since LC-34 and 37 were inactive by then, these launches utilized Kennedy Space Center's LC-39B. Mobile Launcher Platform No. 1 was modified, adding an elevated platform known as the [...] "milkstool" [...] to accommodate the height differential between the Saturn IB and the much larger Saturn V. This enabled alignment of the Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower's</b> access arms to accommodate crew access, fueling, and ground electrical connections for the Apollo spacecraft and S-IVB upper stage. The tower's second stage access arms were modified to service the S-IB first stage.|$|R
50|$|Once all {{the various}} {{components}} had been installed on the Saturn V, it {{was moved to the}} launch site, Launch Complex 39A. During late June and early July 1971, the rocket and Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> (LUT) were struck by lightning at least four times. All was well however, with only minor damage suffered.|$|E
50|$|The {{concrete}} pad measures about 50 feet m wide {{by about}} 100 feet m long and could support the combined {{weight of a}} fueled launch vehicle, payload and customer-provided launch mount up to about 132,000 lbs kg, and an <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> structure, fluid lines, cables and umbilical arms weighing up to about 47,000 lbs kg.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the launch}} of Skylab, ML-1 was the last Mobile Launcher to be {{converted}} {{for use by the}} Space Shuttle. The Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> and Milkstool were dismantled and placed into storage, and the base of the launch platform was modified to accommodate the locations of engines on the shuttle. The platform was redesignated MLP-3.|$|E
50|$|On September 24, the Atlas was {{prepared}} for a planned 12-minute PFRT (Pre-Flight Readiness Test). The satellite {{was not on the}} launch vehicle, the third stage was a dummy, and the second stage was unfueled. After 2.5 seconds of engine operation, a fire erupted in the Atlas's thrust section. Fed by leaking liquid oxygen, it proved impossible to put out with pad extinguishers and soon a huge inferno was raging on LC-12. Thirty-seven seconds after the fire began, the Atlas toppled over in a massive fireball, the biggest explosion seen at Cape Canaveral up to that point. The pad was severely damaged, with both <b>umbilical</b> <b>towers</b> totally destroyed, the concrete launch stand caved in, and the service tower knocked over. It would take months of repairs to get it back online. The final explosion was believed {{to be the result of}} loss of tank pressure. Engine shutdown caused the propellant valves to snap shut, causing overpressurization of the propellant tanks. Ground operators in the blockhouse flipped manual override switches to lower RP-1 pressure and increase LOX pressure, but the missile did not respond, possibly due to fire-induced damage to the control wiring on the pad. The pneumatic control system automatically threw open the LOX boil-off valve to vent tank pressure, which apparently continued until the tanks lost support pressure to the point where their structural integrity failed. At around 35 seconds, the intermediate bulkhead collapsed, causing the LOX to fall into the RP-1 tank and mix. The propellants turned into a gel that detonated with the force of 20,000 pounds (9070 kg) of TNT and resulted in an extremely powerful explosion that caused extensive pad damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{launch of}} Samos 3 {{occurred}} at 19:28 UTC on 9 September 1961. An Atlas LV-3A Agena-B rocket was used, flying from Launch Complex 1-1 at the Point Arguello Naval Air Station. At {{the moment of}} liftoff, one of the launch <b>tower</b> <b>umbilicals</b> detached 0.21 seconds late. This tripped a switch in the Atlas and caused it to change from internal to external power. The booster's engines shut off and it fell back onto the pad and exploded, destroying the satellite and causing extensive pad damage. Samos 3 was to have operated in a Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit, {{at an altitude of}} 480 km and with 83 degrees of inclination. The satellite had a mass of around 1900 kg, and was designed to operate for around four months.Damage to SLC3 mainly affected electrical and plumbing components and repair work began almost immediately. The pad was back online to host the launch of Samos 4 in November. Samos 3 was the last DOD-related launch to be unclassified, and afterwards, much greater secrecy would be put around such flights.|$|R
5000|$|Unmanned and manned rockets {{such as the}} Delta, Saturn V {{also used}} fixed and mobile service {{structure}} configurations with the mobile portion {{moved away from the}} vehicle several hours before launch. The Saturn's [...] "fixed service structure", however, was formally called the launch <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> (LUT) and was fixed to a Mobile Launcher Platform.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the launch}} of Apollo 17, ML-3 {{was the first of}} the Mobile Launchers to be {{converted}} for use by the Space Shuttle. The Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> was dismantled and placed into storage, and the base of the launch platform was modified to accommodate the locations of engines on the Shuttle. The platform was redesignated MLP-1.|$|E
50|$|Two Saturn IBs (AS-201 and AS-202) were {{successfully}} launched from LC-34 before the Apollo 1 fire brought Apollo {{activities at the}} spaceport to an abrupt halt. After the fire, extinguishing equipment was installed {{at the top of}} the <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower,</b> and a slide wire was set up to provide astronauts a quick escape in the event of an emergency.|$|E
50|$|MLP-1 was {{originally}} constructed as a Mobile Launcher for the Saturn V rocket, and was designated ML-3, or LUT-3. It {{was built by}} Ingalls Iron Works. Construction began in 1964, and was completed with {{the installation of the}} Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> hammerhead crane on 1 March 1965. The swing arms, which were constructed by Hayes International were added at a later date.|$|E
50|$|The former President, Dr. Abdul Kalam, {{witnessed}} the launch from the Mission Control Centre. It {{was the first}} PSLV launch from second pad, using integrate-transfer-and-launch technology. After its integration in the Vehicle Assembly Building, the PSLV-C6 was transported on rails to the <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> (UT) located one km away using the Mobile Launch Pedestal where the final operations were carried out.|$|E
50|$|LC-34 was {{extensively}} {{modified to}} support Saturn IB launches, {{which began in}} February 1966. New anchor points were built to fasten the service structure in place during high winds. Access arms on the <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> were rebuilt to match the larger rocket. At the 67-meter level, the swing arm was outfitted with a white room to permit access to the command module {{at the top of}} a rocket.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, NASA {{deactivated}} both LC-34 and LC-37. It briefly considered reactivating {{both for}} Apollo Applications Program launches {{after the end}} of Apollo, but instead modified the Kennedy Space Center launch complex to handle the Saturn IB for the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project launches. The LC-34 service structure and <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> were razed, leaving only the concrete launch pedestal as a monument to the Apollo 1 crew. In 2001, LC-37 was recommissioned and converted to service Delta IV launch vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Work {{began on}} LC-34 in 1960, {{and it was}} {{formally}} dedicated on June 5, 1961. The complex consisted of a launch platform, <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower,</b> mobile service tower, fueling facilities, and a blockhouse. Two steel flame deflectors were mounted on rails to allow placement beneath the launch platform. The service tower was likewise mounted on rails, and it was moved to a position 185 meters west of the pad before launch. At 95 meters high, it was the tallest structure at LC-34.|$|E
5000|$|The {{facilities}} at Musudan-ri are modest, {{consisting of a}} launch pad at [...] The launch pad consists of a 30-meter <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> with a top-mounted gantry crane, a flame blast bucket, a launch blockhouse with a connecting access tunnel, two semi-buried liquid fuel storage buildings, a concrete apron/pad and multiple small support buildings. An engine test stand at , a missile assembly/checkout building at , a missile control building at [...] and a Ground Tracking Facility (coordinates obtained from Google Earth in June, 2006.).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> {{contained}} two elevators {{and nine}} retractable swing arms which {{extended to the}} space vehicle, {{to provide access to}} each of the three rocket stages and the spacecraft for people, wiring and plumbing while the vehicle was on the launch pad, and swung away from the vehicle at launch. Technicians, engineers, and astronauts used the uppermost Spacecraft Access Arm to access the crew cabin. At the end of the arm, the white room provided an environmentally controlled and protected area for astronauts and their equipment to enter the spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|Months before launch, {{the three}} {{stages of the}} Saturn V launch vehicle and the {{components}} of the Apollo spacecraft were brought inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and assembled in one of four high bays into a 363 ft-tall space vehicle on one of three Mobile Launchers. Each mobile launcher consisted of a two-story, 49 by 41 m launch platform with four hold-down arms and a 136 m Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> (LUT) topped by a crane used to lift the spacecraft into position for assembly. The MLP and unfueled vehicle together weighed 12600000 lb.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{spacecraft}} {{is integrated}} {{to the vehicle}} in a clean room, set up inside the MST. However, {{in the case of}} GSLV, the spacecraft is interfaced with the payload adopter and then encapsulated in the heat shield in the preparation facility itself. The encapsulated assembly is moved to the launch pad for integrating with the 3rd stage of GSLV. The <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> houses the feed lines for liquid propellants and high-pressure gases, checkout cables, and chilled air duct for supplying cool air to the satellite and equipment bay." ...|$|E
50|$|After the Apollo program, the {{launcher}} platforms were modified for the Space Shuttle (Space Transport System). The umbilical towers from Mobile Launchers 2 and 3 were removed. Portions {{of these}} tower structures were erected {{at the two}} launch pads, 39A and 39B. These permanent structures are {{now known as the}} Fixed Service Structures (FSS). The <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> from Mobile Launcher 1 (which was the platform used for the most significant Apollo missions) was taken apart and stored in the Kennedy Space Center's industrial area. Efforts to preserve it in the 1990s failed, however, for lack of funding and it was scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The first launch from ML-1 was {{the maiden}} {{flight of the}} Saturn V, and the first launch from LC-39, Apollo 4. Following this, it was used for two manned Apollo {{launches}}: Apollo 8 and Apollo 11. After NASA decided to move Saturn IB launches from LC-34 to LC-39, it was modified {{by the addition of}} a structure known as the Milkstool, which allowed the Saturn IB to use the same Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> as the much larger Saturn V. Three manned flights to Skylab, and the Apollo launch for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, were conducted from ML-1 using the Milkstool.|$|E
50|$|After the {{decommissioning}} of LC-34, the <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> and service structure were razed, {{leaving only the}} launch platform standing {{at the center of}} the pad. It serves as a memorial to the crew of Apollo 1. A dedicatory plaque affixed to the structure bears the inscription:LAUNCH COMPLEX 34Friday, 27 January 19671831 HoursDedicated to the living memory of the crew of the Apollo 1U.S.A.F. Lt. Colonel Virgil I. GrissomU.S.A.F. Lt. Colonel Edward H. White, IIU.S.N. Lt. Commander Roger B. ChaffeeThey gave their lives in service to their country in the ongoing exploration of humankind's final frontier. Remember them not for how they died but for those ideals for which they lived.|$|E
50|$|It {{was noted}} that the GAMBIT flights through {{the first half of}} 1964 had been mostly successful, but a string of {{malfunctions}} occurred starting {{in the second half of}} the year and continuing through the first half of 1965. These included the two above-mentioned launch failures plus GAMBIT 4013 which did not return any imagery and 4014 which suffered a battery explosion. 4019 did not return any imagery either. Eventually, it was determined that the culprit was an extra structure added to the SLC-4W <b>umbilical</b> <b>tower</b> that sent resonant vibration through the Atlas-Agena stack at liftoff, jarring random components in the booster and/or spacecraft loose.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the demise}} of the shuttle program at Vandenberg, SLC 6 was once again reconfigured, this time to support polar-orbit {{satellite}} launches by the new Delta IV family of launch vehicles, utilizing a Common Core Booster for class sizes {{all the way up to}} and including the Delta IV (Heavy) launcher. As it is currently configured, the 132 acre launch site features structures similar to Boeing's Delta IV SLC-37 launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, with a Fixed <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower,</b> Mobile Service Tower, Fixed Pad Erector, Launch Control Center and Operations Building, and a Horizontal Integration Facility. SLC-6 also features a Mobile Assembly Shelter that protects the rocket from adverse weather.|$|E
5000|$|The MLP was {{constructed}} for transporting and launching the Saturn V rocket for the Apollo program lunar landing missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Each MLP originally {{had a single}} exhaust vent for the Saturn V's engines. The MLPs also featured a 380 ft Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> (LUT) with nine arms that permitted servicing of the vehicle on the launch pad, and swung away from it at launch. For Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz, MLP No. 1 was modified with a pedestal (called [...] "the milkstool") that allowed the shorter Saturn IB rocket to use the Saturn V tower and service arms, and Saturn V Ground Support Equipment (GSE) was removed or de-activated and Saturn IB GSE equipment was installed.|$|E
5000|$|NASA stacked or {{assembled}} the Saturn V on a Mobile Launcher Platform (MLP), {{which consisted of}} a Launch <b>Umbilical</b> <b>Tower</b> (LUT) with nine swing arms (including the crew access arm), a [...] "hammerhead" [...] crane, and a water suppression system which was activated prior to launch. After assembly was completed, the entire stack was moved from the VAB to the launch pad using the Crawler Transporter (CT). Built by the Marion Power Shovel company (and later used for transporting the smaller and lighter Space Shuttle), the CT ran on four double-tracked treads, each with 57 'shoes'. Each shoe weighed 2000 lb. This transporter was also required to keep the rocket level as it traveled the 3 mi to the launch site, especially at the 3 percent grade encountered at the launch pad.
