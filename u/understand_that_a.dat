5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks before}} Garza's death, {{a woman named}} Maria America Guerra had been sexually {{assaulted}} while kneeling at the communion rail at another Catholic church in the area. Rumor held that Father Feit was responsible, but local church leaders discouraged people from considering {{the possibility that a}} priest could have been involved in a violent crime. Feit admitted to visiting a priest at that church on the day of Guerra's attack, but he denied assaulting her. He was later charged with rape, and the trial ended in a hung jury. In 1962, rather than facing a second trial, Feit entered a plea of no contest to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault, and he paid a $500 fine. Years later, Feit said he did not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> no contest plea would result in his conviction.|$|E

500|$|Bergkamp and Wright {{scored a}} goal apiece in Arsenal's 2–0 win against Everton {{on the first}} day of March. The team won by an {{identical}} scoreline at home to Nottingham Forest a week later and kept a third consecutive cleansheet against Southampton; midfielders Stephen Hughes and Paul Shaw both got themselves on the scoresheet. Defeat at home to Liverpool on 24 March 1997 was marred by a dubious penalty awarded to striker Robbie Fowler. The player himself [...] "stood and mouthed: 'No penalty!'" [...] given Seaman made no contact in the penalty box, but the referee unaltered his decision. Although Fowler's spotkick was later saved, the ball rebounded to Jason McAteer, who scored. Wenger ruled the team out of the title race again, by saying after the match, [...] "Everybody knows now that it was not a penalty, but I can <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> referee took a wrong decision. That's football and it eliminates our chance of the championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Today’s {{page numbers}} were {{assigned}} to the codex by Agostino Aglio when he became the first to transcribe the manuscript in 1825/26. For this, he divided the original codex into two parts, labeled Codex A and Codex B. [...] He sequenced Codex A on the front side followed by its back side, with the same order on Codex B. Today, historians such as Helmut Deckert and Ferdinand Anders <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> codex reading should traverse the complete front side followed by the complete back side of the manuscript, i.e., pages 1-24 followed by 46-74 and 25-45. The librarian K. C. Falkenstein adjusted the relative position of pages for “esthetical reasons” in 1836, resulting in today’s two similar length parts. While deciphering the codex, the [...] librarian E. W. Förstemann noticed an error in Aglio’s page assignment of the sheets 1/45 and 2/44, so he correctly reassigned Aglio’s pages 44 and 45 to become pages 1 and 2. The reversal of the sheets 6/40, 7/39 and 8/38 is due to an error when the sheets were returned to their protective glass cabinet after drying from the water damage due to the bombing of Dresden in 1945.|$|E

500|$|The city lies on {{approximately}} 200 deep {{canyons and}} hills separating its mesas, creating small pockets of natural open space {{scattered throughout the}} city and giving it a hilly geography. Traditionally, San Diegans have built their homes and businesses on the mesas, while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild. Thus, the canyons give {{parts of the city}} a segmented feel, creating gaps between otherwise proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low-density, car-centered environment. The San Diego River runs through the middle of San Diego from east to west, creating a river valley which serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments. The river used to flow into San Diego Bay and its fresh water was the focus of the earliest Spanish explorers. Miguel Costanso, a cartographer, wrote in 1769, [...] "When asked by signs where the watering-place was, the Indians pointed to a grove which could be seen at a considerable distance to the northeast, giving to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> river or creek flowed through it, and that they would lead our men to it if they would follow." [...] That river was the San Diego River. Several reservoirs and Mission Trails Regional Park also lie between and separate developed areas of the city.|$|E

While recognized as scriptural, terms such as Church of God are avoided to avoid confusion or identification with other groups that use those designations. [...] As a practical matter, use of a common term {{is seen as a}} way to help individual Christians find congregations with a similar approach to the scriptures. Members <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> scriptural name {{can be used in a}} [...] "denominational" [...] or [...] "sectarian" [...] way. Trying to use the term [...] "Church of Christ" [...] exclusively has been criticized as identifying a denomination. Many congregations and individuals do not capitalize the word [...] "church" [...] in the phrases [...] "church of Christ" [...] and [...] "churches of Christ". [...] This is based on the understanding that the term [...] "church of Christ" [...] is used in the New Testament as a descriptive phrase, indicating that the church belongs to Christ, rather than as a proper name.|$|E

2500|$|Education {{for girls}} and women was {{originally}} provided within the family, by locals dame schools and public elementary schools, and at female seminaries found in every colony, but limited to young ladies from families with the means to pay tuition and, arguably, still more limited by the focus on providing ladylike accomplishments rather than academic training. These seminaries or academies were usually small and often ephemeral, usually established founded by a single woman or small group of women, they often failed to outlive their founders. In evaluating the many claims of various colleges {{to have been the}} [...] "first" [...] women's college, it is necessary to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of these 18th- or early 19th-century female seminaries later grew into academic, degree-granting colleges, while others became notable private high schools.

2500|$|The most {{important}} participant was Geiger, who published a lengthy treatise on the matter, Der Hamburger Tempelstreit, eine Zeitfrage. He clarified {{from the start}} that Bernays did not interest him in particular, mocking the [...] "medieval" [...] form in which he chose to protest. He was also angered by the fact that in his book, Der Biblische Orient, Bernays did present a model of historical progress in the Jewish prayer rite, wondering why the rabbi will not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> reformulation was now necessary due to the same process of change with the times. But for Geiger, the subject was his conservative rivals, [...] mainly Frankel, and the authors of the prayerbook. He devoted his book to a history of the development of Jewish prayer, demonstrating how the various layers emerged through the ages. Geiger dismissed any sentimental romanticism accorded to it by the people, arguing that it has always been subject to profound change. On the other hand, he criticised the Hamburg Temple editors for not fully replacing the Messianic concept. While they omitted much, they retained some petitions. He believed they should have adopted the alternative already promulgated in scholarly Reform circles, that of a Messianic age of global harmony. Geiger added they should have also excised all segments referring to beliefs already considered irrational, like the resurrection.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1982 US Open, Evert had {{an easier}} time in {{dispatching}} her opponent Mandlíková in the final, than she had two years prior. [...] It was due to a high propensity of double faults and errant shot making, which allowed Evert even though some suspect serving of her own was able to preserve games on her racket. [...] In the fourth game of the match, Evert had a break point against her serve, but would not give it up. [...] After the match was knotted at 3-games all, Mandlíková was serving in the seventh game of the match, which she was incapable of holding serve. [...] In the next subsequent game, Evert was faced with three break points on serve. [...] Yet, unlike the Czechoslovakian, was able {{to fend off the}} points, which was a game consisting of five deuce points. [...] In the ninth game of the set, Evert broke Mandlíková again, which came off of a backhand volley in the net, and the set was won at six games to three in just 33 minutes. [...] The second set lasted only 31 minutes, and Evert won it in a romp at six games to one in a total match time of 64 minutes. [...] This win gave her the sixth US Open title for her career, which was over an eight-year timespan, which Evert said [...] "the first time you win Wimbledon or the US Open is really a thrill, but I appreciate and maybe have a place in history by winning a sixth, so I can <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> little better." ...|$|E
