5|$|Smith's metallurgists {{found ways}} of {{fabricating}} boron, producing beryllium bricks, and heat-treating steel. They {{also had to}} work with uranium. Frank Spedding had developed a large-scale process for producing pure <b>uranium</b> <b>metal</b> at the Ames Laboratory which was fine for producing tons of feed for the nuclear reactors, but enriched uranium could not be handled in this way, as it would form a critical mass. Smith was initially asked to produce cubes of uranium hydride, which he did, but the 1950s uranium hydride bomb tests were found to be inefficient, and the idea was set aside for the duration, although further work was carried out after the war. By July 1944, they were producing pure <b>uranium</b> <b>metal</b> in 200g amounts with a newly devised process.|$|E
5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the <b>uranium</b> <b>metal.</b> At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce <b>uranium</b> <b>metal,</b> they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E

5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing <b>uranium</b> <b>metal</b> on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E

5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} raw ore and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then {{added in a}} liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into <b>uranium</b> <b>metal</b> initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives.

5|$|On 2 December 1942, {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project, {{another team}} led by Enrico Fermi was able to {{initiate}} the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. An initial plan using enriched uranium-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities. Working in a lab below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400short tons (360metric tons) of graphite, 58short tons (53metric tons) of uranium oxide, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of <b>uranium</b> <b>metal,</b> a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.|$|E

A process was developed to recovery depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>metal</b> from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left over from the gaseous diffusion process.

5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only <b>uranium</b> <b>metal</b> available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E
5|$|The 1789 {{discovery}} of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot {{was the first}} person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used <b>uranium</b> <b>metal</b> and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety. See Nuclear proliferation.|$|E
5|$|Uranium and thorium {{were the}} first {{actinides}} discovered. Uranium was identified in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in pitchblende ore. He named it after the planet Uranus, which had been discovered only eight years earlier. Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. He then reduced the obtained yellow powder with charcoal, and extracted a black substance that he mistook for metal. Only 60 years later, the French scientist Eugène-Melchior Péligot identified it as uranium oxide. He also isolated the first sample of <b>uranium</b> <b>metal</b> by heating uranium tetrachloride with metallic potassium. The atomic mass of uranium was then calculated as 120, but Dmitri Mendeleev in 1872 corrected it to 240 using his periodicity laws. This value was confirmed experimentally in 1882 by K. Zimmerman.|$|E
40|$|Contamination of soils, water, and sediments by {{radionuclides}} {{and toxic}} <b>metals</b> from <b>uranium</b> mill tailings, nuclear fuel manufacturing {{and nuclear weapons}} production is a major concern. Studies of the mechanisms of biotransformation of <b>uranium</b> and toxic <b>metals</b> under various microbial process conditions {{has resulted in the}} development of two treatment processes: (1) stabilization of <b>uranium</b> and toxic <b>metals</b> with reduction in waste volume and (2) removal and recovery of <b>uranium</b> and toxic <b>metals</b> from wastes and contaminated soils. Stabilization of <b>uranium</b> and toxic <b>metals</b> in wastes is accomplished by exploiting the unique metabolic capabilities of the anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium sp. The radionuclides and toxic metals are solubilized by the bacteria directly by enzymatic reductive dissolution, or indirectly due to the production of organic acid metabolites. The radionuclides and toxic metals released into solution are immobilized by enzymatic reductive precipitation, biosorption and redistribution with stable mineral phases in the waste. Non-hazardous bulk components of the waste volume. In the second process <b>uranium</b> and toxic <b>metals</b> are removed from wastes or contaminated soils by extracting with the complexing agent citric acid. The citric-acid extract is subjected to biodegradation to recover the toxic metals, followed by photochemical degradation of the uranium citrate complex which is recalcitrant to biodegradation. The toxic <b>metals</b> and <b>uranium</b> are recovered in separate fractions for recycling or for disposal. The use of combined chemical and microbiological treatment process is more efficient than present methods and should result in considerable savings in clean-up and disposal costs...|$|R
