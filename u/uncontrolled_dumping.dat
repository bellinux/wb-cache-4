30|$|Despite {{rapid changes}} of {{landfill}} technology from <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>dump</b> site {{to a highly}} engineered landfill for ultimate solid waste disposal method, generation of heavily polluted leachate remains inevitable (Cortez et al. 2011). Poorly managed inefficient landfilling {{has been seen as}} the major factor contributing to hydro geological contamination that originates from leachate that infiltrates into soil and groundwater. Furthermore, leachate is a heterogeneous mixture of high-strength organic and inorganic contaminants including humic acids, xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs), ammonia nitrogen, heavy metals and other inorganic salts (Honjiang et al. 2009). If not properly treated and securely disposed, landfill leachate may bring potential hazards to surface and groundwater as it may percolate through soils and sub-soils. Therefore, treatment of landfill leachate is considered crucial prior to its discharge that can safeguard surrounding environment (Tatsi et al. 2003).|$|R

Scenario 3 considered waste sorting, recycling and composting followed by landfill disposal in an integrated treatment disposal facility. The current open dumping practice was considered as the baseline scenario. According to economic analysis, the benefits from the revenues of selling the produced recyclables and compost did not improve the ranking of scenario 3. However, scenario 3 has gained positive recognition due to the environmental benefits of waste recycling.

In order to evaluate the migration of leachate from <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>dumps</b> and to establish efficient groundwater monitoring systems at sanitary landfills, basic information about the behaviour of pollutants in soil-groundwater systems is needed. A series of saturated laboratory soil columns loaded with acid phase leachate under anaerobic CO 2 -saturated conditions were studied in terms of solute breakthrough curves and final pollutant soil profiles. The four soils studied exhibited significantly different capacities for attenuating leachate pollutants. In general, ammonia, sodium and boron were attenuated only by adsorption and organic matter {{by a combination of}} adsorption and degradation. Dissolved solids, specific conductivity, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese were, besides adsorption, subject to precipitation-dissolution processes. For iron and manganese the latter process was in combination with redox processes. Zinc and cadmium were extensively attenuated probably due to a combination of adsorption and sulphide precipitation. With a few exceptions, chloride, dissolved solids, specific conductivity, organic matter (COD) and sodium are the most mobile constituents of the leachate exhibiting migration velocities of 80 - 100 % of the water flow velocity...|$|R

It introduces a concept for determining 3 D geometric characteristics (shape, depth, radius, area, and volume) of formerly concave landforms (i. e., recently filled dolines) by using a combination of two methods: (1) photogrammetric stereo processing of archival aerial photographs and (2) electrical resistivity imaging (ERI). To represent, visualize, and study the characteristics of the former surface morphology (i. e., the dolines before they were filled), a digital terrain model (DTM) for 1972 (DTM 1972) was made using digital photogrammetry processing of five sequential archival aerial photographs (1972, © GURS). DTM 1972 was visually and quantitatively compared with the DTM 5 of the recent surface morfology (DTM 5, © GURS, 2006) in order to define areas of manmade terrain differences. In general, a circular area with a higher terrain difference is an indicator of a filled doline. The calculated terrain differences also indicate the thickness of buried waste material.

Communities use open burning for a variety of functions: For direct disposal, it takes the least amount of man-power and is the cheapest option. For precious metal extraction, it can be an effective method to extract certain valuable metals, such as gold. The combustion of burning e-waste results in ash that contains fine particulate matter; a measure of pollutants that has been linked to cardiovascular and pulmonary issues. Additional health risks result from direct exposure to the toxic metals that release dioxins when burned and in addition to being inhaled, become embedded into the soil and plants in the surrounding area. The United Nations has done significant research into the growing issue of e-waste disposal and has documented that different communities are disproportionately affected by this issue: [...] "Such practices are closely related to poverty because <b>uncontrolled</b> waste <b>dumps</b> typically are located close to human settlements.
