While poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.|$|E

5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son.

In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E
5|$|However, the Attorney-General may not {{consent to}} lend {{his name to}} a relator action. This matter lies entirely within his discretion, and his {{decision}} is not considered reviewable by the courts. In addition, it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive, it is overly idealistic to expect his consent to an action against the Government. This makes a relator action an <b>uncertain,</b> <b>and</b> hence an unsatisfactory, means of obtaining relief.|$|E

5|$|Many {{theories}} have been advanced {{in way of}} explanation for decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are <b>uncertain,</b> <b>and</b> some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.|$|E

3000|$|Liu [11] founded an {{uncertainty}} {{theory that}} is based on normality, duality, subadditivity and product axioms. Gao [12] studied some properties of uncertain measure. Since then, considerable work has been done based on uncertainty theory. Liu [13] founded uncertain programming to model optimization problems in uncertain environments. Liu [14] proposed the concept of <b>uncertain</b> process <b>and</b> <b>uncertain</b> calculus.

Uncertainty theory has become a new tool to describe belief degree and has applications in practical use. For a detailed exposition, the interested reader may consult the book [17] to know more about uncertainty theory. In this section, we will introduce some definitions related on uncertain systems.

5|$|The ethnogenesis of Croats is <b>uncertain</b> <b>and</b> {{there are}} several {{competing}} theories, Slavic and Iranian being the most frequently put forward. The most widely accepted of these, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of White Croats from the territory of White Croatia during the Migration Period. Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin, based on Tanais Tablets containing Greek inscription of given names Χορούαθ, Χοροάθος, and Χορόαθος (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people.|$|E

Smaller numbers are found west to eastern Mali and Nigeria, and in northern Kenya and southern Saudi Arabia. Most birds leave the breeding areas in late August and September, and return north in February and March.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{uncertain}} jump process {{which consists of}} two parts. The continuous part of this uncertain jump process refers to an integral with respect to canonical Liu process, and the discontinuous part finitely jumps in each finite time interval. We will present the definition of integral and differential with respect to <b>uncertain</b> jump process. <b>And</b> then, we propose an uncertain model of asset price which contains multi-assets <b>and</b> <b>uncertain</b> jumps. The remainder {{of this paper is}} organized as follows. The next two sections introduce some results of <b>uncertain</b> variable <b>and</b> <b>uncertain</b> differential equation. In the “Uncertain Jump Process” section, <b>uncertain</b> jump process <b>and</b> <b>uncertain</b> integral with respect to uncertain jump process are proposed. In the “Multi-asset Option Pricing Formulas” section, pricing formulas for three different exotic options with payoffs affected by at least two underlying asset prices are derived. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in the “Conclusions” section.|$|R

The data was <b>uncertain</b> <b>and</b> they carried out new experiments on hassium five years later, where these two isotopes as well as hassium-263 were produced; the hassium-264 experiment was conducted again and confirmed in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms {{a number}} of {{chemical}} compounds, where it normally exists in an oxidation state of +3 or +4, and behaves similarly to its lanthanide analogue, terbium. Like all actinides, berkelium easily dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the trivalent oxidation state. This trivalent state is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is <b>uncertain</b> <b>and</b> has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of the Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective oxide surface layer; however, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds. Berkelium can also form several organometallic compounds.|$|E
5|$|During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having {{held the}} Ashes since 1934 but critics {{considered}} England {{to have a}} good chance of winning the series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was <b>uncertain</b> <b>and</b> he was troubled by fibrositis which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia's first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed early in the second innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain for the remainder of the series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.|$|E

5|$|For {{attack and}} defense, the common torpedo can deliver a strong {{electric}} shock {{of up to}} 200 volts. It is a solitary, nocturnal ambush predator that feeds mainly on bony fishes and crustaceans. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females produce litters of up to 28 young every year in late summer or autumn, after a gestation period of 4–8 months; the specifics vary between geographical regions. The common torpedo's shock is painful but otherwise of little danger to humans. Its electrogenic properties led it {{to be used in}} medicine by the ancient Greeks and Romans. In modern times, it has no economic value and is mostly discarded when caught as bycatch in fisheries. The impact of fishing on its population is <b>uncertain,</b> <b>and</b> pending more data the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E

The Ghouta, the wider area in which Damascus is located, has been occupied since at least 9000 BC, but there is no evidence for settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC. The area occupied by the later citadel was most likely outside this first settlement. The presence of a citadel during the Hellenistic period {{is uncertain}}.
