40|$|AbstractUncoupling protein 3 L, <b>uncoupling</b> protein 1 and the {{mitochondrial}} oxoglutarate carrier {{were expressed}} in Saccharomyces cerevisae. Effects on different parameters {{related to the}} energy expenditure were studied. Both <b>uncoupling</b> protein 3 L and <b>uncoupling</b> protein 1 reduced the growth rate by 49 % and 32 % and increased the whole yeast O 2 consumption by 31 % and 19 %, respectively. In isolated mitochondria, <b>uncoupling</b> protein 1 increased the state 4 respiration by 1. 8 -fold, while <b>uncoupling</b> protein 3 L increased the state 4 respiration by 1. 2 -fold. Interestingly, mutant <b>uncoupling</b> protein 1 carrying the H 145 Q and H 147 N mutations, previously shown to markedly decrease the H+ transport activity of <b>uncoupling</b> protein 1 when assessed using a proteoliposome system (Bienengraeber et al.

The oxoglutarate carrier had no effect on any of the studied parameters. In summary, a discordance exists between the magnitude of effects of <b>uncoupling</b> protein 3 L and <b>uncoupling</b> protein 1 in whole yeast versus isolated mitochondria, with <b>uncoupling</b> protein 3 L having greater effects in whole yeast and a smaller effect on the state 4 respiration in isolated mitochondria.

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 is {{a member}} of the mitochondrial carrier protein family. As a homologue of the thermogenic brown fat <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 1, it possesses a mitochondrial <b>uncoupling</b> activity and thus can influence cell energy metabolism but its exact biological function remains unclear. In the present study, <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 was expressed in 293 cells using the tetracycline-inducible system and its impact on cell bioenergetics and responsiveness to the apoptotic stimulus was determined. The induction of <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 expression in mitochondria did not lead to uncontrolled respiratory <b>uncoupling</b> in intact cells. However, it caused a GDP-inhibition of state 4 respiration and a GDP-induced re-polarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the presence of fatty acids, in agreement with its expected physiological behavior as an <b>uncoupling</b> protein (UCP). <b>Uncoupling</b> protein- 3 expression did not cause apoptosis per se but increased the responsiveness of the cells to a mitochondrial apoptotic stimulus (i. e., addition of staurosporine in the culture medium). It enhanced caspase 3 and caspase 9 activation and favored cytochrome c release. Moreover, cells in which <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 expression had been induced showed a higher mitochondrial Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio essentially due to enhanced translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Finally, the induction of <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 also increased the sensitivity of mitochondria to open the permeability transition pore in response to calcium.

They were well positioned to use coal from the Northumberland and County Durham coal fields. All of the coal used in the stations was brought to them via rail transport from UK coal stocks. Trains delivered coal to the station using the North Blyth Branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The stations' coal handling facility was fitted with a Merry go Round (MGR) coal delivery system in 1981, after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became the British Rail standard. This system involved the trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath the train. Because of site space restrictions, a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed, so instead {{of being able to}} move continuously, trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track; the locomotive would then <b>uncouple</b> and recouple at the opposite end, before slowly moving over the unloading track hopper and discharging the coal and eventually leaving site. Towards the end of the station's operation, coal was more frequently brought in by road. All coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area {{to the north of the}} power stations.

Transient <b>uncoupling</b> works best if the units stay <b>uncoupled</b> whenever the driven orbit visits regions that are locally diverging in its phase space.

Mitochondrial <b>uncoupling</b> increases O 2  consumption but the ensuing reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential may limit excessive oxidative stress. The present study addressed the hypothesis that mitochondrial <b>uncoupling</b> regulates mitochondria function and oxidative stress in the diabetic kidney. Isolated mitochondria from kidney cortex of control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were studied before and after siRNA knockdown of <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 2 (UCP- 2). Diabetes resulted in increased UCP- 2 protein expression and UCP- 2 -mediated <b>uncoupling,</b> but normal mitochondria membrane potential. This <b>uncoupling</b> was inhibited by GDP, which also increased the membrane potential. siRNA reduced UCP- 2 protein expression in controls and diabetics (− 30 – 50 %), but paradoxically further increased <b>uncoupling</b> and markedly reduced the membrane potential. This siRNA mediated <b>uncoupling</b> was unaffected by GDP but was blocked by ADP and carboxyatractylate (CAT). Mitochondria membrane potential after UCP- 2 siRNA was unaffected by GDP but increased by CAT. This demonstrated that further increased mitochondria <b>uncoupling</b> after siRNA towards UCP- 2 is mediated through the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT). The increased oxidative stress in the diabetic kidney, manifested as increased thiobarbituric acids, was reduced by knocking down UCP- 2 whereas whole-body oxidative stress, manifested as increased circulating malondialdehyde, remained unaffected. All parameters investigated were unaffected by scrambled siRNA. In conclusion, mitochondrial <b>uncoupling</b> via UCP- 2 regulates mitochondria membrane potential in diabetes.
