Its basic elements are: actors, subjects and tools, needs and interests, values and norms, positions and roles. Actors set in motion and unify the rest of elements, guide to the magic triangle of sociology (movement, change, order), reaffirm actor paradigm to systemic paradigm. Subjects and tools materialize an action and its overestimate results in technological determinism or (by means of property as institutional appropriation of nature) in the (<b>un)</b> <b>classed</b> historical type of society. Needs and interests are the basis of person's motivation and starting point for depth analysis of sociability. The expansion of legitimate interests circle develops techniques of normative regulation. Values and norms guide to institutional-organizational, positions to vertical and roles to horizontal structure. Values give the meaning to the action {{as well as to}} human existence, they are orientations of motivate system of personality but also basic aspect of society. As abstractions, values are latent background of norms and they tell to us what to do, and norms how to do something. Norms are specified instructions for suitable behavior Without normative order, not to be possible the satisfying of needs and the conciliation of interests. Riches, power and prestige are components of social position, and legal status is the determination of rights and obligations of the position. Roles are normative expectation of behavior. Toward kinds of sanctions roles are classified. Roles but also other elements of social action are starting point for sociological analysis of legal norms and institutes. On the other side, the observation of legal component of social actions enriches, strengths and precises sociological analysis of them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objectives Several {{formulations}} {{have been}} proposed in order to model human growth from birth to maturity. They are usually based on “ad hoc” heuristic assumptions. In the present contribution we adopt, as an alternative, a completely general (interdisciplinary) approach, based on the formalism of the Phenomenological Universalities (PUN). Methods The main PUN class investigated to date, i. e. UN, can only account for the overall growth pattern. For a realistic description {{it is necessary to}} add to it one or more “spurts”, as expected on biological grounds, due to the stimulation of growth and sex hormones. Results A new PUN <b>class</b> (<b>UN</b> [*]+[*] FM) is generated and shown to be able to provide excellent agreement with standard auxological datasets. The accuracy of the fitting and reliability of the model suggest applications both at the diagnostic and therapeutic level. Conclusions The developed formalism can be suitably related to the biological description of bone plate growth under selective hormonal stimulation on the bone epiphysis; i. e., the additional increase of stature is the “macroscopic” response to a well defined biological signal. </p...|$|R

40|$|The period-pulse-width (P-W) {{distribution}} of sample of 41 pulsars has been reanalyzed under {{two versions of}} a model where radiation is beamed from magnetic polar caps which are isotropically {{oriented with respect to}} the rotation axis of the neutron stars (IOPC models). It is found that neither IOPC model can explain the P-W {{distribution of}} the entire sample. Pulsars with simple unimodal (U) or complicated multimodal (M) pulse shapes show significantly different P-W distributions. Class M pulsars have a narrower P-W distribution than do class U pulsars and, taken separately, are compatible with either IOPC model. Class U pulsars divide into two subgroups, those with relatively narrower pulses (UN) and those with relatively wider pulses (UW), each of which is compatible with either IOPC model. One interpretation of these results is that the pulsars in <b>classes</b> <b>UN,</b> M, and UW have different intrinsic beam sizes, roughly in the ratios 1 : 2 : 4, respectively. The possible origins of the three classes are discussed in terms of the force-balance magnetosphere model (Roberts et al., 1972, 1973), where the differences may be attributed to different-mass neutron stars and the structure of the polar caps. An alternative interpretation is that the angle between the rotation and emission axes is not isotropically distributed, but can take only certain preferred values...|$|R
40|$|Machine vision-based sorting of {{agricultural}} commodities {{is an alternative}} to the conventional mechanical and electro-optical sorting methods. This method offers high-speed, multi-category classification by processing multiple-features obtained through image processing algorithms. The purpose of this thesis was to determine an appropriate set of features and to investigate different classification schemes for efficient machine vision-based sorting of pistachio nuts. Kerman cultivar pistachio nuts obtained from California were used in this study. A sample of nuts were weighed and manually sorted into four classes: "Grade One" (G 1), "Grade Two" (G 2), and "Grade Three" (G 3), and "unsplit nuts" (<b>UN).</b> Each <b>class</b> consisted of 260 nuts. Morphological features (area, length, width, perimeter, and roundness), Fourier descriptor (FD's) of the boundary, and gray level histograms were extracted from images of the nuts using a Macintosh-based machine vision system and commercial image processing software. The discrimination power of the individual sets of features for separating the four classes were investigated using Gaussian classifiers. The morphological features and FD's resulted in relatively low classification accuracies. The gray-level histograms yielded an average classification accuracy of 98. 5 %. Analysis of the classification results indicated that morphological features had a better potential for separating G 1, G 2, and G 3 from each other while the FD's had a higher discrimination power for separating the split nuts from unsplit. Different feature selection methods including forward selection, backward elimination, Fisher criterion, and graphical analysis were applied to select a suitable subset of features. The feature selection results indicated that a combination of seven selected FD's and the area (7 FD's & A), or a combination of the frequency of the gray level 56 and the area (GL- 56 & A) were suitable for separating the four classes. The selected features were used as input to different classifiers such as Gaussians, decision trees, multi-layer neural networks (MLNN), and multi-structure neural networks (MSNN). A procedure for calculating the computational complexity of the classifiers was developed. The classifiers were compared in term of performance and computational complexity. A decision tree classifier using GL- 56 & A resulted in 91. 7 % classification accuracy. The same features using MLNN and MSNN resulted in 92. 4 % and 93. 2 % accuracy, respectively. The GL- 56 & A using a Gaussian classifier resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 89. 6 %. Using 7 FD's & A, the classification accuracies were 82. 8 %, 88. 7 %, 94. 1 %, and 95. 0 % for Gaussian, decision tree, MLNN, and MSNN classifiers, respectively. The decision tree classifiers required the least amount of computational time, but relied heavily on the threshold values supplied by the user. The neural network classifiers, in sequential executions, required higher computational time, but in terms of classification accuracy, were superior to the statistical classification methods. The MSNN classifiers were the most suitable method for this multi-category classification problem. These classifiers learned their input-output mapping faster and were more robust compared to MLNN classifiers...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a competition in autonomous navigation for vehicles boosted by the advances in computer vision. The on-board cameras {{are capable of}} understanding the semantic content of the environment. A core component of this system is to localize and classify objects in urban scenes. There {{is a need to}} have multi-class object detection systems. Designing such an efficient system is a challenging and active research area. The algorithms can be found for applications in autonomous driving, object searches in images or video surveillance. The scale of object classes varies depending on the tasks. The datasets for object detection started with containing one class only e. g. the popular INRIA Person dataset. Nowadays, we witness an expansion of the datasets consisting of more training data or number of object classes. This thesis proposes a solution to efficiently learn a multi-class object detector. The task of such a system is to localize all instances of target object classes in an input image. We distinguish between three major efficiency criteria. First, the detection performance measures the accuracy of detection. Second, we strive low execution times during run-time. Third, we address the scalability of our novel detection framework. The two previous criteria should scale suitably with the number of input classes and the training algorithm has to take a reasonable amount of time when learning with these larger datasets. Although single-class object detection has seen a considerable improvement over the years, it still remains a challenge to create algorithms that work well with any number of classes. Most works on this subject extent these single-class detectors to work accordingly with multiple classes but remain hardly flexible to new object descriptors. Moreover, they do not consider all these three criteria at the same time. Others use a more traditional approach by iteratively executing a single-class detector for each target class which scales linearly in training time and run-time. To tackle the challenges, we present a novel framework where for an input patch during detection the closest class is ranked highest. Background labels are rejected as negative samples. The detection goal is to find the highest scoring class. To this end, we derive a convex problem formulation that combines ranking and classification constraints. The accuracy of the system is improved by hierarchically arranging the classes into a tree of classifiers. The leaf nodes represent the individual classes and the intermediate nodes called super-classes group recursively these classes together. The super-classes benefit from the shared knowledge of their descending classes. All these classifiers are learned in a joint optimization problem along with the previouslymentioned constraints. The increased number of classifiers are prohibitive to rapid execution times. The formulation of the detection goal naturally allows to use an adapted tree traversal algorithm to progressively search for the best class but reject early in the detection process the background samples and consequently reduce the system’s run-time. Our system balances between detection performance and speed-up. We further experimented with feature reduction to decrease the overhead of applying the high-level classifiers in the tree. The framework is transparent to the used object descriptor where we implemented the histogram of orientated gradients and deformable part model both introduced in [Felzenszwalb et al., 2010 a]. The capabilities of our system are demonstrated on two challenging datasets containing different object categories not necessarily semantically related. We evaluate both the detection performance with different number of classes and the scalability with respect to run-time. Our experiments show that this framework fulfills the requirements of a multi-class object detector and highlights the advantages of structuring class-level knowledge. Dans cet article, nous présentons une nouvelle approche de détection multi-classes basée sur un parcours hiérarchique de classifieurs appris simultanément. Pour plus de robustesse et de rapidité, nous proposons d’utiliser <b>un</b> arbre de <b>classes</b> d’objets. Notre modèle de détection est appris en combinant les contraintes de tri et de classification dans un seul problème d’optimisation. Notre formulation convexe permet d’utiliser un algorithme de recherche pour accélérer le temps d’exécution.
