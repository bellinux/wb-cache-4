5|$|On {{the evening}} of May 20, 2013, the general public witnessed, through a {{dedicated}} webcam, that the bulb had apparently burned out. The next morning, an electrician {{was called in to}} confirm its status. It was determined that the bulb had not burned out when the <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> was bypassed, using an extension cord. The dedicated power supply was found to have been faulty. Approximately seven hours had transpired before the light was reestablished.|$|E

25|$|Diodes {{will prevent}} {{currents}} in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a battery. An <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> may use diodes {{in this way}} to ensure that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.|$|E

2500|$|The C-rate is {{a measure}} of the rate at which a battery is being {{discharge}}d. It is defined as the discharge current divided by the theoretical current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour. A 1C discharge rate would deliver the battery's rated capacity in 1 hour. [...] A 2C discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C discharge rate on a 1.6 Ah battery means a discharge current of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.|$|E
