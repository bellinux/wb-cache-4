The precinct also operates the Baytown Soccer Complex, located north of Baytown at 9600 North Main Street in an unincorporated area. The complex has eight soccer fields; four are lighted and four are <b>unlighted.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1952, a South African Airways Douglas C-47A-30-DL(DC-3) ZS-AVI with 19 {{occupants}} {{was written}} off when they landed at Carolina after becoming lost {{on a flight}} from Livingstone, Zambia to Palmietfontein. The landing occurred at night and the strip was <b>unlighted.</b> There were no fatalities.|$|E

50|$|Epoch of <b>Unlight</b> is a melodic death metal {{band from}} Memphis, Tennessee. The band formed in 1990, playing under {{a variety of}} {{different}} names including Enraptured and Requiem until 1994, when they officially settled on Epoch of <b>Unlight.</b>|$|R
50|$|The art of <b>Unlight</b> is gothic in {{the style}} of American comic books, drawn by the {{illustrator}} Miya. <b>Unlight</b> was developed by a 5 employee-company at first, and first launched on Yahoo Mobage in 2010. With the release of multiple language versions, its popularity, especially in Taiwan, grew to a point where their servers had to be upgraded every week in September 2011. The popularity of <b>Unlight</b> in Taiwan is attributed to the game's unique setting, good gameplay, female-friendly elements, and a successful promotional campaign targeted at gamers.|$|R
25|$|Many years later, {{scientific}} study {{of the actions of}} the two crews indicated a probability that the third mate on the Stockholm misinterpreted his radar in the minutes prior to the impact. Recent studies and computer simulations carried out by Captain Robert J. Meurn of the United States Merchant Marine Academy and based on the findings of John C. Carrothers suggest Stockholm Third Officer Carstens-Johannsen misinterpreted radar data and badly overestimated the distance between the two ships. The poor design of the radar settings, coupled with <b>unlighted</b> range settings and a darkened bridge, makes this scenario possible. Some critics have suggested that a simple and available technology, a small light bulb on the radar set aboard Stockholm, might have averted the entire disaster. Instead, he may have unintentionally steered the Swedish ship into a collision with the Italian liner.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{pilot-operated}} relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the <b>unlighted</b> lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|E
25|$|For {{four centuries}} after the Norman invasion, {{the growth of}} Leeds was slow. Its site had no {{particular}} military advantages: the great strategic position of that part of Yorkshire was at Pontefract, close by. It had, at first, no commercial values—it may have been that its first beginnings in its staple wool trade sprang from the wool growing of the Cistercians at Kirkstall Abbey, on its western borders. The township was concerned {{with little more than}} agriculture, and such trade as it knew was confined to those retailings which establish themselves wherever communities spring up—dealings in the necessities of life, which, reduced to a minimum, are merely food and clothing. The town itself was small—it was probably confined within a triangle formed on the lines of the present lower Briggate, Kirkgate, and the River Aire, with the parish church at one angle somewhere about, perhaps on, the site of the modern one. The streets would be narrow, unpaved and <b>unlighted.</b> The houses, {{in spite of the fact}} that stone is so plentiful in the district, were of wood, whitewashed, in many cases, thatched. All around the town lay the open fields and meadows, cultivated on the principle of strip-farming. And beyond these lay the forest of Elmet.|$|E

500|$|The <b>unlighted</b> 'dark walks' or 'close walks' {{were known}} as a place for amorous adventures. Thomas Brown in [...] "Works Serious and Comical in Prose and Verse" [...] (1760) says:The ladies that have an {{inclination}} to be private, take delight in the close walks of Spring-Gardens, where both sexes meet, and mutually serve one another as guides to lose their way; and the windings and turnings in the little wildernesses are so intricate, that the most experienced mothers have often lost themselves in looking for their daughters." ...|$|E
500|$|The Largs surface {{observation}} trials were conducted between 25 January and 6 February 1942; air observation trials, using Hudson bombers, {{took place on}} the nights of 4/5 February and 25/26 March 1942. They found an average reduction in the range at which the ship could be seen at night from another ship of around 25% using binoculars, 33% using the naked eye; the results from the air were less conclusive. The best case was on the exceptionally clear moonless night of 29/30 January 1942, when Largs could be seen from a surface ship with the naked eye at [...] <b>unlighted,</b> but only [...] with her diffused lighting, a 57% reduction.|$|E
500|$|Justice Samuel Alito wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion, {{in which he}} was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. He agreed that content-based regulations present the same dangers as viewpoint-based regulations because content-based regulations [...] "may interfere with democratic self-government and the search for truth". He also agreed that the town's ordinance was [...] "replete with content-based distinctions" [...] that were subject to strict scrutiny. However, Justice Alito wrote separately to emphasize that the Court's opinion would not [...] "prevent cities from regulating signs in a way that fully protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic objectives". To support his argument, Justice Alito provided a list of examples of content-neutral sign regulations, including: regulations that target the size of signs, regulations that target the locations at which signs may be placed, regulations distinguishing between lighted and <b>unlighted</b> signs, regulations that distinguish between the placement of signs on public and private property, rules that restrict the total number of signs [...] "per mile of roadway", and rules that distinguish between freestanding signs and signs that are attached to buildings.|$|E

2500|$|May 3, 1987 {{would become}} an infamous day in NASCAR history. [...] Earlier in the week, Bill Elliott had {{qualified}} his No. 9 Coors-Melling Ford Thunderbird at a record 212.809mph (a record which still stands today) for the Winston 500 at the <b>unlighted</b> Talladega Superspeedway. [...] Davey Allison would qualify third, while father Bobby would start second alongside Elliott in the Stavola Brothers No. 22 Miller Buick. [...] On lap 22 of the event, Bobby Allison ran over a piece of debris, cutting his right-rear tire. [...] The car turned sideways, lifted into the air, became airboirne, and crashed vertically into the frontstretch spectator fence near the start finish line. [...] The car landed back on the track and collected {{a number of other}} competitors. [...] Davey was ahead of his father at the time and saw the crash unfold in his mirror. [...] Bobby Allison was not injured, but the crash slightly injured several spectators and the race was red-flagged for two hours and thirty-eight minutes. It was this event that triggered the requirement of smaller carburetors, and later, [...] carburetor restrictor plates on engines at Daytona and Talladega to reduce the top speeds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outermost}} pair of tracks—the Fulton Street local tracks (Tracks A1 and A2)—and {{the outer}} two island platforms {{are no longer}} used in revenue service. To the west, the tracks continue under Schermerhorn Street to the decommissioned Court Street station, currently {{the site of the}} New York Transit Museum, in Brooklyn Heights. Track A2 is currently out of service for the storage of trains at the New York Transit Museum. Though {{it may be difficult to}} see in some of the <b>unlighted</b> portions of the station, a tile band is present on the trackside walls–similar in color to the Crosstown Line stations north to Flushing Avenue, and the Fulton Line stations east to Franklin Avenue–Lime (Nile) Green with a medium Kelly Green border, set in a three-high course consistent with many IND express stations. Captions reading [...] "HOYT" [...] are present in white lettering on a black background, with no mention of [...] "Schermerhorn". On the eastbound (southern) side, some of these captions have been stickered-over with different station names as required for film and TV shoots, though both sides have been used for filming. Both northern platforms have green-painted steel I-beams, while the beams on both southern platforms are tiled. Much of the ceiling at platform level is peeling due to water damage.|$|E

5000|$|The Shadow Planet Killers or Death Clouds, giant {{machines}} {{capable of}} destroying worlds that were created {{and used by}} the Shadows, have a strong resemblance to the <b>Unlight.</b> The <b>Unlight</b> is a dark emanation of Ungoliant, an evil creature of The Silmarillion incarnated {{in the form of}} a giant spider. She helped Morgoth in a crucial moment of the narrative. Like the Planet Killers shadow cloak, the <b>Unlight</b> resembles a cloud of inscrutable darkness, capable of strangling the very will of any living thing ensnared by it, and capable of obliterating all light. It can be woven like a web. Ungoliant used it to satiate her infinite hunger for luminous energy, and also to hide herself and Morgoth, making both of them invisible to the Valar. This <b>Unlight</b> was also what provoked the Darkening of Valinor. The cloud surrounding the Shadow Planet Killer has the same attributes, generating opaque darkness and draining the energy of all that are entrapped within it: star vessels, power sources, etc. This dark cloud conceals a [...] "web" [...] or [...] "net-like" [...] matrix of numerous destructive mechanisms which make up the Planet Killer itself.|$|R
