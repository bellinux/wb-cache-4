40|$|To {{determine}} {{the usefulness of}} urodynamic studies {{in the management of}} children with a suspected tethered spinal cord, the authors retrospectively reviewed case records of 25 patients evaluated both pre- and postoperatively using this diagnostic adjunct. All patients were also evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography myelography. Seven patients who presented initially with orthopedic deformity, skin stigmata, and neurological problems underwent primary cord <b>untethering</b> (Group 1). All seven patients were urologically asymptomatic; all but one had normal findings on urodynamic study. Eighteen patients with prior myelomeningocele closure underwent secondary <b>untethering</b> (Group 2). They presented with urological (11 cases), neurological (three cases), or both urological and neurological (four cases) deterioration. All patients underwent surgery via a microsurgical technique. At a mean follow-up time of 2 years, the only Group 1 patient with preoperative abnormal urodynamic findings normalized following <b>untethering,</b> whereas another asymptomatic patient showed worsened results on his postoperative study. In Group 2, all seven patients with preoperative neurological deterioration improved. Ten of the 15 patients who had isolated or associated preoperative clinical urological deterioration improved or stabilized, whereas five displayed continued deterioration in their bladder function. With respect to urodynamic studies, there was a significant increase in total and pressure-specific bladder capacities following <b>untethering.</b> We conclude that urodynamic studies are useful both diagnostically and in follow-up examinations of patients with tethered cord, that disturbances identified by these studies often precede clinical manifestations of deterioration, and that spinal cord <b>untethering</b> favorably influences the urological status in most patients...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} neurosurgical <b>untethering</b> on the lower urinary tract and male sexual function, in patients with tethered spinal cord. Thirty-six children with tethered spinal cord due to neurospinal dysraphism were assessed clinically and urodynamically before and after surgical <b>untethering.</b> Sexual function was evaluated in 14 boys before and after neurosurgery. In young boys, the assessment was by parental observation and was considered normal if erections had been observed regularly, or if the child had mentioned having an erection at any time. Older patients were asked if they had achieved voluntary erections {{and whether or not they}} were able to ejaculate. The mean follow-up was 91 months and the mean follow-up after neurosurgery was 34 months. A lasting improvement of urinary tract function occurred in only one patient, while another became worse. Seven children had temporary changes of bladder/sphincter function; two developed detrusor overactivity with sphincter dyssynergia and five had signs of bladder denervation. Long-term follow-up showed no permanent changes of lower urinary tract function in 94 % of 34 patients. Sexual function was considered normal in 13 boys. One boy apparently gradually lost erectile ability before <b>untethering</b> and regained it after surgery, while another boy had erectile dysfunction post-operatively for almost 6 months. Changes in bladder-sphincter function after <b>untethering</b> are usually transient and often the result of partial denervation. Although a small group of children seem to benefit from <b>untethering,</b> others can become worse and the individual outcome cannot be predicted. Erectile dysfunction can occur and parents and patients have to be informed of this possible complication. As pre-operative progression of neurological symptoms and post-operative denervation were observed only in patients with myelomeningocele and lipomyelomeningocele, this group may be distinct from patients with occult forms of spinal dysraphism. The natural history in the latter group of patients is unclear and a beneficial effect of prophylactic <b>untethering</b> remains to be proven by controlled prospective studie...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} neurosurgical intervention on the appearance of upper motor neuron (UMN) signs in newborns diagnosed with occult spinal dysraphism and tethered cord (TC) during {{the first month of}} life. METHODS: A prospective study (1990 to 1996) of 22 consecutive newborns with occult spinal dysraphism monitored for the appearance of UMN signs. <b>Untethering</b> was performed when neurologic or urodynamic investigation indicated the presence of UMN dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 22 patients, 10 remained free of UMN symptoms during follow-up (mean, 67 +/- 22 months). <b>Untethering</b> was performed in 12 of 22 patients {{because of the presence of}} UMN symptoms. In 7 of these 12 patients, there was a documented asymptomatic period of 13 +/- 11 months before the onset of UMN symptoms. <b>Untethering</b> at a mean age of 18 +/- 17 months restored normal neurologic and urinary function in all patients (mean postoperative follow-up, 25 +/- 16 months). Of the 12 children, 5 presented with UMN signs at birth. In these children, <b>untethering</b> was performed at a mean age of 9 +/- 5 months. In two of these five patients, UMN symptoms did not resolve after surgery, and ongoing conservative bladder treatment was required (mean follow-up, 37 +/- 14 months). In none of the 12 operated children did signs of retethering occur. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number (10 / 22) of children born with occult spinal dysraphism and TC did not develop UMN symptoms during follow-up; neurosurgical correction after the appearance of an UMN sign restored normal neurologic and urinary function in all children; and <b>untethering</b> in children presenting at birth with UMN symptoms resulted in poorer outcome. status: publishe...|$|R

After the primary retethering operation performed in symptomatic patients, recurrent retethering can occur with an increase of the syringomyelia signs and symptoms.

40|$|Background: Tethered cord {{syndrome}} (TCS) is {{a progressive}} clinical entity that arises from abnormal spinal cord tension. Scoliosis {{may be a}} unique symptom in TCS. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate prognosis after releasing the filum terminale in scoliosis due to TCS with/without findings in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to draw attention to the importance of somatosensorial evoked potentials (SSEP) on the differential diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis versus scoliosis due to TCS with normal appearance of filum terminale and conus medullaris. Materials and Methods: Eleven female and seven male patients with progressive scoliosis were included in the study. They were evaluated radiologically, SSEP and urodynamical studies. Preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior full spine X-rays were obtained for measuring the Cobb's angle. MRI was performed in all cases for probable additional spinal abnormalities. All patients underwent filum terminale sectioning through a L 5 hemilaminectomy. The resected filum terminale were subjected to histopathological examination. Results: The mean Cobb angle was 31. 6 ° (range 18 °– 45 °). Eight patients (44. 45 %) had a normal appearance of filum terminale and normal level conus medullaris in MRI, but conduction delay and/or block was seen on SSEP. In the histopathological examination of filum terminale dense collagen fibers, hyaline degeneration and loss of elastic fibers were observed. Postoperatively none of the patients showed worsening of the Cobb angle. Three patients showed improvement of scoliosis. Conclusion: In TCS presented with scoliosis, <b>untethering</b> must be performed prior to the corrective spinal surgery. Absence of MRI findings does not definitely exclude TCS. SSEP is an important additional guidance in the diagnosis of TCS. After <b>untethering,</b> a followup period of 6 months is essential to show it <b>untethering</b> helps in stopping the progress of the scoliotic curve.
