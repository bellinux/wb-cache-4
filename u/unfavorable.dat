5|$|A {{contact angle}} less than 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is <b>unfavorable,</b> so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E
5|$|A trade {{treaty was}} signed between the Commonwealth and Prussia, <b>unfavorable</b> to the Commonwealth. The Partition {{cut off the}} Commonwealth's access to the Baltic Sea, and the state {{had no choice but}} to accept the high tariffs imposed by Prussia.|$|E
5|$|AML which {{arises from}} a {{pre-existing}} myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative disease (so-called secondary AML) has a worse prognosis, as does treatment-related AML arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Sudal {{were from a}} {{persistent}} area of convection, or thunderstorms, southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia {{toward the end of}} March 2004. Initially, it was in an area of high wind shear, which is the change in wind direction with height and is <b>unfavorable</b> for tropical cyclogenesis. The <b>unfavorable</b> conditions gradually abated, which allowed convection to increase over a broad, developing circulation center. On April2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression near Chuuk in the FSM. It was later classified with the international designation of 0401, meaning it was the first tropical cyclone of 2004. Slow development continued as the system moved slowly westward, and two days later it was classified as Tropical Depression 03W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC); this was the third tropical cyclone tracked by the agency. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, after convection increased over the circulation.|$|E
5|$|These {{films were}} immensely popular with audiences, and were {{generally}} well received by critics, stapling Crawford's position {{as one of}} MGM's top female stars of the decade, along with Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, and Jean Harlow.

5|$|Tropical Depression One-C {{formed on}} July 26 from a {{disturbance}} {{that had been}} showing signs of organization {{for the past three}} days. It moved west to southwest through an <b>unfavorable</b> environment. On the morning of July 27, it dissipated due to strong wind shear caused by an upper-level trough. The system never impacted land, thus no damage was reported.|$|E

Báthory wished to recreate his native country into an independent, strong power, but the <b>unfavorable</b> international situation did not allow him to significantly advance any of his plans in that area. In addition to Hungarian, he was well versed in Latin, and spoke Italian and German; he never learned the Polish language.|$|E
5|$|After its release, Music Box {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. The album faced criticism regarding Carey's more mellow and lazy tone {{in comparison to}} her previous work. Despite some <b>unfavorable</b> reviews, the album became a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 and becoming Carey's first number-one album in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it Diamond, for shipments of ten million copies across the United States. Music Box remains Carey's highest seller with 28 million copies sold worldwide {{and is one of}} the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|Although, in many areas, Scalia's {{approach}} was <b>unfavorable</b> to criminal defendants, {{he took the}} side of defendants in matters involving the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television. In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, holding that defendants must {{have the opportunity to}} confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was a drug.|$|E
5|$|At Cape Canaveral, {{the space}} shuttle Discovery was {{considered}} to be safe on its launching pad after concerns of <b>unfavorable</b> weather, and NASA rescheduled a liftoff the following week; however, shuttle managers eventually decided to begin moving Discovery from the launching pad to ride out the storm. In Miami, the Booker T. Washington Senior High School opened as a voluntary evacuation shelter for all pre-registered special needs residents. Also, the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa evacuated its aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{made some}} new laws {{regarding}} the Jews, but {{while some of}} his edicts were <b>unfavorable</b> towards Jews, they were not harsher than those of his predecessors. It was made illegal for Jews to seek converts or to attack other Jews who had converted to Christianity. They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. On the other hand, Jewish clergy were given the same exemptions as Christian clergy.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} <b>unfavorable</b> vertical {{wind shear}} impacting Colin, deep thunderstorm activity developed atop its center of circulation. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft {{during the afternoon}} hours of August5 revealed that the system reached a peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). A few computer models, namely the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF), predicted that Colin would briefly attain hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|Development was {{initially}} slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air, and the depression became Tropical Storm Patricia later that day. Once {{clear of the}} <b>unfavorable</b> region, Patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification. Dramatic strengthening began late on October21 and continued through October23. Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|During and {{following}} the American Revolutionary War, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the westward thrust of Euro-American settlement led to {{the decline of the}} Overhill towns. The Cherokee were forced to cede most of their lands in this area through a series of <b>unfavorable</b> treaties with the United States, and they migrated to the south and west away from settler pressure for a time.|$|E
5|$|Each side {{considered}} {{how best}} to eliminate {{the threat posed by}} its opponent, and after Virginia returned each side tried to goad the other into attacking under <b>unfavorable</b> circumstances. Both captains declined the opportunity to fight in water not of their own choosing; Jeffers in particular was under positive orders not to risk his ship. Consequently, each vessel spent the next month in what amounted to posturing. Not only did the two ships not fight each other, neither ship ever fought again after March 9.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically <b>unfavorable</b> can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Following peak intensity, Adrian's cloud pattern {{became less}} symmetric, its eye became obscured, and its {{convection}} warmed as southeasterly wind shear increased and the storm passed over ocean temperatures near 77°F (25°C). The storm slowed {{as it passed}} near Socorro Island, all the while the continued <b>unfavorable</b> regime weakened Adrian and stripped it of its all convection. The system was reduced to an exposed swirl of clouds over the open East Pacific by late on June22.|$|E
5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would be {{expected}} that chlorine {{should be able to}} oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are <b>unfavorable,</b> and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Epsilon was {{the final}} of fifteen {{hurricane}}s within the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a cold front beneath an upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November29 about 915mi (1470km) east of Bermuda. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone within five days, due to conditions <b>unfavorable</b> for significant intensification. Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to the southwest, and later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joyce caused minor {{impact in}} the ABC and Windward islands during late September and early October 2000. The fourteenth {{tropical}} cyclone, tenth named storm, and sixth hurricane of the season, Joyce developed from a tropical wave located southwest of Cape Verde on September25. Only twelve hours after becoming a cyclone, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Joyce early on September 26. Joyce continued to strengthen and became a hurricane by September 27. On the following day, Joyce peaked with winds of 90mph (150km/h) on September28. After peak intensity on September 28, <b>unfavorable</b> conditions caused Joyce to become disorganized and weaken.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of <b>unfavorable</b> omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E
5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise <b>unfavorable</b> developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or <b>unfavorable</b> regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E
