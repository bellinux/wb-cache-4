40|$|The Grid Stiffened Analysis Tool {{contract}} is contract performed by Boeing under NASA purchase order H 30249 D. The contract {{calls for a}} "best effort" study comprised of two tasks: (1) Create documentation for a composite grid-stiffened structure analysis tool, {{in the form of}} a Microsoft EXCEL spread sheet, that was developed by originally at Stanford University and later further developed by the Air Force, and (2) Write a program that functions as a NASTRAN pre-processor to generate an FEM code for grid-stiffened structure. In performing this contract, Task 1 was given higher priority because it enables NASA to make efficient use of a unique tool they already have; Task 2 was proposed by Boeing because it also would be beneficial to the analysis of composite grid-stiffened structures, specifically in generating models for preliminary design studies. The {{contract is}} now complete, this package includes copies of the <b>user's</b> <b>documentation</b> for Task 1 and a CD ROM & diskette with an electronic copy of the <b>user's</b> <b>documentation</b> and an updated version of the "GRID 99 " spreadsheet...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{electric}} power industry, the average company’s enterprise system- i. e. the over-all system of IT related entities- is today highly complex. Technically, large organizations posses {{hundreds or thousands}} of extensively interconnected and heterogeneous single IT systems performing tasks that varies from enterprise resource planning to real-time control and monitoring of industrial processes. Moreover are these systems storing a wide variety of sometimes redundant data, and typically they are deployed on several different plat-forms. IT does, however, not execute in splendid isolation. Organizationally, the enterprise system embraces business processes and business units using as well as maintaining and acquiring the IT systems. The interplay between the organization and the IT systems are further determined by for instance business goals, ownership and governance structures, strategies, individual system <b>users,</b> <b>documentation,</b> and cost. Lately, Enterprise Architecture (EA) has evolved with the mission to take a holistic ap-proach to managing the above depicted enterprise system.

40|$|Documentation is an {{integral}} part of a software system. It contains the information that is necessary to effectively and successfully develop, use, and maintain a system. In practice, however, the creation of appropriate documentation is largely neglected. This paper investigates the reasons for this neglect and proposes an approach to improve the current situation. As the quality of documentation depends on its usage, the approach presented here realizes the software engineering principle separation of concerns to provide all <b>documentation</b> <b>users</b> with the <b>documentation</b> they require for performing their tasks. The approach has been empirically validated in a series of experiment and case studies of which one experiment is described here in more detail...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Many people believe that good documentation is important, yet few use it regularly and effectively. An attempt is made to find reasons for this contradictory behaviour, by examining the existing practices of providers and <b>users</b> of <b>documentation.</b> Reasons for not using documentation appear to fall into two classes; predictable interaction effects and unpredictable interaction effects. Providers usually try to predict the problems users {{are likely to have}} at the user-documentation interface, by following standard quality control procedures. When these fail to produce good <b>documentation,</b> <b>users</b> become dissatisfied and turn elsewhere for their information needs. On the other hand, good quality documentation may not be used for reasons which cannot be predicted, and often cannot be explained. An approach which suggests methods for dealing with both of these situations is formulated, and ideas for raising the status of documentation are discussed...|$|R
