50|$|Combat loading is {{a special}} type of <b>unit</b> <b>loading</b> of ships so that {{embarked}} forces will have immediately needed weapons, ammunition and supplies stowed {{in such a way}} that unloading of equipment will be concurrent with the force personnel and available for immediate combat during an amphibious landing. It gives primary consideration to the ease and sequence with which troops, equipment, and supplies can be unloaded ready for combat, rather than to the efficient use of cargo space as in convoy loading where forces and equipment would be joined in rear or secure areas. The art and science of combat loading were developed in World War II, and contributed greatly to the success of Allied amphibious campaigns. While combat loading usually took place in forward bases, the Western Task Force for the landings in North Africa was combat loaded at the Army's Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation which was called on again for the Sicily force.|$|E

Finally, some shipments are particularly restrictive to transport, like dangerous goods, live animals and perishable goods.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 - 10 Improved {{turbomachinery}} aerodynamic {{performance requirements}} have increased journal bearing operating speeds and loads well above traditionally acceptable values. For example, for high performance gearboxes, pinion bearing surface speed requirements are often over 325 f/s with bearing <b>unit</b> <b>loading</b> in the 500 psi range. In {{order to meet}} the design challenges for these severe applications, evaporated bearing housings have been utilized as an effective means of reduction journal bearing operating temperatures. Unfortunately, the use of evacuated housing designs has introduced a new and troubling phenomena - journal bearing starvation. This was never a problem with flooded designs with pressurized housings since any additional oil that may be required is simply drawn from the captured oil inside of the bearing housing. With the new evacuated housing designs, all required oil must be supplied by the oil inlet orifices. Often times, the amount of supply oil required to keep all pads from starving is well beyond reasonable. Thus, due to practicality, starvation in some form is allowed in almost all evacuated designs. This paper discusses evacuated journal bearing starvation and its possible detrimental effects on rotordynamics. Specifically, the effect of starvation on journal bearing stiffness and damping is investigated. A case history is presented showing the effect of increasing oil flow on the location and amplification of a gearbox pinion critical speed during new zero load mechanical testing. As flow increased and the bearing became less starved, the location of the critical increased while the amplification decreased indicating a strong dependency of bearing stiffness and damping on oil flow. Concurrently, a similar but smaller bearing was tested under zero load starvation conditions. Essentially no effect on stiffness and damping was evident. From these results, the authors conclude that although increasing the oil flow solved the problem, starvation in itself was not the cause...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores three {{consolidation}} problems {{derived from}} the daily operations of major international airfreight forwarders. First, we study the freight forwarder's unsplittable shipment planning problem in an airfreight forwarding network where a set of cargo shipments have to be transported to given destinations. We provide mixed integer programming formulations that use piecewise-linear cargo rates and account for volume and weight constraints, flight departure/arrival times, as well as shipment-ready times. After exploring the solution of such models using CPLEX, we devise two solution methodologies to handle large problem sizes. The first is based on Lagrangian relaxation, where the problems decompose into a set of knapsack problems {{and a set of}} network flow problems. The second is a local branching heuristic that combines branching ideas and local search. The two approaches show promising results in providing good quality heuristic solutions within reasonable computational times, for difficult and large shipment consolidation problems. Second, we further explore the freight forwarder's shipment planning problem with a different type of discount structure - the system-wide discount. The forwarder's cost associated with one flight depends not only on the quantity of freight assigned to that flight, but also on the total freight assigned to other flights operated by the same carrier. We propose a multi-commodity flow formulation that takes shipment volume and over-declaration into account, and solve it through a Lagrangian relaxation approach. We also model the "double-discount" scheme that incorporates both the common flight-leg discount (the one used in the unsplittable shipment problem) and the system-wide discount offered by cargo airlines. Finally, we focus on palletized loading using <b>unit</b> <b>loading</b> devices (ULDs) with pivots, which is different from what we assumed in the previous two research problems. In the international air cargo business, shipments are usually consolidated into containers; those are the ULDs. A ULD is charged depending on whether the total weight exceeds a certain threshold, called the pivot weight. Shipments are charged the under-pivot rate up to the pivot weight. Additional weight is charged at the over-pivot rate. This scheme is adopted for safety reasons to avoid the ULD overloading. We propose three solution methodologies for the air-cargo consolidation problem under the pivot-weight (ACPW), namely: an exact solution approach based on branch-and-price, a best fit decreasing loading heuristic, and an extended local branching. We found superior computational performance with a combination of the multi-level variables and a relaxation-induced neighborhood search for local branching...|$|E
