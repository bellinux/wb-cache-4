50|$|Neighboring {{districts were}} (from east clockwise) <b>Uecker-Randow,</b> Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Demmin and Nordvorpommern. The Hanseatic city of Greifswald was {{enclosed}} by the district, {{but did not}} belong to it.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Uecker" [...] {{originated}} in the Polabian word vikru/vikrus, meaning [...] "fast" [...] or [...] "quick". The Uecker gave {{its name to the}} Uckermark historical region and to the two districts Uckermark and <b>Uecker-Randow.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Uecker-Randow</b> was a Kreis ({{district}}) in {{the eastern}} part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. The district was created on 12 June 1994 by merging the previous districts Pasewalk, Ueckermünde and part of the district Strasburg. On 4 September 2011, it was merged into Vorpommern-Greifswald.|$|E
5000|$|Pasewalk (...) {{is a town}} in the Vorpommern-Greifswald district, in {{the state}} of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany. Located on the Uecker river, it is the capital of the former <b>Uecker-Randow</b> district, and the seat of the Uecker-Randow-Tal Amt of which it is not part.|$|E
50|$|From 2500 to 2000 BC, the Uckermark was not {{influenced}} by the Funnelbeaker culture, but by the Havelland culture, representing the northernmost area of this culture that was centered around the middle Elbe and Havel rivers. The Bay of Greifswald, Usedom and <b>Uecker-Randow</b> areas were under a weak influence of this culture also.|$|E
50|$|As part of {{the planned}} local {{government}} reform, from 2011 the districts of Rügen and Northern Hither Pomerania, {{and the town of}} Stralsund formed a reshaped district of Northern Hither Pomerania, and the districts of <b>Uecker-Randow,</b> together with the town of Greifswald and parts of the district of Demmin, became Hither Pomerania-Greifswald.|$|E
5000|$|The {{district}} {{was established by}} merging the former districts of Ostvorpommern and <b>Uecker-Randow</b> with the subdivisions of Jarmen-Tutow and Peenetal/Loitz and the former district-free town Greifswald, {{as part of the}} local government reform of September 2011. The name of the {{district was}} decided by referendum on 4 September 2011. The project name for the district was Südvorpommern.|$|E
50|$|Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a Kreis (district) in the {{southern}} part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. The district was created by merging the three previous districts Neubrandenburg, Neustrelitz and Strasburg in 1994. On 4 September 2011, it was merged into Mecklenburgische Seenplatte. Neighboring districts were (from the north clockwise) Demmin, Ostvorpommern <b>Uecker-Randow,</b> the districts Uckermark, Oberhavel and Ostprignitz-Ruppin in Brandenburg, and the district Müritz. The district-free city Neubrandenburg was nearly completely surrounded by the district.|$|E
50|$|The {{constituency}} {{was created}} {{as part of}} the 2012 federal boundary review, which saw the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern lose one of its 18 geographic constituencies as a result of population change. The constituency of Mecklenburg-Strelitz - <b>Uecker-Randow</b> was abolished, which in turn mandated changes to the boundaries of six nearby constituencies. Vorpommern-Rügen - Vorpommern-Greifswald I was created chiefly from the constituency of Stralsund - Nordvorpommern - Rügen, and took its district number of 15.|$|E
50|$|On the {{district}} level {{there is a}} special concentration in {{the district}} of Uckermark in Brandenburg and its neighbored (former) districts of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and <b>Uecker-Randow</b> in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and in the districts of Oberhavel, Barnim and Märkisch-Oderland in Brandenburg. This concentration of the surname can be a hint to the region of origin of the surname, but doesn't have to. It is also possible that several families got that surname because of the origin in a place without being related.|$|E
50|$|Mittelpommern or Mittelpommerscher Keil in {{historical}} and linguistical usage denote the south-central {{parts of the}} historical Duchy, later Province of Pomerania, roughly between the rivers Zarow and Ihna (Ina). This area differed {{from the rest of}} the duchy or province by the dialect of the inhabitants, who spoke the Central Pomeranian variety closely related to Märkisch-Brandenburgisch, as well as in the town law of the cities, which was Magdeburg Law (vs Lübeck Law in the other parts). Since World War II the Oder-Neisse line divides this area, reducing the German part to the <b>Uecker-Randow</b> district.|$|E
50|$|The {{source is}} near Penkun, {{from which the}} river flows both to the North and to the South. The {{southern}} fork ends with its confluence to the Welse river, the northern fork ends with the confluence with the Uecker only a few kilometers before reaching the Oder Lagoon. The swampy Randow valley is known as Randowbruch, the historical crossing of the Randowbruch swamps are at its narrowest point in Löcknitz. The river lent {{its name to the}} former district of <b>Uecker-Randow</b> in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, also to the historical Landkreis Randow of the Province of Pomerania.|$|E
50|$|After a year's private instruction, Harnack {{attended}} the Joachimsthalsche Gymnasium in Berlin, {{where he took}} the Abitur in 1907. Then he studied law at the University of Marburg and later in Berlin. On 6 May 1911, he took the bar examination and began afterwards working at a magistrate's Court in the Lichterfelde of Berlin. From 1 October 1911 to 30 September 1912, he spent a year doing military service as an Einjährig-Freiwilliger. From 2 August 1914 to 15 May 1915 {{he served in the}} First World War and was active with civil administration in Congress Poland. He began his official career on 8 March 1913 as a governmental junior lawyer in Oppeln. On 29 June 1918, he was appointed as a civil servant (Regierungsassessor) in the Ministry of Science, Art and National Education. He was promoted on 24 January 1921 to Regierungsrat. From 15 August 1921 to 9 November 1923 and from 1 June 1924 to 31 May 1925 he was a Landrat in Hersfeld-Rotenburg, with an appointment as Landrat in <b>Uecker-Randow</b> in the period between. On 1 June 1925 he was appointed vice head of the regional government (Regierungsvizepräsident) in Hanover. He was transferred on 1 April 1927 in the same position in Cologne. On 8 August 1929, he started as of the head of the provincial government (Regierungspräsident) in Merseburg.|$|E
40|$|The {{reunification of}} 1990 changed the {{patterns}} of geographical marginality in Germany. While some regions along the former Iron Curtain have become somewhat more central, regions along the German-Polish border have become even more peripheral. The focus {{of this paper is}} to shed more light on the causes for lagging economic performance in remote East German regions, using the county <b>Uecker-Randow</b> as a case study. The county Ludwigslust, located in the same federal state, but in a more favourable geographic location, is used as a reference. The results of the study are derived from statistical analysis, expert interviews and business surveys in the course of the EU project ‘DORA ’ (=Dynamics of Rural Areas). Contrary to other case study regions of the project, the results for <b>Uecker-Randow</b> suggest that here the geographic location and related deficits of transport infrastructure have in fact been the most decisive explanatory factor for economic decline in the post Socialist period. Additionally, the region has suffered from the unfavourable economic structure it inherited from Socialist modes of production...|$|E
40|$|According to the Ministry for Agriculture, Environment and Consumer Protection in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the avian (coming from birds) {{influenza}} virus of the subtype H 5 N 8 and hence poultry plague was detected in a fattening farm for turkeys {{in the former}} administrative district of <b>Uecker-Randow.</b> The subtype H 5 N 8 virus is characterised by its highly pathogenic (strong ability to cause disease) properties for birds. To date, {{there have been no}} known cases of human infections with the H 5 N 8 virus. While conceivable in theory, transmission of the pathogen (H 5 N 8) via infected food is unlikely. Past cases of transmission of other subtypes (H 5 N 1, H 7 N 9) of avian viruses from birds to humans have almost exclusively been attributable to direct contact with infected live birds. There is no evidence to date for the possibility of humans contracting the virus through raw eggs or raw sausage products made from poultry meat of infected animals. When handling and preparing raw poultry meat and poultry meat products, the rules of hygiene should always be applied. The BfR already published more extensive information on avian {{influenza virus}}es in 2007. The Internet pages of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (www. fli. bund. de), the Robert Koch Institute (www. rki. de) and the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (www. bmel. bund. de) contain more details on the subject of avian influenza. The topical section of the website of the Ministry for Agriculture, Environment and Consumer Protection of the Federal State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern provides information on the latest developments of the poultry plague at www. lu. regierung-mv. de/gefluegelpest (in German) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} make precise and forward-looking {{decisions}} in nearly all social fields, detailed information on the size and structure of prospective populations in specific regional areas is needed. For that purpose, this article will show how current trends of demographic parameters affect {{the development of the}} population in administrative districts of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania until 2030. Based upon population data from 1982 until 2005, provided by the Federal State Agency of Statistics of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, this paper presents a projection of the population as well as the aging and the sex proportion of the federal state until 2030. The development of off-county cities, counties and the whole federal state were calculated by applying the cohort-survival- method and prediction module of the Federal State Agency of Statistics of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The fertility and migration assumptions chosen, are following the assumptions of the last coordinated population projection of the Federal State Agency of Statistics of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (2007). The mortality assumptions enter the analysis analogously to the county- and sex-specific projections of life expectancy, as they are used within the Lee-Carter-method (1982 - 2005). The results show a population decrease of about 180. 000 inhabitants until 2030 for the entire federal state with strongest population loss until 2012. In the following years the outflow of people strongly decreases, because cohorts in migration relevant ages are missing. The population development of the six off-county cities is rather different. Rostock and Greifswald will note a population increase until 2030, whereas the number of residents in Wismar and Stralsund will be stable. Schwerin and Neubrandenburg will lose residents. Every county will diminish enormously; except Bad Doberan which has to count on a population increase, while <b>Uecker-Randow</b> and Demmin will lose most inhabitants. In the forthcoming years the counties will not only be shrinking, but they will also age above average. The mean age of all counties will grow by 10. 5 years until 2030. In the cities it will increase by 4. 4 years and for entire Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania it will increase by 8. 2 years. Counties with positive population development will age most slightly. The absolute quantity as well as the relative proportion of seniors (aged 64 +) and oldest old (aged 79 +) will grow in all counties. A similar picture {{can be seen in the}} cities, where the absolute quantities of oldest old and seniors will also increase, wheras the relative proportions are smaller. In 2030 the proportion of seniors of all cities will be below the federal state mean, except for Neubrandenburg. Overall, inhabitants aged 50 and older will increase, whilst persons in reproductive ages between 15 and 49 years will exhibit a declining proportion of population. Hence, the birth deficit will be further intensified. Moreover, a high predominance of men within the younger population could be discovered for the 1990 s. This predominance of men will be put forward as a cohort effect in older age groups during the following years. At county level it can be shown, that the projected values for the cities comparatively turn out to be more positive, whilst the projections for some counties give a more pessimistic outlook. The latter finding has to be traced back to the migration assumptions. This projection is on par with results of previous projections which also showed shrinkage and aging trends for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Updated federal state population quantities reflect both processes as well. The projected, further increasing absolute quantities of older and the decreasing quantities of young people in urban and less populated regions, imply an urgent need for action from political and economical decision makers. An age-appropriate infrastructure as well as a good performing care- and health system for the growing number of further aging persons are required to absorb the ongoing and projected trends. Political decisions have especially to be made for sparsely populated regions to maintain security of supply and infrastructure. " (author's abstract...|$|E
