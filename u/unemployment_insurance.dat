5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance,</b> old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{recommended}} {{that the federal government}} assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old-age pensions and <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance.</b> It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on need, an idea that became central to Macdonald's thinking about federal-provincial relations. Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} the 2010 midterm elections, Obama {{announced}} a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858billion Tax Relief, <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.|$|E

40|$|Because of the {{increase}} in <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurances</b> and the extension of employment policies, official statistical information about unemployment became important after 1900. How was unemployment to be measured? Appropriate categories and operational definitions were not available. Under these circumstances, what kind of measurement procedures were developed? To what extent were the conceptualization of unemployment and its measurement distinct stages in the process of measurement? The historical and statistical analysis of the practice of the registration of unemployment will provide answers...|$|R
5|$|Ryan {{voted to}} extend <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush {{administration}} to propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E
5|$|Wilder {{was drafted}} into the Army on September 10, 1956. At the end of recruit training, he was {{assigned}} to the medical corps and sent to Fort Sam Houston for training. He was then given the opportunity to choose any post that was open, and wanting to stay near New York City to attend acting classes at the HB Studio, he chose to serve as paramedic in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Valley Forge Army Hospital, in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. In November 1957, his mother died from ovarian cancer. He was discharged from the army a year later and returned to New York. A scholarship to the HB Studio allowed him to become a full-time student. At first living on <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> and some savings, he later supported himself with odd jobs such as a limousine driver and fencing instructor.|$|E
5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield resumed {{her work}} for NUGMW and was re-elected to the TUC Council. In 1926 she {{supported}} the TUC's decision {{to hold a}} General Strike, and also the decision to call it off after nine days. Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour candidate at Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of unemployment benefit. Her private view, that entitlement to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely shared in the Labour Party or the TUC. When the committee made recommendations along these lines she signed the report, which became {{the basis of the}} <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> Act 1927. Bondfield's association with this legislation permanently shadowed her relationship with the Labour movement.|$|E
50|$|A November 2011 {{report by}} the Congressional Budget Office found that even if {{unemployment}} benefits convince some unemployed to ignore job openings, these openings were quickly filled by new entrants into the labor market. A survey of studies on <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance's</b> effect on employment by the Political Economy Research Institute found that unemployed who collected benefits did not find themselves out of work longer than those who didn’t have unemployment benefits; and that unemployed workers did not search for work more or reduce their wage expectations once their benefits ran out.|$|R

She focused on matters of culture, senior citizens, {{disabled}} people and medical ethics. Previously she was State Secretary for Social Affairs and Employment in the Fourth Balkenende cabinet and an alderwoman of the municipality of The Hague.

30|$|The {{administrative}} data {{are based on}} the notification procedure for the German health, pension, and <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurances.</b> This requires all employers to report the necessary information on their workers if covered by the system, where misreporting is legally prohibited. Thus, among others, civil servants, self-employed, and individuals in marginal employment are not included. All in all, about 80 per cent of all people employed in Germany are covered by the social security system. Inter alia, the data include information for every worker on the daily gross wage, age, education, sex, nationality, tenure, occupation, and industry at the 30 th of June of each year.|$|R
5|$|Macdonald also {{urged the}} federal Conservative {{government}} of R. B. Bennett to increase {{financial support to}} poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (<b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance,</b> social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid). See Post-World War II economic expansion for further discussion.|$|E
5|$|The new {{voting system}} {{increased}} the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly {{as a result}} of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum encyclical of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social insurance scheme, including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary old-age insurance (1900) and <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} the effects of joining a Swedish labour market {{programme}} has been examined by Barbara Sianesi [...] who found it having mixed effects: if it had increased employment rates in its participants, these had also been found to remain «significantly longer» on benefits and into the unemployment programme, especially for those entering a programme just after having been entitled to unemployment grants. The potential “locking-in effects” have to be inquired and solved as well: nowadays, some working categories (women with part-time jobs, manpower-employed, seasonal workers, students, own-businessmen, …) misuse the unemployment benefits; some administrative courts cases are expected to clarify these categories’ position about <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurances.</b>|$|R
3000|$|... “All {{employees}} who are subject {{to at least one}} of the following compulsory insurances are liable to social security: health insurance, long-term care <b>insurance,</b> pension <b>insurance,</b> <b>unemployment</b> and accident <b>insurance.</b> However, not liable to social security and thus not included in the data are civil servants, conscripts, those doing alternative civilian service, self-employed, judges, scholars, students, pensioners, clergy and others.” (Spengler 2008, p.  502).|$|R
50|$|Among the PSOE {{election}} pledges {{were the}} creation of 800,000 employments, the nationalization of banks in a critical economic situation and the decrease of retirement age from 69 to 64, {{as well as to}} establish the maximum working time at 40-hour week. It also proposed a wide range of social policies: raising taxes to higher incomes, increasing lowest-earning pensions, promotion of public companies, to increase control and monitoring of companies by workers, to expand <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurances</b> and to reduce social inequality through the social security. Regarding NATO, the PSOE was also a staunch advocate of Spain's exit from the organization, though eventually it would defend a 'Yes' vote in the 1986 referendum on NATO membership.|$|R
5|$|Lavagna {{proposed}} to slow {{economic growth and}} control inflation. Kirchner rejected this, promoting wage increases to reduce economic inequality and extending <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> {{and other types of}} social welfare. Public services such as public transportation, electricity, gas and water supply were subsidized and kept at low prices. Food industries were subsidied as well. The subsidies eventually expanded to several uncommon areas. This increased the economic activity, but also increased inflation and reduced the private investment in those areas. Unable to control inflation, the government influenced the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina, which under-reported it, as well as poverty (which was calculated with the inflation figures). The superpowers law, sanctioned during the crisis, was prorrogated and eventually made permanent in 2006; this law allowed the president to rearrange the budget with supervision from the Congress. Kirchner sought to win over the Argentine Workers' Central Union and leaders of more moderate piquetero factions to reduce the chances of strikes and protests. He nevertheless continued to oppose hard-line elements of the piquetero movement, such as that of Raúl Castells. Kirchner's policy helped to fragment the piqueteros, with some declaring their allegiance to him and others continuing to oppose him. Their usual system of protest (blocking streets) made them highly unpopular. However, Kirchner refused to suppress the piquetero demonstrations to avoid the risk of further violence.|$|E
25|$|The union {{lost more}} than half of its members {{in the first years of}} the Great Depression as {{construction}} dwindled to almost nothing.

30|$|The {{employee}} history {{used for}} constructing the LIAB {{is based on}} the integrated notification procedure for the health, pension, and <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurances.</b> 2 This procedure requires all employers to report all information of their employees if covered by the social security system, where misreporting is legally prohibited. Notifications are compulsory at {{the beginning and the end}} of employment. Additionally, an annual report must be provided for each employee employed on the 31 st December of the year. As a consequence, only those workers, salaried employees, and trainees who are covered by social security are included. Thus, among others, civil servants, self-employed, those in marginal employment, students enrolled in higher education, and family workers are not included. All in all, approximately 80  per cent of all people employed in Germany are part of the employee history.|$|R

25|$|In {{domestic}} policy, {{a number}} of social security reforms were carried out during Smuts’s second period in office as Prime Minister.
