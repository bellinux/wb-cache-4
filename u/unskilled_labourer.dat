5|$|By 1920, the Barry Railway Company had a {{workforce}} of 3169, {{of which}} 890 were <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourers,</b> and operated 148 steam locomotives, 194 carriages and brake vans, and 2,316 wagons and trucks.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} project {{was not without}} controversy. <b>Unskilled</b> <b>labourers</b> were only paid agricultural wages producing strikes, national and governmental debate over wages, conditions, and spending over-runs. Despite this, there was a final cost overrun for Siemens of £150,000.|$|R
60|$|The next day, having keyed {{himself up}} to an {{exhausting}} high- tension, he earned two dollars and a half. His fellow workers favoured him with scowls and black looks, and made remarks, slangily witty and {{which he did not}} understand, about sucking up to the boss and pace-making and holding her down, when the rains set in. He was astonished at their malingering on piece-work, generalized about the inherent laziness of the <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourer,</b> and proceeded next day to hammer out three dollars' worth of boxes.|$|E
60|$|Times were hard. Work of {{any sort}} was {{difficult}} to get. And work {{of any sort}} was what I had to take, for I was still an <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourer.</b> I had no thought of career. That was over and done with. I had to find food for two mouths beside my own and keep a roof over our heads--yes, and buy a winter suit, my one suit being decidedly summery. I had to {{get some sort of}} work immediately. After that, when I had caught my breath, I might think about my future.|$|E
6000|$|He learned many things, and {{generalized}} {{much and}} often erroneously, {{all of which}} {{can be found in the}} pages of The <b>Unskilled</b> <b>Labourer.</b> He saved himself, however, after the sane and conservative manner of his kind, by labelling his generalizations as [...] "tentative." [...] One of his first experiences was in the great Wilmax Cannery, where he was put on piece-work making small packing cases. A box factory supplied the parts, and all Freddie Drummond had to do was to fit the parts into a form and drive in the wire nails with a light hammer.|$|E

5000|$|Locals know it as [...] "Shat", {{which appears}} to be an {{abbreviation}} of [...] "Shatterers" [...] which is what the locals were known as. Local labour was taken on during construction of the railway to break or 'shatter' rocks as well as work on the excavations. These <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourers</b> were referred to as Shatterers.|$|R
60|$|I {{was taken}} out and shown my duties. Also, I was told the terms of my employment--a ten-hour day, {{every day in the}} month {{including}} Sundays and holidays, with one day off each month, with a salary of thirty dollars a month. It wasn't exciting. Years before, at the cannery, I had earned a dollar a day for a ten-hour day. I consoled myself with the thought that the reason my earning capacity had not increased with my years and strength was because I had remained an <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourer.</b> But it was different now. I was beginning to work for skill, for a trade, for career and fortune, and the superintendent's daughter.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Britling {{helped him}} pack a bag, and came {{with him to}} the station in order to drive the car back to the Dower House; for the gardener's boy who had {{hitherto}} attended to these small duties had now gone off as an <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourer</b> to some munition works at Chelmsford. Mr. Britling sat in the slow train that carried him across country to the junction for Filmington, and failed altogether to realise {{what had happened to the}} old lady. He had an absurd feeling that it was characteristic of her to intervene in affairs in this manner. She had always been so tough and unbent an old lady that until he saw her he could not imagine her as being really seriously and pitifully hurt....|$|E
6000|$|In no way is this {{disappearance}} of specialisation more marked than in military and naval affairs. In the great days of Greece and Rome {{war was a}} special calling, requiring a special type of man. In the Middle Ages war had an elaborate technique, in which the footman played the part of an <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourer,</b> and even within {{a period of a}} hundred years it took a long period of training and discipline before the common discursive man could be converted into the steady soldier. Even to-day traditions work powerfully, through extravagance of uniform, and through survivals of that mechanical discipline that was so important in the days of hand-to-hand fighting, to keep the soldier something other than a man. For all the lessons of the Boer war we are still inclined to believe that the soldier has to be something severely parallel, carrying a rifle he fires under orders, obedient to the pitch of absolute abnegation of his private intelligence. We still think that our officers have, like some very elaborate and noble sort of performing animal, to be [...] "trained." [...] They learn to fight with certain specified [...] "arms" [...] and weapons, instead of developing intelligence enough to use anything that comes to hand.|$|E

Klein gained unfavourable national attention by blaming eastern [...] "creeps and bums" [...] for straining the city's social services and police. Prior to entering provincial politics, Klein considered himself a Liberal Party supporter, although he did support the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Brian Mulroney in the 1988 federal election.|$|R
5000|$|The weekly rent was 2.50 crowns, {{about as}} much as a Bettgeher would {{have to pay for the}} use of a bed, which made it a very {{affordable}} lodging for <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourers</b> or journeyman artisans with an annual income of about 1,000 crowns. When the dormitory opened, the Viennese press praised it as [...] "fantastical quarters, a paradise on earth" [...] and as a [...] "wonder of elegance and inexpensiveness".|$|R
60|$|And what I {{desire to}} impress upon you, and through you upon this country, {{is that the}} casual <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourer</b> who is habitually under-employed, who is lucky to get three, or at the outside four, days' work in the week, who may often {{be out of a}} job for three or four weeks at a time, who in bad times goes under altogether, and who in good times has no hope of {{security}} and no incentive to thrift, whose whole life and the lives of his wife and children are embarked in a sort of blind, desperate, fatalistic gamble with circumstances beyond his comprehension or control, that this poor man, this terrible and pathetic figure, is not as a class the result of accident or chance, is not casual because he wishes to be casual, is not casual as the consequence of some temporary disturbance soon put right. No; the casual labourer is here because he is wanted here. He is here in answer to a perfectly well-defined demand. He is here as the result of economic causes which have been too long unregulated. He is not the natural product, he is an article manufactured, called into being, to suit the requirements, in the Prime Minister's telling phrase, of all industries at particular times and of particular industries at all times.|$|E
60|$|I {{made the}} later and larger {{part of this}} speech to the silent wood, for the two policemen had {{vanished}} almost {{as quickly as they}} came. It is very possible, of course, that they were fairies. In that case the somewhat illogical character of their view of crime, law, and personal responsibility would find a bright and elfish explanation; perhaps if I had lingered in the glade till moonrise I might have seen rings of tiny policemen dancing on the sward; or running about with glow-worm belts, arresting grasshoppers for damaging blades of grass. But taking the bolder hypothesis, that they really were policemen, I find myself in a certain difficulty. I was certainly accused of something which was either an offence or was not. I was let off because I proved I was a guest at a big house. The inference seems painfully clear; either it is not a proof of infamy to throw a knife about in a lonely wood, or else it is a proof of innocence to know a rich man. Suppose a very poor person, poorer even than a journalist, a navvy or <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourer,</b> tramping in search of work, often changing his lodgings, often, perhaps, failing in his rent. Suppose he had been intoxicated with the green gaiety of the ancient wood. Suppose he had thrown knives at trees and could give no description of a dwelling-place except that he had been fired out of the last. As I walked home through a cloudy and purple twilight I wondered how he would have got on.|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} a group of <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourers</b> who worked {{wherever}} there was a need. In many cases these people offered their work or skill {{as an act of}} mercy because as Christians they were willing to collaborate on a great work dedicated to their God. In any case they received a remuneration that was either by the day or per piece. In documents many names appear on lists of daily wages so this act was not arbitrary but rather well regulated.|$|R

25|$|Skinnand was {{a village}} of just 12 people in 1801, {{according}} to the Census returns. The population did rise slightly over the next 100 years, to 30 in 1901, but by 1921 numbers were once again decreasing and the figure stood at 25. Census returns also reveal {{that most of the}} village men worked on the land as <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourers.</b> The children of these poor labourers attended school at Wellingore, just south of Navenby, and at Carlton-le-Moorland and Bassingham - each village several miles walk away.|$|R
25|$|In 1963, a {{vocational}} wing {{was added}} on. This addition was {{perceived by the}} board as a move that was long overdue. It felt that the courses that were offered at that time were mainly geared 10 help prepare students for university entrance. These new programmes that would be available would better prepare a student with marketable skills for the job force. At that point in Canadian history, the market for <b>unskilled</b> <b>labourers</b> was rapidly diminishing due to automation in industry and its rapid growth.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Unskilled</b> <b>labourers</b> and {{soldiers}} could quickly assemble prefabricated [...] sections of track weighing about [...] along roads or over smooth terrain.

Derailments were common, {{but the light}} rolling stock was relatively easy to rerail. [...] Steam locomotives typically carried a short length of flexible pipe (called a water-lifter) to refill water tanks from flooded shell holes.|$|R
