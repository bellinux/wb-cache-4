2500|$|From 1 June 2015, all minors {{under the}} age of 18 {{travelling}} in and out of South Africa must hold, in addition to their passport, an unabridged birth certificate with particulars of both parents. The requirement applies to both domestic and foreign citizens. If the child is travelling with only one parent, an affidavit with the absent parent's consent is required. If the child is travelling with another adult and without neither parents, an affidavit with consent of both parents must be produced. An <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor,</b> in addition to holding the affidavit and birth certificate, must in addition provide the information of the local South African host. The rule has been widely criticized by the tourism industry, but officials claimed that the rule was implemented to fight the widespread human trafficking in South Africa. By October 2016 [...] over 13,000 tourists had been prevented from entered the country due to the unabridged birth certificate requirement having a negative impact on the economy.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a series}} of cases before the Texas Supreme Court in 2000, the court was asked to {{construe}} {{for the first time}} the 1999 Texas parental notification law forbidding a physician from performing an abortion on a pregnant, <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> without giving notice to the minor's parents at least 48 hours before the procedure. However, Texas legislators adopted a policy to create a judicial bypass exception in those cases where (1) the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to make the decision to have an abortion performed without notification to either of her parents; (2) notification will not be in the best interest of the minor or (3) notification may lead to physical, sexual or emotional abuse of the minor. The court was asked in these cases to discern legislative intent for the first time to these subjective standards, presumably included in the law as a matter of Texas policy and to make the law constitutional under U.S. Supreme Court precedents. In the seven parental notification decisions rendered by the court, Gonzales voted to grant one bypass. For In re Jane Doe 5 his concurring opinion began with the sentence, [...] "I fully join in the Court's judgment and opinion." [...] He went on, though, to address the three dissenting opinions, primarily one by Nathan L. Hecht alleging that the court majority's members had disregarded legislative intent in favor of their personal ideologies. Gonzales's opinion dealt mostly with how to establish legislative intent. He wrote, [...] "We take the words of the statute as the surest guide to legislative intent. Once we discern the Legislature's intent we must put it into effect, even if we ourselves might have made different policy choices." [...] He added, [...] "o construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to eliminate bypasses, or to create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words of the statute, would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism," [...] and [...] "While the ramifications of such a law and the results of the Court's decision here may be personally troubling to me as a parent, it is my obligation as a judge to impartially apply the laws of this state without imposing my moral view on the decisions of the Legislature." ...|$|E

40|$|Irregular {{migration}} by <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> {{has become}} an increasingly prevalent global issue. <b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> who have fled their countries of origin, often due to persecution, violence, or poverty, present an opportunity for migrant smugglers and human traffickers who exploit their unique vulnerabilities and dependence. Smuggling and trafficking are often fluid, interrelated phenomena, making practical distinctions difficult. This article explores the protection of smuggled and trafficked <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> under the United Nations Protocols against the Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons. While each Protocol includes mandatory provisions pertaining to criminalization, it explains that neither Protocol adequately protects <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors,</b> addresses their unique vulnerabilities, or accounts for the often-blurred distinction between minors who are smuggled migrants and minors who are victims of trafficking. In light of these issues, this article argues that a coherent, protection-based approach, founded on international human rights and refugee law, is necessary. This article outlines rights and principles integral to such an approach, and analyses their particular application to smuggled and trafficked <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> It posits that the emphasis on criminal, preventative, and border control aspects of smuggling and trafficking comes {{at the expense of}} more nuanced understandings of the experiences and vulnerabilities of smuggled and trafficked <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors,</b> despite the pressing and evident need for a more substantive framework for their protection...|$|R

40|$|The {{legal rights}} of {{children}} who enter a country without their parents or other guardians, {{including the right to}} legal representation in immigration proceedings, differ vastly across the globe. This Article is the first to show that <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> lie at the nexus of international and regional human rights standards governing the treatment of immigrants, children, and civil counsel and to show how the development of human rights standards in these three areas underscores the importance of and the need for counsel for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> Part I illustrates why <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in the United States need legal representation by focusing on the complexity of immigration proceedings, the likelihood that children will be deprived of their liberty {{at some point in the}} process, and the law and practice relating to representation. Part II analyzes how developing regional and international legal standards for children‚Äôs rights, refugee rights, and the right to free civil counsel support the right to free legal counsel for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings. Part III identifies the differing approaches to legal representation for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> around the world, and Part IV endorses a model for representation for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> based on developing human rights law as well as best practices and ethical standards in the United States. The Article concludes that the recommended model should be at the forefront of U. S. legislative consideration so that the United States does not continue to run afoul of well-developed principals of human rights law affecting <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors...</b>|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a qualitative study that explored the sexual health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in the London Boroughs of Enfield and Haringey. It begins {{by providing the}} policy context and outlining {{the rationale for the}} research undertaken. Although there is a growing body of literature and research available on refugees and asylum-seekers, less is known about the health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> This is especially true of sexual health. The introductory section to the report shows how this case study of an exploration of the nature and level of sexual and reproductive health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in Enfield and Haringey can provide important new information that can help policy development and implementation in this area at both a local and national level. The background section also explains the qualitative research methods used by the research team. The research findings are then presented in five sections that address research objectives one and two: firstly, exploring the nature and level of sexual and reproductive health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in Enfield and Haringey; secondly, assessing the accessibility and appropriateness of current sexual health, family planning and young peoples‚Äô service provision in meeting the identified needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> Section one covers the background characteristics of the <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> involved in the study, such as age, gender, country of origin, length of time in the UK and the countries of origin. This section shows the diversity of the sample. Following this, in section two, it is shown that although those young people interviewed all have their own individual stories, there are common themes to these experiences. These common themes relate to their accounts of leaving their home country, travelling to the UK and establishing themselves in Enfield and Haringey. Sections three, four and five explore the findings generated from the two sets of interviews: with the <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors,</b> and with the professionals. Sexual health needs cannot be seen in isolation, so section three looks at the social care needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> and their likely sources of support. These issues are important because they give some indication of where, and how, sexual health needs might be addressed. Section four then moves on to consider general health needs, before section five focuses upon sexual health. The report ends with a conclusion and recommendations, thus addressing the final research objective: identifying how local health promoting programmes and local sexual health services can develop and deliver appropriate interventions to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors...</b>|$|R
