60|$|For here I {{should say}} that as though by common consent the battle had been stayed; we no longer {{attacked}} and the enemy no longer ran.

60|$|In {{spite of}} strenuous and {{diplomatic}} efforts on his part, M. le Duc d'Aumont {{had been unable}} to obtain any further explanation of these extraordinary events from his daughter. Lydie had no intention whatever of deceiving her father and she had given him what she believed to be a perfectly faithful exposé of the situation. All that she had kept back from him was the immediate cause of the grave misunderstanding between herself and her husband, and we must do her the justice to state that she did not think that this was relevant to the <b>ultimate</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
6000|$|When Lingard {{had decided}} to proceed by way of {{negotiation}} she had asked him on what he based his hope of success; and he had answered her: [...] "On my luck." [...] What he really depended on was his prestige; {{but even if he}} had been aware of such a word he would not have used it, since it would have sounded like a boast. And, besides, he did really believe in his luck. Nobody, either white or brown, had ever doubted his word and that, of course, gave him great assurance in entering upon the negotiation. But the <b>ultimate</b> <b>issue</b> of it would be always a matter of luck. He said so distinctly to Mrs. Travers at the moment of taking leave of her, with Jorgenson already waiting for him in the boat that was to take them across the lagoon to Belarab's stockade.|$|E
6000|$|This, in my judgment, is the <b>ultimate</b> <b>issue</b> of Descartes' argument; but it {{is proper}} for me {{to point out that}} we have left Descartes himself some way behind us. He stopped at the famous formula, [...] "I think, {{therefore}} I am." [...] But a little consideration will show this formula to be full of snares and verbal entanglements. In the first place, the [...] "therefore" [...] has no business there. The [...] "I am" [...] is assumed in the [...] "I think," [...] which is simply another way of saying [...] "I am thinking." [...] And, in the second place, [...] "I think" [...] is not one simple proposition, but three distinct assertions rolled into one.

Later that year, Prager became the Monday-Thursday talk show host for KABC, but he refused to work on Friday night, the beginning of Shabbat.

50|$|Among {{the early}} Anglican divines of the 16th and 17th centuries, {{the names of}} Thomas Cranmer, John Jewel, Matthew Parker, Richard Hooker, Lancelot Andrewes and Jeremy Taylor predominate. The {{influential}} character of Hooker's Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity cannot be overestimated. Published in 1593 and subsequently, Hooker's eight-volume work is primarily a treatise on church-state relations, but it deals comprehensively with issues of biblical interpretation, soteriology, ethics and sanctification. Throughout the work, Hooker makes clear that theology involves prayer and is concerned with <b>ultimate</b> <b>issues</b> and that theology is relevant to the social mission of the church.|$|R
60|$|There {{will be a}} Second Chamber, and, as in the Transvaal, it will be nominated, for {{the first}} Parliament only, by the Governor, under {{instructions}} from the Secretary of State. It is not an hereditary Chamber; and it may be, therefore, assumed that the distribution of Parties in that Chamber will be attended by some measure of impartiality, and {{that there will be}} some general attempt to select only those persons who are really fit to exercise the important functions entrusted to them. But even so protected, the Government feel that in the <b>ultimate</b> <b>issue</b> in a conflict between the two Chambers, the first and representative Chamber must prevail. The other body may review and may suspend, but for the case of measures sent up in successive sessions from the representative Chamber on which no agreement can be reached, we have introduced the machinery which appears in the Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, that both Chambers shall sit together, debate together, vote together, and the majority shall decide. The whole success of that operation depends upon the numerical proportion observed between the two Chambers. In the Australian Commonwealth the proportion of the First Chamber is rather more than two to one; in the Transvaal the proportion will be more than four to one, namely, sixty-five to fifteen; and in the Orange River Colony it will be thirty-eight to eleven.|$|E
6000|$|The process {{still goes}} on, and {{there can be}} little doubt of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>issue.</b> The old small {{manufacturers}} are either ruined or driven into sweating and the slums; the old coaching innkeeper and common carrier have been impoverished or altogether superseded by the railways and big carrier companies; the once flourishing shopkeeper lives to-day on the mere remnants of the trade that great distributing stores or the branches of great companies have left him. Tea companies, provision-dealing companies, tobacconist companies, make the position of the old-established private shop unstable and the chances of the new beginner hopeless. Railways and tramways take the custom more and more effectually past the door of the small draper and outfitter to the well-stocked establishments at the centre of things; telephone and telegraph assist that shopping at the centre more and more. The small [...] "middle-class" [...] school-master finds himself beaten by revived endowed schools and by new public endowments; the small doctor, the local dentist, find Harley Street always nearer to them and practitioners in motor-cars from the great centres playing havoc with their practices. And while the small men are more and more distressed, the great organizations of trade, of production, of public science, continue to grow and coalesce, until at last they grow into national or even world trusts, or into publicly-owned monopolies. In America slaughtering and selling meat has grown into a trust, steel and iron are trustified, mineral oil is all gathered into a few hands. All through the trades and professions and sciences and all over the world the big eats up the small, the new enlarged scale replaces the old.|$|E
6000|$|Swift {{remained}} {{very much}} alive. Harding, for printing the obnoxious letter, {{had been arrested}} and imprisoned, and the Crown proceeded with his prosecution. In such circumstances Swift was not likely to remain idle. On the 26th October he addressed a letter to Lord Chancellor Midleton in defence of the Drapier's writings, and practically acknowledged himself to be the author.[3] It was not actually printed until 1735, {{but there is no}} doubt that Midleton received it at the time it was written. What effect it had on the <b>ultimate</b> <b>issue</b> is not known; but Midleton's conduct justifies the confidence Swift placed in him. The Grand Jury of the Michaelmas term of 1724 sat to consider the bill against Harding. On the 11th of November Swift addressed to them his [...] "Seasonable Advice." [...] The bill was thrown out. Whitshed, the Chief Justice, consistently with his action on a previous occasion (see vol. vii.), angrily remonstrated with the jury, demanded of them their reasons for such a decision, and finally dissolved them. This unconstitutional, and even disgraceful conduct, however, served but to accentuate the resentment of the people against Wood and the patent, and the Crown fared no better by a second Grand Jury. The second jury accompanied its rejection of the bill by a presentment against the patent,[4] and the defeat of the [...] "prerogative" [...] became assured. Every where the Drapier was acclaimed the saviour of his country. Any person who could scribble a doggerel or indite a tract rushed into print, and now Whitshed was harnessed to Wood in a pillory of contemptuous ridicule. Indeed, so bitter was the outcry against the Lord Chief Justice, that it is said to have hastened his death. The cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford passed resolutions declaring the uttering of Wood's halfpence to be highly prejudicial to his Majesty's revenue and to the trades of the kingdom. The Drapier was now the patriot, and the whole nation responded to his appeal to assist him in its own defence.|$|E
50|$|The {{expert witness}} {{testimony}} {{is confined to}} giving an opinion on whether the defendant had a serious mental disorder {{at the time of}} the offense, and explaining the symptoms and characteristics of any diagnosis given, including other testimony regarding the defendant's mental status (mens Rea) and motivation. The expert witness cannot make a statement addressing the issue of whether the legal test for insanity has been met. That is left to the judge and jury. The restriction of expert opinion on <b>ultimate</b> <b>issues</b> includes any testimony on the criminal elements, including testimony that would bear on the mental state of the defendant relevant to ultimate legal decisions to be decided by the triers of fact.|$|R
6000|$|Fletcher Christian, {{although}} what {{is called}} a high-spirited youth, was not quick to resent injury or insult. On the contrary, he had borne with much forbearance the oft-repeated and coarse insolence of his superior. His natural expression was bright and his temperament sunny. He possessed a powerful frame and commanding stature, was agile and athletic, and a favourite with officers and men. But Bligh's conduct had soured him. His countenance was now changed. The last insult about the cocoa-nuts, delivered openly, was more than he could bear. [...] "When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war."

40|$|Cardiovascular {{gene therapy}} is {{becoming}} a clinical reality due to improved vectors, delivery systems and careful experimental validation studies.

Currently, the most efficient vectors available are replication-defec-tive adenoviral vectors, but transgene expression is limited in time due to a strong immune response. Conversely, non-viral vectors or plasmid DNA may be used safely but have very limited efficiency. Percutaneous, catheter-based delivery is feasible for most applications. The <b>ultimate</b> <b>issues</b> that will decide of the future of gene therapy are safety of the transfer and delivery techniques as well as costreffectiveness comparisons with alternative therapies, including local delivery of drugs, proteins andror mechanical devices. q 199...|$|R
60|$|If, however, I {{have had}} no reason to regret my hasty advance, as far as regards the <b>ultimate</b> <b>issue</b> of the struggle, I have yet found it to {{occasion}} much misconception of the character, and some diminution of the influence, of the present essay. For though the work has been received as only in sanguine moments I had ventured to hope, though I have had the pleasure of knowing that in many instances its principles have carried with them a strength of conviction amounting to a demonstration of their truth, and that, even where it has had no other influence, it has excited interest, suggested inquiry, and prompted to a just and frank comparison of Art with Nature; yet this effect would have been greater still, had not the work been supposed, as it seems to have been by many readers, a completed treatise, containing a systematized statement of the whole of my views on the subject of modern art. Considered as such, it surprises me that the book should have received the slightest attention. For what respect could be due to a writer who pretended to criticise and classify the works of the great painters of landscape, without developing, or even alluding to, one single principle of the beautiful or sublime? So far from being a completed essay, it is little more than the introduction to the mass of evidence and illustration which I have yet to bring forward; it treats of nothing but the initiatory steps of art, states nothing but the elementary rules of criticism, touches only on merits attainable by accuracy of eye and fidelity of hand, and leaves for future consideration every one of the eclectic qualities of pictures, all of good that is prompted by feeling, and of great that is guided by judgment; and its function and scope should the less have been mistaken, because I have not only most carefully arranged the subject in its commencement, but have given frequent references throughout to the essays by which it is intended to be succeeded, in which I shall endeavor to point out the signification and the value of those phenomena of external nature which I have been hitherto compelled to describe without reference either to their inherent beauty, or to the lessons which may be derived from them.|$|E
60|$|The {{electric}} bell rang three times, and we crept forward--halted--looked around, forward again--halt again--another look round; and so, yard by yard, we approached Colenso. Half {{a mile away}} we stopped finally. The officer, taking a sergeant with him, went on towards the village on foot. I followed. We soon reached the trenches {{that had been made}} by the British troops before they evacuated the place. 'Awful rot giving this place up,' said the officer. 'These lines took us a week to dig.' From here Colenso lay exposed about two hundred yards away--a silent, desolate village. The streets were littered with the belongings of the inhabitants. Two or three houses had been burned. A dead horse lay in the road, his four legs sticking stiffly up in the air, his belly swollen. The whole place had evidently been ransacked and plundered by the Boers and the Kaffirs. A few natives loitered near {{the far end of the}} street, and one, alarmed at the aspect of the train, waved a white rag on a stick steadily to and fro. But no Dutchmen were to be seen. We made our way back to the railway line and struck it at the spot where it was cut. Two lengths of rails had been lifted up, and, with the sleepers attached to them, flung over the embankment. The broken telegraph wires trailed untidily on the ground. Several of the posts were twisted. But the bridge across the Tugela was uninjured, and the damage to the lines was such as could be easily repaired. The Boers realise the advantage of the railway. At this moment, with their trains all labelled 'To Durban,' they are drawing supplies along it from Pretoria to within six miles of Ladysmith. They had resolved to use it in their further advance, and their confidence in the <b>ultimate</b> <b>issue</b> is shown by the care with which they avoid seriously damaging the permanent way. We had learned all that there was to learn--where the line was broken, that the village was deserted, that the bridge was safe, and we made haste to rejoin the train. Then the engine was reversed, and we withdrew out of range of the hills beyond Colenso at full speed--and some said that the Boers did not fire because they hoped to draw us nearer, and others that there were no Boers within ten miles.|$|E

50|$|Education {{helps with}} the most onerous {{obstacle}} to keeping out of prison—finding gainful employment. Legitimate employment {{is the basis for}} other requirements on the outside, including the ability to pay for housing and food. Holding a degree or certificate is a boost to these effort. Pell funding holds an added potential of making religious programming, study, and training more widely available. The expansion of religious programming is a boon for prison culture since involvement in religion is associated with positive outcomes for prisoners, including lower recidivism, improved self-esteem, and movement away from gang subcultures. Increased opportunity for religious study is a unique aspect of education known to transform the lives of inmates. This is likely due to the content of religion itself. As religion deals with <b>ultimate</b> <b>issues,</b> including one’s worldview and morality, religious education may be a special ally in the quest for rehabilitation.|$|R
