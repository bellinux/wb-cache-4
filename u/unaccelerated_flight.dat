50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized compass (or heading indicator) is {{to read the}} magnetic compass only while in straight and level <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight.</b> This reading is then used to set the gyro-stabilized compass. The gyro compass will read correctly in a turn, whereas the magnetic compass can't be read properly while turning. Thus the pilot will always ignore the magnetic compass while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{types of}} error {{will affect the}} heading {{indication}} provided by a magnetic compass if the aircraft is not in steady straight and level <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Steady flight, <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight,</b> or {{equilibrium}} {{flight is}} a special case in flight dynamics where the aircraft's linear and angular velocity are constant in a body-fixed reference frame. Basic aircraft maneuvers such as level flight, climbs and descents, and coordinated turns can be modeled as steady flight maneuvers. Typical aircraft flight consists {{of a series of}} steady flight maneuvers connected by brief, accelerated transitions. Because of this, primary applications of steady flight models include aircraft design, assessment of aircraft performance, flight planning, and using steady flight states as the equilibrium conditions around which flight dynamics equations are expanded.|$|E

40|$|In the {{calculation}} of the dimensions of modern mach~nes and building constructions, account. is taken of the freouency of the occurrence of the anticipated loads: It is generally assumed that these loads w$ll be repeated an infinite number, or at any rate some milliops, of t$mes dur$ng the total work-ing life of the construction, When calculating {{the dimensions of the}} structural parts of aircraft, on the contrary, a con-sideration only of those frequencies in the appearance of the loads which act~ally come into play $n the various states of stress is allowable. This is because in aircraft construction it is absolutely essential not only to ensure adequate struc-tural strength but also to keep down the structural weight to the lowest poss”ible>Imit, St?’ength tests in which this requirement is direqtly taken into account have recently been carried Qut by the DVL Material Strength Department. STRESSIiS OCCURRING IN FLYING OPERATION The stresses produced in an aircraft fluctuate in-vary– ing measure, according to the nature and purpose pf the ma-chine, about a mean load, which corresponds to the air forces in <b>unaccelerated</b> horizontal <b>flight,</b> hence to the value of’the total loaded weight of the aircraft multiplied by unity? These load fluctuations or ‘tload multiples ” do qot’succeed each other in obedience to any definite law.

5000|$|Results of {{the testing}} of this craft were first {{published}} November 1959 in the NASA TN D-89 [...] of the Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California. In Figure 12 above, the airplane is mounted with {{the trailing edge of}} the flaps at an altitude of 17 feet (out of ground effect). To quote the authors of TN D-89, “The major objectives of the wind-tunnel study were to determine if the machine could achieve steady-state VTOL operation; to determine under what conditions operation would become impossible or unsafe from either an aerodynamic or structural limit; and to obtain the information necessary for the piloted motion simulation of the aircraft….The major portion of the tests was directed toward conditions and forces simulating level <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight,</b> that is, lift about equal to the airplane weight (2625 lb) and drag about equal to the horizontal thrust component.” ...|$|E

40|$|A new {{trailing}} bomb-type {{instrument for}} photographically recording the flight-path angle and air speed of aircraft in <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight</b> is described. The instrument consists essentially of an inclinometer, air-speed meter and a film-drum case. The inclinometer carries an oil-damped pendulum which records optically the flight-path angle upon a rotating motor-driven film drum. The air-speed meter {{consists of a}} taut metal diaphragm of high natural frequency which is acted upon by the pressure difference of a Prandtl type Pitot-static tube. The inclinometer record and air-speed record are made optically on the same sensitive film. Two records taken by this instrument are shown...|$|E

The lift-to-drag ratio of the aircraft for two configurations, one with full capture and accelerated flight and the other allowing spillage of the leading shock and in <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight,</b> is studied.

40|$|A brief {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the longitudinal-stability characteristics of a YF- 84 A airplane (Army Serial No. 45 - 79488). The airplane developed a pitching-up tendency at approximately 0. 80 Mach number which necessitated large push forces and down-elevator deflections for further increases in speed. In steady turns at 35, 000 feet with the center of gravity at 28. 3 percent mean aerodynamic chord for normal accelerations up to the maximum test value, the control-force gradients were excessive at Mach numbers over 0. 78. Airplane buffeting did not present a serious problem in accelerated or <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight</b> at 15, 000 and 35, 000 feet up to the maximum test Mach number of 0. 84. It is believed that excessive control force would be the limiting factor in attaining speeds in excess of 0. 84 Mach number, especially at altitudes below 35, 000 feet...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{were made}} in {{sideslipping}} flight at a Mach, number of 0. 50 of the pressure distribution over the horizontal tail surfaces of a tractor-propeller-driven pursuit airplane, {{to determine the effects}} of an-gle of sideslip and propeller operation on the tail—load distribution. Measurements were also made of the tail—load distribution on the horizon-tal tail in steady <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight</b> over a Mach number range of 0, 30 to 0. 79 and 0. 30 to O^Jk, respectively, 'for the power—on and power^-off conditions. It is shown that the asymmetric tail loading results from a large decrease in load on the "blanketed tail and a small increase of load on idle leading tail. Although, in general, the application of power at a speed of 290 miles per hour results in an increase in the positive asym-metric loading over the sideslip-angle range, the effect is relatively small as compared with that of Bideslip angle. The asymmetric loads and torsional moments at low speeds and zero angle of sideslip are small an...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the complete NEFS simulation model comprising the aircraft and flap system model. At first the model {{architecture of the}} Matlab/Simulink model will be described. The system model {{as well as the}} aircraft model will not be described in detail as there exist specific reports concerning these models (NEFS deliverables D 2. 3 - 3 and D 2. 2 - 2). For more information about the modelling of these parts of the simulaton model the author must refer to the above mentioned reports. Nevertheless the model architecture and the integration of these models in the overall simulation model will be described and the input and output signals of the aircraft and system model will be listed. After this a description of the simulation control will be given. This includes some useful functions of the simulation like "quickplots" or some useful switches on top level of the model.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{reliable}} and accurate values of the stability and control derivatives, the Dryden Fligh Research Center (DFRC) developed a technique for extracting the derivatives from flight data. This technique is implemented {{by a set of}} FORTRAN computer programs that is based on a modified maximum likelihood estimator that uses the Newton-Raphson algorithm to perform the required minimization of the derivatives. Data was obtained with a PA- 30, light twin-engine general aviation aircraft in zero, half, and full flap configuration in level <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight</b> with the landing gear retracted. The derivatives were plotted as functions of angle of attack using various graphical arrangements to show variations of wind tunnel and flight determined values at zero flap settings. Also, data was displayed to show the effects of flap deflection and thrust variation on the longitudinal stability derivatives. The angle of attack and angle of sideslip were measured. The dynamic pressure, velocity, and altitude were calculated, using a FORTRAN computer program, from the static and dynamic pressures. The control deflections of the stabilator, ailerons, and rudder also were recorded along with left throttle position, engine rpm, and manifold pressure...|$|E

The tests were made at Mach numbers from 0. 80 to 1. 20. Large variations of missile forces and moments were observed for missile positions simulating launch or jettison within the local flow field of the airplane model. At transonic Mach numbers, {{the influence of the}} wing leading edge and shocks originating from components of the air-plane were dominant factors contributing to the nonuniformity of the mis-sile flow field. A simplified analysis of the data indicated that for a rapidly accelerating missile, however, these large variations in forces and moments would not cause excessive displacements of the missile when launched from the airplane in level <b>unaccelerated</b> <b>flight.</b> jettison boundaries estimated from the missile jettison data indicate satisfactory jettison would be achieved from the airplane in level flight at sea level but not at 40, 000 feet altitude. Idealized Canting o r cambering the pylons supporting the missiles generally resulted only in small changes in the longitudinal force and moment characteristics of the airplane model. pylon mounted, the rolling-moment coefficient was decreased by canting the pylons.
