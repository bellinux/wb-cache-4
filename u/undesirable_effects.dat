5|$|Provision of {{breathing}} gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects</b> immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E

40|$|Mutual {{coupling}} is {{well known}} as an <b>undesirable</b> <b>effect</b> as it degrades the performance of most array signal processing algorithm. Such <b>undesirable</b> <b>effect</b> becomes significant when the antenna element spacing becomes small, which {{is the case for}} compact antenna array. Throughout the years, extensive studies from signal processing and communication society have been conducted to compensate such <b>undesirable</b> <b>effect.</b> In this paper, a new method for the determination of receiving mutual impedances of omni-directional antenna elements is proposed. The new method is able to compensate such <b>undesirable</b> <b>effect</b> for compact array. Numerical examples of using the new method for the determinations receiving mutual impedances for some monopole arrays are given, which aims to show the differences between the old and new methods. DOA estimation examples with better accuracies demonstrate the superior mutual coupling characterization performance of the new receiving mutual impedance determination method over existing methods...|$|R

25|$|While the {{commercial}} boom in Pigeon Forge vastly increased the town's revenue, it had several <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects.</b> As land value increased, many farmers {{could no longer}} afford the accompanying high property taxes and were forced to sell their land. The high cost of living in Pigeon Forge is difficult to offset with the low wage jobs that often accompany the tourist industry.|$|E
25|$|High-dynamic-range {{photographs}} are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using exposure bracketing, {{and then later}} merging them into a single HDR image, usually within a photo manipulation program). Digital images are often encoded in a camera's raw image format, because 8-bit JPEG encoding does not offer a wide enough range of values to allow fine transitions (and regarding HDR, later introduces <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects</b> due to lossy compression).|$|E

25|$|Federally {{recognized}} Indigenous Nations {{and states}} protect designated areas by adopting {{water quality criteria}} {{that allow them to}} adopt the criteria that EPA publishes under §304(a) of the CWA, modify the §304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific conditions or adopt criteria based on other scientifically defensible methods. Water quality criteria can be numeric criteria that toxicity causes are known for protection against pollutants. A narrative criterion is water quality criteria which serves as basis for limiting toxicity of waste discharge to aquatic species. A biological criterion is based on aquatic community which describes the number and types of species in a water body. A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment; and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and uncontaminated sediments in order to avoid <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in France, Monroe addressed the National Convention, receiving a standing applause for his speech celebrating republicanism. He experienced several early diplomatic successes, including {{the protection of}} U.S. trade from French attacks. He also used his influence to win the release of Thomas Paine and Adrienne de La Fayette, {{the wife of the}} Marquis de Lafayette. Months after Monroe arrived in France, the U.S. and Great Britain concluded the Jay Treaty, outraging both the French and Monroe—not fully informed about the treaty prior to its publication. Despite the <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects</b> of the Jay Treaty on Franco-American relations, Monroe won French support for U.S. navigational rights on the Mississippi River—the mouth of which was controlled by Spain—and in 1795 the U.S. and Spain signed Pinckney's Treaty. The treaty granted the U.S. limited rights to use the port of New Orleans.|$|E

25|$|The {{minimum height}} {{requirement}} for Mission: Space is 44inches (112cm). Spiels and warnings throughout the attraction caution {{that people who}} do not like enclosed dark spaces, simulators, spinning, or are prone to motion sickness should not ride. Signs also warn that the ride may cause nausea, headache, dizziness, or disorientation, and that people prone to motion sickness, or who have a headache or an inner ear problem, or who have a history of migraines, vertigo, or elevated anxiety also should not ride. These signs are similar to those present at considerably less-intense rides in the same park, such as Soarin'. There are also signs which instruct the rider to keep their head flat against the headrest, stating that if one ignores this, the centrifugal motion acting on one's head can cause <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects</b> such as dizziness and/or headaches, or possibly even more serious effects.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{literature}} is demonstrating {{the importance of}} emotion regulation {{in the treatment of}} substance abuse. Considering that nicotine and other psychoactive substances such as cocaine activate similar psychopharmacological pathways, an emotion regulation approach may be applicable to a wide array of substance abuse. Proposed models of affect-driven tobacco use have focused on negative reinforcement as the primary driving force for addiction; according to such theories, tobacco is used because it helps one escape from the <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects</b> of nicotine withdrawal or other negative moods. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), is showing evidence that it is effective in treating substance abuse, including the treatment of poly-substance abuse and cigarette smoking. Mindfulness programs that encourage patients to be aware of their own experiences in the present moment and of emotions that arise from thoughts, appear to prevent impulsive/compulsive responses. Research also indicates that mindfulness programs can reduce the consumption of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes and opiates.|$|E
500|$|Reflections cause several <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects,</b> {{including}} modifying frequency responses, causing overload {{power in}} transmitters and overvoltages on power lines.

2500|$|Beyond the {{question}} of physical injury to the eye from a laser pointer, several other <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects</b> are possible. [...] These include short-lived flash blindness if the beam is encountered in darkened surroundings, as when driving at night. [...] This may result in momentary loss of vehicular control. [...] Lasers pointed at aircraft are a hazard to aviation. A police officer seeing a red dot on his chest may conclude that a sniper is targeting him and take aggressive action. In addition, the startle reflex exhibited by some exposed unexpectedly to laser light of this sort {{has been reported to}} have resulted in cases of self-injury or loss of control. [...] For these and similar reasons, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised that laser pointers are not toys and should not be used by minors except under the direct supervision of an adult.|$|E

2500|$|In spring 785, Li Huaiguang's {{subordinate}} Lü Mingyue (呂鳴岳) {{was killed}} by Li Huaiguang after he discovered that Lü had been in secret communications with Ma. [...] Li Huaiguang also put two other subordinates, Gao Ying and Li Yong, under arrest for associating with Lü. [...] Meanwhile, Ma rendezvoused with Hun at Changchun Palace and put it under siege. [...] By this point, the Shuofang soldiers were largely ready to turn against Li Huaiguang, and when Yan Yan tried to lead them against Han Yougui's Binning army — which was branched off the Shuofang army, and whose soldiers therefore mostly had family relationships with the Shuofang soldiers — the Shuofang soldiers refused to fight against Binning soldiers. [...] Li Huaiguang declared to the soldiers that {{he was ready to}} resubmit to Tang and offer tributes to Emperor Dezong, but thereafter did nothing for another month. [...] Meanwhile, as the Chang'an region lacked food, many officials suggested to Emperor Dezong that he pardon Li Huaiguang, but Li Sheng opposed, pointing out five reasons why pardoning Li Huaiguang would have <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects,</b> and Emperor Dezong agreed and did not pardon Li Huaiguang.|$|E
2500|$|By the Tudor era {{there were}} some 200 {{buildings}} on the bridge. Some stood up to seven storeys high, some overhung the river by seven feet, and some overhung the road, to form a dark tunnel through which all traffic had to pass, including (from 1577) the palatial Nonsuch House. The roadway was just [...] wide, divided into two lanes, so that in each direction, carts, wagons, coaches and pedestrians shared a single file lane six feet wide. When the bridge was congested, crossing it could take up to an hour. Those who could afford the fare might prefer to cross by ferry, but the bridge structure had several <b>undesirable</b> <b>effects</b> on river traffic. The narrow arches and wide pier bases restricted the river's tidal ebb and flow, so that in hard winters, the river upstream of the bridge became more susceptible to freezing and impassable by boat. [...] The flow was further obstructed in the 16th century by waterwheels (designed by Peter Morice) installed under the two north arches to drive water pumps, and under the two south arches to power grain mills; the difference in water levels on {{the two sides of}} the bridge could be as much as , producing ferocious rapids between the piers resembling a weir. Only the brave or foolhardy attempted to [...] "shoot the bridge"—steer a boat between the starlings when in flood—and some were drowned in the attempt. The bridge was [...] "for wise men to pass over, and for fools to pass under." ...|$|E
