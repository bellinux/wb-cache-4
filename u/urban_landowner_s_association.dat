5000|$|Alfred Marshall {{argued in}} favour of a [...] "fresh air rate", a tax to be charged to <b>urban</b> <b>landowners</b> and ‘‘levied on that value of urban land that {{is caused by the}} {{concentration}} of population’’. That ‘‘general rate’’ should have ‘‘to be spent on breaking out small green spots in the midst of dense industrial districts, and on the preservation of large green areas between different towns and between different suburbs which are tending to coalesce’’. This idea influenced Marshall's pupil Arthur Pigou's ideas on taxing negative externalities.|$|R

50|$|After Seddon's {{death in}} 1906, the Government Advances to Workers Act allowed <b>urban</b> <b>landowners</b> to borrow up to £450 from the Government at low {{interest}} rates {{to build their own}} houses. This proved much more popular than the state housing system. A total of only 126 houses were built under the Workers' Dwellings Act by 1910. A replacement Workers' Dwelling Act in that year allowed landless urban workers to build a house on a deposit of just £10. While it still allowed for workers to rent or lease their homes from the Government, applicants who were willing to buy were favoured. The state houses were sold by the Reform Government from 1912 onwards.|$|R
50|$|People often {{surround}} {{their house}} and garden with a hedge. Common hedge plants are privet, hawthorn, beech, yew, leyland cypress, hemlock, arborvitae, barberry, box, holly, oleander, forsythia and lavender. The idea of open gardens without hedges may be distasteful to those who enjoy privacy.The Slow Food movement has sought in some countries to add an edible school yard and garden classrooms to schools, e.g. in Fergus, Ontario, where these were added to a public school to augment the kitchen classroom. Garden sharing, where <b>urban</b> <b>landowners</b> allow gardeners to grow on their property {{in exchange for a}} share of the harvest, is associated with the desire to control the quality of one's food, and reconnect with soil and community.|$|R

In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state. Joining the peasant class with the bourgeoisie of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, <b>urban</b> <b>landowners</b> through the banner of communism. Only when this collection of peasants and petty bourgeoisie existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy. Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people {{were the ones who}} could control the state.

This book s sometimes harrowing accounts of women s experiences, provided by victims and observers, lead into an analysis of the causes of property grabbing.
