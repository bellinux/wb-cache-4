5|$|Until 1928, the Indian River Inlet was {{a natural}} {{waterway}} that shifted <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> two-mile (3.2km) stretch of the coast. Dredging kept the inlet open in its current location between 1928 and 1937, and in 1938 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built jetties that hold it in place. With the inlet in a fixed place, it became possible after 1928 to build a bridge to span it, and {{the completion of the}} Ocean Highway in 1933 prompted Delaware to build a span to connect the northern and southern segments of the highway.|$|E

25|$|As weirs are a {{physical}} barrier they can impede the longitudinal movement {{of fish and}} other animals <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> river. This can {{have a negative effect}} of fish species that migrate as part of their breeding cycle (e.g., Salmonids), but can also be useful as a method of preventing invasive species moving upstream. For example, weirs in the Great Lakes region have helped to prevent invasive Sea lamprey from colonising further upstream.|$|E
25|$|Their nests may {{be located}} in the trees or on the ground. Ground nests, {{frequently}} located near leaf litter, may be fabricated within sunken areas of the soil or beneath logs. Ground nests have both advantages and disadvantages. Floods or wet soil may force golden mice to leave their ground nests and relocate into the trees. However, if the ground nest is undisturbed, it can lower the risk for predation for the following reasons: the nest is well hidden, a mouse on the ground is more likely to escape a predator, and less energy is required to build a nest on the ground since the mouse doesn't have to keep running <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> tree with nesting materials.|$|E
25|$|Weaving is the {{technique}} of playing a succession of bells by changing which bell is in each hand as required. This is used by bass and solo or small-ensemble ringers. The large size and weight of bass bells makes four-in-hand ringing impractical and impossible, and often a solo or small-ensemble ringer will need to move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> range of bells, possibly sharing them with others. This technique means more than two bells can be rung in short succession, using the table to damp and free the hand {{to pick up the}} next bell. If the ringing sequence requires bells to be rung in tonal order, this technique often results in a weaving pattern as the ringer must often reach across his or her body for the next bell.|$|E

25|$|The Trustees {{asked their}} Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, {{to draw up}} plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design {{involving}} a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> <b>A</b> similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support {{the weight of the}} loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the rams and their cylinders, buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.|$|E
25|$|The game uses a basic point-and-click {{interface}} to {{move the}} player around and manipulate the game world. Within each screen, the player is free to look around 360 degrees. As the player moves the cursor around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), a mouth (the player can speak to the character over whom the option appears), an eye (an area or object can be examined in more detail), a magnifying glass (an object contains important information which needs closer examination), a hand (the player can take the object), a cog (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction with the object), a cog with red line (the player is attempting to use the wrong inventory item to initiate interaction), a left-right horizontal arrow (the object can be moved left and right), an up-down vertical arrow (the object can be moved <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down),</b> <b>a</b> circular arrow (the object can be rotated).|$|E
25|$|The team first {{considered}} {{spinning the}} radar dish around a vertical axis and then angling the dish <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> few degrees with each complete circuit. The vertical motion could be smoothed out by moving continually {{rather than in}} steps, producing a helix pattern. However, this helical-scan solution had two disadvantages; one was that the dish spent half of its time pointed backwards, limiting {{the amount of energy}} broadcast forward, and the other was that it required the microwave energy to somehow be sent to the antenna through a rotating feed. At a 25 October all-hands meeting attended by Dee, Hodgkin and members of the GEC group at GEC's labs, {{the decision was made to}} proceed with the helical-scan solution in spite of these issues. GEC solved the problem of having the signal turned off half the time by using two dishes mounted back-to-back and switching the output of the magnetron to the one facing forward at that instant. They initially suggested that the system would be available by December 1940, but as work progressed it became clear that it would take much longer.|$|E

Two officers with one hundred men in 11 Para and thirty men in 10 Para. With their losses in men and vehicles beginning to tell, German troops attacking the perimeter changed tactics and now tended to rely more on artillery and mortars than on infantry and armour {{to break through the}} British line. However, in the attacks on Lonsdale Force, the Germans persisted in attacking in company strength supported by one or two armoured vehicles. The method employed by the Germans was a tank or SP gun would move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> street blowing holes in the house walls. This would be followed up by supporting infantry who would try and use the holes to gain entry to the houses. During the day men from Lonsdale Force and the 21st Independent Company stalked and destroyed two SP guns then engaged the supporting infantry.|$|E
500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> <b>A</b> passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!", and then [...] "Give it to me!" [...] repeated eight times in succession, possibly referring to the plane's yoke.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the episode}} was {{completed}} in the Upper Boat Studios, particularly the interior car scenes. For this, only one car set was used, with it being redecorated for each different car. The cars were decorated to look like they had been lived in, and incorporated futuristic and well-known home objects. Brannigan and Valerie's children were played by real kittens, which proved difficult to direct. The production team shot for four days in the [...] "6-foot by 6-foot" [...] car, which Davies called a [...] "nightmare" [...] because not many camera angles were available and only one crew member could adjust the props and lighting at a time. In addition, smoke was generated around the car so it would {{blend in with the}} CGI smoke from the CGI cars. The small set was intended to benefit the actors, as they would feel claustrophobic. For the scene in which the Doctor jumps from car to car, the underside of a car was built and suspended ten to fifteen feet above the top of the car set with a green screen all around to get as many angles as possible. Davies preferred action sequences that moved <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>a</b> scale that is not seen much on television. The Temple of Peace in Cardiff was the location for the Darkened Temple, as well as the TV Studio with news reporter Sally Calypso. The production team spent two days filming there, on 18 and 19 September 2006. The undercity where the Doctor and Martha arrive was filmed at the Cardiff Bay maltings and the Ely Papermill, which were designed to look in disrepair. The artificial rain proved difficult in some shots, as the production team had trouble getting one of the side walls wet.|$|E

2500|$|Often {{synonymous with}} logical {{determinism}} are the ideas behind spatio-temporal determinism or eternalism: {{the view of}} special relativity. J. J. C.
