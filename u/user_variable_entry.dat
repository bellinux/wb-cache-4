The application of the generic set of <b>user</b> <b>variables</b> is shown by means of the application of a virtual character.

It was found that among individuals {{with little or no}} online search experience, cognitive style influenced their search performance and usage of search/navigational tools. Those with field-dependent cognitive style tended to complete search tasks by spending longer time and by following more steps than those with field-independent cognitive style. The field-dependents also tended to use Home button and embedded links more frequently than the fieldindependents. Among individuals with substantial online search experience, however, their cognitive style did not seem to influence any of the search performance or tool usage.

On the basis of the previous researches, we tested seven (7) hypotheses for five (5) market-entry-related strategic <b>variables</b> (<b>entry</b> mode, entry timing, entry location, entry scale and entry purpose) and two (2) control variables (firm size and level of globalisation) that can influence the performance of South Korean firms (henceforth, Korean firms) in China and Russia. The results reveal that entry mode, entry timing, entry purpose, firm size and level of globalisation are crucial to ensure Korean firms' successful performances. In addition, we find {{that in the case of}} China, the moderating effect of entry scale was negatively significant on the relationship between entry mode and market performance.

40|$|Background: Responsiveness is an {{indicator}} by WHO {{to evaluate the}} performance of health systems on non-medical expectations of consumers. This study measures the health system responsiveness and the factors affecting responsiveness in Iran health system. Methods: World Health Survey (WHS) questionnaire was used {{to collect data on}} a two-stage cluster sampling in 17 th District of Tehran in 2003. Of a sample of 773, 677 and 299 individuals who respectively had outpatient or inpatient services utilization responded to the responsiveness module of WHS questionnaire. Result: More than 90 % of respondents believed that responsiveness issues were very important. Performance of outpatient services was better than hospital services in terms of responsiveness. "Prompt attention " and "quality of basic amenities " received low score for outpatient services. Service <b>user</b> <b>variables</b> had no significant effect on respon-siveness, while type of centers was significantly related to responsiveness. Principal component analysis found three factors for both outpatient and inpatient services that explained 62 % and 61 % of total variances respectfully.

40|$|Over {{the past}} seven years, the {{portability}} of the GFDL SKYHI general circulation model has greatly increased. Modifications to the source code have allowed SKYHI to be run on the GFDL Cray Research PVP machines, the TMC CM- 5 machine at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and more recently on the GFDL 40 -processor Cray Research T 3 E system. At the same time, changes {{have been made to}} the model to make it more usable and flexible. Because of the reduction of the human resources available to manage and analyze scientific experiments, it is no longer acceptable to consider only the optimization of computer resources when producing a research code; one must also consider the availability and cost of the people necessary to maintain, modify and use the model as an investigative tool, and include these factors in defining the form of the model code. The new SKYHI model attempts {{to strike a balance between}} the optimization of the use of machine resources (CPU time, memory, disc) and the optimal use of human resources (ability to understand code, ability to modify code, ability to perturb code to do experiments, ability to run code on different platforms). Two of the key features that make the new SKYHI code more usable and flexible are the archiving package and the <b>user</b> <b>variable</b> block. The archiving package is used to manage the writing of all archive files, which contain data for later analysis.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the contribution of effectuation dimensions to the predictive power of the entrepreneurial intention model over and above that which can be accounted for by other predictors selected and confirmed in previous studies. As is often the case in social and behavioral studies, some variables are likely to be highly correlated with each other. Therefore, the relative amount of variance in the criterion variable explained by each of the predictors depends on several factors such as the order of <b>variable</b> <b>entry</b> and sample specifics. The results show the modest predictive power of two dimensions of effectuation prior to the introduction of the theory of planned behavior elements.

The knowledge utilization framework consisted of eight stages of knowledge use (reception, search/find, cognition, reference, effort, adoption, implementation, and impact), and three categories of obstacles to knowledge use (supply, demand, and context). A critical perspective also informed the study 2 ̆ 7 s methods, analyses, and implications. A mixed methodology was employed by way of: (a) a pre-pilot study which tested the efficacy of the knowledge utilization framework; (b) a narrative synthesis of RD research; (c) a pilot study of an online questionnaire; (d) an online teacher questionnaire; and (e) focus groups. Ten Ontario elementary school teachers participated in the pre-pilot and pilot studies; 204 elementary school teachers completed the questionnaire and eight teachers took part in focus groups. Results revealed underutilization of RD research across the eight stages of knowledge use. Variables within the three categories of obstacles contributed to the underuse of RD research.
