I have brought the cattle that he desired me to fetch, and I am willing to deliver them to him {{wherever}} he wishes, but we will not <b>unarm</b> in order to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Lady," [...] said Sir Launcelot, [...] "thou dost put upon me a very sore task in this, for God knoweth I am no climber of trees. Yea, I {{would rather}} {{do battle with}} twenty knights than to climb one such tree as this. Nevertheless, I cannot find it in me to refuse the asking of any lady, if so be it lieth at all {{in my power to}} perform her will. Now if you will aid me to <b>unarm</b> myself, I will {{endeavor}} to climb this tree and get your hawk." ...|$|E
6000|$|She lit the candles, and, turning {{quickly on}} her guest, stopped {{him at the}} first attempt he made to remove the {{knapsack}} from his shoulders. [...] "No," [...] she said, gently; [...] "in the good old times there were occasions when the ladies unarmed their knights. I claim the privilege of <b>unarming</b> my knight." [...] Her dexterous fingers intercepted his at the straps and buckles, {{and she had the}} dusty knapsack off, before he could protest against her touching it.|$|R
5000|$|Neria [...] "the Trident" [...] is a thief but {{prefers to}} be called a [...] "nighthawk." [...] She first appears when she tries to rob Hoochie's party at the {{crossing}} to the Iramus Bridge. When Sanson <b>unarms</b> her easily, she tricks him into giving him a ride, robbing him clean on the way.Karl and the party tricks her back and capture her, but find out that she has already used up her money to pay her dues at the town's thieves' guild. The party lets her go, and in turn, Neria goes {{out of her way to}} gather and return the money. This exchange of goodwill leads her to join the party.|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Mellegrans said {{to those}} who were with him: [...] "Now I will go down and do battle with this knight, for never will I {{have a better chance of}} {{overcoming}} him than this." [...] Therewith he turned to that messenger, and he said: [...] "Go! Hasten back to yonder knight, and tell him that I will do battle with him upon those conditions he offers, to wit: that he shall <b>unarm</b> his left side, and that he shall lay aside his shield and his helm. And tell him that by the time he hath made him ready in that wise, I will be down to give him what satisfaction I am able." ...|$|E
6000|$|So the {{messenger}} went to Sir Launcelot and delivered that message to him. But when Sir Launcelot heard {{what it was}} that {{the messenger}} said to him from Sir Mellegrans, he laughed with great scorn. Then he said to the messenger, [...] "Doth the knight of this castle fear to meet me?" [...] The messenger said, [...] "Yea, Messire." [...] Sir Launcelot said: [...] "Then take thou this message to him: that I will lay aside my shield and my helm and that I will <b>unarm</b> all the left side of my body, and thus, half naked, will I fight him if only he will come down and do battle with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot {{climbs the}} tree] So the lady {{dismounted}} from her mule, and Sir Launcelot dismounted from his horse, {{and the lady}} aided Sir Launcelot to <b>unarm</b> himself. And when he had unarmed himself he took off all his clothes saving only his hosen and his doublet. Then he climbed that tree, though with great labor and pain to himself, and with much dread lest he should fall. So he, at last, reached the falcon where it was, and he loosened the lunes from where they were entangled about the branch, and he freed the bird. Then he brake off a great piece of rotten bough of the tree and he tied the lunes of the falcon to it and he tossed the falcon down to where the lady was; and the lady ran with great joy and caught the falcon and loosed it from the piece of branch and tied the lunes to her wrist, {{so that it could}} not escape again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou art right, Oliver. Such fools {{there are}} in the world, and we have no time to {{reconcile}} their scruples by a little dose of self interest. We must be true men, Oliver, and good allies of Burgundy, for this night at least--time may give us a chance of a better game. Go, tell no man to <b>unarm</b> himself; and let them shoot, in case of necessity, as sharply on those who cry France and St. Denis! as if they cried Hell and Satan! I will myself sleep in my armour. Let Crawford place Quentin Durward on the extreme point of our line of sentinels, next to the city. Let him e'en have the first benefit of the sally which he has announced to us--if his luck bear him out, it is the better for him. But take an especial care of Martius Galeotti, and see he remain in the rear, in a place of the most absolute safety--he is even but too venturous, and, like a fool, would be both swordsman and philosopher. See to these things, Oliver, and good night.--Our Lady of Clery, and Monseigneur St. Martin of Tours, be gracious to my slumbers!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Rolling Stone {{noted the}} group as a [...] "Band to Watch" [...] which led to {{performing}} at Lollapalooza. In 2014, Beast Patrol released their follow-up EP, <b>Unarm</b> Yourself and Twin Danger signed to Universal Classics. In 2015, the Twin Danger released their debut, self-titled album, which went to number 1 on the iTunes Jazz Chart and received 4 stars from Downbeat, leading to an interview on NPR's All Things Considered. Twin Danger performs live with six members and has played extensively around NYC with trips to Tokyo, Los Angeles and Austin's SXSW.

5000|$|The Polish National Committee {{had decided}} to <b>unarm</b> its forces, but this {{determination}} was ignored by Mierosławski who expected a Russian intervention {{in which they would}} assist Prussian forces in defense as an ally. As such they were unprepared to fight the Prussians. As the Prussian troops lashed unrestricted terror against the Polish population, the Prussian attack started on 29 April as camps in Książ, Pleszew, Września and Miłosław were assaulted. In Książ, Prussian troops destroyed the town after murdering 600 prisoners and wounded [...] Among the victims of the massacre was Florian Dąbrowski Additionally population of Grodzisk led by Jewish doctor Marcus Mosse defended the town against encroaching 600 Prussian troops. Polish committees in Wielkopolska were being attacked as well,Demobilized Poles returning to their homes were being harassed as were Catholic priests, while Germans pacified villages. [...] This provoked an outrage in Polish peasants who rose up against Prussian forces in rural uprising and guerrilla warfare, and joined the regular Polish forces under Mierosławski. Mierosławski believed that to save morale and honor of Poles it is necessary to resist military, while the Committee members were opposed to fighting, and as such the Committee disbanded itself on 30 April, in its last proclamation stressing the Prussian treachery and violence.|$|E
