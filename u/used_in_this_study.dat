25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} physiological explanations for {{parts of the}} OBE. OBE-like experiences have been induced by stimulation of the brain. OBE-like experience has also been induced through stimulation of the posterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus in a patient. Positron-emission tomography was also <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> to identify brain regions affected by this stimulation. The term OBE-like is used above because the experiences described in these experiments either lacked some of the clarity or details of normal OBEs, or were described by subjects who had never experienced an OBE before. Such subjects were therefore not qualified to make claims about {{the authenticity of the}} experimentally-induced OBE.|$|E

Where it has made falsifiable predictions under controlled conditions, they have been falsified.

The double-blind experimental protocol <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was agreed upon {{by a group of}} physicists and a group of astrologers nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, who advised the experimenters, helped ensure that the test was fair and helped draw the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested. They also chose 26 out of the 28 astrologers for the tests (two more volunteered afterwards). The study, published in Nature in 1985, found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing [...] "...clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis." ...|$|E

50|$|In Europe {{and parts}} of the U.S., a study has been {{conducted}} collecting DNA sequence data over a range of commonly encountered forensically important Calliphoridae species. One species observed was the C. mortuorum. This specimen was collected in Durham, UK. Flies <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> were caught with liver-baited sticky traps. High quality DNA was extracted from these flies, and the genetic marker <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was the large sub-unit (lsu) ribosomal RNA gene. (This lsu rRNA gene has also been used in studies of evolutionary analysis of other organisms.) The DNA analysis collected in this study provides insight to different evolutionary patterns apparent in the Calliphoridae family, which can possibly provide a measure of the degree of genetic variation likely to be encountered within taxonomic groups of different forensic usefulness. This study provides the first documented molecular based phylogenic analysis of the blowfly species. This research and more studies to come in the future will greatly assist the identification of larvae and adult insect species, which may play a great role in medicocriminal forensic entomology.|$|E
