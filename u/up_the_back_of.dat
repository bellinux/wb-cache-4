5|$|The talonid, {{another group}} of cusps, makes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the tooth. It is wider than long and {{contains}} a well-developed cusp, the hypoconid, on the outer side and a depression, the talonid basin, in the middle. The cristid obliqua connects to the hypoconid. The smaller hypoconulid cusp is present towards the inner side of the tooth, and the hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by a cutting edge which is suggestive {{of the presence of}} a metacone cusp on the upper molars. Further towards the inner side, a crest, the entocristid, rims the talonid basin; on m1, it is swollen and on m2, it contains two small cuspules, but a distinct entoconid cusp is absent. This entocristid is continuous with the lingual cingulum.|$|E
25|$|When {{dragged through}} a field the coulter cuts {{down into the}} soil and the share cuts {{horizontally}} from the previous furrow to the vertical cut. This releases a rectangular strip of sod that is then lifted by the share and carried by the mouldboard up and over, so that the strip of sod (slice of the topsoil) that is being cut lifts and rolls over as the plough moves forward, dropping {{back to the ground}} upside down into the furrow and onto the turned soil from the previous run down the field. Each gap in the ground where the soil has been lifted and moved across (usually to the right) is called a furrow. The sod that has been lifted from it rests at about a 45 degree angle in the next-door furrow and lies <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the sod from the previous run.|$|E
500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that he could feel his skin crawling <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his neck the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E

500|$|Hoylande Denune Young {{was born}} in Columbus, Ohio, on June 26, 1903. She had a sister, Hilda. She became {{interested}} in chemistry {{when she was in}} high school, where there were separate boys' and girls' chemistry classes. Due to course scheduling conflicts she was permitted to take the more challenging boys' course, although she had to sit <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the class. She entered Ohio State University, from which she received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1924. She then went on to earn a Doctor of Philosophy at the [...] University of Chicago, writing her thesis on [...] "Stereoisomeric Bromoimino Ketones" [...] under the supervision of Julius Stieglitz.|$|E

In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up {{the front of my}} dress, one <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> my dress. I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|Carlisle's 1903 {{season was}} a success, {{with only two}} losses. The 12–11 defeat by Harvard is known for the [...] "hunch-back", or [...] "hidden-ball", play which Warner learned from Heisman; he had a tailor sew elastic bands into the waists of several players' jerseys before the game so the play could be executed. It was used during a Harvard kickoff; when the ball was caught, Carlisle formed {{a circle around the}} {{returner}} and pushed the ball <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the player's (altered) jersey. Carlisle then broke the huddle and spread out in different directions. Each player except the returner (who had the hidden ball) pretended to carry the football. The ruse confused the Harvard players, who scrambled to find the ball carrier, and the returner (ignored, with both hands free) ran untouched into the end zone. Warner's next step was a brief return to Cornell.|$|E

2500|$|Actress Tess Harper, who co-starred, said Duvall {{inhabited}} the character so fully that she only {{got to know}} Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director Bruce Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable {{to him that he}} could feel his skin crawling <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, [...] "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny." [...] Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.|$|E
2500|$|During 1983, Pigott and Hunter wrote Dragon's {{come back}} hit single [...] "Rain". Pigott remembers, [...] "I {{went from a}} little {{underground}} band to finding myself <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the Entertainment Centre hearing 10,000 people sing the chorus of my song." [...] The song reached No.2 but was blocked by Austen Tayshus' No.1 hit [...] "Australiana". Pigott sang [...] "Rain" [...] with Rockmelons on their album Form 1 Planet (1992) with Hunter (and Rockmelons' Bryon Jones) providing backing vocals. Hunter and Pigott co-wrote other Dragon songs including [...] "Cry" [...] and Pigott was a session musician on Dragon's 1989 album, Bondi Road. Re-formed in 2006, Dragon perform acoustic versions of their earlier work including [...] "Rain".|$|E
2500|$|The Type A1 cabinet, {{formerly}} known as Type A, has a minimum inflow velocity of 75ft/min. The downflow air, considered contaminated, splits just above the work surface (the BSCs smoke split) and mixes with the inflow. This air is drawn, through ductwork, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the cabinet where it is then blown into a positive pressure, contaminated plenum. Here, the air is either recirculated, through a HEPA filter, back down over the work zone, or exhausted out of the cabinet (also through a HEPA filter). Sizing of HEPA filters and an internal damper are used to balance these air volumes. This type is not safe for work with hazardous chemicals even when exhausted with a [...] "thimble" [...] or canopy to avoid disturbing internal air flow.|$|E

[...] He quickly picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powerful Hudson County Democratic Organization. On April 26, Coffee withdrew from the race and endorsed Byrne, and led to increased pressure for Crabiel to also drop out and help clear the field for Byrne. [...] Byrne quickly won endorsements from Democratic organizations in Bergen and Mercer counties.|$|R

2500|$|On the {{southern}} side, Mount Keira Road leaves suburbia and winds {{its way through}} the bush <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the mountain, giving access to the (now closed) Kemira coal mine, Byarong park, Girl Guides camp, Scout camp, and ultimately the summit lookout via Queen Elizabeth Drive. The Scout camp was established in 1939 by Sid Hoskins and later described by Lady Baden Powell (wife of Lord Baden Powell, the founder of Scouting) as [...] "surely {{one of the most beautiful}} campsites in the world". Mount Keira Road was built using convict labour in 1835–1836, surveyed by Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell, using much of the route used by O'Briens Road but descending the south and west slopes of Mount Keira rather than Mount Nebo, a nearby hill to Mount Keira's south. Byarong Park was originally a pit pony grazing area, the ponies were stabled at the site of the Girl Guide camp.|$|E
