5|$|Before the Spanish conquest, Chiapas was {{inhabited}} {{by a variety}} of indigenous peoples, including the Zoques, various Maya peoples, such as the Lakandon Ch'ol and the Tzotzil, and an <b>unidentified</b> <b>group</b> referred to as the Chiapanecas. Soconusco had been incorporated into the Aztec Empire, centred in Valley of Mexico, and paid the Aztecs tribute. News of strangers first arrived in the region as the Spanish penetrated and overthrew the Aztec Empire. In the early 1520s, several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land, and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast. The first highland colonial town in Chiapas, San Cristóbal de los Llanos, was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527. Within a year, Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River, Comitán, and the Ocosingo valley. Encomienda rights were established, although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted to little more than slave-raiding rights.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 December 2014 a stage that Sirisena had been {{intending}} to use for a rally at Wanduramba near Galle was set on fire along with a vehicle by an <b>unidentified</b> <b>group,</b> and three workers installing the stage were abducted. Three suspects were arrested but were then taken from police custody by Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama. Despite an arrest warrant being issued for his arrest, Muthuhettigama left Sri Lanka for Singapore on 26 December 2014. He was arrested on 28 December 2014 after returning to Sri Lanka but was released the following day.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008, the Grand Regency Scandal broke, {{wherein the}} Central Bank of Kenya {{is alleged to}} have {{secretly}} sold a luxury hotel in Nairobi to an <b>unidentified</b> <b>group</b> of Libyan investors for more than 4 billion Kenyan Shillings (approx US $60 million) below the appraised market value. Finance Minister Amos Kimunya negotiated the sale, and was censured in a near-unanimous motion by the Kenyan Parliament, though he vehemently denies the charges. This follows {{on the heels of the}} Safaricom IPO, overseen by Kimunya, which has been alternatively praised and questioned for possible corruption in the execution of the sale. Safaricom is the largest mobile phone service provider in Kenya, having operated with a near-government monopoly for many years. The government of Kenya sold its 50% stake in Safaricom in the IPO.|$|E

25|$|Aquaman is {{told by the}} White Lantern Entity to find Jackson Hyde {{before a}} second, <b>unidentified</b> <b>group</b> does. Mera states that she knows who he is, and after she tells him, Aquaman leaves, and rescues Jackson from a Xebel attack. It is {{revealed}} that Aquaman's Silver Age origin has been re-established and he is once again the half-human son of Tom Curry and an Atlantean queen. The Entity subsequently reduces Aquaman to {{what appears to be}} white water. Aquaman is revealed {{to be one of the}} Elementals, and was transformed by the Entity to become the element of water and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar, which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the Swamp Thing. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing returns Aquaman to normal. Afterward, Aquaman is reunited with Mera, at which point he discovers that the Xebels' weapons were made of Atlantean technology.|$|E
25|$|The UNP's {{headquarters}} Sirikotha {{was attacked}} on 24 December 2014 {{by members of}} the Patriotic National Front and the Federation of National Organizers (FNO) resulting in over 30 injuries on both sides. The FNO is believed to be an affiliate of the National Freedom Front, a member of the UPFA government. On 20 December 2014 UPFA supporters tried to sabotage an opposition rally in Haputale before attacking UNP supporters resulting in five injuries. A group of opposition activists were attacked on 21 December 2014 at the bus halt in Hambantota by government supporters led by Hambantota mayor Eraj Ravindra Fernando. Fernando was arrested the following day but released on bail on 24 December 2014. On the night of 23/24 December 2014 an <b>unidentified</b> <b>group</b> fired shots at the stage that Sirisena had been intending to use for a rally at Kolonnawa. Sirisena's election office in Batticaloa was attacked on the morning of 24 December 2014 by a group of around 30 unidentified people armed with firearms and petrol bombs.|$|E
500|$|Because the Fugitive Slave Law {{had made}} the {{northern}} United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an <b>unidentified</b> <b>group</b> of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. In his third autobiography, Douglass wrote: [...] "On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with me until I could collect sufficient money to get them on to Canada. It was the largest number I ever had at any one time, and I had some difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter...." [...] The number of travelers and the time of the visit make it likely that this was Tubman's group.|$|E
3000|$|... [Ebisawa (1996, 2000]) {{reported}} on the lane-side tree compositions at two locations in Shiga Prefecture; they found 2837 individuals representing 63 species (including six <b>unidentified</b> <b>groups)</b> on 173 paddy lanes in Nagahama city and 1001 individuals representing 59 species (including two <b>unidentified</b> <b>groups)</b> on 113 paddy lanes in Youkaichi city. Such a high diversity of lane-side trees species in the two localities would {{be related to the}} functions of the trees. The lane-side trees in Shiga Prefecture had several uses, such as Hasagi (drying rice after harvest using lane-side trees as pillars), harvesting fruit and materials for craftwork, and use as a landscape plant ([Ebisawa 1982]). To serve the various purposes, such a wide variety of trees were expected to be maintained at the local scale. In contrast, the farmland markers in upland fields in our study region have not been used directly in harvesting processes, such as Hasagi. As indicated by our interviews, at present woody plant markers serve only the limited role of marking farmland boundaries. This situation suggests the vulnerability of marker maintenance in the future because artificial markers are widely available as substitutes.|$|R

500|$|Although the Giants were {{no longer}} the league's top draw by 1955, falling to ninth in {{attendance}} and being one of three teams which had decreased attendance compared to the previous season, the Maras were still financially secure enough to turn down an offer of one million dollars for the team. NFL commissioner Bert Bell had personally made the offer on behalf of an <b>unidentified</b> <b>group</b> of investors, and accorded to Bell the Maras responded, [...] "ootball is our business and we intend to remain in it." [...] The offer was the largest for a franchise in pro football up to that point. The investment group was reportedly enticed by the team's potential television revenue—at the time the Giants [...] "television-radio" [...] income led the league at $150,000 annually—and the 8,000,000 population of New York City from which it could draw. Despite {{the size of the}} offer, John Mara considered the figure low, and stated that he had [...] "no idea" [...] who was in the group attempting to buy the team.|$|E

50|$|The museum {{collection}} of African art is composed by wood carvings, masks, ceremonial objects, functional objects, ivory and bronze sculptures, textiles, body ornaments, {{and other items}} related to several ethnic groups, most part of which indigenous to Western Africa, more specifically, to the Bight of Benin. The collection is of particular importance for its coherent geographical unity, which allows the identification of interethnic flows among {{groups such as the}} Ashanti, Bassa, Baoulé, Dan, Bambara, Fon, Fulani, Senufo, Yoruba, and <b>unidentified</b> <b>groups</b> of Benin. It is, therefore, an important register of the common symbols of political, social and economic power, concerning the Pan-African theories.
