40|$|This volume {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the testamentary practices of women in medieval and early modern France, examining {{the experience of a}} cross-section of the population, from artisans to the elite, in Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, Marseille, Montpellier, La Rochelle, Brittany, and Burgundy. The making of a will was perhaps the single most prominent moment in women’s lives for the assertion of agency. Though constrained to some degree by customary practice and the increasing influence of Roman law, women demonstrated remarkable initiative in the formulation of their last wishes. Wills permitted women to reward friendship and loyalty, to designate <b>universal</b> <b>heirs</b> as major beneficiaries, to stipulate conditions of inheritance so that last wishes were carried out, and, perhaps most importantly, to make pious donations to the Church for the salvation of the testators’ souls. They chose their burial sites and arranged for funeral processions, and they endowed anniversary masses for their souls in perpetuity. Individual testamentary decisions differed, as did spousal strategies, but the reinforcement of family ties, even the assertion of relationship, was possible in wills.

6000|$|In {{these last}} and awful moments, when the soul has but a brief {{space in which}} to make up its {{accounts}} between heaven and earth, all dissimulation is at an end, and we read unequivocal evidences of character. The last codicil of Columbus, made at the very verge of the grave, is stamped with his ruling passion and his benignant virtues. He repeats and enforces several clauses of his original testament, constituting his sou Diego his <b>universal</b> <b>heir.</b> The entailed inheritance, or mayorazgo, in case he died without male issue, {{was to go to}} his brother Don Fernando, and from him, in like case, to pass to his uncle Don Bartholomew, descending always to the nearest male heir; in failure of which it was to pass to the female nearest in lineage to the admiral. He enjoined upon whoever should inherit his estate never to alienate or diminish it, but to endeavor by all means to augment its prosperity and importance. He likewise enjoined upon his heirs to be prompt and devoted at all times, with person and estate, to serve their sovereign and promote the Christian faith. He ordered that Don Diego should devote one tenth of the revenues which might arise from his estate, when it came to be productive, to the relief of indigent relatives and of other persons in necessity; that, out of the remainder, he should yield certain yearly proportions to his brother Don Fernando, and his uncles Don Bartholomew and Don Diego; and that the part allotted to Don Fernando should be settled upon him and his male heirs in an entailed and unalienable inheritance. Having thus provided for the maintenance and perpetuity of his family and dignities, he ordered that Don Diego, when his estates should be sufficiently productive, should erect a chapel in the island of Hispaniola, which God had given to him so marvelously, at the town of Conception, in the Vega, where masses should be daily performed for the repose of the souls of himself, his father, his mother, his wife, and of all who died in the faith. Another clause recommends to the care of Don Diego, Beatrix Enriquez, the mother of his natural son Fernando. His connection with her had never been sanctioned by matrimony, and either this circumstance, or some neglect of her, seems to have awakened deep compunction in his dying moments. He orders Don Diego to provide for her respectable maintenance; [...] "and let this be done," [...] he adds, [...] "for the discharge of my conscience, for it weighs heavy on my soul." [...] [234] Finally, he noted with his own hand several minute sums, to be paid to persons at different and distant places, without their being told whence they received them. These appear to have been trivial debts of conscience, or rewards for petty services received in times long past. Among them is one of half a mark of silver to a poor Jew, who lived at the gate of the Jewry, in the city of Lisbon. These minute provisions evince the scrupulous attention to justice in all his dealings, and that love of punctuality in the fulfillment of duties, for which he was remarked. In the same spirit, he gave much advice to his son Diego, as to the conduct of his affairs, enjoining upon him to take every month an account with his own hand of the expenses of his household, and to sign it with his name; for a want of regularity in this, he observed, lost both property and servants, and turned the last into enemies. His dying bequests were made in presence of a few faithful followers and servants, and among them we find the name of Bartholomeo Fiesco, who had accompanied Diego Mendez in the perilous voyage in a canoe from Jamaica to Hispaniola.|$|E

Anton Baldrich Janer va nomenar hereu el fill gran del primer matrimoni amb l’obligació de pagar als seus germans i especialment als seus germanastres unes quantitats molt elevades de diners atorgats en un moment de grans expectatives econòmiques, gràcies al comerç amb Amèrica i el nord d’Europa. Durant la primera meitat del segle XIX, alguns anys de males collites, les contínues guerres i la independència de les colònies americanes feren minvar els recursos i van afeblir la hisenda familiar. Els successius hereus maldaven per pagar les contínues reclamacions dels cabalers i les cabaleres de les diferents generacions, fet que els impedia invertir en noves empreses per tal d’ampliar i modernitzar els seus negocis. L’any 1863, el darrer hereu Baldrich va morir sense descendència, havent pagat els darrers deutes familiars però sense haver creat nous horitzons per als seus successors. This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the difficulties faced by the heirs of the Baldrich family of Valls when, during the period 1768 to 1863, they were attempting to fulfil their obligations related to dowries and inheritances. Anton Baldrich Janer named his eldest son by his first marriage hereu, or <b>universal</b> <b>heir,</b> as was the custom in Catalan families, but with the obligation to pay his siblings, and especially his half-brothers and sisters, large amounts of money adjudicated at a time when trade between America and northern Europe had considerably raised financial expectations. During {{the first half of the}} 19 th century, poor harvests, continual wars and the independence of the American colonies diminished the family’s resources and weakened their financial situation. Successive generations of hereus struggled to meet the continuous claims of their brothers and sisters —the cabalers and cabaleres who would normally have the legal right to a percentage of the inheritance— with the result that they were unable to invest in new enterprises which would have expanded and modernized their commercial activity. In 1863, the last hereu of the Baldrich family died childless, having paid off the last of the family debts but without having opened up new horizons for his successors...|$|E
40|$|Pijarist Francesco Maria Appendini (1768 - 1837) proveo je gotovo pola stoljeća kao nastavnik u dubrovačkom Kolegiju pijarista/skolopa. Svoje retoričko umijeće pokazao je i na javnim skupovima, poput sastanaka Domoljubnog društva kojemu se pridružio još kao mladić, nedugo po dolasku u Dubrovnik, ili istupa s propovjedaonice. Pohvalni govor na ispraćaju kneza Orsata Gozze u katedrali u ljeto 1798. omogućio mu je da pred najuglednijim domaćim slušateljstvom oprezno pozove na reformu dubrovačkog društva, barem u domeni pedagoškog rada, oslanjajući se na engleski racionalizam. Iako Appendinijevi prijedlozi nisu bespogovorno prihvaćeni, ipak su i protivnici poput satiričara Junija Restija cije nili iznesena stajališta i isticali važnost engleske kulture. Time njegova politička retorika postaje značajno sredstvo za prenošenje poruke, uz pedagoški, spisateljski i dušebrižnički rad. Piarist Francesco Maria Appendini (1768 - 1837) {{spent almost}} fifty {{years as a}} teacher at the Piarist/Scolope Collegium in Dubrovnik. His enthusiasm for Latin rhetoric was also {{recognised}} outside the classroom walls as he delivered sermons in church and in public. As member of the Patriotic Society (Società patriotica), which gathered young patricians interested in social reforms {{under the influence of the}} French Enlightenment and English Rationalism, he advocated for the reform of the Ragusan school system and for the education of the local children abroad, at certain Italian schools in particular. The seeds of this idea he found in the treatise Some Thoughts Concerning Education written by John Locke, which he tried to adjust to the specific circumstances in Dubrovnik. Unlike Locke, Appendini did not incline towards radical social changes, as he believed that patrician children were the only ones to inherit their fathers and assume power when the time came, and rescue the state from the crisis. His disposition towards English culture has earned Appendini a rightful position among the educated Ragusans who were known to learn English and acquire professional and literary books even though they did not always share his views. Thus Junije Resti, the satirist, rejected the proposal for the children to study abroad and mocked the habits of his fellow-citizens in blindly following foreign customs. Since Appendini and Resti knew each other well, upon the request of the latter’s widow Appendini wrote an extensive introduction to a collection of Resti’s satires, printed in Padua in 1816, in which he spoke highly of Resti’s life-long learning and continuous advancement in law, languages, philosophy and sciences, believing it to be the only right path towards true statesmanship. Similar views Appendini had stated some twenty years earlier, in June 1798, while addressing the highest representatives of the Ragusan state and Church during the funeral ceremony of Orsat Gozze, the last Ragusan rector who died on duty. Privileged to have been chosen to deliver the oration in rector’s honour, Appendini decided to ascribe all Gozze’s achievements to his profound learning and individual striving that brought him firm character and broad knowledge. Graced by the glory of his forefathers, who, “from the very foundation of the city”, worked to the benefit of Dubrovnik, Rector Orsat Gozze in Appendini’s eyes had become a symbol of a responsible statesman and rational man. These achievements he owed most directly to his study of the treatises on law, philosophy, theology and natural philosophy written mostly by English, German or Dutch authors (Francis Bacon, John Locke, Johann Wolf, Pieter van Musschenbroek, Willem Jacob ‘s Gravesande), with special reference to an Italian Guido Grandi and Euclid, ancient mathematician. Sadly, Appendini failed to mention any of Gozze’s concrete works inspired by these treatises, nor did he refer to his contributions to the state, if any. He only praised Gozze’s interest in art and his valuable art collection, acquired during his visits to the Apennine Peninsula. Appendini took advantage of the occasion to render his political views and to repeat the message on the necessity to invest into the school system and culture as a pledge for the future, in which new generations would eradicate nepotism and corruption as the greatest social evils. An insight into archival sources provides a more complete but also more objective picture of Orsat Gozze. A caring husband and good brother, in a marriage with no offspring he designated his wife Mara as <b>universal</b> <b>heir,</b> on condition that she provided for his sisters in the convent and a brother who had been promised life rent. Apparently, Gozze did not manage to resolve an old and ongoing dispute with his cousins over property which snowballed because of his father’s imprudent decision, but finally ended in settlement only a few years upon the Republic’s fall. The establishment of the French and later Austrian rule had no impact on Appendini’s position at the Ragusan Collegium. His social status remained intact, which prompted his former students to accuse him of opportunism. This accusation we discard as unjust, because he persevered in his advocation of the investments in schooling, acquisition of new knowledge and opening towards new cultures as basis of the development of an individual as well as the society that rests upon him. That is the core of Appendini’s political theory...|$|E
