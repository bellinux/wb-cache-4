2500|$|A second, {{and perhaps}} more correct, {{definition}} of [...] "compatible single sideband" [...] (CSSB) refers {{to a form of}} amplitude and phase modulation in which the carrier is transmitted along with a series of sidebands that are predominantly above or below the carrier term. [...] Since phase modulation is present in the generation of the signal, energy is removed from the carrier term and redistributed into the sideband structure similar to that which occurs in analog frequency modulation. [...] The signals feeding the phase modulator and the envelope modulator are further phase-shifted by 90° with respect to each other. [...] This places the information terms in quadrature with each other; the Hilbert transform of information to be transmitted is utilized to cause constructive addition of one sideband and cancellation of the opposite primary sideband. [...] Since phase modulation is employed, higher-order terms are also generated. [...] Several methods have been employed to reduce the impact (amplitude) of most of these higher-order terms. [...] In one system, the phase-modulated term is actually the log {{of the value of the}} carrier level plus the phase-shifted audio/information term. [...] This produces an ideal CSSB signal, where at low modulation levels only a first-order term on one side of the carrier is predominant. [...] As the modulation level is increased, the carrier level is reduced while a second-order term increases substantially in amplitude. [...] At the point of 100% envelope modulation, 6dB of power is removed from the carrier term, and the second-order term is identical in amplitude to carrier term. [...] The first-order sideband has increased in level until it is now at the same level as the formerly <b>unmodulated</b> <b>carrier.</b> [...] At the point of 100% modulation, the spectrum appears identical to a normal double-sideband AM transmission, with the center term (now the primary audio term) at a 0dB reference level, and both terms on either side of the primary sideband at −6dB. [...] The difference is that what appears to be the carrier has shifted by the audio-frequency term towards the [...] "sideband in use". [...] At levels below 100% modulation, the sideband structure appears quite asymmetric. [...] When voice is conveyed by a CSSB source of this type, low-frequency components are dominant, while higher-frequency terms are lower by as much as 20dB at 3kHz. [...] The result is that the signal occupies approximately 1/2 the normal bandwidth of a full-carrier, DSB signal. [...] There is one catch: the audio term utilized to phase-modulate the carrier is generated based on a log function that is biased by the carrier level. [...] At negative 100% modulation, the term is driven to zero (0), and the modulator becomes undefined. [...] Strict modulation control must be employed to maintain stability of the system and avoid splatter. [...] This system is of Russian origin and was described in the late 1950s. [...] It is uncertain whether it was ever deployed.|$|E

Theoretically, the requirements for achieving polarization-independent phase-sensitive amplification of both single and dual polarization signals in a general scenario are also analyzed in this work. This part of the thesis is concluded by experimentally demonstrating mitigation of fiber nonlinearities in an installed link by performing mid-span spectral inversion with a vector parametric amplifier. This thesis also covers {{the analysis of}} polarization-assisted phase-sensitive processors to achieve quadrature decomposition. Using a vector amplifier, decomposition of a quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signal into two BPSK signals is experimentally demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract—The {{automatic}} detection of the modulation {{type of communication}} signals in the HF range between 2 and 30 MHz is extremely difficult due to the signal distortion caused by sky wave propagation. Under time varying and frequency selective fading it’s difficult to determine between stationary digital and nonstationary speech modulated transmissions. In this paper an algorithm is introduced to seperate speech modulated single side-band (SSB) and double sideband (AM) broadcasts from all other broadcasts in the HF range. The algorithm extracts a set of fea-tures from the analyzed signal and uses a polynomial classifier to classify the signal. I. REQUIREMENTS In the HF range {{it is possible that}} different signals overlap in the receiver. So one requirement for the algorithm is that some kind of segmentation (i. e. a radio direction finder) adjusts the frequency range of the receiver to the frequency range of the analyzed signals. The signal length of the analyzed signal should normally be as short as possible. For the introduced algorithm a dwell time of at least 500 ms is required. II. ASSUMPTIONS The only information about the received signal are its esti-mated bandwidth and center frequency. All other information about the signal like exact carrier frequency as well as modu-lation parameters like baudrate, frequency shift or pulse shape used at the transmitter are assumed to be unknown. The algo-rithm should seperate SSB and AM broadcast from all other broadcasts typically found in the HF range, i. e. FSK (usually 2 and 4 FSK), PSK (usually 2, 4 and 8 PSK), MSK, ASK, VFT and <b>unmodulated</b> <b>carriers.</b> Its assumed that the received signal is disturbed due to time varying and frequency selective fad-ing.

Around 1905 the first continuous wave radio transmitters began to replace the earlier spark transmitters. The Morse code signal of the spark transmitter consisted of pulses of radio waves called damped waves which repeated at an audio rate, so they were audible as a buzz or tone in a receivers earphones. In contrast the new continuous wave transmitters produced a signal consisting of pulses of continuous waves, <b>unmodulated</b> sinusoidal <b>carrier</b> waves, which were inaudible in the earphones.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 This thesis explores new {{wireless}} power and backscatter communication architectures for ultra-low-power wireless sensors {{and other devices}} such as wearables. We first present measurement, analysis and harvesting approaches for extracting energy from 2. 4 GHz wireless communication signals, including an approach for powering a relatively high power sensor in burst mode at an input power level of - 15 dBm. We present the first backscatter-based data uplink approach that achieves compatibility between backscatter devices and billions of completely unmodified standard wireless devices using the Bluetooth Low Energy standard. We show that this data uplink approach can communicate with BLE receivers with a radio communication efficiency of 28. 4 pJ/bit. This is over 100 x lower energy per bit than conventional BLE transmitters. One microcontroller based implementation consumes over 6 x less power than the best commercially-available Bluetooth transmitters, and can leverage both modulated and <b>unmodulated</b> <b>carriers</b> to provide the backscatter uplink. This al- lows us to transform one BLE signal as a carrier source for another BLE-Backscatter signal. We investigate {{the range of the}} BLE-Backscatter system in both bistatic and monostatic, full-duplex application scenarios. The range analysis considers the BLE receiver sensitivity and performance in the presence of self-jamming interference from the external carrier source in the bistatic case. We also present a carrier cancellation architecture that reduces self-jamming in the monostatic case. We characterize the packet error rate and received signal strength in both cabled and over-the-air scenarios. Finally we present an ultra-low power superheterodyne receiver architecture that leverages an external carrier as the local oscillator, removing the need for on board (or on chip) generation of the local oscillator signal. The receiver uses a two- port mixer for simultaneous mixing and power harvesting of the external carrier and desired BLE signal. This thesis shows a path toward the widespread adoption of backscatter communication in low-power wireless devices such as smart watches, fitness bands, biomedical sensors, etc. Other wireless devices, such as sensors for the Internet of Things (IoT) where power consumption is a crucial consideration could also benefit from the approaches presented...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{findings}} of the main studies that have examined the effects of GSM mobile phone radiofrequency emissions on human brain activity and sleep variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen published studies reporting on human brain electrical activity measurements during and/or after such radiofrequency emissions were identified and compared. CONCLUSIONS: Although, in general, outcomes have been inconsistent and comparison between individual studies is difficult, enhanced electroencephalogram alpha-band power has been noted in several of the studies, a phenomenon also observed in some animal studies. Performance decrements observed in some recent extremely low frequency studies are consistent with enhanced alpha-band power, highlighting the possible role of extremely low frequency fields associated with battery current in mobile phone handsets.
