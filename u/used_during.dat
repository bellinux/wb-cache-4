5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia has, on the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much {{larger numbers of}} mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species did not suffer from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he believes it is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides <b>used</b> <b>during</b> mouse plagues or from pesticides <b>used</b> <b>during</b> locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{from both}} human and {{preclinical}} studies {{seems to indicate that}} maternal smoking, alcohol drinking, or other drug <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy can affect offspring outcomes.

Nonetheless, more recent studies applying genetically sensitive designs cast some doubt on the causality of the relationship between prenatal maternal substance use and infant and child behavioral outcomes. In this review, recent findings in this field of research are provided, with attention to correlated risk factors of maternal substance <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy and preclinical studies focusing on plausible biological pathways. Next, evidence-based interventions targeting maternal substance <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy are discussed.

40|$|Background Alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> {{pregnancy}} is the direct cause of {{fetal alcohol syndrome}} (FAS). We aimed to estimate the prevalence of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy and FAS {{in the general population}} and, by linking these two indicators, estimate the number of pregnant women that consumed alcohol during pregnancy per one case of FAS. Methods We began by doing two independent comprehensive systematic literature searches using multiple electronic databases for original quantitative studies that reported the prevalence in the general population of the respective country of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy published from Jan 1, 1984, to June 30, 2014, or the prevalence of FAS published from Nov 1, 1973, to June 30, 2015, in a peer-reviewed journal or scholarly report. Each study on the prevalence of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy was critically appraised using a checklist for observational studies, and each study on the prevalence of FAS was critically appraised by use of a method specifi cally designed for systematic reviews addressing questions of prevalence. Studies on the prevalence of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy and/or FAS were omitted if they used a sample population not generalisable to the general population of the respective country, reported a pooled estimate by combining several studies, or were published in iteration. Studies that excluded abstainers were also omitted for the prevalence of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy. We then did country-specifi c randomeff ects meta-analyses to estimate the pooled prevalence of these indicators. For countries with one or no empirical studies, we predicted prevalence of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy <b>using</b> fractional response regression modelling and prevalence of FAS using a quotient of the average number of women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy per one case of FAS. We used Monte Carlo simulations to derive confi dence intervals for the country-specifi c point estimates of the prevalence of FAS. We estimated WHO regional and global averages of the prevalence of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy and FAS, weighted by the number of livebirths per country. The review protocols for the prevalence of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy (CRD 42016033835) and FAS (CRD 42016033837) are available on PROSPERO. Findings Of 23 470 studies identifi ed for the prevalence of alcohol use, 328 studies were retained for systematic review and meta-analysis; the search strategy for the prevalence of FAS yielded 11 110 studies, of which 62 were used in our analysis. The global prevalence of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>during</b> pregnancy was estimated to be 9 · 8...|$|R
