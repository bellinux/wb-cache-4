40|$|Abstract—The area {{of virtual}} environments has {{received}} an increasingly growing {{attention from the}} research com-munity, leading {{to the design of}} various innovative albeit incompatible protocols. In this paper, we present an open modular middleware that allows the clients and servers of multiple virtual worlds to be dynamically interfaced via a granular design. Our technology significantly alleviates the workload traditionally imposed to developers, and we see it as an important step forward towards the design of <b>universal</b> <b>interfaces</b> for interoperable virtual environments.

5000|$|KeyMod is a <b>universal</b> <b>interface</b> {{system for}} firearm {{accessory}} components designed to supersede the MIL-STD-1913 accessory rails. The concept was first created by VLTOR Weapon Systems of Tucson, Arizona, and released through Noveske Rifleworks of Grants Pass, Oregon, before being {{published in the}} public domain for adoption by the entire firearms accessory industry. The name [...] "KeyMod" [...] was coined by Eric Kincel (then working for VLTOR Weapon Systems) following the naming trend of other VLTOR accessories with the suffix [...] "Mod" [...] meaning modular, and [...] "Key" [...] being a reference to the key-hole profile of the mounting slots.|$|E

Superguns frequently resemble video game consoles which plug into a television or monitor, and have detached joysticks and play arcade boards as if they were large cartridges. Some superguns are a large box with two arcade controllers side by side, resembling the top of a typical arcade cabinet.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>universal</b> <b>interfacing</b> {{integrated}} circuit for direct capacitance-to-digital and capacitance-to-frequency (period, time interval) -to-digital conversion suitable for various capacitive sensing elements is newly {{presented in the}} paper. Measurement results havesuccessfully verified the functions and performance of the proposed circuit. The capacitance range is from 50 pF to 100  μF. Theworst case relative error for reported results is not more than ± 0. 7 %. Any capacitance-to-frequency converters can be also connectedto the designed universal sensors and transducers interfacing circuit. The relative error for the further frequency-to-digitalconversion is constant in the whole frequency range and not exceeds ± 0. 0005 %...|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Lincoln {{added two}} rocker {{switches}} {{on the steering wheel}} to activate various cruise control functions on the Continental and Continental Mark IV. In 1988, Pontiac offered a steering wheel with 12 buttons controlling various audio functions on the Trans-Am, 6000 STE and Bonneville. In the 1990s, a proliferation of new buttons began to appear on automobile steering wheels. Remote or alternate adjustments could include vehicle audio, telephone, and voice control navigation. Often scroll wheels or buttons are used to set volume levels or page through menus, change radio stations or audio tracks. These controls can use <b>universal</b> <b>interfaces,</b> wired or wirelessly.|$|R
