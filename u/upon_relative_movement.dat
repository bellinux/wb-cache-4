Therefore, aiming at achieving rotational spiral parts, in this study, a polishing mode that enables the active movement of the work piece as well as the passive <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> of the abrasive particles, defined as “active polishing,” was developed, and the concept of “active profiling and polishing” was put forward, which means generating <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> between abrasive particles and applying a design basis through {{the movement of the}} central workpiece, thereby producing a high profile polishing.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{evaluation}} of influence <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> rate of components during solidification on heat movement kinetics. Following assumptions have been made, <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> of components favour the thermal homogenisation of system, and what follows improving structural and utilitarian properties of composite. Design/methodology/approach: Real rate of forced <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> of component is hard to measure. But it analytical estimation in temperature and time function is possible. In presented researches as kinetics of heat movement determinants, dependences of temperature and temperature on time and heat movement direction derivative in time and direction of thermal axis are assumed. Next the computer simulations have been made. Findings: In comparison with <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> rate of components cooling rate have dominant influence on kinetic of composite region solidification. Along with increasing of cooling rate similar and about double increasing of time and direction derivatives of temperature were observed. Research limitations/implications: Quantitative analysis of field of force influence on components movement in solidificating composite is purposeful. In planed researches potential field of force will be electromagnetic field. Practical implications: Individual selection of character of <b>relative</b> components <b>movement</b> in depends of sand mould’s thermal properties, which was used to casting composite, is necessary. Even small <b>relative</b> components <b>movement,</b> on level 1 [cm/s], during composite solidification causes thermal homogenization of composite microregion, what may in prospect, improves structural homogeneity of composite, in the same time decreases thermal stresses on matrix – reinforcement boundary. Originality/value: It is show that apart from other, typical variants of metal-ceramic composites use also component with high thermal conductivity to creating composite casting generating in particles surroundings high local cooling rates and temperature gradients...|$|R
30|$|The {{results from}} the {{displacement}} transducers for the <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> of the bone showed that at direct weight loading, both bone fragments were pushed towards {{each other in the}} direction of the osteotomy. The proximal and the distal fragment covered the same distance in relation to a ring level, which is half of the defect size. Upon contact of both bone ends in the osteotomy, there were no more <b>relative</b> <b>movements</b> of the fragments. At indirect loading, only the proximal fragment moved distally {{in the direction of the}} osteotomy and the distal fragment. The proximal segment covered the total defect distance of 3.5  mm. The distal fragment did not move until it was contacted by the proximal bone fragment. Upon contact of the bone ends in the osteotomy, the proximal fragment moved further distally, in the direction of the axial force, and pushed the distal fragment distally. This resulted in greater <b>relative</b> <b>movements</b> of the proximal fragment and therefore greater overall movements.|$|R
