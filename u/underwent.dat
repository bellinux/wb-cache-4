40|$|Language {{varieties}} {{are common in}} any places which consist of heterogeneous people in each region. Tuban {{is one example of}} town which consists of many regions with heterogeneous people and has language varieties of each region. In this paper, the author focused only on two regions: Kingking and Karangsari. This study was aimed at analyzing dialect varieties spoken in Kingking and Karangsari by using the 200 basic vocabularies proposed by Morish Swadesh. The author used phonology, morphology, and semantic analysis. The study found 103 lexicons from Kingking and Karangsari that are different from other Tuban dialects. First, there are phonological differences: nine lexicons <b>undergoing</b> vowel change, six lexicons <b>undergoing</b> consonant change, and seven lexicons <b>undergoing</b> sound omission. On morphological differences, there are 36 lexicons <b>undergoing</b> coinage process, eight lexicons <b>undergoing</b> borrowing process, two lexicons <b>undergoing</b> blending process, three lexicons <b>undergoing</b> clipping process, three lexicons <b>undergoing</b> conversion, 16 lexicons <b>undergoing</b> derivation process, two lexicons <b>undergoing</b> reduplication process, and 12 lexicons <b>undergoing</b> multiple processes. Third is semantic difference, that is change in meaning, which involved 19 lexicons. After differentiating lexicons through three analyses, the author obtained 51. 5 % as the percentage of lexicon criteria. And according to the criteria of isolect or lexicon, the number 51. 5 % must be assumed as dialect differences...|$|R

The middle chalcogens (selenium and tellurium) have similar decay tendencies as the lighter chalcogens, but their isotopes do not <b>undergo</b> proton emission {{and some of the}} most neutron-starved isotopes of tellurium <b>undergo</b> alpha decay. Polonium's isotopes tend to decay with alpha or beta decay. Isotopes with nuclear spins are more common among the chalcogens selenium and tellurium than they are with sulfur.|$|R
