40|$|Background: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effect of reduced preload on LV <b>untwist</b> and early diastolic filling in healthy individuals. Methods: Twelve healthy men, 22 (22, 23) years of age, were examined at rest and during applied lower body negative pressure (LBNP) of - 20 mmHg and - 40 mmHg, respectively. Regional <b>untwist</b> and <b>untwist</b> rate during IVRT were calculated at LV basal, papillary, sub-papillary and apical short axis levels by two dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. LV early diastolic filling was assessed by transmitral E-wave (E) peak velocity by pulsed Doppler and flow propagation velocity (Vp) by color M-mode Doppler and early diastolic pulsed Doppler tissue velocities (E`) from septal and lateral mitral annulus. Results: From rest to LBNP - 40 mmHg the LV <b>untwist</b> and <b>untwist</b> rate at sub-papillary level increased from 2. 3 (1. 4, 3. 5) to 4. 5 (3. 1, 7. 6) degrees and from - 36 (- 51,- 25) to - 69 (- 127,- 42) °/s (p< 0. 001, p= 0. 003), respectively, while apical <b>untwist</b> and <b>untwist</b> rate increased from 3. 9 (2. 3, 4. 3) to 7. 6 (6. 4, 10. 5) degrees and from - 51 (- 69,- 40) to - 118 (- 170,- 84) °/s (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001), respectively. Since <b>untwist</b> and <b>untwist</b> rate at the basal level were unchanged, this created markedly larger base to apical <b>untwist</b> and <b>untwist</b> rate gradients from rest to LBNP - 40 mmHg. E, Vp and E` were reduced by 34, 32 and 39 %, respectively. Conclusions: LV <b>untwist</b> and <b>untwist</b> rate during IVRT were increased at apical levels, which might be a physiological mechanism to minimize the impairment in LV early diastolic filling during preload reduction...|$|R

This study explored differences of LV twist and <b>untwisting</b> rate {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and patients with ischemic and nonischemic chronic heart failure (HF). Fifty patients with AMI, 49 with ischemic HF, and 38 with nonischemic HF were studied. As a control group, 28 subjects without evidence of structural heart disease were included. Speckle-tracking analysis was applied to LV short-axis images at basal and apical levels. LV twist {{was defined as the}} net difference of apical and basal rotations at isochronal time points. The first time derivative of LV <b>untwist</b> was defined as the LV <b>untwisting</b> rate. Compared with control subjects, peak LV twist was decreased in patients with AMI and extremely decreased in those with HF (p < 0. 001, analysis of variance). A strong correlation (r = 0. 87, p < 0. 001) was found between peak LV twist and LV ejection fraction in the overall study population. LV <b>untwisting</b> rate was progressively decreased in patients with AMI and HF compared with control subjects (p < 0. 001, analysis of variance). A moderate correlation (r = 0. 56, p < 0. 001) was noted between peak LV <b>untwisting</b> rate and grade of diastolic dysfunction in the overall study population. In conclusion, LV twist and <b>untwisting</b> rate are strongly related to LV systolic and diastolic functions, respectively.

500|$|In 1934, Mitchell and {{the design}} staff decided to use a semi-elliptical wing shape to solve two {{conflicting}} requirements.

An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an <b>untwisted</b> wing, leading to the lowest amount of induced drag. The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure, which occurs at the quarter-chord position, aligned with the main spar, thus preventing the wings from twisting. Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70, which first flew in 1932; but as Beverley Shenstone, the aerodynamicist on Mitchell's team, explained: [...] "Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section {{to that of the}} Heinkel.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{establish}} the relationship between invasive measures of diastolic function and <b>untwisting</b> parameters measured with speckle tracking imaging. BackgroundLeft ventricular (LV) diastolic function is determined by early diastolic relaxation (which creates suction gradients for LV filling) and myocardial stiffness. Assessment of LV torsion has shown that <b>untwisting</b> begins before aortic valve closure and, in animals, might be {{an important component of}} normal diastolic filling. Studies in human subjects using indirect indexes derived from right heart catheterization have suggested a relationship between τ and measures of <b>untwisting,</b> but the relationship between directly measured diastolic function indexes with micromanometer catheters and <b>untwisting</b> parameters has not been established in human subjects. MethodsSimultaneous Millar micromanometer LV pressure and echocardiographic assessment was performed on 18 patients (10 male, mean age 66 years) with normal systolic function and a spectrum of diastolic function. Invasive rate of the rise of LV pressure, dp/dt minimum and τ were recorded as measures of active relaxation, and the LV minimum diastolic pressure was recorded as an index of diastolic suction. The LV stiffness constant and functional chamber stiffness were estimated from hybrid pressure-volume loops. Echocardiographic speckle tracking imaging was used to quantify torsion. ResultsAs relaxation was impaired, (prolonged τ) <b>untwisting</b> was delayed (r = 0. 35, p < 0. 01). There were nonsignificant associations between reduced <b>untwisting</b> and longer values of τ and lower dp/dt minimum. Reduction in the extent of <b>untwisting</b> before mitral valve opening was associated with increased LV minimum diastolic pressure (r = − 0. 30, p < 0. 034). No relation was observed between the LV stiffness constant (β: r = 0. 11, p = NS) or the functional LV chamber stiffness (b: r = 0. 11, p = NS) and <b>untwisting.</b> ConclusionsUntwisting parameters are related to invasive indexes of LV relaxation and suction but not to LV stiffness.

40|$|AIMS: The {{contribution}} of left ventricular (LV) <b>untwisting</b> to LV suction and early-diastolic filling was previously demonstrated, {{but this was}} not yet tested in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). We sought to assess the relationship between LV <b>untwisting</b> and LV filling pressures in patients with severe AS and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) using speckle tracking echocardiography. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-one consecutive patients (66 +/- 9 years) with severe AS, preserved LVEF (63 +/- 6 %), and 40 normal subjects (47 +/- 12 years) were prospectively enrolled. A comprehensive echocardiographic examination was performed in all. LV rotation and twisting were assessed using speckle tracking echocardiography. Peak apical back rotation rate, peak LV <b>untwisting</b> rate, and time intervals from QRS onset (ECG) to each of them were measured. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were determined in 30 patients. Patients with AS were older than normal subjects (P < 0. 001). LV mass, LA volume, LV filling pressures as well as peak apical back rotation rate and time to peak apical back rotation rate were increased in patients (P < 0. 05 for all). In patients with AS, both time to peak LV <b>untwisting</b> rate and time to peak apical back rotation rate were significantly related to E/E' ratio and to BNP levels (P < 0. 04 for all).

2500|$|Each pixel of an LCD {{typically}} {{consists of}} a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes, and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other. Without the [...] liquid crystal between the polarizing filters, light passing through the first filter would be blocked by the second (crossed) polarizer. Before an electric field is applied, {{the orientation of the}} liquid-crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces of electrodes. In a twisted nematic (TN) device, the surface alignment directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other, and so the molecules arrange themselves in a helical structure, or twist. This induces the rotation of the polarization of the incident light, and the device appears gray. If the applied voltage is large enough, the liquid crystal molecules {{in the center of the}} layer are almost completely <b>untwisted</b> and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer. This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter, and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel, light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts thus constituting different levels of gray.
