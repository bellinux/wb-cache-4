60|$|Now let us {{turn to our}} richest museums, {{and what}} a paltry display we behold! That our {{collections}} are imperfect is admitted by every one. The remark of that admirable palaeontologist, Edward Forbes, should never be forgotten, namely, that very many fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens collected on some one spot. Only {{a small portion of}} the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove. No organism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. We probably take a quite erroneous view, when we assume that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a formation conformably covered, after an immense interval of time, by another and later formation, without the <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> having suffered in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will, when the beds are upraised, generally be dissolved by the percolation of rain water charged with carbonic acid. Some of the many kinds of animals which live on the beach between high and low water mark seem to be rarely preserved. For instance, the several species of the Chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep water and this has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the Chalk period. Lastly, many great deposits, requiring a vast length of time for their accumulation, are entirely destitute of organic remains, without our being able to assign any reason: one of the most striking instances is that of the Flysch formation, which consists of shale and sandstone, several thousand, occasionally even six thousand feet in thickness, and extending for at least 300 miles from Vienna to Switzerland; and although this great mass has been most carefully searched, no fossils, except a few vegetable remains, have been found.|$|E

50|$|A flame {{structure}} {{is a type}} of soft-sediment deformation that forms in unlithified sediments. The weight of an overlying bed forces an <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> to push up through the overlying bed, generally when both strata are saturated with water. The resulting pattern (in cross section) may resemble flames. In order for the flame structure to occur, the overlying bed must be of a higher density than the <b>underlying</b> <b>bed,</b> or there must be differential pressures in the upper bed.|$|E

50|$|Terraces are {{sediment}} storage {{features that}} record an alluvial river’s past sediment delivery. Many changes in boundary conditions can form terraces in alluvial river systems. The most basic {{reason for their}} formation is that the river {{does not have the}} transport capacity to move the sediment supplied to it by its watershed. Past climate during the Quaternary has been linked to the aggradation and incision of floodplains, leaving step-like terrace features behind. Uplift as well as sea level retreat can also cause terraces to form as the river cuts into its <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> and preserves sediment in its floodplain.|$|E
5000|$|Groove casts are {{straight}} parallel ridges that are raised a few millimeters from the bedding surface. These structures were named and defined by Shrock in 1948 {{because of their}} long and narrow appearance, and they were formed from the filling in of grooves. Even though they may seem similar to flute casts, they each have many distinguishing characteristics, and the two are generally {{not found in the}} same vicinity. Groove casts are closely spaced, but not on top of each other, and exist in pairs, triples, and even larger groups. Groove casts form when high velocity flows (e.g. turbidite) create a pattern on an <b>underlying</b> <b>bed.</b> In 1957, Kuenen published that [...] "groove cast" [...] was a general term encompassing both drag marks and slide marks.|$|E

50|$|When energy {{within a}} flow is highest, it can carry {{the maximum amount}} of {{sediment}} and the largest grain sizes, but as energy decreases, the carrying capacity reduces, and the coarsest grains quickly settle out, sometimes almost instantaneously. High-energy flows may also erode into <b>underlying</b> <b>beds,</b> thereby incorporating new material into the flow, which will tend to decrease flow energy. Flows in channels can also undergo flow stripping, in which {{the upper part of the}} flow, where the finer grains tend to concentrate, separates and travels out over the top of the channel, leaving the lower part of the flow, where the coarser grains accumulate, within the channel. Ultimately, only clay particles remain, suspended in a stagnant water column with essentially no current movement.|$|R
50|$|Analytic {{glacial erosion}} models suggest that ice flows passing through {{constrained}} spaces such as mountain passes produced enhanced erosion beneath thicker, faster ice flows, which deepens the channel below areas both upstream and downstream. The underlying physical phenomena is that erosion increases with {{the rate of}} ice discharge. Although this simplifies complex relationships among time-varying climates, ice sheet behaviors and bed characteristics, {{it is based on}} the general recognition that enhanced ice discharges typically increase the erosion rate. This is because the basal sliding rate and the erosion rate are interrelated and driven by the same variables: the ice thickness, the <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> slope, the overlying glacial slope and the basal temperature. As a result, the modeled fjords are deepest through the narrowest channels (i.e., regions with the highest surrounding highest topography). This corresponds with actual physical observations of fjords.|$|E
5000|$|Bouma A is {{the first}} layer {{deposited}} by a flow, provided the flow has sufficient energy. Otherwise Bouma B, C or D {{will be the first}} layer deposited. Bouma A is deposited when the flow energy is high enough that fluid turbulence is able to keep the coarsest grains in suspension. When energy drops below a critical level, the grains tend to settle out all at once to create a massive bed. If flow energy drops more slowly, then the coarse grains may settle out first, leaving the fine grains still in suspension. This results in coarse-tail graded bedding, which means that there is a bimodal distribution of grain sizes with the coarse grains becoming progressively smaller towards the top of the bed, and the finer grains being randomly distributed between the coarse grains (i.e., the finer grain sizes are ungraded). As grains settle out, water displaced by grain compaction can move upward to create dish structures. Also, erosion can take place {{at the base of the}} flow and tear up shale from an <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> so that shale-rip clasts are incorporated into the base of the Bouma A layer. If there is some buoyancy to the rip-up clasts, then they may form a layer some distance above the base of Bouma A.|$|E
40|$|As a plane water-wave {{passes over}} a fixed <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> {{topography}} it scatters and a reflected wave is created travelling {{in the opposite}} direction. With knowledge of the incident wave and <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> topography, the reflected wave can be calculated; {{this is known as}} forward scattering. Taking this reflected data we have formulated the inverse scattering problem, whereby we use this data in an iterative process working backwards in an effort to approximate the bed topography. This has been done using both a shallow water, and mild-slope hypothesis. It is found that the mild-slope approximation is more accurate and reliable than the shallow water approximation at estimating the bed profile. Moreover, it is shown that with a small range of reflected data, R(ν), and some prior knowledge that the bed profile is mild, the iterative inverse method with the mild-slope approximation is able to produce an accurate representation of the underlying topography. ii Acknowledgments On the administrative side of things I would like to thank EPSRC for their financial support of the Master programme 2007 - 2008, and Sue Davis for all her help and guidance throughout the year.

30|$|Three {{recurrent}} hardground surfaces (HG I, II and III) {{within the}} upper part of the Bada Bag Member of the Jaisalmer Formation serve as marker beds for intra-basinal correlation. Previous records of late Bathonian ammonites (such as Perisphinctes congener, Macrocephalites madagascariensis, and M. triangularis) and brachiopods (Plectoidothyris jaisalmerensis and Cryptorhynchia sp.) from HG III suggest a late Bathonian age of the marker beds. The characteristic lithology and biotic components of individual hardgrounds, extending with only minor lithological changes from the southwestern to northeastern part of the Jaisalmer Basin, allow a very precise correlation within the unit and facilitate stratigraphic correlation of overlying and <b>underlying</b> <b>beds.</b> Although HG I may not be exposed everywhere, the cross-bedding and megaripple surface associated with HG I have been found in almost all the outcrops.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{report the}} {{findings}} in a patient treated by repeated intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin) injections, followed by macular relocation and excision of subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV). Methods: Histopathological evaluation of the CNV specimen, including immunohistochemical assessment. Results: During surgical excision, the CNV seemed to be avascular and its <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> did not bleed. Histopathological examination revealed that the CNV comprised avascular fibrous subretinal tissue containing fibroblastic retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, fragments of irregular thickened Bruch's membrane and fibrotic choroidal tissue containing some medium-sized vessels but no choriocapillaris. Conclusions: The development of an RPE tear {{during the course of}} Avastin treatment may reflect contraction of the avascular subretinal tissue, whereas the lack of capillaries in both choroidal and subretinal components may be caused by the increased access of Avastin to the choriocapillaris {{in the presence of the}} RPE tear. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Bed-load {{sediment}} transport is most usually modelled by relationships {{in which the}} solid discharge {{is a function of}} the shear stress, but such formulae may lead to unreliable predictions. Particle-scale relationship between turbulence and bed-load sediment motion has thus become one of the most important topics in {{sediment transport}} research. In this respect the bed configuration, affecting flow field, is one of the elements on which particle motion may depend. In this paper some results of a wider experimental campaign are presented. The latter was performed with the aim of examining the characteristics of sediment motion for variable bed configuration. The full experimental campaign comprehended mobile-bed configurations and fixed-bed ones. A new technique, based on image processing, was applied to movies recorded from above during the experiments to identify and track each moving grain. The cases experimented in this work proved some differences in the characteristics of sediment transport for fixed and movable <b>underlying</b> <b>bed,</b> even if the bulk flow properties were the same.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of monosulfidic sediments in inland waterways {{is emerging as}} a major environmental issue. Mobilisation and suspension of monosulfidic sediments can result in deoxygenation, acidification of the water column and mobilisation of trace metals. The controls on monosulfidic sediment mobilisation and the critical thresholds for its scour and entrainment have not been established. This study examines {{the effect of a}} minor flood event (average return interval of 5 years) on sulfidic sediment scour in the Wakool River in southern NSW, Australia. Five profiles were sampled within a small (∼ 300 m) reach before and after a minor flood event to determine the degree of sediment scour and transport. The results indicate substantial scour of both monosulfidic sediments and <b>underlying</b> <b>bed</b> sediments (approximately 2100 m 3). Changes in the sediment geochemistry suggest large concentrations of monosulfidic sediments had been suspended in the water column, partially-oxidised and redeposited. This is supported by 210 Pb results from one of the profiles. These results suggest that these monosulfidic sediments can move as bed load during minor flood events...|$|E
40|$|NERC GEF {{high-frequency}} seismic {{stations were}} deployed on Pine Island Glacier during two austral summer field campaigns (2006 / 7 and 2007 / 8). During the first season, five ISSI SAQS instruments were operated {{as a single}} local array; during the second season, four SAQS were deployed at different locations {{along the length of}} the glacier. The aim of these deployments was to detect natural seismicity (microearthquakes) arising from the glacier bed, associated with the motion of the ice over the <b>underlying</b> <b>bed.</b> Basal events were detected at five sites; at three sites no events were detected. A number of equipment problems (mostly interference and firmware issues) significantly reduced the amount of useable data recovered during 06 / 07. Preliminary analysis indicates that bed events occur in a few concentrated swarms separated by prolonged quiet periods. The results appear to show that ice sliding over its bed is associated with the release of far more elastic energy and therefore possibly higher basal friction, than ice flow by deformation of the underlying basal sediment.
