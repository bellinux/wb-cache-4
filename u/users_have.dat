A new program rating functionality in this version shows how other TuneUp Utilities <b>users</b> <b>have</b> rated the usefulness of a given program {{on a scale of}} 1 to 5 stars. The Start Center also includes a Tuning Status, which tracks and displays optimization progress and highlights areas with remaining optimization potential.|$|E
5|$|Verified status {{does not}} imply that Twitter {{continuously}} checks whether such accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015. Some <b>users</b> <b>have</b> tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images. Twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone to apply for a verified account. The company announced that they will disable the verification progress in response to an outlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler got verified on Twitter.|$|E

Many users predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that it has been supported for more than 3 years.|$|E
30|$|Performance {{results are}} {{better in the}} last {{experiments}} (i.e. E 4  > E 3  > E 2  > E 1) because (a) the <b>user</b> <b>has</b> already acquired more habituation and (b) the <b>user</b> <b>has</b> received {{more information about the}} process.

For example, if the <b>user</b> <b>has</b> traveled path {e 3,[*]e 4 } but in CTW tree no such path exists means this something which has not occurred in past. Hence prediction function result is Route_Predict(e 3,[*]e 4)[*]→[*]ε.

30|$|In this paper, we analyze Yelp {{users with}} a {{slightly}} deeper perspective of social interaction and study impacts of this social interactive behavior on classification of spammers and non-spammers. We consider features such as the total votes a <b>user</b> <b>has</b> received from public, {{the total number of}} followers a <b>user</b> <b>has</b> on Yelp, the total number of friends a <b>user</b> <b>has</b> on Yelp, the total number of pictures a <b>user</b> <b>has</b> posted for various businesses. These features represent how socially active a user is, how a user is more likely to have socially active friends and how a user is more likely to try out new businesses whenever possible. This additional set of social behavioral features about reviewers is used to improve the classification result on real-life opinion spam data.|$|R

Neutral, Trump Supporter, and Positive <b>users</b> <b>had</b> few connections with other users. In all connection types, Negative <b>users</b> <b>had</b> the highest number of connections with Hillary Supporter users. These totals were even higher than among their peers, despite their higher number of connections among peers.

For example, retweet impact refers to how many times a certain <b>user</b> <b>has</b> been retweeted on a certain topic. The impact is dampened by a factor measuring how many times the <b>user</b> <b>had</b> been retweeted by a unique author to avoid the cases when a <b>user</b> <b>has</b> fans who retweet regardless of the content.
