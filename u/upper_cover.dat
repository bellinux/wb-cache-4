25|$|The main {{characteristic}} of these scripts was their writing style. The letters {{in most of}} these manuscripts are heavy-looking, relatively short and horizontally elongated. The slanted isolated form of the alif that was present in the Umayyad period completely disappeared and was replaced by a straight shaft with a pronounced right-sided foot, set at a considerable distance from the following letter. Also, unlike the Hijazi scripts, these are often richly illuminated in gold and other colors. Another difference is that sura headings are clearly marked and enclosed in rectangular panels with marginal vignettes or palmettes protruding into the outer margins. These Qurans of the early Abbasid period were also bound in wooden boards, structured like a box enclosed on all sides with a movable <b>upper</b> <b>cover</b> that was fastened {{to the rest of the}} structure with leather thongs.|$|E

2500|$|The Lindau Gospels is an {{illuminated}} manuscript in the Morgan Library in New York, {{which is important}} for its illuminated text, but still more so for its treasure binding, or metalwork covers, which are of different periods. [...] The oldest element {{of the book is}} what is now the back cover, which was probably produced in the later 8th century in modern Austria, but in the context of missionary settlements from Britain or Ireland, as the style is that of the Insular art of the British Isles. [...] The <b>upper</b> <b>cover</b> is late Carolingian work of about 880, and the text of the gospel book itself was written and decorated at the Abbey of Saint Gall around the same time, or slightly later.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>cover</b> (not {{illustrated}} here, {{see note}} for image) is very lavishly studded with large gems, and uses low repoussé relief. [...] The composition also centres on a cross, but here a whole Crucifixion {{scene with a}} figure of Jesus on the cross and much smaller ones of the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist. [...] Each of these is in a compartment below {{the arms of the}} cross, paired with iconographically unusual female figures; the matching compartments above the arms each contain two angels. [...] Identifications for these lower figures vary; they are described by the Morgan Library as anonymous mourners, [...] "two dishevelled female figures thought to be personifications of Christian souls saluting their Redeemer" [...] as their file note puts it but Peter Lasko, calls them instead [...] "the curiously duplicated figure of St Mary Magdalen (?)" [...] To Needham they are Mary Magdalene and Mary Cleophas. [...] All eight figures are represented crouching or sideways, or hovering horizontally {{in the case of the}} angels, above and below clusters of gems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is first}} certainly documented in 1691 {{when it was}} described by a visitor to an aristocratic convent {{on the island of}} Lindau on the Bavarian side of the Bodensee, which was founded long after the book was created. [...] The leather spine of the book is stamped with the date 1594, but it is not absolutely certain where the book was when it was rebound, nor can the possibility be entirely excluded that the present combination of text and covers only dates back this far. [...] Paul Needham notes that while the <b>upper</b> <b>cover</b> is from the Imperial workshop, and in the grandest and most luxurious style of the period, the text, while richly illuminated, does not appear to quite match the cover in richness, and is not even the most lavishly decorated text written in St Gall during this period. The cover also appears to have been designed for a slightly smaller book. Treasure covers are relatively easy to transfer, as they are only attached to the wooden boards of the binding by small nails. On the other hand, the additional sections enlarging the lower cover are clearly early medieval.|$|E
40|$|Association rule mining (ARM) is {{the task}} of {{identifying}} meaningful implication rules exhibited in a data set. Most {{research has focused on}} extracting frequent item (FI) sets and thus fallen short of the overall ARM objective. The FI miners fail to identify the <b>upper</b> <b>covers</b> that are needed to generate a set of association rules whose size can be readily exploited by an end user. An alternative to FI mining can be found in formal concept analysis (FCA). FCA derives a lattice whose concepts identify closed FI sets and connections identify the <b>upper</b> <b>covers.</b> However, most FCA algorithms construct a complete lattice and therefore include item sets that are not frequent. An iceberg lattice, on the other hand, is a lattice whose concepts contain only FI sets. This paper presents the development of the Qu ick I ceberg C oncept L attice (QuICL) algorithm. QuICL uses recursion instead of iteration to navigate the lattice and establish connections, thereby eliminating costly processing incurred by past algorithms. The QuICL algorithm was evaluated against a leading FI miner and lattice construction algorithms using cited benchmarks. Results demonstrate that QuICL provides performance on the order of FI miners yet additionally derive the <b>upper</b> <b>covers.</b> Beyond this, QuICL has proved to be very efficient, providing an order of magnitude gains over other lattice construction algorithms. </p...|$|R

60|$|During {{the three}} {{minutes or so}} {{required}} for writing on the six pages of the slate, {{the position of the}} slate, in reference to the editor, was as follows: After considerable moving about beneath the top of the table, during which time it was principally {{in the hands of the}} psychic, it approached the writer and remained with him. The under cover of the slate (with a bit of slate-pencil tightly enclosed) rested on his knee; the <b>upper</b> <b>cover</b> was pressed against the frame of the table. The editor's thumb rested rather lightly on the middle of the nearer half of the <b>upper</b> <b>cover,</b> and his fingers assisted in supporting the nearer half of the under cover. The psychic herself had surrendered the control of the slate to the editor, and could have had no contact with it beyond touching the edge farthest from him. On the second day, Saturday, during which the bass for the last four measures was produced, the slate was in the exclusive control of the editor, the psychic not touching it at all. The progress of the musical writing was both felt and heard; it was a combination of light and rapid scratching, pecking, and twitching, with an occasional slight waving motion up and down.|$|E
6000|$|Coverlets.--General Remarks.--For an <b>upper</b> <b>cover,</b> {{it is of}} {{importance}} to an otherwise unsheltered person, that its texture should be such as to prevent the wind blowing through. If it does so, no thickness is of any avail in keeping out the cold; hence the advantage of skin carosses, buffalo robes, leather sheets, and macintosh rugs. All clothes lose much of their closeness of texture in a hot, dry climate; the fibres shrink extremely, and the wind blows through the tissue as through network. It is {{in order to make}} their coverings wind-proof, that shepherd-lads on the hills in Scotland, when the nights are cold, dip their plaids in water, before sitting or lying down in them. The wet swells up the fibres of the plaid, and makes the texture of it perfectly dense and close. It is also {{of importance}} that the outer covering should have a certain weight, {{so as not to be}} too easily displaced, either by the person fidgeting in his sleep or by the blowing of the wind. In dry weather there is nothing like furs; but in a rainy country I prefer a thick blanket bag (see [...] "Sleeping Bags"), a large spare blanket, and a macintosh sheet and counterpane. It may be objected that the bag and macintosh would be close and stuffy, but be assured that the difficulty when sleeping on mother earth, on a bitter night, is to keep the fresh air out, not to let it in. On fine nights I should sleep on the bag and under the spare blanket.|$|E
