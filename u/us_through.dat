5|$|In {{the film}} industry, more than 300 actors, authors and {{directors}} were denied {{work in the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>through</b> the unofficial Hollywood blacklist.

A port security program initiated by the Coast Guard shortly {{after the start of}} the Korean War required a review of every maritime worker who loaded or worked aboard any American ship, regardless of cargo or destination. As with other loyalty-security reviews of McCarthyism, the identities of any accusers and even the nature of any accusations were typically kept secret from the accused. Nearly 3,000 seamen and longshoremen lost their jobs due to this program alone.|$|E

40|$|The genome of a temperature-sensitive, DNA-negative mutant {{of human}} {{cytomegalovirus}} was cloned in cosmids and analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blotting. The data presented {{show that in}} the mutant genome, {{nearly half of the}} short segment was deleted (14. 3 to 15. 1 kb; map position, 0. 83 to 0. 9), including the genes for a potential immediate early protein (US 3) and a structural glycoprotein of 47 to 52 kDa (<b>US</b> 6 <b>through</b> <b>US</b> 11). The deleted DNA region was replaced by a 20. 8 - to 21. 6 -kb fragment that represented an inverted repetition of the retained portion of the short segment (map position, 0. 92 to 1. 0), suggesting that <b>US</b> 20 <b>through</b> <b>US</b> 36 were duplicated in the mutant. Northern (RNA) blots with appropriate probes of total cell RNA extracted from mutant-infected cells confirmed the absence of mRNAs originating from US 3 or from <b>US</b> 8 <b>through</b> <b>US</b> 11. It is concluded that the deleted genes are dispensable for human cytomegalovirus replication in cell culture...|$|R

5|$|The Theban Cycle {{deals with}} events {{associated}} especially with Cadmus, the city's founder, and {{later with the}} doings of Laius and Oedipus at Thebes; a series of stories {{that lead to the}} eventual pillage of that city {{at the hands of the}} Seven Against Thebes and Epigoni.

As far as Oedipus is concerned, early epic accounts seem to have him continuing to rule at Thebes after the revelation that Iokaste was his mother, and subsequently marrying a second wife who becomes the mother of his children — markedly different from the tale known to <b>us</b> <b>through</b> tragedy (e.g. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) and later mythological accounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} St. Louis, Missouri {{began with the}} {{settlement}} of the St. Louis area by Native American mound builders who lived {{as part of the}} Mississippian culture from the 9th century to the 15th century, followed by other migrating tribal groups. Starting in the late 17th century, French explorers arrived. Spain took over in 1763 and a trading company led by Pierre Laclede and Auguste Chouteau established the settlement of St. Louis in February 1764. It attracted French settlers leaving Illinois when Britain took control east of the Mississippi. The city grew in population due to its location as a trading post on the Mississippi River, as the western fur trade was lucrative. The city played a small role in the American Revolutionary War and became part of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>through</b> the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.|$|E
