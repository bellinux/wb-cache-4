2500|$|The {{attack of}} the 2/3rd Battalion {{commenced}} {{in the morning of}} 27 October. Horii had ordered a withdrawal from the position on the night of 28 October. [...] Since Colonel Kusonose Masao had been evacuated through illness, Lieutenant Colonel Tsukamoto Hatsuo now acted as commander of the 144th Regiment and the Stanley Detachment. [...] In compliance with Horii's order, he had prepared by withdrawing artillery and the 1st/144th and 2nd/144th Battalions on the morning of 28 October. The position was lightly held by the 3rd/144th, about to withdraw. The 2nd/41st Battalion, was tasked as rearguard behind the position. The 2/3rd Battalion resuming its attack on 28 October, now co-ordinated with the remainder of the brigade and the situation turned into a rout. The position was secured on 29 October. Lloyd has been criticised for a poor tactical decision in ordering a frontal attack at the start of this battle – a decision which <b>unduly</b> <b>delayed</b> the Australian advance and led to higher casualties than might otherwise have occurred.|$|E

40|$|Pre-market {{regulation}} of {{the introduction of new}} medical products is widely seen as offerinc the important beneEit of protecting the public from the hazards of potentially unsafe drugs and devices (Mitchell and Link, 1976).

Much of the inter-est in the latter issue stems from response to the legislative changes enacted in 1962 by the U. S. Congress that gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to impose safety and efficacy criteria on new commercial pharma-ceutical product review prior to market introduction. A general decline in U.

40|$|Ethics {{review is}} a {{pre-requisite}} to conducting research involving humans in Canada, and indeed in most international jurisdictions.

Consequently they are being deprived of a cost-effective, risk-reducing treatment. Every physician who treats patients with clinical atherosclerotic disease should become fully informed about the results of cholesterol-lowering trials in patients at high risk. All physicians who care for high-risk patients should take responsibility for cholesterol management, including primary care physicians and cardiovascular specialists. Highly effective and generally safe drugs for cholesterol lowering are available. The benefits of therapy for reducing recurrent CHD and prolonging life are considerable. There is no justification for <b>unduly</b> <b>delaying</b> institution of therapy for the majority of patients. The many advantages of nonpharmaceutical therapy call for its use in almost all patients, but drug treatment should not be postponed if the target for LDL cholesterol lowering (3 ̆c or = 100 mg/dL) is unlikely to be achieved in the near term by a nonpharmaceutical approach alone. The view that patients with CHD or other forms of atherosclerotic disease do not receive substantial clinical benefits from aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy is no longer warranted.
