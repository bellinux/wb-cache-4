This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of Sōryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.|$|E

25|$|Saints contested several {{finals in}} the modern game with now the now defunct Bradford Bulls, {{following}} <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> vast successes respectively in previous decades. When known as Bradford Northern, Bradford experienced their period of success largely in the 1940s, {{at a time when}} St Helens struggled to compete due to the commitments of World War II. In fact, {{it was only in the}} 1950s that St Helens won their first Challenge Cup and National League, and at this time, when St Helens were establishing themselves and improving in the 1950s, and 1960s, Bradford were disproving, and in fact folded in 1963. So the contest between the two can be doubted as a historical or traditional one. However, during the modern, Summer era, the game between the two gained prestige. The two contested consecutive Challenge Cup finals in 1996 and 1997, and later in 2001, St Helens winning all three. In Super League Grand Finals, St Helens and Bradford met twice, in 1999 and 2002, St Helens again winning all encounters.|$|E

The two musicians performed the song on a custom-made stage adorned with Yankees flags, while images of New York City flashed across several large screens throughout the stadium.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{is based on}} a {{boarding}} school revolt. The video starts off with flash images of the exterior of an old school building. It then cuts to two separate lines of male and female students, the latter being led by Lisa and Jessica, marching down a school corridor. They were led by a teacher with a whip in her hand while being watched on surveillance cameras. The scene then shifts to the male students walking past a sign that says [...] "no girls beyond this point". The first verse then begins and the students are marching into a classroom and sit at individual tables. When the chorus begins, Lisa and Jessica are standing on a stage in front of their band performing for rows of still students who stare back blankly. When the second verse begins the students are in the classroom while guards patrol its perimeter and the teacher hits a blackboard with a pointing stick. During the second chorus Lisa and Jessica get their band members together in a toilet to start their rebellion at the school. When the bridge starts smash cuts are shown of them taking over the school's PA system, and the students getting <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> chairs in the classrooms and throwing objects at a teacher {{standing in front of a}} blackboard. The video ends with everyone running down stairs out of the school, with Jessica and Lisa leading the way. The scenes are inter cut to scenes of Lisa and Jessica holding each other.

500|$|Manners {{noted that}} [...] "Closure" [...] {{was one of}} the first episodes in which the {{production}} staff was able to [...] "shoot in Los Angeles with the sun out". According to Manners, the show was struggling with the fact that [...] "we weren't in Vancouver anymore and that our show had suddenly become very bright and cheery". To amend this, Bill Roe, director of photography, used tree branches and c-stands to block out the sunlight. [...] The first scene with the walk-ins rising <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> grave, shot at Griffith Park above the playground, was [...] "tricky," [...] according to director Kim Manners. Manners felt uncomfortable telling the children to rise out of [...] "graves", feeling it could psychologically hurt them, so instead the crew called the holes in the ground [...] "forts." [...] The scenes taking place at April Air Force Base was shot in San Bernardino, California at a closed airfield, the former Norton Air Force Base. On the airbase was a large abandoned house complex of over 400 buildings constructed and used by the United States military. [...] According to Manners, the entire area was [...] "eerie", and many of the houses still had furniture in them. Originally, the producers wanted to name the fictitious air force March Air Force Base. However, the presence of an actual air force base with the same name necessitated a change to April Air Force Base. One of the shots in the April Air Force Base was filmed at a sound stage in Los Angeles. The scene at the restaurant was shot in a location on Sepulveda Boulevard, at a hotel that had been standing there for 30 to 40 years.|$|E
