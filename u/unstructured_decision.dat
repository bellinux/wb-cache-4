50|$|Like {{many other}} control strategies, {{adaptive}} collaborative control has limits to its capabilities. Although the adaptive collaborative control allows for many tasks to be automated and other predefined cases to query the human operator, <b>unstructured</b> <b>decision</b> making remains {{the domain of}} humans, especially when common sense is required. Particularly, robots possess poor judgment at high-level perceptual functions, including object recognition and situation assessment.A high number of tasks or a particular task that is very involved may create many questions, thereby increasing {{the complexity of the}} dialogue. This complexity to the dialogue in turn adds complexity to the system design. To retain its adaptive nature, the flow of control and information through the simuland will vary with time and events. This dynamic makes debugging, verification, and validation difficult because it is harder to precisely identify an error condition or duplicate a failure situation. This becomes particularly problematic if the system must operate in a regulated facility, such as a nuclear power plant or waste water facility.Issues that affect human-based teams also encumber adaptive collaborative controlled systems. In both cases, teams are required to coordinate activities, exchange information, communicate effectively, and minimize the potential for interference. Other factors that affect teams include resource distribution, timing, sequencing, progress monitoring, and procedure maintenance.Collaboration involves that all partners exhibit trust in the other collaborators and understand the other. To do so, each collaborator needs to have an accurate idea of what the other is capable of doing and how they will carry out an assignment. In some cases, the agent may have to weigh the responses from a human and the human must believe in the decisions a robot makes.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – To aid theory building, {{the use of}} {{decision}} theory (DT) concepts in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research is examined. Design/methodology/approach – An abductive approach considers two DT concepts, Snowden’s Cynefin framework for sense-making and Keeney’s value-focussed decision analysis, in a systematic literature review of 160 peer-reviewed papers in English. Findings – Around 60 per cent of the papers on decision-making in SSCM come from operational research (OR), which makes explicit use of DT. These are almost all normative and rationalist and focussed on structured decision contexts. Some exceptions seek to address <b>unstructured</b> <b>decision</b> contexts via Complex Adaptive Systems or Soft Systems Methodology. Meanwhile, a second set, around 16 per cent, comes from business ethics and are empirical, behavioural decision research. Although this set does not explicitly refer to DT, the empirical evidence here supports Keeney’s value-focussed analysis. Research limitations/implications – There is potential for theory building in SSCM using DT, but the research only addresses SSCM research (including corporate responsibility and ethics) and not DT in SCM or wider sustainable development research. Practical implications – Use of particular decision analysis methods for SSCM may be improved by better understanding different decision contexts. Social implications – The research shows potential synthesis with ethical DT absent from DT and SCM research. Originality/value – Empirical behavioural decision analysis for SSCM is considered alongside normative, rational analysis for the first time. Value-focussed DT appears useful for <b>unstructured</b> <b>decision</b> contexts found in SSCM.

40|$|There is convincing {{evidence}} that structuring decision making leads to better decisions. Comparing structured and <b>unstructured</b> professional <b>decisions</b> {{on a wide variety}} of topics in medicine, psychology or social welfare, it was found that structured decisions were as good as and often better than <b>unstructured</b> <b>decisions.</b> This can be explained by the fact that professionals, like anyone else, make errors of judgement. In different professional settings decision support tools have therefore been developed and implemented. As far as probation is concerned, tools for risk assessment are currently used in many countries. Assessment of the risks of recidivism and criminogenic needs thus have become structured, yet decisions on interventions are still to a large extent a matter of professional judgement. This is problematic, since this decision is fundamental in the probation process, and can have a large impact on the effectiveness of probation and on the life of the offender. Dutch probation practice shows that the quality of intervention planning indeed leaves something to be desired. Structuring the decision process for intervention planning, without replacing the professional, may improve the quality of probation work. It would seem to be a logical next step in the development of assessment tools...|$|R
40|$|Model {{management}} {{is a research}} area in decision support systems (DSS). Current research trends emphasize the specification of decision models at the conceptual level rather than their detailed implementation. Several approaches have been proposed for the conceptual specification of model management systems (MMS). However, these methods lack the design theory for {{the discovery of the}} inheritance relationship between decision models. As a result, redundancy and inconsistency arise in MMSs. This paper proposes the use of an object-oriented (OO) approach to the design of MMSs.

An inheritance rule checking system(IRCS) based upon it has been implemented as a software tool for designing a MMS. I.

In this paper we review a number of experiments conducted to compare the results of different MCA methods when applied to the same decision problem. I compare and critically examine the hypotheses postulated and the results obtained from these experiments. Despite the equivocal results yielded in some experiments, many authors recommend applying two or more MCA methods, {{especially in the case of}} <b>unstructured</b> <b>decision</b> problems.

The prior evaluation system structures the prior evaluation process and defines the evaluation procedures, objectives, and responsibilities. The simulation model utilizing the mathematical theories mentioned above supports the intuitive evaluation process.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a contracting company is closely linked {{with the quality of}} the decisions at the strategic level. However, the increasing complexity of organizations’ internal and external environments and the <b>unstructured</b> nature of <b>decisions</b> at the strategic level make the decision making a very complicated task. The number of influential variables is so large and their effects are so varied that any attempt to encapsulate them in a rational manner can indeed hinder the decision making process. To this end, this research explores the advantages of decision support tools and the benefit these tools can yield for the strategic management. Some of these tools are deterministic and structured: they rely on straightforward calculation or optimisation techniques. The solution to the unstructured problems, however, has relied on heuristic approaches and judgement of the decision-maker. While deterministic problems have to a large extent been addressed and appropriate models and algorithm have been developed for them, the unstructured problems have remained relatively unattended and the research works in this area tend to focus on single issues. This paper conceptualizes an umbrella framework using a “Viable Systems Diagnosis” VSD Model and a "Decision Framework", within which strategic decision making research applicable to construction can be coordinated and developed, thus avoiding wasteful duplication and gaps in knowledge. To this end, the research highlights the relevance and potential use of artificial intelligent techniques in assisting the managers with <b>unstructured</b> <b>decisions.</b> Further, it is argued that a strategic decision support system should assume an integrated structure, as many decision nodes, within the overall decision making structure, share common attributes and the inter-connection amongst these decision nodes has a complex structure.

In this type of a decision, an individual may not have formed preferences or may not know the path {{to arrive at a}} solution. As opposed to selecting from existing alternatives, little research examines when decision makers create an alternative. Electronic commerce websites allow individuals to create a product by customizing it. A web-based simulation called Interactive Choice was developed for the investigation. It is an interactive naturalistic decision space permitting experimental controls such as random placement of participants into conditions and random display of stimuli. Participants customized three products (pizza, cell phones, shoes). Building on theoretical foundations of unfolding model and Image Theory, a model asserts the presentation of the information and preparation of the decision maker influences a decision maker. A phased examination explores decision makers’ cognitive processes by measuring participants’ evaluations of the product created and the process to create it. In the first phase, three experiments find, contrary to previous independent investigations, participants rarely retain a pre-selected default value. Logistic regression reveals that the odds ratio of predicting default retention is dependent on product type. In the second phase, results identify that problem solving instructions influence {{decision making}}. Analyses of multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis reveal patterns for default retention and problem solving instructions that define an electronic decision aid called Choice Builder. The dissertation suggests that when an individual creates a product, he or she has more control over the process that subsequently reduces the influence of the default. A new theoretical foundation is proposed identifying that for <b>unstructured</b> <b>decisions</b> individuals construct both decision strategies and preferences while creating an alternative. With an active process of acquiring and evaluating information, an individual forms a decision strategy and updates preferences to achieve an ideal outcome.

Purchasing is establishing itself as a center of competence for the strategic alliances and development partnerships with suppliers, for the continual process of improvement and for strategic cost management in product development. Materials Management within the Steel Industry is primarily concerned with the planning, acquisition, conversion, flow, and distribution of raw materials to finished goods. Through the use of Materials Management techniques, a company can initiate cost reduction programs. These can include lower stock levels, reduction in number of vendors used, better quality of goods used, integration of supply chain into company's own value chain, etc. As such, {{it is important to}} have an integrated, supporting information system, which can supply valid, up-to-date information as and when required. This thesis investigates whether it is necessary or more advantageous to buy a ready-to-use system, or to write a custom system, to fulfil the before mentioned requirement. New technologies create the opportunity to do business more effectively. Managers must however, take responsibility for participating in the planning and design of the information systems. Many computer-generated reports are designed to enable managers to keep track of day-to-day operations and to monitor the use of resources. Through effective design these reports can help manage not only the use of resources, but also the total cost of ownership. Decision support systems are designed to support semi-structured and <b>unstructured</b> <b>decisions</b> in situations in which information is incomplete. They are developed to support decisions that are so different each time that it would be hard to develop a standard set of procedures for programming them. Such decisions may be specific and may relate to a one-time-only situation. A decision support system should enable the decision-maker to apply the right decision rule to a problem, rather than using standard rules that may not apply because of changing conditions. After a sample group tested the custom software system and completed the questionnaires, the information was summarised. The most important conclusion is that while the smaller, custom written system is not ideally suited for every application within a larger company, it will be ideal for a smaller company. Ease of adaptation and the financial impact also influences the final decision, where the easier to adapt, 'cheaper' custom system is more suitable to a small company...|$|R

30|$|If {{compared}} to other businesses, cargo transportation in tramp mode has three distinctive characteristics. The first characteristic is that its production cycle (ship voyage) passes through different economic systems which cause uncertainty and create <b>unstructured</b> <b>decision</b> situation (Fields and Shingles 2016). In an <b>unstructured</b> <b>decision</b> situation, solution steps are usually not known beforehand. The second characteristic is that production time (voyage time) varies considerably from one alternative production cycle to another. The production cycle {{is said to be}} time-sensitive because of this variation in time. The variation is mainly caused by the alternative cargo mixes available for transport in competition with other ships, the alternative shipping routes the ship may follow towards the same cargo mix, and the alternative ship speeds at which the ship may sail. In comparison, the production cycle in liner shipping is not sensitive to time since production time is fixed where the ship sails per a predetermined itinerary (see El Noshokaty  2013). Likewise, crop harvesting in agriculture, car manufacturing and assembly lines in industry, and road paving in construction are all not time-sensitive. Time-sensitivity is known to the ship owner when he hires his ship as a time charter for a better hire per-day, main while he ignores it when he does not hire his ship as a voyage charter for a better gross profit per day (Time Charter Equivalent rate in voyage charter is not the gross profit per day as been defined in this paper). However, the ship owner shows awareness of time sensitivity when he puts in the voyage charter party a clause specifying a minimum cargo loading and discharging rate. His intention is to minimise voyage time. This action influences few cost and revenue items plus cargo handling days, while a gross-profit-per-day objective influences all cost and revenue items plus all voyage days, including sailing and waiting days. The gross-profit-per-day objective is more described hereinafter. The third characteristic is that transportation unit calls at a variable number of stops and follows many calling sequences among these stops. In other words, a transportation unit does not operate on a published schedule but serves different stops in response to tenders of cargo. It runs like a taxi cab in private transport if {{compared to}} a bus in public transport. This mode of operation requires, in model terminology, many variables and constraints which in turn requires the use of mathematical models (Christiansen and Fagerholt 2014).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide the control decisions made during the task of grasping objects with a simple compliant grasper in <b>unstructured</b> environments. The <b>decision</b> process relies only on the sensing of angular deflection of the compliant gripper joints – proprioceptive information available on most robot hands and grippers. This information is used to infer the state of contact between the gripper and the object and guide a set of actions to be undertaken in order to lead to a successful grasp. We believe that the performance of the gripper under a POMDP model built from this limited sensory information will serve as a valuable baseline for comparison with more complex sensing modalities, allowing for quantitative analysis of the tradeoffs between commonly available sensory suites.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{information system}} based DSS is developed for Open and Distance Learning (ODL) institutions in India. The system has been web structured with the most suitable newly developed modules. A DSS model has been developed for solving semi-structured and <b>unstructured</b> problems including <b>decision</b> making with regard to various programmes and activities operating in the ODLIs. The DSS model designed for problem solving is generally based on quantitative formulas, whereas for problems involving imprecision and uncertainty, a fuzzy theory based DSS is employed. The computer operated system thus developed would help the ODLI management to quickly identify programmes and activities that require immediate attention. It shall also provide guidance for obtaining the most appropriate managerial decisions without any loss of time. As a result, the various subsystems operating in the ODLI are able to administer its activities more efficiently and effectively to enhance the overall performance of the concerned ODL institution to a new level...|$|R
40|$|Today {{it is the}} competitive, fast {{business}} world most organizations start with data processing system that support transaction processing and evolve to management information system which support tactical and strategic level decision making. The opinion is that computer based systems are very valuable for transaction processing and support of operational level decision making. Computers {{play an important role}} in providing significant support for tactical and strategic level decision making especially for <b>unstructured</b> and unanticipated <b>decisions.</b> In the past few years a new type of system called Decision Support System has gained a great deal of popularity in the information system. We are sure that for some characteristics of organizations decision support system are very useful. Decision Support System supports individual decision making - a major component of managerial work. DSS is the primary means by which businesses can gain competitive advantage through analyzing and using the information stored in their computerized systems. Decision making process are playing important role in the Global Business Environment. Decision Support System supports not only for the decision making but also communication among individuals. </strong...|$|R
