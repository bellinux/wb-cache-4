Using a difference-in-differences specification, I find that the departure of all-stars caused their bank-industry <b>underwriting</b> <b>groups</b> to lose equity issuance market share. Market share losses were more severe for IPOs than for IPOs and follow-on underwritings combined. The higher the average quality of all-stars in a bank-industry, the more severe were the bank-industry 2 ̆ 7 s losses. Additionally, the departure of all-stars raised the cost of equity capital for IPOs underwritten by their bank-industry groups, particularly for IPOs that were more difficult to value. Ultimately, the loss of sell-side research talent, an unintended consequence of regulation, forced issuers to accept research coverage of inferior quality, raising the cost of obtaining public capital. ...|$|R

Cash later said the FSP inmates [...] "were the most enthusiastic audience I have ever played to." [...] The [...] "Folsom Prison Blues" [...] single from that album was #1 on the country music chart for four weeks, and the album was on the top 200 pop album chart for 122 weeks. A 40th-anniversary tribute concert was to take place in the same cafeteria at FSP on January 13, 2008, with a special appearance by Cash's original drummer W.S. [...] "Fluke" [...] Holland.

40|$|The Swedish {{publisher}} Georg Scheutz (1785 - 1873) {{was a man}} who combined literary, political, scientific, {{and technological}} interests. Inspired by the difference engine of Charles Babbage, he and his son, the engineer Edvard Scheutz (1821 - 1881), designed and constructed a machine to compute tabular differences and print the results. The machine, built with a grant from the Swedish governnient and <b>underwritten</b> by a <b>group</b> of Swedish supporters of Scheutz, was completed in 1853. It was patented in Great Britain in 1834, shown at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1855, and purchased for the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York, in 1856. A copy of the machine was constructed in 1857. For a short time, in 1858, work contracted by the United States Department of Navy for the Nautical Almanac Office was performed on the machine. Because of the departure (resulting from a major dispute) of the astronomer Benjamin A. Gould and his assistants from the Dudley Observatory, the machine was used rarely in later years and gradually fell into total disuse. The arguments surrounding the construction, purchase, and use of the machine portray two recurring themes in the history of technology. One is the conflict between defenders of established procedures and those of new innovations within a given field. The other is the influence of social, economic, or political currents on the activities in that field. The Scheutz calculator is significant because it made feasible the concept of a machine that computes and then retains results in printed form.

500|$|Although {{volunteer}} enthusiasm {{was essential}} to the Association's plans in the Harvest Campaign, it did not rely on it at the higher levels; the state chairs were compensated, both by salary and commission. J.W. Gibbes, clerk of the South Carolina House of Representatives, was hired as that state's executive director; he undertook to sell 100,000 coins and received just under $3,500 in salary and commissions, all paid in 1926. Local volunteers organized Chamber of Commerce luncheons to sell coins throughout the South; chapters of the UDC purchased pieces to present to surviving Civil War veterans. [...] The quota for Florida was 175,000 coins, with each town and city apportioned its share. [...] Often, Kiwanis or Rotary <b>groups</b> <b>underwrote</b> local quotas. Mrs. N. Burton Bass of Atlanta {{was reported to be}} the leading seller, once disposing of 233 coins in an afternoon. A series of dance balls honored the UDC members who sold large numbers of pieces. [...] Nevertheless, Hyder and Colbert suggested that there was [...] "a general lack of more ladies such as Mrs. Bass"; many municipalities had trouble finding local chairs. Outside the South, sales were promoted by three professional publicists hired by the Association. To keep public interest high, the Association released Lukeman's conceptions for Stone Mountain, which were on a smaller scale than Borglum's. [...] Lukeman conceived a scaled-down concept, of the three Confederate leaders on horseback. Despite the campaign, sales were slower than expected. In late 1925, the Association offered Northern banks a commission of seven cents a coin; it is uncertain if any took up the offer. The continuing opposition of the GAR to the coins dampened sales in the North, and there was considerable criticism of the coin issue in newspapers.|$|R
