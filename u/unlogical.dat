Therefore will evaluated its using in the Law no. 25 / 1997 Labor. This ineffectively using was assumed to emerge multiple interpretation among the lawyers. And to examine this assumption, might needed some comparations with the later coming Law of Labor no. 13 / 2003. The result has showed {{that the use of}} language in Indonesian law often appears an <b>unlogical</b> meaning. Beside also rising the unclearness using of some vocabularies, like 'dan/atau', 'dalam hal [...] ., maka [...] .,etc...|$|E

This study was carried out with 300 students selected by random sampling among the students at 6 th, 7 th and 8 th grades of elementary schools in Turkey. A problem test which requires realistic responses was administered to these students. Two separate forms were arranged for this problem test given to the students. After the students solved the problem test, totally 60 students, were randomly selected {{to participate in an}} interview aiming {{to investigate the}} students ’ thoughts while solving the problems and how they comment on the problem situation. In this study, it was determined that the percentage of the students ’ level of achievement related with the problems the students had to consider the real-life situations was low. This result can be commented that the students tend to make mathematical operations when they meet a problem in a maths class as they think the problem must have an accurate solution although they find the answer <b>unlogical.</b> Article history...|$|E
40|$|The decimal {{scale for}} {{vegetation}} analyses of permanent plots Formerly for vegetation analysis of permanent plots the author used the modified scale of Braun-Blanquet with smaller intervals {{than the original}} scale. For calculations {{on the basis of}} coverage (e. g. of difference- and change quotients) the symbols of this scale have to be transformed in values proportional to the real coverage percentages. A transformation in very simple values is not possible; so calculations are time-consuming. It has become clear that for an efficient and exact analysis of permanent plots a scale is needed that fulfills the following demands: 1. The scale should be fine enough to register small changes in vegetation. 2. The symbols (numbers) of the scale should be proportional to the real coverage. The coverage values are then equal to the coverage symbols and transformations are not necessary. 3. Coverage and abundance should be determined separately. It is <b>unlogical</b> to combine such uncomparable characteristics in one quantitative scale. 4. The symbols should be as simple as possible. The decimal scale fulfills all these demands and is applied among others by the Research Institute for Nature Management in the Netherlands. At the meeting of the Working Group for Succession Research on Permanent Plots of the International Society for Plant Geography and Ecology the decision has been made to take up the decimal scale in the research program. For the analysis of small divisions of a permanent plot the coarse scale is used. This scale is directly comparable with the finer decimal scale...|$|E
40|$|I 複数の文章の集合からなるテキストは、配列によってその総体的な意味を構築し、発信する。本論は、まず新聞の多様な記事を分析素材として、テキストの配列や諸要素の関係、構成原理を解析し、〔I問い、II事情説明、III転換・新説、IV答え〕の四分節構成法を析出し、その基本的原理を東洋の古典的配列である起承転結と重ねあわせる。II だが、〔序論、本論、結論〕の三分節構成原理を古典古代より継承する西洋近代の論構成が主流となっている現代、その起承転結構成は転における論の破綻、首尾一貫性の欠落が災いして、強く忌避されている。III それは、しかし、従来の転に対する理解に難があったからで、その転調を先行研究に対する新機軸や新実験と解する時、災いは論理的に不可欠の必然へと一変する。IV つまり、I II III IVから構成されるテキストをIIIを中心に配置した問答装置として読み替えることによって、起承転結構成は、科学論文のみならずあらゆるテキストを秘かに律している物語と思考の母型回路であることが明らかになるのである。I. A {{text that}} {{consists}} of multiple sentences constructs and creates its meaning through the order and composition of those sentences. In this paper I examine EastAsian rhetorical organization, the four-part framework for composition Ki-Shoo-Ten-Ketsu 起承転結, and make {{clear that it is}} an essential framework, not only for narrative, but also logic. II. First, I analyze several articles from Japanese newspapers with regard to their composition and the relationships between paragraphs. I demonstrate that the four-part order is a fundamental logical principle. It is composed of: I. a beginning (Ki); II. the subsequent progression (Shoo); III. change (Ten); and IV. the conclusion (Ketsu). But, {{because of a lack of}} a coherence caused by the introduction of unexpected elements at the third stage (change), recently this ancient Chinese framework has been regarded as an <b>unlogical</b> pattern and does not play an important role in writing in Japan. III. However, if we define a text as a collection of sentences that constitutes a Question-Answer-System, every text should begin with an explicit or implicit question. The question or unsolved problem presented in the first section is explained in detail in the second part II. At this point, the problem has still not been solved, so the linear logic reaches a dead end. It is the third part, III. the change, where changes in the inadequate linear logic show us new ideas and perspectives for finding a solution. That is the reason why we have the introduction of unexpected elements into the normal logical progression in the third part. The Ten (change) section is a turning point and has the function of critiquing and overturning inadequate existing research. The revolutionary function of the Ten section is the most important and indispensable part of the Question-Answer-System within the text. The final fourth part, IV conclusion (Ketsu) depends on the third part and summarizes its results and implications. The newly reinterpreted model of the ancient four-part-order, Ki-Shoo-Ten-Ketsu, therefore, creates the following thinking-matrix:I. Question, II. Explanation of circumstances to III. Turning point and Proposal of new Ideas and IV. Answer and Solution. While I. and II. belong to the Question-dimension, III. and IV. constitute symmetrically the Answer-dimension. In this new order, III. (Ten) leads the final part IV. (Ketsu) to an answer to the question posed in I. (Ki). In other words, III. (Ten) is literally located at the center of the text and it is the other parts I., II. and IV.,that serve to provide the context for the Ten (Change) part. IV. The logical and revolutionary function of Ten (Change) has been overlooked in the past in the Western history of rhetoric and writing theory. But, a clear comprehension of the fundamental matrix for narrative and logical thinking, the four-part-framework Ki-Shoo-Ten-Ketsu, will bring about a number of new perspectives and innovations in our cultural texts, both Asian and European...|$|E
