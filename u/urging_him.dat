5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, {{supporters}} of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped. Later, supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to dismiss the charges.|$|E
5|$|The Antiochene noblemen sent envoys to Baldwin II, <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> {{to come to}} the principality. Alice {{decided to}} resist and sought {{assistance}} from Imad ad-Din Zengi, Atabeg of Aleppo. However, BaldwinII's soldiers, who had meanwhile reached Antioch, captured Alice's envoy. Before long, Alice was forced to beg for mercy from her father. He removed Alice from the regency, ordering her to leave Antioch.|$|E

50|$|Nonetheless, the United States, {{objecting to}} the {{remaining}} text, decided to send a low-level delegation, headed by Ambassador Michael Southwick, to the Conference, rather than have United States Secretary of State Colin Powell attend himself. German officials criticized this decision, and the United States Congressional Black Caucus <b>urged</b> <b>him</b> to attend. The Anti-Defamation League <b>urged</b> <b>him</b> to stay away.|$|R
5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and friends had been <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.|$|E
5|$|During her training, {{she worked}} with the {{district}} nurses, visiting families in the Melbourne's less affluent suburbs. Her ambition {{was to become a}} doctor who improved the lives of women and children. Women of her own social class did not normally work after they married, so marriage was not something she had intended. In 1919, with the war over, she wrote to Ned <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia.|$|E
5|$|In May 1202 Pope Innocent III {{wrote to}} Coutances, <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to impose {{religious}} punishments on any rebels against King John's {{rule in the}} duchy of Normandy. When John lost the duchy in 1204, Coutances did not resist the government of King Philip II, {{although he did not}} make his complete peace with Philip until March 1207. In 1206–1207, Coutances, along with his suffragan bishops, petitioned Philip for special legal procedures relating to patronage, which Philip granted.|$|E

50|$|Ethan's {{decision}} to gain {{wealth and power}} is influenced by criticisms and advice from people he knows. His acquaintance Margie <b>urges</b> <b>him</b> to accept bribes; the bank manager (whose ancestors Ethan blames for his family's misfortunes) <b>urges</b> <b>him</b> to be more ruthless. Ethan's friend Joey, a bank teller, even gives Ethan a lesson on how to rob a bank {{and get away with}} it.|$|R
5|$|Weizsäcker {{joined the}} CDU in 1954. Some years later, Helmut Kohl {{offered him a}} safe seat for the 1965 elections, even {{going so far as}} to have Chancellor Konrad Adenauer write two letters <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to run, but Weizsäcker declined, due to his work in the German Evangelical Church Assembly, wanting to avoid a {{conflict}} of interest. However, he became a member of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) in the 1969 federal elections, serving until 1981.|$|E
5|$|When Marsh {{responded to}} Lakes, {{he paid the}} {{prospector}} $100, <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to keep the finds a secret. Learning that Lakes had corresponded with Cope, Marsh sent his field collector Benjamin Mudge to Morrison to secure Lakes' services. Marsh published a description of Lakes' discoveries in the American Journal of Science on July 1, and before Cope could publish his own interpretation of the finds, Lakes wrote {{to him that the}} bones should be shipped to Marsh, a severe insult to Cope.|$|E
5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to tell {{the public about the}} danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, {{one of the authors of}} the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.|$|E

5|$|A {{letter of}} support from 120 members of the German parliament, the Bundestag, {{was sent to the}} Russian Ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin. It {{described}} proceedings against the women as disproportionate and draconian. On August 9, 2012, 200 Pussy Riot supporters in Berlin marched, wearing colored balaclavas, in a show of support for the group. Attending the trial, British MP and Shadow Foreign Office Minister for Human Rights, Kerry McCarthy, also backed the group, describing proceedings as “surreal”. Lech Wałęsa criticised the church performance as “tasteless”, but nevertheless wrote to Putin <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to pardon the women.|$|E
5|$|Although about 300 French knights {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} Holy Land, no influential noblemen joined him; they preferred participating in the French Albigensian Crusade or did not see him as sufficiently eminent. John's cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined him only after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to Egypt to plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the Holy Land, John forged a new truce with Al-Adil {{by the middle of}} 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to preach a new crusade.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor lobbied {{behind the}} scenes for the 1934 Costigan-Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime, {{including}} arranging a meeting between Franklin and NAACP president Walter Francis White. Fearing he would lose the votes of Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda, however, Franklin refused to publicly support the bill, which proved unable to pass the Senate. In 1942, Eleanor worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of sharecropper Odell Waller, convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight; though Franklin {{sent a letter to}} Virginia Governor Colgate Darden <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, Waller was executed as scheduled.|$|E

5|$|In 1291 Pope Nicholas IV sent {{a letter}} to Joachim III, dated 23 March, {{reminding}} the Bulgarian Patriarch of their old friendship and <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to join the Roman Church. The Pope also {{sent a letter}} to George Terter I expressing his hope to see Bulgaria return to the authority of Rome, alluding to the union between Bulgaria and Rome concluded in 1205 during the reign of emperor Kaloyan. Despite some hesitations Joachim III maintained the firm position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church on the matter and the papal initiative failed to produce any tangible results.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Castro {{joined the}} Party of the Cuban People (Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran {{politician}} Eduardo Chibás. A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás came {{third in the}} 1948 general election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers and Castro soon received a death threat <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to leave the university, but refusing and beginning to carry a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends. In later years, anti-Castro dissidents accused him of committing gang-related assassinations at the time, but these remain unproven.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1949, Nixon {{embarked}} on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many of his closest advisers <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat. He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E

5|$|Though Green was {{caring for}} Farrar {{in the family}} home while he {{recovered}} from his repeated bouts of illness, she was also continuing to drink heavily and, increasingly often, claiming to be contemplating suicide or to want Margaret Hacker dead. In late September, Farrar searched the house and her belongings. In her purse, he discovered seed packets labeled as castor beans, {{a copy of a}} supposedly-anonymous letter that had been sent to Farrar <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to not divorce Green, and empty vials of potassium chloride. He removed all three items from her purse and hid them.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin II was {{captured}} in 1123, and the burghers of Antioch sent envoys to Bohemond, <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> {{to come to his}} principality. Bohemond reached the age of majority at the age of 16. According to William of Tyre, he made an agreement with William II, Duke of Apulia, stipulating that the one who first died without issue was to will his principality to the other; however, the reliability of William's report is suspect. Alexander of Telese recorded that before leaving for Syria, Bohemond entrusted his Italian domains to the Holy See, but Romuald of Salerno said that he made Alexander, Count of Conversano, the overseer of those lands. Bohemond sailed from Otranto with a fleet of twenty-four ships in September 1126.|$|E
5|$|Eddy left Boston in September {{and sailed}} to Machias, where he {{recruited}} about 20 men. On October 13, this party sailed from Machias for Passamaquoddy Bay. Coincidentally, John Allan, {{who was working}} on a longer-term plan for military action, sailed from Campobello Island for Machias the same day. The two parties met at sea, where Allan attempted to dissuade Eddy from his plan, informing him that the Mi'kmaq (the largest tribe in Nova Scotia) would not help him. Allan extracted a promise from Eddy to wait at Campobello while he went to Machias to meet with the council there. When the Machias council learned of how little native support there was, they sent a letter to Eddy <b>urging</b> <b>him</b> to give up the effort. Eddy persisted, and left Campobello, having added nine Passamaquoddy recruits to his band.|$|E
