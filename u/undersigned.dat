Informality is a globally widespread phenomenon, which has become a feature of developed and developing countries. Despite the global reach, and despite the adverse effects it has, informality still remains the term that causes many disagreements, which are directly related to its definition, classification and measurement. This study aims to present the real picture of informality in Kosovo; The size, the determinants, and the economic consequences that this phenomenon may cause. In this study, informality is defined as a phenomenon that describes all the economic activities that are secretly developed by the state and which do not neglect the rule of the state.

In deference to the faith of our dear mother who was through her lifetime a loyal though never bigoted communicant of that congregation, perhaps the current pastor of the First Presbyterian Church would consent to read the Twenty-third Psalm, which was her favorite passage in the Scriptures and is mine since it contains no charnel words, no morbid mouthings about corruption and decay and, being mercifully without creed or dogma, carries no threat of eternal hell-fire for those parties we do not like, no direct promise of a heaven which, if one may judge by the people who are surest of going there, must be a powerfully dull place, populated to a considerable and uncomfortable degree by prigs, time-servers and unpleasantly aggressive individuals. Hell may have a worse climate but undoubtedly the company is sprightlier. The Catholics, with their genius for stage-management, handle this detail better. The officiating clergyman speaks in Latin and the parishioners, being unacquainted with that language are impressed by the majesty of the rolling, sonorous periods without being shocked by tressing allusions and harrowing references.|$|E

The four escapees were Australian Corporal Rodney Breavington and Private Victor Gale, and English soldiers, Private Harold Waters and Private Eric Fletcher. The pledge reads: [...] "I the <b>undersigned,</b> hereby solemnly swear on my honour that I will not, under any circumstances, attempt to escape." [...] With three exceptions, everyone refused to sign, because the prisoners saw it as their duty to escape if they could. Under the Geneva Convention, POWs {{had the right to}} attempt to escape and they were not supposed to be punished if they were recaptured. However, at that time, Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention. General Fukuye was furious at the mass display of insubordination and the following day he ordered all prisoners, except the three who had agreed to sign, to congregate at the parade square in Selarang Barracks. What ensued was to become known as the [...] "Selarang Barracks Incident".|$|E

[...] The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting {{of them was a}} few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.|$|E
40|$|In Taxon 10 (1961) 261, a {{proposal}} was published to conserve the generic {{name of the}} Papuan genus Phyllocharis Diels, 1917, against Phyllocharis Fée, Essai Crypt.

As {{a matter of fact}} an experienced lichenologist was one of the three botanists who endorsed the proposal by <b>undersigning</b> it. Therefore, no harm would have come from accepting the proposal and this would have been distinctly useful for stabilizing the generic name Phyllocharis in the Campanulaceae, not only for the few botanists working in New Guinea, but for all handbooks and monographs on the family. It is precisely for this purpose that there is the provision in the Rules to conserve generic names. No useful purpose is pursued to drop established names if it is reasonable to maintain them, which I strongly think it is in this case. The proposal has unfortunately been found redundant by the majority of the Subcommittee for Phanerogams (Taxon 12, 1963, 238) and was rejected.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis investigates the application of enterprise document management techniques to better support documents discovery and reuse across a learning organisation. It examines the nature of documents and organisations, and the roles that documentation plays within modern enterprises. This thesis recognises the increasing need to reuse documents {{at a number of}} levels of abstraction, so leveraging an enterprise's valuable document resources. Enabled by Internet developments and document mark-up languages, particularly the extensible mark-up language (XML) and its associated standards, this thesis describes the development of ideas that have led to the design and initial implementation of the Model-driven Reuse Architecture MRA The concept underlying the design of the MRA have developed from an initial feasibility study undertaken with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MoD) to provide management techniques for military support documentation. A range of current approaches to document management and enterprise-wide information model based approach to document management permits access to and reuse of document fragments for new purposes. An extensible mechanism permits the inclusion of other document approaches to facilitate document discovery, potentially lead into reuse. This thesis describes the approach taken <b>undersigning</b> a new document architecture that provides a work-focussed approach to document management encouraging social collaboration rather than automation, and supporting a range of users within the same environment. This thesis presents the overall Model-driven Reuse Architecture and preliminary implementation that has been developed to support the specific needs of teaching and learning in higher education. The resulting web-base implementation, MRA-HE, is evaluated in terms of how it performs against a set of realistic scenarios within the domain of higher education. Upon evaluating the MRA-HE implementation, the final chapter of this thesis generalises some of the MRA approaches to the diverse demands of other types of organisation. ...|$|R
40|$|It is the {{ultimate}} goal of the intended REACH process (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) of the European Union to identify substances of hazardous properties and to evaluate the risks of human and environmental exposure. During the last few months there has been a controversial discussion as to what extent in vitro studies and consideration of structure activity relationship provide sufficient information to waive repeated exposure studies. Industry as well as certain regulatory agencies or NGOs support this approach and propose that repeated dose studies may only be required beyond 100 t/a. From a toxicological point of view it has to be stressed that this discussion primarily considers the cost reduction and protection of animals, whereas protection of {{human health and the environment}} are secondary. In vitro studies only allow identification of specific hazardous properties which can be detected by the specific test system. Moreover, appropriate information on the dose response of adverse effects, identification of thresholds and NOELs that are essential for risk characterization cannot be obtained from these studies. Consequently, identification of all relevant hazardous properties and endpoints of adverse effects can only be determined in the intact animal by repeated dose studies such as 28 -day or 90 -day studies. In the absence of such information the hazard identification is incomplete and there is no basis for appropriate risk assessment of human exposure. Thus, any waiving of repeated dose studies in animals bears the probability of unforeseen effects in case of acute or continuous human exposure. From this the <b>undersigning</b> European Toxicologists conclude: 1. The intention of REACH is to identify hazardous properties in order that a reliable risk assessment can be made and measures taken to deal with chemicals posing a significant risk. 2. The recent debate has centered on ways in which the well established in vivo methods for risk assessment can be bypassed. 3. The evidence that the available alternatives would support such replacement is weak. Progress to improve their value for risk assessment purposes is bound to be slow because the issues are very complex. As a group of European Toxicologists we strongly support the need for more research support in these areas, but we believe that over claims for progress is damaging their development. 4. Under the circumstances only two options are available: to reduce very substantially the estimation of hazard and risk with inevitable adverse consequences for human health and environmental protection, or to continue the existing methods until properly validated new methods are available...|$|R
40|$|The {{renewal of}} DG {{is based on}} the {{following}} presuppositions The analysis of the historical evolution of the discipline shows that, from {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, the only advancements of the discipline are connected to the experimental field of the drawing. The few original contributions of theoretical nature are unfortunately an exception. The same analysis shows the importance that the drawing has had, as experimental method, not only for the DG but for the geometry in general. The Advent of the digital representation has put at the researchers disposal a tool able to: to generate graphics in the space; synthetically express problems that, in the history, it has only been possible to develop analytically; to generate graphics with an accuracy one hundred times greater; to produce images of superior quality (dynamism, chiaroscuro, interactivity). As Gaspard Monge affirmed, the DG has two privileged fields of application: the first is to represented exactly, on drawings that have only two dimensions, the objects that have three dimensions and that are open to a rigorous definition; the second is to deduce from the exact description of the bodies all that follows consequently from their forms and from their reciprocal positions; in this sense it is a means for the search for the scientific truth and it offers perpetual examples of the passage from the well-known to the unknown… the first aim is today excellently absolved by means of the machines; the second cannot be accomplished by means of the machines, nevertheless the machines represent for the researcher a powerful means of inquiry and of discovery. The renewal of DG can be realized through the following initiatives The introduction of the three-dimensional digital modelling among the methods of the Descriptive Geometry in the shapes of mathematical representation and of the polygonal representation, the first for the metric control, the second for the formal control of the represented objects. The analysis, critical, of the performances of the digital representation: tracing in the space, accuracy, coherent mathematical representation with studied functions (degree of the equations) etc. The study of the algorithms that are at the base of the digital procedures and of their relationship with the historical theories from which they descend. The theoretical re-reading of the classical problems and their experimentation with the digital representation. The proposal of new procedures that takes into account the digital means available. The definition and the adoption of an unified glossary (for instance: digital representation instead of digital modelling and so on). The initiatives that we have described and mainly those which regard the re-reading of the classical authors by means of the digital tools, the optimisation of new solutions of general application, the unification of the glossary, are not such that they can be developed in a narrow ambit, that’s why the authors of this Manifesto invite the colleagues of the other Athenaeums to discuss it and to <b>undersign</b> it in order to concretely participate in the project of the renewal of Descriptive Geometry...|$|R
