40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{temperature}} {{during the development}} of fish larvae on sex differentiation is well known, but not so well known {{is the impact of}} the daily thermocycles. Our aim was to investigate the effect of early exposure of Senegal sole larvae to different temperature cycles on gonad development, sex ratio, and sex steroid (11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT); estradiol (E 2); and testosterone, (T)) content in muscle extracts of juveniles. From 1 to 97 days posthatching (DPH) fish larvae and post-larvae were subjected to three temperature regimes: Thermophase-Cryophase (TC), Cryophase-Thermophase (CT), and constant temperature. In fish exposed to TC, sex determination occurred earlier, because 90 % of soles were males/females at 110 DPH, whereas 45 % of <b>fish</b> <b>under</b> CT were undifferentiated at that time. <b>Fish</b> <b>under</b> TC showed the highest growth rates, followed by <b>fish</b> <b>under</b> constant temperature and by <b>fish</b> <b>under</b> CT, the differences being statistically significant between the TC and CT groups. Regarding sex ratio, juveniles exposed to TC showed a higher proportion of females than <b>fish</b> <b>under</b> CT or constant temperature. <b>Under</b> TC, <b>fish</b> showed the highest concentration of E 2, whereas 11 -KT concentration was highest in <b>fish</b> <b>under</b> CT and constant temperature. <b>Fish</b> <b>under</b> constant temperature and CT showed higher T levels than those under TC.

40|$|A {{small number}} of fishers in Chiba Prefecture of eastern Japan use cotton gill nets to catch Japanese spiny lobster Panulirus japonicus. To examine the {{advantages}} of cotton gill nets, we analyzed changes in mesh breaking load of a new cotton gill net used in a fishing operation. A new cotton gill net was also soaked in a seawater tank to simulate ghost fishing conditions. The average mesh breaking load of new cotton mesh was 50. 3 N. This value decreased to 19. 0 N after 38 days (∼ 912 h), and after 82 days (∼ 1968 h) the mesh could be easily torn (breaking load 0. 07 N). <b>Under</b> <b>fishing</b> conditions, the cumulative soak time was only 744. 4 h over 19 months.

40|$|We {{propose a}} dynamic model to {{describe}} a fishery where both preys and predators are harvested by a population of fishermen who are allowed to catch {{only one of the}} two species at a time. According to the strategy currently employed by each agent, i. e. the harvested variety, at each time period the population of fishermen is partitioned into two groups, and an evolutionary mechanism regulates how agents dynamically switch from one strategy to the other in order to improve their profits. Among the various dynamic models proposed, the most realistic is a hybrid system formed by two ordinary differential equations, describing the dynamics of the interacting species <b>under</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure, and an impulsive variable that evolves in a discrete time scale, in order to describe the changes of the fraction of fishermen that harvest a given stock. The aim of the paper is to analyze the economic consequences of this kind of self-regulating fishery, as well as its biological sustainability, in comparison with other regulatory policies. Our analytic and numerical results give evidence that in some cases this kind of myopic, evolutionary self-regulation might ensure a satisfactory trade-off between profit maximization and resource conservation...|$|E
40|$|Age {{and size}} at {{maturation}} have declined dramatically in many commercial fish stocks {{over the past}} few decades – changes that have been widely attributed to fishing pressure. We performed an analysis of such trends across multiple studies, to test for the consistency of life history changes <b>under</b> <b>fishing,</b> and for their association with the intensity of exploitation (fishing mortality rate). We analyzed 143 time series from 37 commercial fish stocks, the majority of which originated from the North Atlantic. Rates of phenotypic change were calculated for two traditional maturation indices (length and age at 50 % maturity), as well as for probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). We found that all three indices declined in heavily exploited populations, and at a rate that was strongly correlated with the intensity of fishing (for length at 50 % maturity and PMRNs). These results support previous assertions that fishing pressure is playing a major role in the life history changes observed in commercial fish stocks. Rates of change were as strong for PMRNs as for age and size at 50 % maturity, which is consistent with the hypothesis that fishing-induced phenotypic changes can sometimes have a genetic basis...|$|E

This study presents the first discard survival estimates on-board Dutch commercial pulse trawlers. During seven, six, and one fishing trip(s), respectively, undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea), and dab (Limanda limanda) were collected, assessed for vitality and subsequently monitored up to 21 days. Uncorrected for any potential impacts from predation, tagging, research-related handling, or holding conditions overall survival for plaice (n¼ 349), sole (n¼ 226), and dab (n¼ 187) was assessed as 15 % [95 % CI: 11 – 19 %], 29 % [95 % CI: 24 – 35 %], and 16 % [95 % CI: 10 – 26 %] respectively. Survival was mainly effected by water temperature and factors linked to the fishing vessel. Fish length was not found to affect survival. Catch processing time and haul duration affected plaice survival but not sole.

40|$|Ecosystem models {{provide a}} {{platform}} allowing exploration into the possible responses of marine food webs to fishing pressure and various potential management decisions. In {{this study we}} investigate the particular effects of overfishing on the structure and function of the southern Benguela food web, using two models with different underlying assumptions: the spatialized, size-based individual-based model, OSMOSE, and the trophic mass-balance model, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE). Starting from the same reference state of the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem during the 1990 s, we compare {{the response of the}} food web to scenarios of overfishing using these two modelling approaches. A scenario of increased fishing mortality is applied to two distinct functional groups: i) two species of Cape hake, representing important target predatory fish, and ii) the forage species anchovy, sardine and redeye. In these simulations, fishing mortality on the selected functional groups is doubled for 10 years, followed by 10 years at the initial fishing mortality. We compare the food web states before the increase of fishing mortality, after 10 years of overfishing and after a further 10 years during which fishing was returned to initial levels. In order to compare the simulated food web structures with the reference state, and between the two modelling approaches, we use a set of trophic indicators: the mean trophic level of the community and in catches, the trophic pyramid (biomass per discrete trophic level), and the predatory/forage fish biomass ratio. OSMOSE and EwE present globally similar results for the trophic functioning of the ecosystem <b>under</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure: the biomass of targeted species decreases whereas that of their potential competitors increases. The reaction of distant species is more diverse, depending on the feeding links between the compartments. The mean trophic level of the community does not vary enough to be used for assessing ecosystem impacts of fishing, and the mean trophic level in the catch displays a surprising increase due to the short period of overfishing. The trophic pyramids behave in an unexpected way compared to trophic control theory. because at least two food chains with different dynamics are intertwined within the food web. We emphasize the importance of biomass information at the species level for interpreting dynamics in aggregated indicators, and we highlight the importance of competitive groups when looking at ecosystem functioning <b>under</b> <b>fishing</b> disturbance. Finally, we discuss the results within the scope of differences between models, in terms of the way they are formulated, spatial dimensions, predation formulations and the representation of fish life cycles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} to {{transform}} environmental questions about future evolution of ecosystems into queries {{that could be}} submitted to a simulation model. In this work, the model is a marine ecosystem in a fisheries context. When dealing with environmental problems, scenarios are widely used tools for evaluating future evolution of ecosystems given policy options, potential climatic changes or impacts of catastrophic events. If the scenarios are generally expressed in natural language, when working with a model describing the ecosystem, {{it is necessary to}} transform them into formalised queries that can be given as input to the model. In this paper, the ecosystem behavior is described by a qualitative model, defined as a discreteevent system and represented by timed automata. The scenario templates are expressed using temporal logic completed with interest variables. The ecosystem is represented as a set of interacting subsystems and the global model obtained by composition on shared events. This technique is particularly suited to representing large-scale systems such as ecosystems. This work has been applied to a simplified marine ecosystem <b>under</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure. The model describes the tropho-dynamic interactions between fish trophic groups as well as interactions with the activities of a fishery. Scenario templates has been defined and tested in order to check several assumptions of the model...|$|E
