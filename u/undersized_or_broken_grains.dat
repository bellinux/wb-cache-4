40|$|Wave-induced {{fluid flow}} at {{microscopic}} and mesoscopic scales arguably constitutes the {{major cause of}} intrinsic seismic attenuation throughout the exploration seismic and sonic frequency ranges. The quantitative analysis of these phenomena is, however, {{complicated by the fact}} that the governing physical processes may be dependent. The reason for this is that the presence of microscopic heterogeneities, such as micro-cracks <b>or</b> <b>broken</b> <b>grain</b> contacts, causes the stiffness of the so-called modified dry frame to be complex-valued and frequency-dependent, which in turn may affect the viscoelastic behaviour in response to fluid flow at mesoscopic scales. In this work, we propose a simple but effective procedure to estimate the seismic attenuation and velocity dispersion behaviour associated with wave-induced fluid flow due to both microscopic and mesoscopic heterogeneities and discuss the results obtained for a range of pertinent scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Village, {{scavenging}} or backyard poultry are {{a valuable}} asset, financially and nutritionally, for very poor {{peoples of the}} world where they can obtain eggs and meat. The poultry, or so-called desi poultry, derive a significant amount of their nutrients from their scavenging activity and thus the cost of feeding is free or low, to their owners. However some poultry keepers may also feed small amounts of feed, such as whole <b>or</b> <b>broken</b> <b>grains</b> of maize, wheat, sorghum, etc, to their birds. The proportion of the nutrient intake that is able to be utilised by the bird will be determined by a number of factors, of which, for the scavenging bird, the extent of endoparasite colonisation in the digestive tract is important. Often it is not recognised that endoparasites are a problem but some work has shown that most scavenging birds have a heavy parasitic load. While conventional intensive production systems favour the use of synthetic anthelmintics this may not be feasible, primarily because of cost, in village production systems. It has been demonstrated that some plants and their constituent phytochemicals have some anti-parasitic properties for animals. Plant materials that are available locally may, because of the type and level of phytochemicals present, act as natural anthelmintics. These could be fed to village poultry without incurring a significant cost in either time or money. Breeding desi birds, obtained locally in Namakkal in the Tamil Nadu state of India, were allowed to scavenge in a replicated system at Tamil Nadu University o...|$|R

40|$|Excessive solids {{buildup in}} {{livestock}} manure lagoons is generally due to manure or non-manure materials which cannot be degraded <b>or</b> <b>broken</b> {{down by the}} bacteria in the lagoon.

If manure entering the lagoon has a small particle size, and is relatively highly degradable by bacteria, then the solids accumulation is usually not excessive. Manure from confinement swine operations has these characteristics. So, the solids buildup in properly sized hog lagoons is not usually excessive.

40|$|Integrating the {{technological}} aspect for assessment of rice quality {{is very much}} needed for the Asian markets where rice {{is one of the}} major exports. Methods based on image analysis has been proposed for automated quality assessment by taking into account some of the textural features. These features are good at classifying when rice grains are scanned in controlled environment but it is not suitable for practical implementation. Rice grains are placed randomly on the scanner which neither maintains the uniformity in intensity regions nor the placement strategy is kept ideal thus resulting in false classification of grains. The aim of this research is to propose a method for extracting set of features which can overcome the said issues.

Analysis of water content made with grain moisture tester. Analysis of water uptake is done by soaking the samples then were weighed to determine the amount of water absorbed.
