5|$|A protein as a {{stand-alone}} infectious agent stands {{in contrast to}} all other known infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, all of which contain nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both). For this reason, a minority of researchers still consider the prion/TSE hypothesis <b>unproven.</b>|$|E

Some known results are also rediscovered in a more direct and elegant manner. A previously <b>unproved</b> degree~ 4 ternary formula is also proved. Finally, a couple of ternary zero relations are established, which prove two known but hitherto <b>unproved</b> formulas...|$|R
5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa.

5|$|A large tumulus of {{uncertain}} {{origin and}} purpose stands approximately {{in the middle}} of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city. Various theories have been advanced to explain it, such as that it was a burial site, a religious structure of some kind, a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory. However, these remain <b>unproven</b> hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|According {{to several}} journalists {{who have worked}} {{independently}} on Opus Dei, such as John Allen, Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett, Maggy Whitehouse, Noam Friedlander many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and <b>unproven</b> tales. Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say {{that most of these}} myths were created by its opponents, with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practise what they preach.|$|E

5|$|Surgical {{excision}} of aphthous ulcers has been described, {{but it is}} an ineffective and inappropriate treatment. Silver nitrate has also been used as a chemical cauterant. Apart from the mainstream approaches detailed above, there are numerous treatments of <b>unproven</b> effectiveness, ranging from herbal remedies to otherwise alternative treatments, including aloe vera, myrtus communis, Rosa damascena, potassium alum, zinc sulfate, nicotine, polio virus vaccine and prostaglandin E2.|$|E
5|$|The three {{infantry}} classes {{may have}} retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, {{but at least}} officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, <b>unproven</b> men would serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.|$|E
5|$|The use of Agent Orange {{has been}} {{controversial}} in New Zealand, {{because of the}} exposure of New Zealand troops in Vietnam {{and because of the}} production of Agent Orange for Vietnam and other users at an Ivon Watkins-Dow chemical plant in Paritutu, New Plymouth. There have been continuing claims, as yet <b>unproven,</b> that the suburb of Paritutu has also been polluted; see New Zealand in the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|As Leeds manager he was criticised for the {{physical}} and often negative approach of his teams, though the period was noted for its highly physical football across the country. His resignation as England manager fuelled criticism of him as money-obsessed, and <b>unproven</b> allegations of bribery and financial misconduct also tarnished his reputation. He retired in 1984, but was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in May 1987, which led to his death two years later. He remains a highly popular figure in Leeds, and has a stand named after him at Elland Road {{as well as a}} statue outside the ground.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia, who {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were {{probably}} nothing more than <b>unproven</b> slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, <b>unproven,</b> and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there were}} so many {{uncritical}} and <b>unproven</b> speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E
5|$|Harding's biographers, writing while Britton's {{allegations}} remained uncertain, differed {{on their}} truth; Russell believed them unquestioningly while Dean, having reviewed Britton's papers at UCLA, regarded them as <b>unproven.</b> In 2015, DNA comparisons {{between members of}} the Harding and Blaesing families conducted by ancestry.com indicated that Harding was Elizabeth's father. Sinclair wondered why Harding's infidelity was held so much against him, given that Grover Cleveland was elected president in 1884 although it was known he had a mistress and may have fathered a son out of wedlock.|$|E
5|$|In natural diamonds, several hydrogen-related IR {{absorption}} peaks {{are commonly}} observed; the strongest ones are located at 1405, 3107 and 3237cm−1 (see IR absorption figure above). The microscopic {{structure of the}} corresponding defects is yet unknown {{and it is not}} even certain whether or not those defects originate in diamond or in foreign inclusions. Gray color in some diamonds from the Argyle mine in Australia is often associated with those hydrogen defects, but again, this assignment is yet <b>unproven.</b>|$|E

5|$|New York won the {{following}} week against Minnesota before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding a significant advantage in time of possession, they lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound New York's problems, Phil Simms went down with an injury that would sideline him {{for the rest of}} the year. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, was an <b>unproven</b> career backup, who had thrown a mere 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E
5|$|On release, Contact Harvest {{reached a}} top spot of #3 on the New York Times bestseller list, where it {{remained}} for four weeks. The novel also {{appeared on the}} USA Today bestsellers list at the same time. Reviewers noted that despite being an <b>unproven</b> writer, Staten had succeeded in crafting an excellent novel. The novel's success {{was considered to be}} evidence that games were breaking into the mainstream, and that the genre was becoming increasingly about the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the G-spot has not been proven, nor has the source of female ejaculation. Although the G-spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. A 2009 British study concluded that its existence is <b>unproven</b> and subjective, based on questionnaires and personal experience. Other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse. It is also hypothesized that the G-spot {{is an extension of}} the clitoris and that this is the cause of orgasms experienced vaginally.|$|E
