25|$|OFCOM have {{released}} their consultation {{of the future}} of the 600MHz and 700MHz UHF bands beyond 2018 on 16 November 2012. This document recommends that the 600MHz <b>UHF</b> <b>band</b> is allocated to DVB-T2 MPEG-4 Freeview HD services and Whitespace services, allowing a future migration of the existing 700MHz Freeview allocation to 700MHz mobile data services (synchronising the bandwidth usage with many other markets in Europe and globally).|$|E

25|$|WSVN ended {{programming}} on its analog signal, on VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, {{the official}} date in which full-power television {{stations in the}} United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 8 to channel 7.

25|$|In North America, UHF {{can be used}} {{unlicensed}} for 902–928MHz (±13MHz {{from the}} 915MHz center frequency), but restrictions exist for transmission power. In Europe, RFID and other low-power radio applications are regulated by ETSI recommendations EN 300 220 and EN 302 208, and ERO recommendation 70 03, allowing RFID operation with somewhat complex band restrictions from 865–868MHz. Readers are required to monitor a channel before transmitting ("Listen Before Talk"); this requirement has led to some restrictions on performance, the resolution {{of which is a}} subject of current research. The North American UHF standard is not accepted in France as it interferes with its military bands. On July 25, 2012, Japan changed its <b>UHF</b> <b>band</b> to 920MHz, more closely matching the United States’ 915MHz band.|$|E
25|$|By 1954, all U.S. {{networks}} had regained {{control of}} their programming, with higher advertising revenues: ABC's revenue increased by 67% (earning $26 million), NBC's went up by 30% ($100 million) and CBS's rose by 44% ($117 million). However that year, ABC had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC. Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable <b>UHF</b> <b>band.</b> Until the All-Channel Receiver Act (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter {{to be able to}} watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.|$|E
25|$|Like Gaylord's other {{independent}} stations, KTVT's programming {{was mainly}} aimed at rural and suburban {{residents in the}} Metroplex's outer portions. Channel 11 was further aided in its status {{as it was a}} VHF station, whereas its future competitors would transmit on the <b>UHF</b> <b>band.</b> KTVT gained its first major competitor in February 1968, when Doubleday Broadcasting signed on KMEC (channel 39), which featured a broad mix of general entertainment and sports programs. The Christian Broadcasting Network entered into the mix in January 1973, when it launched KXTX-TV (channel 33; allocation now occupied by CW affiliate KDAF), with a schedule that featured a mix of family-oriented secular programs and religious programs. However, the former of the two would struggle, leading Doubleday to donate the UHF channel 39 license (by then, assigned the KDTV call letters) to CBN in exchange for acquiring KXTX's license for UHF channel 33; while KXTX continued to grow after the call sign and intellectual unit were transferred to Channel 39 (now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station) in November 1973, KDTV could not compete with either KXTX nor KTVT and shut down nine weeks later.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{using the}} Rec.

From the derived formulation of the receiver field strength, some computation results are presented and {{discussed in terms of}} the equivalent level of service caused by analogue to digital TV conversion. The suggested method is also applicable to the analysis of frequency coordination or compatibility from unwanted signal in VHF and <b>UHF</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R

25|$|After {{losing a}} bid to {{purchase}} then-CBS affiliate WTVJ (then on channel 4) from then-owner Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., CBS made a half-hearted offer to buy WCIX from Taft in January 1987. Taft declined, but a month later opted to sell all of its independent stations and Fox affiliates, including WCIX, to the TVX Broadcast Group. However, TVX became mired in debt {{as a result of}} the purchase, and began to sell off many of its medium- and small-market stations. Although TVX originally planned to keep WCIX, the company eventually decided that the station would have to be divested. One of the primary factors in the decision to sell was that WCIX was TVX's only VHF station, whereas its sister stations were all broadcasting on the <b>UHF</b> <b>band.</b> KKR sold WTVJ to NBC in September 1987. However, CBS' affiliation contract with WTVJ did not expire until December 31, 1988, as did NBC's contract with WSVN (channel 7), which had served as its Miami affiliate since that station signed on in July 1956. WSVN's owner, Sunbeam Television, was not willing to end channel 7's affiliation with NBC one year early. NBC was thus forced to run WTVJ as a CBS affiliate for over a year—a situation that did not sit well with either NBC or CBS.|$|E

BBC1 and ITV later joined BBC2 on 625-line <b>UHF</b> <b>band,</b> but continued to simulcast on 405-line VHF until 1985.

2500|$|Radar maps of {{the surface}} of the planet were made using the Arecibo radiotelescope. The survey was {{conducted}} with 420kW <b>UHF</b> <b>band</b> (2.4GHz) radio waves which allowed for a 15km resolution.

It has been postulated that surface ice may be responsible for these [...] high luminosity levels, as the silicate rocks that compose most of the surface of Mercury have exactly the opposite effect on luminosity.|$|E

2500|$|Non-broadcast {{signals are}} also affected. [...] Mobile phone signals {{are in the}} <b>UHF</b> <b>band,</b> ranging from 700 to over 2600 Megahertz, a range which makes them even more prone to weather-induced {{propagation}} changes. [...] In urban (and to some extent suburban) areas with a high population density, this is partly offset {{by the use of}} smaller cells, which use lower effective radiated power and beam tilt to reduce interference, and therefore increase frequency reuse and user capacity. [...] However, since this would not be very cost-effective in more rural areas, these cells are larger and so more likely to cause interference over longer distances when propagation conditions allow.|$|E
2500|$|After the FCC's Sixth Report and Order {{ended the}} license freeze {{and opened the}} <b>UHF</b> <b>band</b> in 1952, it devised a plan for allocating VHF licenses.

Other areas would be designated as [...] "UHF islands" [...] since they were too close to larger cities for VHF service.

2500|$|The radar {{operates}} in the <b>UHF</b> <b>band</b> between 420 - 450MHz, {{just below the}} UHF television broadcast band, that is a wavelength of 71–67cm, with circular polarization.

[...] It {{operates in}} a repeating 54millisecond cycle in which it transmits a series of pulses, then listens for echoes. [...] Its duty cycle (fraction of time spent transmitting) is never greater than 25% (so the average power of the beam never exceeds 25% of 540kW, or 145kW) and is usually around 18%.
