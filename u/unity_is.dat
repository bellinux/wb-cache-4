5|$|To combine glyphs, rongorongo employs {{consistent}} rules. First, the ‘defining feature’ of a glyph is identified, and {{the rest}} is discarded. Then, this ‘defining feature’ is grafted onto a ‘main body’ glyph which retains most of its original shape (except for the addition of the ‘defining feature’). This is done {{in such a way that}} aesthetic <b>unity</b> <b>is</b> maintained. Typically, either one or two ‘defining features’ may be grafted onto a single ‘main body’.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{uses the}} {{combined}} image {{of fire and}} Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation. According to the poet, humanity's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare, but this can be overcome by recognising {{the lessons of the}} past. Within the poem, the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures. Little Gidding focuses on the unity of past, present, and future, and claims that understanding this <b>unity</b> <b>is</b> necessary for salvation.|$|E
5|$|<b>UNITY</b> <b>is</b> {{a secret}} {{international}} organization headquartered somewhere in England that protects humanity from outsiders {{that want to}} take over the world. In 1960, over half of the UNITY's elite agents are murdered by an unknown assassin within a week, leaving UNITY with a critical manpower shortage. They are forced to send UNITY agent Cate Archer and her mentor, Bruno Lawrie, on a series of high-profile missions. Cate is an ex-, and is UNITY's first female spy operative. UNITY's leaders, Jones and Smith, are skeptical of Cate working as a field agent, and have previously relegated her to more mundane assignments. Intelligence reveals that a Russian assassin named Dmitrij Volkov and a new terrorist organization named H.A.R.M. are responsible for the murders of UNITY's former agents. Cate and Bruno embark on a dangerous assignment in Morocco, which later turns out to be an ambush set up by Volkov and his men. Cate manages to escape Morocco whilst Bruno is shot by Volkov. In the UNITY headquarters, Jones and Smith reveal that Volkov killed Bruno simply because he was the traitor, to which Cate reacts with disbelief.|$|E

25|$|A lot {{of modern}} {{criticism}} {{tries to find}} hidden structure or some unifying principle within the odes. 19th century criticism favoured 'gnomic unity' i.e. that each ode is bound together {{by the kind of}} moralizing or philosophic vision typical of archaic Gnomic poetry. Later critics sought unity in the way certain words or images are repeated and developed within a particular ode. For others, the odes are just celebrations of men and their communities, in which the elements such as myths, piety, and ethics are stock themes that the poet introduces without much real thought. Some conclude that the requirement for <b>unity</b> <b>is</b> too modern to have informed Pindar's ancient approach to a traditional craft.|$|E
