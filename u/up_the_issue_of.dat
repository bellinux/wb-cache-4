5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized {{a referendum on}} whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) had {{repeatedly}} taken <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> aboriginal {{title in the}} United States. However, {{with the exception of}} Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), which was dismissed for lack of original jurisdiction, all the disputes had been between non-Indianstypically between those who derived their title from the government and those who derived their title from private purchases from Indians. The uniform rule of these cases, enunciated most clearly in Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823), was that non-Indians could not acquire valid land title from such private purchases. However, the purchase at issue in Fellows, the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838), had been ratified by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1350 or 1351, Ivan Shishman was {{the eldest}} son of emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371) and his second wife Sarah–Theodora, a Jew {{converted}} to the Eastern Orthodox Church. His birth brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the succession to the Bulgarian throne. Ivan Shishman had two elder brothers by the Ivan Alexander's first wife, Theodora of Wallachia. The eldest one, Michael Asen, was proclaimed successor to the throne and co-emperor shortly after Ivan Alexander's accession to the throne. However, Michael Asen's early death in battle against the Ottomans in 1355 put forward the question of succession once more. It is likely that Sarah–Theodora pressured Ivan Alexander to select her own son as his successor, although Ivan Sratsimir would have come next under the majorat system. The issue was decided in Ivan Shishman's favour because the latter {{was born in the}} purple (after his father was crowned), thus making him eligible as successor. By the end of 1355, Ivan Shishman had been proclaimed heir to the throne and co-emperor.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{maintained}} {{peace with}} Scotland during his reign, {{where he was}} the feudal lord of Alexander II. Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or the resources to do much more. Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat. Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier. Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship. Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from Edinburgh Castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{also took}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> white {{settlement}} in Indian Territory. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the Unassigned Lands {{in what is}} now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did the Cherokee Nation, which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land to be open to white settlement.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} conference, the African National Congress President General Alfred Bitini Xuma along with delegates of the South African Indian Congress brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the {{brutality}} of Smuts' police regime against the African Mine Workers' Strike earlier that year {{as well as the}} wider struggle for equality in South Africa.|$|E

Early in 1939 he protested against criticism of the police voiced in Parliament by Communist Party of Great Britain MP Willie Gallacher.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{worked closely}} with Southern Democrats. In Wilson's first month in office, Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> racially segregating {{workplaces}} in a cabinet meeting and urged the president to establish this policy across the government, in restrooms, cafeterias and work spaces. Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo also permitted lower-level officials to racially segregate employees in the workplaces of those departments. By the end of 1913 many departments, including the Navy, had workspaces segregated by screens. Restrooms and cafeterias were also segregated, although no executive order had been issued. Segregation was urged by conservative groups, such as the Fair Play Association.|$|E
25|$|After a close race, with polls {{showing the}} two {{candidates}} neck-and-neck, Granholm defeated Smietanka by 1,557,310 votes (52.09%) to 1,432,604 (47.91%). After Granholm was elected Governor in 2002, arguments broke about between Smietanka and then-Republican Governor John Engler about who was most responsible for Granholm's meteoric rise in Michigan politics. Smietanka blamed Engler for trying to force {{him out of the}} 1998 race in favour of G. Scott Romney, for dredging <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> his missed child support payments and for not supporting him more fully after he defeated Romney at the Republican convention. Engler contested that Smietanka was a weak candidate who should have stepped aside for Romney, who would have beaten the inexperienced Granholm; she would then not have had a launch pad for her gubernatorial campaign in 2002.|$|E

25|$|After the Compromise of 1850 allowed California {{into the}} Union {{as a free}} state while {{permitting}} Utah and New Mexico territories the option of deciding the issue by popular sovereignty, the Utah Territorial Legislature took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> legalizing slavery. At that time, Brigham Young was governor, and the Utah Territorial Legislature was dominated by church leaders. In 1852, Brigham Young addressed the joint session of the legislature advocating slavery. He made the matter religious by declaring that if {{members of the church}} believe in the Bible and the priesthood then they should also believe in slavery. Following the speech, the Utah Legislature passed an Act in Relation to Service, which officially sanctioned slavery in Utah Territory. The Utah slavery law stipulated that slaves would be freed if their masters had sexual relations with them; attempted to take them from the territory against their will; or neglected to feed, clothe, or provide shelter to them. In addition, the law stipulated that slaves must receive schooling.|$|E
25|$|At the post-season conference {{meeting in}} December, {{allegedly}} {{at the behest}} of MU's Don Faurot, but in accordance with the conference's response to KU's inquiry in November, the Big 8 faculty committee took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Bert Coan. Based upon the NCAA's ruling that a representative of KU's athletic interests, Bud Adams, had transported Coan from his home in Texas to Chicago to view a football all-star game, the conference's ruling committee ruled, by a vote of 5–3, that KU had violated a conference ban on off-campus recruiting. By conference rule, any student-athlete that was recruited in violation of this ban was automatically ineligible. The committee accordingly took up the matter of the period in which Coan would be ineligible. The committee initially defeated two separate motions to declare Coan ineligible for the entire 1961 season, before finally declaring him ineligible for a period of one year starting from the date of the NCAA finding by a vote of 6–2. The Big 8 then ordered KU to forfeit the two games in which Coan had played following the NCAA finding (versus Colorado and Missouri). By virtue of the forfeits, the conference championship was awarded to Missouri.|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} then launched Operation Lalang (Weeding Operation), detaining 55 {{people under}} the ISA. More were arrested {{over the next few}} months. Although most were opposition politicians — including Parliamentary Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang — a few from BN were included. All BN politicians were released from detention after two months, while those from the opposition remained in custody for much longer. The government later justified these detentions on grounds of security, stating that the detainees had played <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Chinese education to incite racial sentiment. Some of Mahathir's supporters saw this as a vindication of his rejection of the Tunku's [...] "compromise" [...] with the non-Malays, teaching the non-Malays not to criticise the government and its pro-Malay policies.|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} over the length of the course, The New York Times brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the cloistered and undemocratic nature of student life at West Point. Also, {{starting}} with Harvard University in 1869, civilian universities had begun grading students on academic performance alone, but West Point had retained the old [...] "whole man" [...] concept of education. MacArthur sought to modernize the system, expanding the concept of military character to include bearing, leadership, efficiency and athletic performance. He formalized the hitherto unwritten Cadet Honor Code in 1922 when he formed the Cadet Honor Committee to review alleged code violations. Elected by the cadets themselves, it had no authority to punish, but acted as a kind of grand jury, reporting offenses to the commandant. MacArthur attempted to end hazing by using officers rather than upperclassmen to train the plebes.|$|E

500|$|Boniface {{seems to}} have been unable to correct his {{misunderstanding}} of the meaning of the Libellus on this point. But this was perhaps due as much to the fact that seventh- and eighth-century canonical authorities (especially popes) so frequently conflicted on this subject, as to Boniface's own interpretative error. In a long series of letters written to subsequent bishops of Rome — Pope Gregory II, Pope Gregory III, Pope Zachary — Boniface periodically brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> consanguinity and marriage, and each time he received a slightly different answer as to what was permitted and what was prohibited. Suspicion about the authenticity of the Libellus {{seems to have}} ended with Boniface's death in 754, though misinterpretation of its chapter on consanguinity continued for long after that. Nevertheless, no medieval authority except Boniface is on record as ever having questioned the authenticity of the Libellus and its marriage chapter. In fact, there arose a vigorous tradition of forged documents that defended the authenticity of the Libellus and attempted to explain why it permitted, or (to those who followed the [...] "Roman" [...] system) seemed to permit, nieces to marry their uncles, or even first cousins to marry.|$|E
500|$|The series two premiere (2008) {{establishes}} that Rhys became {{engaged to}} Gwen {{between the first}} and second series. After Rhys becomes suspicious of her behaviour and her friendship with her boss Captain Jack (John Barrowman) in [...] "Meat", Gwen reveals to him the truth about her responsibilities with Torchwood. Rhys then becomes involved in a mission to uncover and destroy an alien meat-trading racket, and ends up taking a bullet to protect Gwen's life. Because she enjoys finally being able to be honest with Rhys, Gwen cannot bring herself to drug him for a second time, and so demands that Jack allow Rhys keep his memories of Torchwood. Rhys and Gwen marry in the episode [...] "Something Borrowed". Following the wedding, in the episode [...] "Adrift", Rhys brings <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> starting a family with Gwen, though she dismisses the idea, arguing that it would be impossible to have children with her job.

On 27 February Coke, an enthusiastic hunter, suggested in Parliament that these laws be relaxed; [...] "Combinations had been formed in the Country against the execution of these laws and some lives had been lost". Before any motion could be brought (it was not until 1827 that the laws were revised), the situation in America came up again. On 22 February, Henry Seymour Conway brought a motion asking the King to [...] "listen to the humble prayer and advice of his faithful Commons, {{that the war on}} the continent of North America may no longer be pursued for the impractical purpose of reducing the inhabitants of that country to obedience by force". While the motion failed, it was again brought on 27 February, and passed. With this, Conway moved that [...] "An humble address be presented to His Majesty"; George III replied that he would see them on 3 March at St James's Palace. It was then that [...] "the most important and symbolic act of Coke's political career" [...] occurred. As a Knight of the Shire, Coke had the right to appear in court dressed [...] "in his boots" [...] as opposed to in formal court dress; this he did, appearing in front of George III dressed in leather breeches, boots and spurs.|$|E
