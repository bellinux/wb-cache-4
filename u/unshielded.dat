5|$|NASA has speculated on the {{feasibility}} of mining the atmospheres of the outer planets, particularly for helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on Earth and could {{have a very high}} value per unit mass as thermonuclear fuel. Factories stationed in orbit could mine the gas and deliver it to visiting craft. However, the Jovian system in general poses particular disadvantages for colonization because of the severe radiation conditions prevailing in Jupiter's magnetosphere and the planet's particularly deep gravitational well. Jupiter would deliver about 36Sv (3600rem) per day to <b>unshielded</b> colonists at Io and about 5.4Sv (540rems) per day to <b>unshielded</b> colonists at Europa, which is a decisive aspect {{due to the fact that}} already an exposure to about 0.75Sv over a period of a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning, and about 5Sv over a few days is fatal.|$|E

In 1972 U.S. dollars the ADSID cost $619.00, the ACOUSID $1,452.00, and the engine detector $2,997.00. During the life of the operation approximately 20,000 sensors were deployed in Laos.|$|E
40|$|A nonmodal {{approach}} {{based on}} the potential vorticity (PV) perspective is used to compute the singular vector (SV) that optimizes the growth of kinetic energy at the surface for the β-plane Eady model without an upper rigid lid. The basic-state buoyancy frequency and zonal wind profile are chosen such that the basic-state PV gradient is zero. If the f-plane approximation is made, the SV growth at the surface is dominated by resonance, resulting from the advection of basic-state potential temperature (PT) by the interior PV anomalies. This resonance generates a PT anomaly at the surface. The PV <b>unshielding</b> and PV-PT <b>unshielding</b> contribute less to the final kinetic energy at the surface. The general conclusion of the present paper is that surface cyclogenesis (of the 48 -h SV) is stronger if p is included. Three cases have been considered. In the first case, the vertical shear of the basic state is modified in order to retain the zero basic-state PV gradient. The increased shear enhances SV growth significantly first because of a lowering of the resonant level (enhanced resonance), and second because of a more rapid PV <b>unshielding</b> process. Resonance {{is the most important}} contribution at optimization time. In the second case, the buoyancy frequency of the basic state is modified. The surface cyclogenesis is stronger than in the absence of β but less strong than if the shear is modified. It is shown that the effect of the modified buoyancy frequency profile is that PV <b>unshielding</b> occurs more efficiently. The contribution from resonance to the SV growth remains almost the same. Finally, the SV is calculated for a more realistic buoyancy frequency profile based on observations. In this experiment the increased value of the surface buoyancy frequency reduces the SV growth significantly as compared to the case in which the surface buoyancy frequency takes a standard value. All growth mechanisms are affected by this change in the surface buoyancy frequency...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation has}} been performed {{of the role}} of the different growth mechanisms (resonance, potential vorticity <b>unshielding,</b> and normal-mode baroclinic instability) in the evolution of optimal perturbations constructed for a two-layer Eady model and a kinetic energy norm. The two-layer Eady model is obtained by replacing the conventional upper rigid lid by a simple but realistic stratosphere. To make an unambiguous discussion possible, generally applicable techniques have been developed. At the heart of these techniques lies a description of the linear dynamics in terms of a variable number of potential vorticity building blocks (PVBs), which are zonally wavelike, vertically localized sheets of potential vorticity. If the optimal perturbation is composed of only one PVB, the rapid surface cyclogenesis can be attributed to the growth of the surface PVB (the edge wave), which is excited by the tropospheric PVB via a linear resonance effect. If the optimal perturbation is constructed using multiple PVBs, this simple picture is modified only in the sense that PV <b>unshielding</b> dominates the surface amplification for a short time after initialization. The <b>unshielding</b> mechanism rapidly creates large streamfunction values at the surface, as a result of which the resonance effect is much stronger. A similar resonance effect between the tropospheric PVBs and the tropopause PVB acts negatively on the surface streamfunction amplification. The influence of the stratosphere to the surface development is negligible. In all cases reported here, the growth due to traditional normal-mode baroclinic instability contributes either negative or only little to the surface development up to the optimization time of two days. It takes at least four days for the flow to become fully dominated by normal-mode growth, thereby confirming that finite-time optimal perturbation growth differs in many aspects fundamentally from asymptotic normalmode baroclinic instability...|$|R

5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors <b>unshielded</b> legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E

40|$|Use of Env in HIV vaccine {{development}} has been disappointing. Here we show that, {{in the presence of}} a biologically active Tat subunit vaccine, a trimeric Env protein prevents in monkeys virus spread from the portal of entry to regional lymph nodes. This appears to be due to specific interactions between Tat and Env spikes that form a novel virus entry complex favoring R 5 or X 4 virus entry and productive infection of dendritic cells (DCs) via an integrin-mediated pathway. These Tat effects do not require Tat-transactivation activity and are blocked by anti-integrin antibodies (Abs). Productive DC infection promoted by Tat is associated with a highly efficient virus transmission to T cells. In the Tat/Env complex the cysteine-rich region of Tat engages the Env V 3 loop, whereas the Tat RGD sequence remains free and directs the virus to integrins present on DCs.
