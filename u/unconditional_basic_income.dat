First, I examine a number of stability-generating features of conceptions of justice that pertain to their scope and content.

Although the unconditional scheme may emerge as the winner, all things considered, introducing the factor of stability or sustainability nevertheless deepens {{our understanding of the}} nature and justifiability of the <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> proposal. ...|$|R

40|$|This article uses Peter Drucker’s work vector-like, {{to carry}} the thesis of {{cognitive}} capitalism into the management field. Drucker’s prophetic insights into the knowledge society are juxtaposed with recent, Italian autonomist Marxistinspired analyses of capitalism’s cognitive phase. If the capacity to create knowledge – or what autonomists call the ‘general intellect’ – is becoming the key productive force, arguably {{there is a need}} for a full-blown social form of knowledge management. Our reading of Drucker thus retrieves the one worthwhile thing from the rubble of normative knowledge management. It is the idea of society-level knowledge management premised on a universal and <b>unconditional</b> guaranteed <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> (GBI; or social wage). <b>Basic</b> <b>income</b> represents not just a social investment in knowledge, which Drucker himself called for, but also compensation for biolabour’s augmented social productivity. With Drucker as the steppingstone, we conclude, the autonomist tradition merits greater attention from critical management and organisational scholars interested in factoring class and gender back into the knowledge management equation...|$|R
40|$|By {{treating}} labor {{like any}} other tradable good, orthodox economic models ignore various features that define the specificity {{of the labor market}} (disponibility, solvability, alienation). Taking into account such features, as the new situation generated by the emergence of cognitive capitalism forces us to do, requires a major change in paradigm. In the new “bio-economic” paradigm, classical distinctions between production and reproduction, consumption and production, leisure and work tend to vanish, while labor increasingly appears as a common good. The most important input being life itself, a just retribution of productive forces must now include a retribution for living, i. e., a universal, <b>unconditional</b> and guaranteed <b>basic</b> <b>income.</b> ...|$|R
