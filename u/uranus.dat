5|$|Ariel is the fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of <b>Uranus.</b> Ariel orbits and rotates in the {{equatorial}} plane of <b>Uranus,</b> {{which is almost}} perpendicular to the orbit of <b>Uranus</b> and so has an extreme seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{the ring}} system of <b>Uranus</b> is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of <b>Uranus</b> are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of <b>Uranus.</b> In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of <b>Uranus</b> may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of <b>Uranus,</b> although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E
5|$|Neptune {{differs from}} <b>Uranus</b> in its typical level of {{meteorological}} activity. Voyager 2 observed weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby, but no comparable phenomena on <b>Uranus</b> during its 1986 fly-by.|$|E
50|$|The mermaid, Umbriel, {{is named}} after one of <b>Uranus's</b> moons. The {{reasoning}} was because the Disney mermaid, Ariel, is also named after one of <b>Uranus's</b> moons.|$|R
25|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-defined}} solid surface within <b>Uranus's</b> interior, the outermost part of <b>Uranus's</b> gaseous envelope (the region accessible to remote sensing) is called its atmosphere. Remote sensing capability extends down to roughly 300km below the 1 bar level, with a corresponding pressure around 100bar and temperature of 320K.|$|R
50|$|Titania, one of <b>Uranus's</b> moons, {{was also}} named after her.|$|R
5|$|No other {{spacecraft}} {{has ever}} visited the Uranian system or Titania, and no mission is currently planned. One possibility, now discarded, was to send Cassini on from Saturn to <b>Uranus</b> in an extended mission. Another mission concept proposed was the <b>Uranus</b> orbiter and probe concept, evaluated around 2010. <b>Uranus</b> was also examined {{as part of}} one trajectory for a precursor interstellar probe concept, Innovative Interstellar Explorer.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} <b>Uranus,</b> {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, like those of <b>Uranus,</b> Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of <b>Uranus.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Uranus</b> {{has five}} major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. They range in {{diameter}} from 472km for Miranda to 1578km for Titania. All these moons are relatively dark objects: their geometrical albedo varies between 30 and 50%, whereas their Bond albedo is between 10 and 23%. Umbriel is the darkest moon and Ariel the brightest. The {{masses of the}} moons range from 6.7kg (Miranda) to 3.5kg (Titania). For comparison, the Moon has a mass of 7.5kg. The major moons of <b>Uranus</b> {{are thought to have}} formed in the accretion disc, which existed around <b>Uranus</b> for some time after its formation or resulted from a large impact suffered by <b>Uranus</b> early in its history.|$|E

5|$|As of 2005 <b>Uranus</b> {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the irregular moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by <b>Uranus</b> soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
5|$|At 162km, Puck is {{the largest}} of the inner moons of <b>Uranus</b> and the only one imaged by Voyager 2 in any detail. Puck and Mab are the two {{outermost}} inner satellites of <b>Uranus.</b> All inner moons are dark objects; their geometrical albedo is less than 10%. They are composed of water ice contaminated with a dark material—probably radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur {{astronomer}} the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of <b>Uranus</b> might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of <b>Uranus,</b> and postulated that two planets lay beyond <b>Uranus.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated {{at the start of the}} 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for PlanetX. Lowell proposed the PlanetX hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly <b>Uranus</b> and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed <b>Uranus</b> enough to account for the irregularities.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 e, {{discovered}} in 2010, has a mass {{similar to that}} of the planet <b>Uranus</b> and its orbit takes 124 days to complete.|$|E
50|$|Despite its curious alignment, {{in other}} respects the Uranian {{magnetosphere}} is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts. Overall, the structure of <b>Uranus's</b> magnetosphere is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's. <b>Uranus's</b> magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to Earth-based observations, diapirism {{is thought to}} occur on Neptune's moon Triton, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and <b>Uranus's</b> moon Miranda.|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} <b>Uranus's</b> rings {{proposed}} by Van Flandern (1979) is discussed. According {{to the proposed}} model, <b>Uranus's</b> rings are the gaseous tails of unobserved small satellites. The hypothesis raises a number of objections, e. g., a gaseous torus must have a minor diameter of thousands, not tens, of kilometers; very large densities are required to produce the postulated angles of refraction; and making up the mass losses, even with a generous lifetime, would use up quite a large body in a few million years...|$|R
5|$|High-altitude clouds on Neptune {{have been}} {{observed}} casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150km and lie about 50–110km above the cloud deck. These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. Unlike <b>Uranus,</b> Neptune's composition has a higher volume of ocean, whereas <b>Uranus</b> has a smaller mantle.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{classical}} planets, <b>Uranus</b> is {{visible to the}} naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit. Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on 13 March 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System {{for the first time in}} history and making <b>Uranus</b> the first planet discovered with a telescope.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} model of <b>Uranus's</b> structure {{is that it}} consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron-nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle {{in the middle and}} an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope. The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55 Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus's; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4 Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5 Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of <b>Uranus's</b> radius. <b>Uranus's</b> core density is around 9 g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8 million bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000 K. The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water-ammonia ocean.|$|R
5|$|On 26 July 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope {{captured}} a rare transit made by Ariel on <b>Uranus,</b> which {{cast a shadow}} {{that could be seen}} on the Uranian cloud tops. Such events are rare and only occur around equinoxes, as the moon's orbital plane about <b>Uranus</b> is tilted 98° to Uranus's orbital plane about the Sun. Another transit, in 2008, was recorded by the European Southern Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of <b>Uranus,</b> which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (the smallest of the five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of <b>Uranus</b> and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and geometric albedo in visible light of approximately 0.11.|$|E
5|$|So far {{the only}} {{close-up}} images of Umbriel {{have been from}} the Voyager 2 probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of <b>Uranus</b> in January 1986. Since the closest distance between Voyager 2 and Umbriel was , the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 5.2km. The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 20% was photographed with the quality required for geological mapping. At {{the time of the}} flyby the southern hemisphere of Umbriel (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied. No other spacecraft has ever visited <b>Uranus</b> (and Umbriel), and no mission to <b>Uranus</b> and its moons are planned.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{short period}} from March to May 2004, large clouds {{appeared}} in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance. Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 229 m/s and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as [...] "Fourth of July fireworks". On August 23, 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on <b>Uranus's</b> surface, giving scientists more insight into <b>Uranus's</b> atmospheric activity. Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, {{but it appears that}} <b>Uranus's</b> extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather. Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on <b>Uranus's</b> atmosphere have existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes. A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s. Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice. The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry.|$|R
