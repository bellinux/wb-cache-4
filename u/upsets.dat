40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the {{presented}} in this work research was determining the limiting conditions of <b>upsetting</b> in three-slide forging press (TSFP). The free <b>upsetting</b> process and <b>upsetting</b> process in cylindrical impression were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: The assumed purpose was confirmed in experimental research. For the case of <b>upsetting</b> in cylindrical impression, the research of limiting <b>upsetting</b> coefficients were made for different diameters and impression lengths. Findings: The obtained results showed large variety of limiting <b>upsetting</b> ratio depending on the analyzed impression geometrical parameters. It was stated, that there are 3 phenomena limiting the <b>upsetting</b> process in the die. The main phenomenon is the bar <b>upsetting</b> outside the impression. The <b>upsetting</b> processes in the impression are limited also by bar buckling outside the impression and overlapping inside the impressionResearch limitations/implications: The results of research allowed for stating that, besides the process geometrical parameters, friction conditions and type of the formed material influenced the limiting <b>upsetting</b> coefficients in the cylindrical impression. It is purposeful to make the further research determining quantitative and qualitative dependencies between these factors. Practical implications: The obtained results are the basis for designing of forming processes in TSFP in which the <b>upsetting</b> dominates. Especially it considers the elongated forgings and elongated preforms with thickeningsOriginality/value: The influence of the impression geometrical parameters on the limiting <b>upsetting</b> coefficients for the case of <b>upsetting</b> in cylindrical impression in TSFP has been analyzed in details. The dependencies, which should be used during designing of <b>upsetting</b> processes in TSFP were determined...|$|R

40|$|The {{electric}} <b>upsetting</b> {{process is}} an excellent electrically assisted preforming technique with electrical-thermal-mechanical multi-field coupling characteristic. The secondary <b>upsetting</b> defect in electric <b>upsetting</b> with inappropriate parameters combinations could result in folds in subsequent forging process. In order to analyze the formation process of the secondary <b>upsetting</b> defect, the finite element model of electric <b>upsetting</b> was constructed based on the multi-field coupling solver platform, MSC. Marc. It is concluded through the numerical simulation with inappropriate parameters combination that the main factor causing the secondary <b>upsetting</b> defect is the large temperature decrease of the deformed portion after the formation of drum-shape in the preliminary stage of electric <b>upsetting.</b> Subsequently, the secondary <b>upsetting</b> defect has been successfully avoided via a three-stage current mode. Finally, a novel optimization method based on close-cycle control of current in numerical simulation was established by developing a current subroutine in MSC.

40|$|An {{important}} element of timber auctions is the upsetâ€”the minimum acceptable price, often called the reserve price in other auction environments. The <b>upset</b> has three main purposes: (1) to guarantee substantial revenue in auctions where competition is weak but the <b>upset</b> is met, (2) to limit the incentive forâ€”and the impact ofâ€”collusive bidding, and (3) to provide useful information to bidders. We analyze {{the determination of the}} <b>upset</b> in British Columbia timber auctions. Setting the <b>upset</b> too high results in unsold stands and produces an upward bias in price if the competitive auctions are used to determine stumpage rates for non-auctioned timber. Setting the <b>upset</b> too low will reduce auction revenue and can create downward bias when the auction prices are used to calculate timber prices for non-auctioned stands. It is therefore important to set the <b>upset</b> at or near the optimal level. We present the theory of <b>upset</b> pricing and then apply that theory to the data available from historical timber auction sales in the BC Interior from 1999 to 2000. We find that an <b>upset</b> of about 70 percent (a rollback of 30 percent) maximizes auction revenues if the Ministry values timber at about 52 to 56 percent of its appraised value. This <b>upset</b> strikes the right balance between enhanced revenues and unsold timber stands. Given its importance, this <b>upset</b> calibration should be refined as additional data becomes available to assure that the <b>upset</b> is not set too high or too low...|$|R

5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel.
