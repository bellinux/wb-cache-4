5|$|In August 2016, Microsoft {{released}} a refreshed Xbox One model, Xbox One S, {{which has a}} streamlined design, native support for 4K video playback and <b>upscaling,</b> and HDR10 high-dynamic-range color. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as {{the lack of a}} native Kinect port were noted. A high-end model, Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 2017 for release in November, which features major hardware upgrades focused on enabling games to be rendered at 4K resolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{major threat}} for crested and marbled newts is habitat loss. This {{concerns}} especially breeding sites, which are lost through the <b>upscaling</b> and intensification of agriculture, drainage, urban sprawl, and artificial flooding regimes (affecting {{in particular the}} Danube crested newt). Especially in the southern ranges, exploitation of groundwater and decreasing spring rain, possibly caused by global warming, threaten breeding ponds. Aquatic habitats are also degraded through pollution with agricultural pesticides and fertiliser. Introduction of crayfish and predatory fish threatens larval development; the Chinese sleeper {{has been a major}} concern in Eastern Europe. Exotic plants can also degrade habitats: the swamp stonecrop replaces natural vegetation and overshadows waterbodies in the United Kingdom, and its hard leaves are unsuitable for egg-laying to crested newts.|$|E

25|$|With the <b>upscaling</b> of the El Parián market, vendors {{selling to}} commoners were pushed into two other markets, El Baratillo and El Volador. The El Baratillo was {{established}} in 1793, initially {{with the name of}} Cruz del Factor. It was on the Zocalo as well, and specialized in handcrafts, secondhand items and food to the lower classes. It was also known for the sale of stolen merchandise as well. Over time, this market would draw thieves and other delinquents and have a reputation for being dangerous. This market would eventually be moved to an area now called Tepito. The first market established off the Zocalo was the El Volador {{at the end of the}} 18th century where the Supreme Court of Mexico is now. It was the first market run similarly to traditional retail markets of today, and became the main market for the city after the El Parián and El Baratillo disappeared.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{show was}} shot on high quality 35 mm film, {{but had to}} be downscaled before editing and postprocessing to standard 80s and 90s TV resolution (video quality) for broadcast. [...] The show's final visual effects (e.g. all exterior shots of the starship Enterprise, phaser fire or beaming fade-ins and -outs) were also composed only in standard resolution video. All previous home video and DVD releases used this severely downscaled version. To include such footage on Blu-ray, using only <b>upscaling,</b> {{would have resulted in}} a larger but blurred image, so CBS decided to use a more detailed approach to bring the show to high-definition.

2500|$|Development of {{the power}} cycle - Developing a large helium or {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide turbine is needed for highest efficiency. These gas cycles offer numerous potential advantages for use with molten salt-fueled or molten salt-cooled reactors. These closed gas cycles face design challenges and engineering <b>upscaling</b> work for a commercial turbine-generator set. A standard supercritical steam turbine could be used at a small penalty in efficiency (the net efficiency of the MSBR {{was designed to be}} approximately 44%, using an old 1970s steam turbine). A molten salt to steam generator would still have to be developed. Currently, molten nitrate salt steam generators are used in concentrated solar thermal power plants such as Andasol in Spain.

40|$|An <b>upscaled</b> Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for flow {{simulations}} in heterogeneous porous {{media at}} the Darcy scale is proposed in this paper. In the Darcy scale simulations, the Shan-Chen force model {{is used to}} simplify the algorithm. The proposed <b>upscaled</b> LBM uses coarser grids to represent the average effects of the fine-grid simulations. In the <b>upscaled</b> LBM, each coarse grid represents a subdomain of the fine-grid discretization and the effective permeability with the reduced-order models is proposed as we coarsen the grid. The effective permeability is computed using solutions of local problems (e. g., by performing local LBM simulations on the fine grids using the original permeability distribution) and used on the coarse grids in the <b>upscaled</b> simulations. The <b>upscaled</b> LBM that can reduce the computational cost of existing LBM and transfer the information between different scales is implemented. The results of coarse-grid, reduced-order, simulations agree very well with averaged results obtained using a fine grid...|$|R
