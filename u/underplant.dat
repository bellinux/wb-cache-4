During {{the growth}} of <b>underplant</b> and cover crop {{interactions}} occur, the patterns and mechanisms of which are not totally known, particularly within the changeability of ecological factors. Joint use of environmental resources may modify the uptake of nutrients from the bedding and their accumulation in the particular plant organs. The aim {{of the study was}} the determination of the effect of interactions between spring barley and red clover on phosphorus content in their organs against diversified water provision. In a pot experiment (three cycles), the study factors were: (1) plant sowing type (growth of each species in pure and mixed sowing), and (2) plant provision with water (dose that satisfies plant requirements and one lowered by 50 %). Mixture was composed according to the additive pattern. Phosphorus content was marked in plant material uptaken at five stages set by the developmental rhythm of barley in pure sowing in the conditions of more favourable water supply. Sowing type had no effect on phosphorus content in spring barley organs but mixed sowing resulted in the accumulation of a higher amount of phosphorus in the roots at the straw-shooting stage, and a lower amount in the shoots and spikes at the end of growth.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to promote the public interest in forests concerning with watersource conservation and land conservation, and to produce high-price trees by improving the productivity of the stand, by the selective cutting system for the broad leaved forest in Okinawa. As a guide of the selective cutting system for the actual broad leaved stand, the practically applicable methods were considered as follows; (1) a method to lead to the selective cutting after establishing the forest by the regeneration of sprout, (2) a method to lead to the selective cutting after applying salvage cutting to improve the actual stand, and (3) a method to carry out the selective cutting directly to the actual forest. In the seperate article, the case of method (1) was reported, and the outline of the established test plots and the stand composition of the plots before cutting were described in the present paper as the case of method (2).

40|$|A partial {{equilibrium}} {{framework is}} used to estimate the deadweight loss arising from government intervention in the U. S. rice market {{in order to protect}} domestic producers. The efficiency of the rice program is compared to other grain programs. Deadweight losses relative to taxpayer and consumer costs from rice programs in recent years were only slightly higher compared to the same measure associated with major commodity programs. The primary source of deadweight losses in rice programs result from set-asides. The potential savings from completely decoupling the rice program are estimated to reach $ 387 million for 1987. Key words: acreage control, deadweight loss, decoupling, rice programs. Commodity programs that tie producers ' sup-port to production decisions are becoming a ma-jor issue in designing the programs. Current dis-cussions of planting flexibility and decoupling are examples. The point of these discussions is to move producers away from making produc-tion decisions in response to the program and to facilitate their response to market signals. The goal is to avoid the necessity of using large set-asides to reduce the buildup of excessive stocks, and thereby to increase the efficiency in income transfer from taxpayers and consumers to pro-ducers. The marketing loan provision of the Food Se-curity Act of 1985 reflects market orientation on the demand side of the market by virtually elim-inating government management of stocks. Freezing a payment yield and determining base acreage at the previous five-year-moving aver-age is a limited decoupling on the supply side. In addition, the 50 / 92 underplanting provision of current rice programs further decouples pro-duction decisions from program payments-rice growers who <b>underplant</b> their permitted acreage by planting between 50 % and 92 % of the per-mitted acreage and devote the remaining acre...|$|E

We measured the height growth of the <b>underplanted</b> seedlings 4 years after planting. The larch canopies were of varying stand age (12, 17, and 37 years) and strip-cut width (4. 5, 6. 0, and 7. 5 [*]m). We measured the seedling height growth in an open site (i. e., a site with no canopy). <b>Underplanted</b> seedlings had a smaller height growth (12. 1 – 20. 1 [*]cm year− 1) than the seedlings planted in the open site (23. 7 [*]cm year− 1). The seedlings <b>underplanted</b> in the wider strip-cuts tended to have greater height growth than the seedlings <b>underplanted</b> in the narrowest strip-cuts. A generalized linear mixed model analysis predicted the greatest seedling height growth in the open site.

40|$|A {{major concern}} in the {{management}} of Quercus rubra is the the difficulty in regenerating stands that have developed dense understories of shade tolerant species. A study was conducted at two locations in south central Iowa to determine the impact over a five year period of using root graded seedlings, understory control, tree shelters, and overstory reduction on establishing <b>underplanted,</b> 1 - 0, Quercus rubra bare root stock. Relationships between growth or mortality, and photosynthetically active radiation, red to far red light ratio, basal area, average stand diameter, number of trees/hectare, percent stocking, and various combinations of these variables were tested. Shelters and root grading had the greatest impact on survival and growth of the <b>underplanted</b> seedlings. Annual survival and growth of non-sheltered seedlings was greater than sheltered seedlings after three growing seasons. However, By the end of the fifth growing season non-sheltered seedlings had averaged 221 percent greater growth and 75 percent greater survival than sheltered seedlings. <b>Underplanted</b> seedlings with five or more permanent, first-order, lateral roots had 93 percent greater growth at the McNay site and 407 percent at the Stephens sites, respectively, compared to seedlings with fewer, first-order lateral roots.

For each variant three circular research plots with the size 500 m 2 were established. To determine the intensity of relative irradiance 15 hemispherical photographs in the height of 1. 5 m were taken for each variant. The analysis confirmed a significant relationship only between indirect site factor (ISF) and basal area and partly stem number of parent stand. There is almost no influence of spruce overstorey density (within the observed range of basal area and stem number) on the values of total site factor (TSF) and its main component direct site factor (DSF). The relevant predictor for the height increments of <b>underplanted</b> saplings is ISF. Relationship between TSF and height increment is weak.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.), {{scotch broom}} (Cytisus scoparius L.) and snowbrush (Ceanothus velutinus Dougi) were planted under precommercially thinned Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga iuenziesil Mirb Franco) {{in the central}} Oregon Cascades. Plug grown red alder had {{significantly}} greater survival than all wildling propagules except for the second broom planting Browsing was strongly positively correlated with mortality for snowbrush Survival was somewhat correlated with Douglas-fir basal area (BA) and cover but not with available light. Nitrogen fixation in <b>underplanted</b> alder and broom and naturally occurring alder, broom and snowbrush was measured by acetylene reduction. Plant moisture stress (PMS) appeared to exert a stronger control on nitrogen fixation through the season than soil temperature. Nitrogen fixation {{did not appear to}} be related to available light or Douglas-fir BA or cover On single dates neither PMS nor soil temperature appeared to be related to nitrogen fixation. Averaged over the season, broom had significantly greater nitrogen fixation per unit nodule weight than alder but on a per plant basis the species were nearly equal. For <b>underplanted</b> alder, leaf area may have a higher immediate priority for photosynthate than nitrogen fixation as indicated by negative correlations between percent foliar nitrogen and leaf/top and leaf/nodule dry weight ratios Nitrogen fixation ability keeps apace with leaf development as seen by the positive correlations between leaf and stem total nitrogen values with nodule weights; leaf and nodule dry weights; and leaf weights and nitrogen fixation. For all species, total foliar nitrogen (leaf dry weight x percent nitrogen) was better correlated to nitrogen fixation than percent foliar nitrogen A greater leaf/nodule ratio for <b>underplanted</b> alder compared to naturally occurring may have resulted from lowered light levels in the thinned stands In late February, all broom had strong nitrogenase activity compared to sporadic weak activity for alder and no activity for snowbrush. This may suggest that fixation on broom is much less controlled by dormancy Red alder plugs offer the best potential for nitrogen fixation because of their higher survival, potentially greater growth and fixation, ease of planting, and lesser weed potential. Given seasonal estimates of nodule fixation rates and the proportion of alder mass as active nodules, nitrogen fixation for alder can be estimated over time from its expected growth under the Douglas-fir. The termination of alder growth is likely set by crown closure of the Douglas-fir This in turn depends on the number of Douglas-fir left after precommercial thinning and the radial growth rate of their crowns. A probability tree can organize and display the uncertainties of future growth and nitrogen fixation from <b>underplanted</b> alder It displays possible paths of growth that individual alder may follow and allows calculation of an expected or mean value for cumulative nitrogen fixation. For an example 15 year period, the expected cumulative fixation for an individual <b>underplanted</b> alder is about 0. 668 kg For comparison, a fully stocked alder stand with this rate of accretion averages 121 kg ha[superscript - 1] yr [superscript - 1] of nitrogen The initial cost of 224 kg N ha [superscript - 1] from <b>underplanted</b> alder accrued over a 15 year period is about double the current cost of applying an equivalent amount of urea The longer recovery period for the <b>underplanting</b> costs further magnify the difference...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral thesisThe need {{to develop}} forest {{management}} systems other than clearfelling {{has resulted in a}} requirement for improved understanding of the potential of continuous cover forestry (CCF). One suggested method for the conversion of forest stands into CCF systems and for bringing under-performing forests into productivity is thinning in conjunction with <b>underplanting.</b> This study was an attempt to provide information on species suitability for <b>underplanting</b> of two important trees in European forestry: pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). To determine the morphological, physiological and growth responses of these two species to different light conditions, beech and oak seedlings previously grown at full light for two years were covered by shading nets that provide different shade levels (62 %, 51 % or 28 % of full light) or continued to be exposed to full light. The different shade levels were intended to mimic a range of <b>underplanted</b> conditions and the process of acclimation to shade was studied to provide information on the ecology and adaptation of <b>underplanted</b> seedlings. In addition to the controlled-shade experiment another study to determine the physiological responses of beech natural regeneration to shade was conducted under natural light conditions (from open gaps to closed canopy). Both oak and beech displayed similar acclimation in response to shade for most of the traits investigated. At the plant level, seedling acclimation to shade included higher biomass allocation to above than below-ground parts and greater energy investment on height than diameter growth. At the leaf level, seedlings grown under shade reduced their leaf thickness and photosynthetic rates per unit area and increased their specific leaf area. This increase in specific leaf area seems to be one mechanism that allows seedlings to perform well under shade conditions. Another acclimation to low light conditions was to increase the efficiency of the photosystem II under shade. Photosynthetic rates were higher and leaves were retained for longer in seedlings grown at full light than under shade. Hence, this probably led to a greater growth in the full light than under shade. Despite this greater growth at full light, {{the results of this study}} suggest that beech and oak seedlings would be able to acclimate and perform well if <b>underplanted</b> below overstories that reduce the available light to as low as 28 % of full light without having any significant adverse effect on the quality of the final crop...|$|R

Currently, federal cost share programs, such as the Wetland Reserve Program and the Conservation Reserve Program, are enticing landowners to consider reforesting lands that are marginally productive for agriculture. This study examined four reforestation techniques commonly used in the area. These techniques were applied operationally, following methods used under federal reforestation programs. Four techniques were implemented on 8. 1 -ha blocks in a completely randomized design with three replications. The entire study site was prepared by disking following soybean harvest {{in the fall of}} 1994. The techniques tested were: (1) direct seeding Nuttall oak (Quercus nuffallii Palmer) acorns (2) plantfng 1 -O bareroot Nuttall oak seedlings (3) establishing a nurse crop of eastern cottonwood (Populus delfoides Marsh.) and then <b>underplanting</b> 1 -O bareroot Nuttall oak seedlings (4) control (natural succession).
