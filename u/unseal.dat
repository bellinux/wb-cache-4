5|$|Scully learns from {{blood tests}} that the {{contaminated}} water causes rapid cellular damage and dramatically increases sodium chloride in the body. She tries to ration the drinkable water amongst the three, but discovers Trondheim attempting to hoard what little that remains. Trondheim locks Scully {{out of the}} sewage hold, forcing her to use minuscule supplies to keep Mulder alive. The corrosion eventually eats through the ship's hull, flooding the hold and drowning Trondheim, who cannot <b>unseal</b> the hatch. The agents both lose consciousness shortly before Navy rescuers arrive at their former ship. Scully comes to at the hospital, where she is told that her written observations on the case helped naval doctors reverse their aging and save Mulder from near-certain death. Scully says {{that she wants to}} return to the Ardent for more research, but the doctor tells her that the ship sank shortly after their rescue due to the flooding.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} cathedral, Garrett ventures through Old Quarter, a haunted, {{abandoned}} district of the City. Through {{an opening in}} the cathedral, The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary, where he may learn how to <b>unseal</b> the cathedral. There, Garrett discovers that the cathedral was sealed to prevent the City's destruction by the Trickster. He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal: two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City, and two inside a Hammerite temple (in Thief Gold, one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below, while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game). Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral. After unsealing the cathedral, he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye. He returns The Eye to Constantine, who reveals himself to be the Trickster. Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye. The Trickster places it on the gemstone, and the two disappear through a portal. Garrett, left for dead, is found and freed by two Keepers. During his escape from the Trickster's mansion, he learns that the Trickster plans to use The Eye to revert the world to a wild state.|$|E

The purpose of this Note is to provide guidance for decision makers, engineers and administrators on selecting the most appropriate surface for <b>unsealed</b> road given the prevailing conditions.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} the wind-induced tearing and blow-off of asphalt roofing shingles, {{which are the}} most frequently observed forms of residential building damage in hurricanes. Field surveys indicate that in-service asphalt shingle sealant strips can lose adhesion along their leading edge over time, leaving the shingle partially <b>unsealed</b> and susceptible to wind uplift. Two interrelated studies {{presented in this paper}} show that <b>unsealing</b> is a naturally occurring process and that <b>unsealed</b> shingles are a contributing cause of shingle roof cover damage in high winds. The first study quantified the number, location, and failure mode of laminate and three-tab style shingle systems installed on residential buildings at 30 sites in Florida and Texas. Systematic patterns of partially <b>unsealed</b> field shingles found on 22 of the 30 roofs resembled spatial patterns of wind-induced shingle damage observed in post-hurricane building performance assessments. As expected, older roofs generally contained more <b>unsealed</b> shingles than newer roofs. The results of the second study link blow-off to partially <b>unsealed</b> shingles. Seventeen ASTM D 7158 Class H asphalt shingle roofs were aged outside for nominally one year at the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety Research Center and then evaluated in full-scale wind tunnel tests. Partially <b>unsealed</b> field and hip shingles frequently exhibited damage during wind testing, while fully sealed shingles were not damaged unless adjacent, <b>unsealed</b> shingles failed first...|$|R
25|$|The {{documentary}} featured {{one notable}} {{change from the}} UFO Files story – Tim Oates, grandson of Brawley Oates and the now-owner of the property with the sealed well where the UFO wreckage was purportedly buried, allowed the investigators to <b>unseal</b> the well, {{in order to examine}} it for possible debris. Water was taken from the well which tested normal except for large amounts of aluminum present; the well had no significant contents. It was stated in the episode that any large pieces of metal had been removed from the well by a past owner of the property. Further, the remains of a windmill base were found near the well site, which refuted Ms. Pegues' statements (from the 1979 Time magazine article) that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{protection}} spell is causing Regina {{to believe that}} Emma trapped her inside, and as she sees {{herself in the mirror}} Regina changes her clothes to those she used to wear as the Evil Queen. When Emma and Elsa arrive and <b>unseal</b> the Vault, Regina uses her pyrokinetic powers against them and they shield themselves with the ribbons on their wrists; the ribbons free Emma and Elsa, and Emma uses her powers to stall Regina from going after them. Regina, believing that Emma went to the Sheriff's station, shows up there, only to set up a battle between her and Mary Margaret. Regina then makes Anna and Kristoff disappear, and they end up on the beachfront. As Kristoff argues with Anna, she trips her leg on a bottle. Anna picks up the bottle and hits Kristoff on his head knocking him out, allowing the letter that was inside the bottle to fall into Anna's hands. Anna then reads the letter and she races off to the Snow Queen's lair.|$|E
500|$|Novice Hame finally {{catches up}} with the Doctor and teleports him against his will to the senate {{building}} where the Face of Boe is waiting. [...] Hame explains that a new mood drug called [...] "Bliss" [...] proved too addictive, and a virus mutated with the Bliss drug, became airborne and wiped out the entire surface population {{in a matter of}} minutes. Those in the Motorway were spared by being sealed in and quarantined, however there was not enough energy to <b>unseal</b> the motorway and as a result caused people to be trapped inside for years. [...] The Face of Boe wired himself to the system to keep the Motorway operational. [...] The Doctor determines that whatever danger that Bliss may have caused before has long passed, and works with Hame to try to power up the systems to <b>unseal</b> the Motorway.

Upon completion, the player destroys the corridor and is returned to the Labyrinth, where a power-up (and sometimes a warp panel key) is collected as a reward. While some corridors can be accessed freely, others can only be entered by performing a particular action in the corridor room. Some rooms in the Labyrinth contain clues that indicate how to <b>unseal</b> these corridors. [...] Ten of the corridors in the game serve as the safety devices which must be deactivated to win the game.|$|E
500|$|Although {{his efforts}} dealing with video games have {{generally}} focused on juveniles, Thompson {{got involved in}} a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant {{in a series of}} highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to <b>unseal</b> a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the [...] "functional equivalent of a 15-year-old," [...] and [...] "the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense".|$|E

[...] However, Chase didn't report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until October 2008, when it told the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency that the performance of Madoff's investments was [...] "too good to be true." [...] The suit also claimed that Chase bankers were making profitable deals with Madoff even as risk management executives expressed concern about the nature of Madoff's business. [...] It also claimed that Chase officials knew that Friehling & Horowitz wasn't peer reviewed or registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (it subsequently emerged that the Friehling firm had stated in writing {{for more than a decade}} that it didn't conduct audits). [...] Almost as seriously, Picard charged that Chemical/Chase's retail bankers failed to perform even basic oversight of Madoff's banking activities, despite several transactions dating as far back as the 1990s that raised the appearance of money laundering or check kiting. [...] Picard argued that even a cursory glance at Madoff's account activity at Chase would have revealed his business could not possibly have been legitimate. [...] He also argued that even after Chase reported its concerns about Madoff's performance to UK officials, it didn't put any restrictions on Madoff's banking activities until his arrest two months later.|$|E
