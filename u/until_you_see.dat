500|$|Rogen {{has been}} outspoken about {{awareness}} of Alzheimer's disease. No {{one in his}} biological family has it but it runs in his wife's side, and has affected her mother for several years. [...] "Ithink <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it firsthand, it's {{kind of hard to}} conceive of how brutal it is," [...] Rogen said to CNN. [...] "Until I saw it, you just don't get kind of how heartbreaking it can be." [...] During the interview, he talked about how he tries to be emotionally supportive and around as much as he can for Miller's mother. Both he and Miller spoke to Larry King for ALarry King Special, Unthinkable: The Alzheimer's Epidemic, which aired in April 2011. Rogen testified about the disease and his charity before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services on February 26, 2014.|$|E
500|$|The split-reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 {{feet long}} with A Husband's Jealous Wife included, {{was released on}} September 23, 1910. Advertising for the film was a bit mixed {{as to whether or}} not it was a comedy or a drama, stating, [...] "You have no idea as to how marvelously a Thanhouser can twist a story <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> this gripping dra - well, perhaps, it isn't a drama at that - or a comedy even. We hate to tip you off as to WHAT it is. When you see the picture, with its totally unlooked-for climax, you'll know why!" [...] Bowers would later term this as more of the slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser said the company would not produce. The film likely had a wide national release, known advertising theatres include Indiana, and Kansas. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. One theater advertisement may have confused this film with another because it lists this film as a western film.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards {{based on her}} performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted {{for her role as}} Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't believe anything is going to happen until it does, <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> your name on a paper or it actually happens and you have something in your hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA [...] to connect with a big audience." [...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, made it sound worthwhile, I think. So I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Lawrence's gesture {{hinted at}} humorous resignation. [...] "You're a restless fellow, Jake, but I hoped you'd wait <b>until</b> to-morrow. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> I've been warned to keep quiet." ...|$|R
2500|$|During the show, {{there was}} a [...] "fierce {{competition}} between the Anglo-French Concorde and the Russian Tu-144". [...] The Soviet pilot, Mikhail Kozlov, had bragged that he would outperform the Concorde. [...] "Just wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> us fly," [...] he was quoted as saying. [...] "Then you'll see something." [...] On {{the final day of}} the show, the Concorde, which was not yet in production, performed its demonstration flight first. [...] Its performance was later described as being unexciting, and it has been theorized that Kozlov was determined to show how much better his aircraft was.|$|E
2500|$|Formula One driver Bruno Senna is {{the nephew}} of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: [...] "If you think I'm fast, just wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> my nephew Bruno." [...] Due {{to the death of}} his uncle, Bruno {{initially}} gave up motor racing at his family's insistence. He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2009, a video {{appeared}} online of Hutchison {{performing a}} new track, entitled [...] "Swim <b>Until</b> <b>You</b> Can't <b>See</b> Land". The song was later revealed {{as the first}} single from the forthcoming third album.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{as well as}} we all are," [...] said Stacy quickly, {{yet with}} a certain dry significance. [...] "Never mind now; wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jimmy rose, {{and quietly}} {{reached for his}} hat. [...] "Then," [...] he said, [...] "there {{is nothing to be}} gained by {{pointing}} out what my views are. We can only wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> things differently." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is a purse of money, to pay {{for what}} you may require on the voyage; and to keep you, if need be, at Rome <b>until</b> <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> Titus, who may {{possibly}} be absent.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall see}} him," [...] said the Major. [...] "I promise you that. The doctor has {{forbidden}} {{him to leave}} the house <b>until</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> him. Only wait a little! My poor, dear lady, wait, if it is only for a few minutes, <b>until</b> <b>you</b> are stronger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember what I told you," [...] {{came from}} Stanley, {{as he turned}} {{slightly}} to address his followers. [...] "Don't throw any snowballs yet. Do as the soldiers did in Revolutionary days--wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> the whites of their eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. On {{the further}} side. Don't {{come by the}} road, come across {{by the end of}} the mere. Lie in the bracken <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me coming.... I've not played tennis a dozen times this year. Not half a dozen." ...|$|E
6000|$|Doris laughed. [...] "You're jealous! Come on." [...] A {{moment later}} they {{stood before the}} clock, looking up at it. [...] "He'll come out in a few minutes. Wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him. I know you two will get along just fine." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw (5th Baronet) {{commanded}} his men [...] "Dinna fire till ye can see {{the whites}} of their e'en," [...] from which the saying [...] "Don't fire <b>until</b> <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> the whites of their eyes" [...] is taken.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was Alfred {{who sent}} me to you, Mr Boffin. Alfred said, [...] "Don't come back, Sophronia, <b>until</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> Mr Boffin, and told him all. Whatever he may think of it, he ought {{certainly}} to know it." [...] Would you mind coming into the carriage?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] the {{official}} said irritably, [...] "this man would not have your name and address in his pocket without an object. You cannot tell whether you know him or not <b>until</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> him. Be so good as to come this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's good," [...] he said; [...] "then {{when you}} reach the mile-stone that stands on this road at the confine of the forest, bear sharply to your right and skirt the wood <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the hamlet of--Le--something.

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Burke said; [...] "you {{have only}} to wait here quietly <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> an opportunity. I will go with you {{tomorrow}} to the merchants I was introduced to today, and say that I am going away for a time and shall be obliged if they will make you useful in any way until I return. In that way {{you will have a}} sort of established position here, and can wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> a chance of smuggling yourself on board some English or Dutch vessel. Mine is a very different affair. I may talk lightly of it, but I am perfectly aware that I run a tremendous risk, and that the chances are very strongly against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wyvil thereupon {{advised her}} not to express any opinion, until {{she was in a}} better {{position}} to judge for herself.

6000|$|... "Perfectly so, {{my dearest}} mother.

I ask but this of your justice." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Confound you, yes, you {{stubborn}} {{offshoot of}} a stubborn breed," [...] growled David, {{looking at him}} affectionately. [...] "I know that, {{and that is why}} I'll never feel at ease about <b>you</b> <b>until</b> I <b>see</b> <b>you</b> married to the right sort of a girl. She's not hard to find. Nine out of ten girls in this country of ours are fit for kings' palaces. But the tenth always has to be reckoned with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{the king}} to his apartments, Stein," [...] he {{commanded}} curtly, [...] "and you, Lieutenant Butzow, accompany {{them with a}} guard, nor leave <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> that he is safely confined.

6000|$|... "And me," [...] sighed Patty. [...] "I do wish I {{could find}} {{something}} to do too. If only we both could get positions, everything would be all right. Mother wouldn't have to worry so. Don't say anything about this chance to her <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> what comes of it. She'd only be doubly disappointed if nothing did. What is your other assignment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See me in a coat {{fit for a}} Lord!--Well, Judith, if {{you wait}} till that day, you'll wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me beyond reason and memory. No--no--gal, my gifts are my gifts, and I'll live and die in 'em, though I never bring down another deer, or spear another salmon. What have I done that you should wish {{to see me in}} such a flaunting coat, Judith?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can <b>you</b> do {{anything}} <b>until</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> everything, or {{as much as}} you can? And besides, darling, I love you. Come along with me. You have no business here; you don't belong to this place; you're half a gipsy,--your face tells that; and I--even the smell of open water makes me restless. Come across the sea and be happy!' ...|$|R
