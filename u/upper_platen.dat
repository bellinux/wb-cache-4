50|$|While {{not a true}} {{lenticular}} process, the Dufex Process (manufactured by F.J. Warren Ltd.) does use a form of lens {{structure to}} animate the image. The process consists of imprinting a metallic foil with an image. The foil is then laminated onto a thin sheet of card stock that has been coated with {{a thick layer of}} wax. The heated lamination press has the Dufex embossing plate on its <b>upper</b> <b>platen,</b> which has been engraved with 'lenses' at different angles, designed to match the artwork and reflect light at different intensities depending on angle of view.|$|E
50|$|For soil samples, the {{specimen}} {{is contained in}} a cylindrical latex sleeve with a flat, circular metal plate or platen closing off {{the top and bottom}} ends. This cylinder is placed into a bath of a hydraulic fluid to provide pressure along the sides of the cylinder. The top platen can then be mechanically driven up or down along the axis of the cylinder to squeeze the material. The distance that the <b>upper</b> <b>platen</b> travels is measured {{as a function of the}} force required to move it, as the pressure of the surrounding water is carefully controlled. The net change in volume of the material can also be measured by how much water moves in or out of the surrounding bath, but is typically measured - when the sample is saturated with water - by measuring the amount of water that flows into or out of the sample's pores.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for compressive {{testing of}} a test specimen may comprise vertically spaced upper and lower platen members between which a test specimen may be placed. The platen members are supported by a fixed support assembly. A load indicator is interposed between the <b>upper</b> <b>platen</b> member and the support assembly for supporting the total weight of the <b>upper</b> <b>platen</b> member and any additional weight which may be placed on it. Operating means are provided for moving the lower platen member upwardly toward the <b>upper</b> <b>platen</b> member whereby an increasing portion of the total weight is transferred from the load indicator to the test specimen...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic lateral {{crushing}} behaviour of short empty and sandwich circular tubes is {{examined in this}} paper. Unlike the conventional impact method, the specimens {{were placed on the}} bottom platen of an Instron machine with a constant upwards velocity and then the tube collided with the fixed <b>upper</b> rigid <b>platen.</b> Load-deflection curves of empty tubes were first obtained and analysed. From the viewpoint of deformation modes and plastic strain energy absorbed by the tube quadrants around the proximal surface and distal surface, a critical velocity of impact is determined which corresponds to a mode change. A relationship is found to exist between the critical velocity and thickness-to-diameter ratio as well as the yield stress and density of the material. To understand the dynamic crushing behaviour of short aluminium foam-filled sandwich tubes by two rigid platens, further tests and corresponding finite element analysis were performed, respectively. Similar to the observations in the quasi-static tests, the mode of dynamic collapse is bending, with the formation of plastic bending zones accompanied with core crushing. Corresponding FE models for ABAQUS/Explicit were developed and validated against the experimental observations. Detailed deformation features and energy absorption characteristics during the crushing process were identified. It was found that increasing the compression velocity leads to an increase in the total internal plastic energy dissipation for both empty and sandwich tube. The propagation of plastic bending in the form of double-moving-hinges is the main mechanism of energy dissipation, as opposed to the low velocity impact which involves stationary plastic deformation zones...|$|R
30|$|The {{heat flow}} meter method, as {{described}} in ASTM C 518 [11], was employed. The sample mat was covered with another heat flow meter same as used for {{the bottom of the}} mat, then, the test sample sandwiched with two heat flow meters was inserted between upper and lower heat platens measuring 450  ×  450  mm. The temperature {{on both sides of the}} samples was measured using three sets of thermocouples. The temperature of the heat platens was set in one of two ways: either the <b>upper</b> <b>platen</b> was set at 40  °C and the lower platen at 20  °C, which generated a downward heat flow, or the opposite way around, which generated an upward heat flow.|$|E
30|$|Elastic modulus of the {{concrete}} specimens of size Ø 50  ×  75  mm was obtained as the slope of stress–strain curves recorded {{by means of an}} ALPHA compression testing machine. The load cell had a maximum capacity of 50 kN and was loaded with a mechanical press at a constant rate of 0.01 kN/ms. The vertical strain was measured utilizing a calibrated Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDT) sensor. The end surfaces of the specimens, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of specimen, were cut with a diamond saw and polished {{in order to create a}} smooth surface. The concrete specimens of the size Ø 50  ×  75  mm were placed between two platens and positioned under the load cells. 4 LVDT sensors were used to measure the displacement of the bottom platen and three more sensors were employed to measure the displacement of the <b>upper</b> <b>platen.</b> The sensors were connected to a data-log system to record the gradient of strain as a function of stress.|$|E
