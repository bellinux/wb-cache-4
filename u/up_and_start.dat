5|$|Nafaryus and Arabelle {{arrive and}} beg Gabriel {{to use his}} gift to save Faythe ("Losing Faythe"), but Gabriel is unable to sing after {{screaming}} so loudly ("Whispers on the Wind"). The people, attracted by the scream, show <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> singing, giving Gabriel hope. He finds his ability to sing and brings Faythe back to life ("Hymn of a Thousand Voices"). Nafaryus, realising what he has done, decides to end the conflict with Gabriel and shuts down the NOMACS for good. Daryus is forgiven for his actions, and Gabriel and Faythe raise Xander as a family ("Our New World"). Nafaryus promises to govern the empire as a fair leader in a new world where music is appreciated again ("Astonishing").|$|E

However, the remaining portions of the incident waves during a major earthquake still bear a huge devastating potential.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Nuckolls {{and several other}} weapons {{designers}} had developed {{the outlines of the}} ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum {{did not have to be}} heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1MJ beam. To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5kt releases 2 million MJ in total.|$|E

500|$|In his 2005 book Rip It <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Start</b> Again: Post Punk 1978–1984, British music {{journalist}} Simon Reynolds {{described the}} sound of Heaven Up Here as having been filled out with [...] "guitar overdubs, keyboard glints, vocal multitracking and atmospheric vapours". Comparing Heaven Up Here with Joy Division's 1980 album Closer, Reynolds said they are [...] "harrowed by the same things [...] hypocrisy, distrust, betrayal, lost or frozen potential". However, he said that [...] "Closer shows Ian Curtis fatally mesmerized by his own dread visions, Heaven Up Here ultimately turns its face towards the light" [...] with the tracks [...] "No Dark Things"– which he describes as renouncing [...] "death-wishful thinking"– and [...] "All I Want"– which he describes as [...] "a blasting celebration of desire for desire's sake" [...] and [...] "pure intransitive exhilaration".|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} Thief focused on stealth and evasion from a first-person perspective. Leonard said this idea {{challenged}} the standard first-person shooter concept: [...] "It {{is a game}} style that many observers were concerned might not appeal to players [...] and even those intimately involved with the game had doubts at times." [...] In response to the sentiment that their previous games [...] " [...] {{a fair amount of}} investment from the player to get maximal enjoyment", the team specifically designed Thief to allow players to [...] "pick [...] <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> playing". While the team's goal was to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with the game's design, Church said that it shared its core design with previous Looking Glass Studios games. He explained: [...] " [...] provide a range of player capability in [...] world [...] the player can choose their own goals, and their own approaches to an obstacle when they reach the goal it is far more satisfying", and that [...] "flexible simulation of game elements is a powerful way to enable the player to make their own way in the world".|$|E

He goes on to describe Pattinson's [...] "granite basslines" [...] carrying the melody; Sergeant's guitar playing as [...] "jagged-quartz" [...] and avoiding [...] "anything resembling a solo, apart from the odd flinty peal of lead playing"; de Freitas' drumming as minimal and [...] "surging urgency"; and McCulloch's vocals as having [...] "precocious authority". Reynolds then describes the songs as being rooted in [...] "doubt, anguish, despair" [...] while the [...] "tightness and brightness of their sound transmits contradictory sensations of confidence, vigour and euphoria." [...] He also describes how the line [...] "Stars are stars and they shine so hard"– from the track [...] "Stars Are Stars"– showed how the band felt no embarrassment in their wish to be famous. In 1989 McCulloch told Reynolds how, as a teenager, he felt there was [...] "a big movie camera in the sky". McCulloch described the opening line of the track [...] "Going Up"– [...] "Ain't thou watching my film"– as a terrible line and he went on to say, [...] "It was meant to be tongue in cheek, but that was what spurred me on." ...|$|E
500|$|Psychedelic rock {{began to}} be revived in the early 1980s by bands of the post-punk scene, {{including}} the work of The Teardrop Explodes, Echo and the Bunnymen, the Soft Boys, Siouxsie and the Banshees,S.

The Cure, The Glove, XTC's side-project The Dukes of Stratosphear, The Church and The Legendary Pink Dots. There were occasional mainstream acts that dabbled in neo-psychedelia in the US, including Prince's mid-1980s work and some of Lenny Kravitz's 1990s output, but it has mainly been an influence on alternative and indie-rock bands. These singers were joined by the Paisley Underground movement, based in Los Angeles, with acts like Dream Syndicate, The Bangles and Rain Parade. [...] The late 1980s saw the birth of shoegazing in the UK, which, among other influences, took inspiration from 1960s psychedelia. Critic Simon Reynolds described this movement as [...] "a rash of blurry, neo-psychedelic bands". With loud walls of sound, where individual instruments and even vocals were often indistinguishable, they followed the lead of noise pop and dream pop bands such as My Bloody Valentine (often considered as the earliest shoegaze act), The Jesus and Mary Chain, and the Cocteau Twins. Major acts included Ride, Lush, Chapterhouse, and The Boo Radleys, who enjoyed considerable attention in the UK, but largely failed to break through in the US.|$|E
