5|$|Reluctantly, Dowding defined three categories, A, B and C. Category A <b>units</b> <b>were</b> to {{bear the}} brunt of the fighting, and were to be kept at full {{strength}} in aircraft and pilots. Only if the A units suffered exceptionally high losses would they be replaced. B <b>units</b> <b>were</b> relief units, to be maintained at operational strength and only used if absolutely necessary. C <b>units</b> <b>were</b> generally stripped down to just five or six pilots. These <b>units</b> <b>were</b> devoted to training new pilots. Although not fit for fighter-fighter action, they could defend quieter areas. The system potentially could have had fatal results for Fighter Command, with C units becoming less and less effective. But the system had not been running long enough by 14 September for it to have a serious impact on Fighter Command's strength. The replacement <b>units</b> <b>were</b> sufficient in number and effectiveness to continue to replace exhausted units. By 15 September, the C units could still give a good account of themselves in battle.|$|E
5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 <b>units</b> <b>were</b> used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 <b>units</b> <b>were</b> bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 <b>units</b> <b>were</b> brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more <b>units</b> <b>were</b> bought in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement, now known as base units. Derived <b>units</b> <b>were</b> built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived <b>units</b> <b>were</b> decimal-based and identified by a standard set of prefixes.|$|E
50|$|But not all {{quantities}} {{require a}} unit of their own. Using physical laws, units of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities. Thus only a small set of <b>units</b> <b>is</b> required. These <b>units</b> <b>are</b> taken as the base <b>units.</b> Other <b>units</b> <b>are</b> derived <b>units.</b> Derived <b>units</b> <b>are</b> a matter of convenience, {{as they can be}} expressed in terms of basic <b>units.</b> Which <b>units</b> <b>are</b> considered base <b>units</b> <b>is</b> a matter of choice.|$|R
5000|$|Cadet <b>units</b> <b>are</b> {{referred}} to differently {{depending on the}} parent service. Air Force Cadet <b>units</b> <b>are</b> {{referred to}} as Squadrons, Navy Cadet <b>units</b> <b>are</b> referred to as Training Ships and Army Cadet <b>units</b> <b>are</b> referred to as Army Cadet Units. The ADFC comprise three organisations: ...|$|R
50|$|Only five Cosmos <b>units</b> <b>are</b> {{known to}} exist today, three are empty mockup shells {{and the other}} two <b>units</b> <b>are</b> fully {{functional}}. One empty shell and one fully functional <b>unit</b> <b>are</b> owned by the Atari History Museum, while the other functioning <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> owned by a former Atari Inc. employee.|$|R
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such <b>units</b> <b>were</b> spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian <b>units</b> <b>were</b> breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral {{and elsewhere in the}} Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|B-1A: The B-1A was the {{original}} B-1 design with variable engine intakes and Mach2.2 top speed. Four prototypes were built; no production <b>units</b> <b>were</b> manufactured.|$|E
5|$|Before the Spring Offensive on the Western Front began, the War Office {{had decided}} to {{substitute}} British units in the EEF with British Indian Army units. The relieved British <b>units</b> <b>were</b> to be retained in Egypt as reinforcements. When the Spring Offensive was launched these British <b>units</b> <b>were</b> quickly redeployed to the Western Front.|$|E
50|$|The head <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> the {{centerpiece}} of the car's sound system. Typically located {{in the center of the}} dashboard, modern head <b>units</b> <b>are</b> densely integrated electronic packages housed in detachable face plates. As high-end head <b>units</b> <b>are</b> common targets for theft, many head <b>units</b> <b>are</b> typically integrated into the vehicle's alarm system.|$|R
50|$|It is Romania's largest {{electricity}} {{producer and}} one of the large thermal power plants in Europe having 6 units of 309 MW net each. But only 5 <b>units</b> <b>are</b> operational, thus totalling a capacity of 1,545 MW. An eighth <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> not completed, but dismantled. One <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned and a second <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> refurbished and mothballed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{known as}} the Harlem I Unit. Under the administration of George Beto, the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> converted into a pre-release facility. The <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> renamed after Governor of Texas Beauford H. Jester.|$|R
5|$|Construction of the {{new power}} station started in 1930, but the Second World War delayed its full {{completion}} until 1951. The station was opened in stages throughout its construction, as generating <b>units</b> <b>were</b> able {{to be put into}} production while the other sections were still under construction. The first <b>units</b> <b>were</b> commissioned in January 1933.|$|E
5|$|Four Class 66 <b>units</b> <b>were</b> {{ordered by}} the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in 1939, {{to be used as}} express trains on the then newly or shortly-to-be {{electrified}} Sørland- and Østfold Lines. At the same time, similar Class 88 diesel multiple <b>units</b> <b>were</b> ordered for the non-electrified Bergen- and Dovre Lines. The trains were built by Strømmens Værksted, Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). The diesel series was assembled by Strømmen, while Skabo assembled the electric version. NEBB delivered the motors for the units.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car <b>units</b> <b>were</b> built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer <b>units</b> <b>were</b> designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt <b>units</b> <b>were</b> designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|The command {{structure}} is hierarchical, with divisions and brigades controlling groups of <b>units.</b> Major <b>units</b> <b>are</b> regiment- or battalion-sized, and minor <b>units</b> <b>are</b> company-sized <b>units</b> (or platoons). All <b>units</b> <b>are</b> Regular (full-time) or Army Reserve (part-time).|$|R
50|$|These three <b>units</b> <b>are</b> new {{additions}} to the Refuge. The St. Lawrence <b>Unit</b> <b>is</b> 303 acres and is located in St. Lawrence Township. The Jessenland <b>Unit</b> <b>is</b> 1,827 acres and is located in Blakely Township and Henderson Township. The Blakeley <b>Unit</b> <b>is</b> 136 acres and is located in Blakely Township south {{of the town of}} Blakeley and north of Salisbury Hill Road.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, ASPC-Tucson Echo <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> {{demolished}} {{and a new}} <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> to be {{built for}} around 2,000 minimum custody 1-2 inmates.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{extend the life of}} the Genesis, Sega {{released}} two add-ons to increase its capabilities: a CD-based peripheral known as the Sega CD (Mega-CD outside North America), and a 32-bit peripheral known as the Sega 32X. 2.24 million Sega CD <b>units</b> <b>were</b> sold worldwide, and an estimated 665,000 32X <b>units</b> <b>were</b> sold by the end of 1994.|$|E
5|$|M400 (1970) – 35-note single manual. The {{most common}} and {{portable}} model. About 1,800 <b>units</b> <b>were</b> made. It has three different sounds per frame.|$|E
5|$|Many NSB Class 69 <b>units</b> <b>were</b> {{taken out}} from traffic in 2013-2015, {{replaced}} by Class 75 units.|$|E
25|$|About 30 to 40% of {{the stone}} in the upper <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> ripple-laminated while the lower <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> structureless to {{horizontally}} laminated. Good exposures of the ripple-laminated upper <b>unit</b> <b>are</b> found on {{the lower part of}} Egyptian Temple.|$|R
50|$|A {{horticulture}} <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> {{established in}} 1978 and a poultry <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> constructed in 1979.|$|R
30|$|Another <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> also used; this <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> LCI points (Pt). This <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> used {{to compare}} the {{environmental}} impact of a process to the emissions caused by one average European citizen per year; 1000  Pt is equal to one citizen.|$|R
5|$|The 6S <b>units</b> <b>were</b> {{intended}} to be introduced into service in June 1957. On 5April a fire at Cannon Street signal box disabled all signalling equipment there. As a result, locomotive-hauled trains were banned from the station. A temporary signal box was commissioned on 5May and the 6S <b>units</b> <b>were</b> introduced on peak services the next day. Two units coupled together formed the 06:58 and 07:26 Hastings–Cannon Street services in the morning, and the 17:18 and 18:03 Cannon Street–Hastings services in the evening. From 17June the 6S and 6L <b>units</b> <b>were</b> working services throughout the day. The 6B units entered service between May and August 1958.|$|E
5|$|The below <b>units</b> <b>were</b> {{deployed}} {{for communication}} line protection duties {{and as such}} were under command of Major-General Methuen.|$|E
