5|$|The {{convergence}} of both series has very different properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not {{coincide with the}} function; but if the function is analytic then the series converges pointwise to the function, and uniformly on every compact subset of the convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the function is square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or <b>uniform</b> <b>convergence</b> (for instance, if the function is periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform).|$|E

25|$|The {{most basic}} type of {{convergence}} for {{a sequence of}} functions (in particular, it does not assume any topological structure on {{the domain of the}} functions) is pointwise convergence. It is defined as convergence of the sequence of values of the functions at every point. If the functions take their values in a uniform space, then one can define pointwise Cauchy convergence, <b>uniform</b> <b>convergence,</b> and uniform Cauchy convergence of the sequence.|$|E
25|$|This {{demonstrates}} that for integrals on unbounded intervals, <b>uniform</b> <b>convergence</b> of a function is {{not strong enough}} to allow passing a limit through an integral sign. This makes the Riemann integral unworkable in applications (even though the Riemann integral assigns both sides the correct value), because there is no other general criterion for exchanging a limit and a Riemann integral, and without such a criterion it is difficult to approximate integrals by approximating their integrands.|$|E

A {{two-dimensional}} visual {{device for}} {{description of the}} dispersion of a multivariate data set in any dimension is the scale curve, a depth-based method introduced by Liu (1990) and treated in detail by Liu, Parelius and Singh (1999). It offers an appealing alternative to covariance matrix methods and even provides an attractive new tool in the univariate case. To support applications such as uniform confidence bounds for the population scale curve, we develop some asymptotics. <b>Uniform</b> strong <b>convergence</b> of the sample scale curve is established under broad conditions and <b>uniform</b> weak <b>convergence</b> under somewhat restricted conditions.

25|$|The {{space of}} {{distributions}} on U is denoted by D′(U) {{and it is}} the continuous dual space of D(U). No matter what dual topology is placed on D′(U), a sequence of distributions converges in this topology if and only if it converges pointwise (although this need not be true of a net), which is why the topology is sometimes defined to be the weak-* topology. But often the topology of bounded convergence, which in this case {{is the same as the}} topology of <b>uniform</b> <b>convergence</b> on compact sets, is placed on D′(U) since it is with this topology that D′(U) becomes a nuclear Montel space and it is with this topology that the kernels theorem of Schwartz holds.
