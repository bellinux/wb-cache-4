It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> word.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} {{imperial}} period, local varieties of Chinese had diverged {{to the extent}} that people from different provinces could not <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> another. In order to facilitate communication between officials from different provinces, and between officials and the inhabitants of the areas to which they were posted, imperial administrations adopted a koiné based on various northern dialects. Until well into the 19th century, this language was based on dialects spoken in the area of Nanjing, the first Ming capital and a major cultural centre, though not identical to any single dialect. The standard language of the Ming and early Qing, when it was based on lower Yangtze dialects, is sometimes called Middle Mandarin.|$|E
25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E

25|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on talking to the Turks, Ribbentrop and Papen became entangled in a feud over Papen's demand that he by-pass Ribbentrop and send his dispatches straight to Hitler. As a former Chancellor, Papen had granted this privilege of by-passing the Foreign Minister while he was Ambassador to Austria. Ribbentrop's friendship with Papen, which went back to 1918, ended over this issue. At the same time, Ribbentrop took to shouting at the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin, Mehemet Hamdi Arpag, {{as part of the}} effort to win Turkey over as a German ally. Ribbentrop believed that Turks were so stupid that only by shouting at them could one make them <b>understand.</b> <b>One</b> of the consequences of Ribbentrop's heavy-handed behaviour was the signing of the Anglo-Turkish alliance of 12 May 1939.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{interaction}} with other languages, Urdu has become localized {{wherever it is}} spoken, including in Pakistan. Urdu in Pakistan has undergone changes and has incorporated and borrowed many words from regional languages like Pashto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balti, thus allowing speakers of the language in Pakistan to distinguish themselves more easily and giving the language a decidedly Pakistani flavour. Similarly, the Urdu spoken in India can also be distinguished into many dialects like Dakhni (Deccan) of South India, and Khariboli of the Punjab region. Because of Urdu's similarity to Hindi, speakers of the two languages can easily <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> another if both sides refrain from using specialized vocabulary. The syntax (grammar), morphology, and the core vocabulary are essentially identical. Thus linguists usually count them as one single language and contend that they are considered as two different languages for socio-political reasons.|$|E
500|$|He then concludes presciently, [...] "Some {{analysts have}} tried to paint this war as a {{conflict}} between Afghans. It isn't. In reality, it is a war between a Pakistan-supported militant group {{and the rest of}} the world. There are only two possible solutions: A Western-backed Afghan government decisively defeats the Taliban, or the Taliban agree to demilitarize and join the political process. The United States, however, should <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> thing very clearly: It would be making a huge error -- and confirming the Afghan people's worst fears -- if it picked up and left Afghanistan to the Taliban's brutal ways." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1967, Lennon's {{aggressive}} edges {{from his}} childhood had disappeared, and he spent considerable amounts of time sitting in his sunroom or garden and daydreaming for hours at end. He became somewhat uncommunicative towards most people, including Cynthia (but not with the other Beatles, who had an almost unspoken ability to <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> another). [...] Cynthia once complained, saying: [...] "What I'd like is a holiday of our own ... John, Julian and me". Lennon replied with, [...] "OK, I know, we'll all retire to a little cottage on a cliff in Cornwall, all right?" [...] Then adding, [...] "No, I've got these bloody songs to write. I have to work, to justify living." [...] She understood his temperament, but felt frustrated at never having developed her own career by using her art college background.|$|E
500|$|McClellan's first {{military}} operations were {{to occupy the}} area of western Virginia that wanted {{to remain in the}} Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part." [...] He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.|$|E

2500|$|Lee {{eventually}} became the consensus {{candidate of the}} federalists, overcoming competition from like minded men including relative Ludwell Lee, William Fitzhugh, Martin Pickett, {{as well as two}} friends - Leven Powell and Dr. David Stuart. Opposing him for the anti-federalists was state Senator John Pope. Though there is little primary material describing the tenor of this first election, what does exist hints at a hard fought and sometimes dirty campaign. John Pope was called [...] "contemptible" [...] in a letter from John Murray to Horatio Gates, and William Allason writing to John Woodcock described the contest: [...] "I <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> makes very free with the other's Reputation [...] by wch. I would not be surprised to hear of their having Exchanged a few dry blows." [...] Lee eventually outpolled Pope, defeating him nearly 4 to 1 in Fairfax County alone, which included the vote of George Washington.|$|E
2500|$|Inuit {{languages}} {{comprise a}} dialect continuum, or dialect chain, {{that stretches from}} Unalakleet and Norton Sound in Alaska, across northern Alaska and Canada, and east to Greenland. Changes from western (Iñupiaq) to eastern dialects are marked by the dropping of vestigial Yupik-related features, increasing consonant assimilation (e.g., kumlu, meaning [...] "thumb", changes to kuvlu, changes to kublu, changes to kulluk, changes to kulluq), and increased consonant lengthening, and lexical change. Thus, speakers of two adjacent Inuit dialects would usually be able to <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> another, but speakers from dialects distant from {{each other on the}} dialect continuum would have difficulty understanding one another. Seward Peninsula dialects in Western Alaska, where much of the Iñupiat culture has been in place for perhaps less than 500 years, are greatly affected by phonological influence from the Yupik languages. Eastern Greenlandic, {{at the opposite end of}} the Inuit range, has had significant word replacement due to a unique form of ritual name avoidance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principle}} of the selection and institutionalization of a Universal/International Auxiliary Language is among the Bahá'í Faith's key tenets. Bahá'u'lláh, {{the founder of the}} Bahá'í Faith, writing in the Tablets of Ishráqát and Maqṣúd, taught that the lack of a common language is a major barrier to world unity since the lack of communication between peoples of different languages undermines efforts toward world peace due to misunderstandings of language; he urged that humanity should choose an auxiliary language that would be taught in schools in addition to one's own native language, so that people could <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> another. He stated that until an auxiliary language is adopted, complete unity between the various parts of the world would continue to be unrealized. `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, called the promotion of the {{principle of}} the international auxiliary language [...] "the very first service to the world of man" [...] and its realization as [...] "the greatest achievement of the age in conferring profit and pleasure on mankind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Terms such as [...] "transformation" [...] {{can give}} the {{impression}} that theories of transformational generative grammar are intended {{as a model for the}} processes through which the human mind constructs and understands sentences. Chomsky is clear that this is not in fact the case: a generative grammar models only the knowledge that underlies the human ability to speak and <b>understand.</b> <b>One</b> of the most important of Chomsky's ideas is that most of this knowledge is innate, with the result that a baby can have a large body of prior knowledge about the structure of language in general, and need only actually learn the idiosyncratic features of the language(s) it is exposed to. Chomsky was not the first person to suggest that all languages had certain fundamental things in common (he quotes philosophers writing several centuries ago who had the same basic idea), but he helped to make the innateness theory respectable after a period dominated by more behaviorist attitudes towards language. Perhaps more significantly, he made concrete and technically sophisticated proposals about the structure of language, and made important proposals regarding how the success of grammatical theories should be evaluated.|$|E
2500|$|Maria Feodorovna's grandson-in-law, Prince Felix Yusupov, {{noted that}} she had great {{influence}} in the Romanov family. Sergei Witte praised her tact and diplomatic skill. Nevertheless, despite her social tact, she did not get along well with her daughter-in-law, Tsarina Alexandra, holding her responsible {{for many of the}} woes that beset her son Nicholas and the Russian Empire in general. She was appalled with Alexandra's inability to win favour with public, and also that she did not give birth to an heir until almost ten years after her marriage, after bearing four daughters. The fact that Russian court custom dictated that an empress dowager took precedence over an empress consort, combined with the possessiveness that Maria had of her sons, and her jealousy of Empress Alexandra only served to exacerbate tensions between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Sophie Buxhoeveden remarked of this conflict: “Without actually clashing they seemed fundamentally unable … to <b>understand</b> <b>one</b> another,” [...] and her daughter Olga commented: “they had tried to understand each other and failed. They were utterly different in character, habits and outlook.” [...] Maria was sociable and a good dancer, with an ability to ingratiate herself with people, while Alexandra, though more intelligent and beautiful, was very shy and closed herself off from the Russian people.|$|E
