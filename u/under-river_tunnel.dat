50|$|For years, debate raged in Port Adelaide {{about the}} need for a third {{crossing}} over the Port River, in addition to the existing Birkenhead Bridge and Jervois Bridge. Ideas for the crossing included an <b>under-river</b> <b>tunnel,</b> closed bridge, causeway and opening bridge. In the early 2000s the State Government announced the Port River Expressway project, a highway linking Port Adelaide to Adelaide's northern suburbs. The project included a closed bridge across the Port River. However the Port Adelaide community were concerned a closed bridge would cut-off the Port River and block larger boats from accessing the Port's inner harbour. After a strong community campaign, the State Government agreed to build a high-level single-leaf bascule opening bridge, instead of a closed bridge. AbiGroup was awarded the tender to build the bridge in 2005 and construction began the following year. The twin bascule bridges were designed by the New York City based engineering firm, Hardesty & Hanover, LLP. The bridge was expected to be complete in December 2007, but due to delays it was opened for vehicles on 3 August 2008.|$|E

During World War II it contained equipment to detect bombs falling in the River Thames which might require the emergency floodgates on the <b>under-river</b> <b>tunnels</b> to be closed.|$|R
