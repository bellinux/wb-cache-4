5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, {{territorial}} disputes flared <b>up</b> <b>between</b> the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by VijayadityaII(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of BhimaI (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of BhimaI, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.|$|E

5|$|The Falcons lost Super Bowl XXXIII by a {{score of}} 34–19, which earned the Broncos their second {{consecutive}} Super Bowl victory. The game was anticipated as a match <b>up</b> <b>between</b> the Vikings and the Broncos, and the Falcons' presence in the game was noted as an anticlimax. The night before the game, safety Eugene Robinson was arrested for soliciting a prostitute. Although Robinson played in the game, the distraction contributed to a poor performance by the Falcons team, who managed only six points in six drives deep into Denver territory and surrendered a season-high point total.|$|E
5|$|The First Macedonian War saw the Romans {{involved}} {{directly in}} only limited land operations. When the Aetolians sued for peace with Philip, Rome's small expeditionary force, {{with no more}} allies in Greece, was ready to make peace.

Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} the ships was drawn <b>up</b> <b>between</b> 1910 and 1912.

Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply and rate of fire, and loss of fighting capability if one of the turrets was disabled. It was therefore decided to arm the new vessels with eight 38cm guns instead of twelve 30.5cm guns.|$|E

5|$|The {{traffic routing}} {{was not only}} {{influenced}} by {{the location of the}} already existing stations the line was supposed to connect, but also by land availability in the city centre. One of the original drafts, which called for building the line along Leipziger Straße, had to be scrapped because of overly high land prices. The moat of the 17th century Berlin Fortress was filled <b>up</b> <b>between</b> Hackescher Markt and Jannowitzbrücke stations and, since it was public land, was used for building the railway line. This explains some of the curvy sections on the Stadtbahn, especially between Alexanderplatz and Jannowitzbrücke stations.|$|E

5|$|Thus Meher Baba {{offers many}} {{suggestions}} that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation. Many chapters offer {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught <b>up</b> <b>between</b> the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, and point to a way of transcending them.|$|E
