40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the bibliometric methods used for {{research}} evaluation, within the well known field of the bibliometrics which uses mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze the publications distribution patterns, and to explore their impact into the scholarly communities. While the bibliometric methods are used more often in the LIS, bibliometrics offers a wide range of applications in a variety of fields of knowledge. Since the research evaluation requires a double approach: quantitative (bibliometric analysis) and qualitative (peer-review, panel [...] .), the fundamental idea is that the measurement of the scientific knowledge uses both the methods. Though the IF or impact factor is the most well known bibliometric index, {{is not the only one}} suggested by ISI (now Thompson) to refer. In the Open Access world are spreading a wide number of initiatives and projects regarding the “bibliometrics” field, in which are being testing alternative solutions to the traditional IF, for example the Eigenfactor, the Hirsch index and its variations like the g-index, a-index, h-b-index, tools that mark a meaningful change in this fascinating field. While the indicators “author-produced” are the citations, those “reader-produced” are usage data collected through webserver and linkresolver logs. A quantitative bibliometric indicator of new generation is the <b>Usage</b> <b>Factor</b> <b>UF,</b> complementary but non substitutive of traditional or alternative impact factor indicator. It will be necessary to organize the log data collection to share methods to obtain significant analysis. The article goes over some examples of new tools/projects for citational analysis in the Web area, among these the Web Impact Factor (WIF), and for the statistical analysis of logs and data, both bringing back to the new science known as metric of the web or Webometric. Within the OAI framework there are many research projects of the webometric type, involving the intellectual output archivied into the repositories and their impact within the constitutive processes of the scholarly communication. The theory assuming that an open access article in more likely to be read and therefore cited is matter of international debates and object of several studies, aimed to analyze the effects of the open access model and of the download on the citational impact. The article closes with a critical report on some of the most important works investigating the validity of this theory, from the original study of Lawrence, on Nature 2001, to the most recent works, the three postulates of Kurtz, the analysis run in 2006 by the Cornell’s Library staff on the MathSciNet database, the study of Moed which imposed a completely new methodological level with the introduction of the “variable citation window”. Useful tools for the citational bibliometric analysis, on the statistical usage measurement of the researchs for the successful data monitoring, should be in the hands of the research producers, not in the hands of those commercial oligopoles that can influence the investment strategies and the national and international policies for the research...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{rational}} land use according to the land <b>usage</b> <b>factor</b> in the village called Sevnica, more precisely {{in the area of}} Drožanjska road and the village of Log. We were interested in the possibilities of development of these two settlements within the boundaries, that is, how much of empty space there is available, how much space can be built upon or densified on the new vacant building lands, and how much within the existing built-up building lands. We also determined the compensations for change of usage of agricultural land after changes and amendments of Agricultural Land Act. Introductorily, we have presented a rational land use and land <b>usage</b> <b>factors</b> in the law regulations. In our calculations, the land <b>usage</b> <b>factors</b> of areas that are underground are not included because this information was not available. We found that within the area of the building land in question there are building plots with low <b>usage</b> <b>factors</b> (from 0 to 0, 4) and vacant building lands on which it is possible to build and with that it is also possible to densify building sites and thus to use the land more efficiently.

This factor of 10 has become routinely adopted in essentially all risk assessment procedures involving animal model data for extrapolation.

This interspecies UF represents an estimate of the upper 95 % of the population of 95 % prediction intervals (PI) for binary interspecies comparisons within four categories of phylogenetic relatedness (species within genus, genera within family, families within order, orders within class). The 95 % interspecies UFs range from a low of 10 for species within genus up to 65 for orders within class.

40|$|Successful {{implementation}} of Proportional-Integral (PI) control logic for gate automation on irrigation canals has been problematic because of difficulties in tuning the PI controllers {{for a wide}} range of flows. This research shows that successful and relatively simple tuning for upstream controllers can be accomplished if one uses the velocity form of the PI logic. The velocity form must be modified with a newly-developed Universal <b>Factor</b> (<b>UF)</b> concept, which accounts for the nonlinearity of the upstream water level response to gate movement. The UF function is unique for each check structure, and can be determined with a steady state simulation program. The technique was tested with unsteady flow simulations of a new control system for the Highline Canal in Grand Valley, Colo. Extreme flow rate changes were successfully controlled with minimal water level changes upstream of the check structures. Robustness of the Highline Canal control system was enhanced by incorporating the use of long weir walls into the radial gate structure design...|$|R

The alternating stress produced at this node was 621.79 N/mm 2. The cumulative fatigue <b>usage</b> <b>factor</b> for this point was 136.91, indicating that the number of cycles before failure was only 7, 304. This means the failure probability was very high within short period of usage. It could also be observed from the Table 2 that the location of maximum alternating stress due to fluctuating load was different from maximum stress obtained after a static analysis. Thus by performing fatigue analysis, the number of cycles to failure at different stress values was obtained for different fiber orientation angles and stress ratios. A representative set of these data was used for the formulation of the network; that is, during training phase and another set for checking the performance of the network; that is, during testing phase.|$|R

For the effect of over-match on Kn × Κν, dispersion of the Kn × Κν analysis data can be sharply reduced by dividing total stress intensity range, excluding local thermal stresses, Sp-lt by MF.

40|$|Transferring a {{drilling}} rig and its subsea equipment from one location to another by conventional means {{tends to be}} time consuming. With low oil prices and increasing rig rates, operators are looking into making drilling rigs more efficient. This thesis will examine a method called BOP sailing, which may expedite the process of moving {{a drilling}} rig and its subsea equipment from one location to another. It will also {{make sure that the}} BOP sailing method is feasible from a safety and design point of view. The BOP sailing operation is modelled and simulated in the riser analysis software RIFLEX for three riser column lengths: 	 311 m 	 800 m 	 1225 m The riser joints for each of the riser column length have the same diameters and submerged weight per unit length. Weather conditions, current profiles and sailing speeds were defined prior to running the simulations. The results obtained from RIFLEX is then further analyzed by calculating a <b>usage</b> <b>factor,</b> n, based on the combined loading equation from the DNV-OS-F 201 standard. This equation is used to perform riser analysis using tension and bending moments, and the value of the calculated <b>usage</b> <b>factor</b> may not exceed a critical value. The <b>usage</b> <b>factor</b> is calculated at two locations on each of the riser columns for all of the weather conditions. One of the locations is located {{at the top of the}} riser column where the riser column is attached to the drilling vessel. The second location is where the maximum dynamic bending moment takes place. Based on the simulation results, it is found that the value of n increases with an 	Increase in sailing speed 	Increase in wave height 	Increase in riser column length However, the value of n did not exceed the limiting value in any of the simulations.

The objective of this work is to develop a model of a biomass-SOFC system capable of predicting performance under diverse operating conditions. The tubular SOFC technology is selected. The SOFC stack model, equilibrium type based on Gibbs free energy minimisation, is developed using Aspen Plus.

40|$|AbstractThe {{remaining}} life {{assessment of}} components in a {{thermal power plant}} operating in the creep regime has drawn considerable attention. The structural integrity of such critical components is essential for operational safety, reliability and economic plant operation. Boiler headers and high energy pipings operating at high temperatures and pressure are subjected to different degradation mechanisms synergistically. A finite-element analysis based real-time monitoring system for four 210 MW units of a power station of NTPC Ltd. is evaluating creep and fatigue <b>usage</b> <b>factors</b> being accrued in the components. The candidate components under 24 x 7 assessments are super-heater-outlet-header, re-heater outlet and inlet headers, and the piping bends before the control valves of intermediate pressure turbine of each unit. The cyclic stresses with a mean stress at an elevated temperature lead to a damage mechanism due to creep, fatigue and creep fatigue interaction. The process data i. e., steam pressure, steam temperature and steam flows of the components are made available through a local plant information server on a real-time basis. The system evaluates the material temperature, stress and <b>usage</b> <b>factors</b> due to creep, fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction and computes the remaining life fraction in all the components. The application of a real-time monitoring system thus enables the on-line damage assessments followed by surveillance inspection of critical components of a station comprehensively...|$|R
