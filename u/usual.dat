5|$|The most <b>usual</b> call is CaaW!-CaaW!-CaaW!.|$|E
5|$|A mutant {{and expert}} tracker with super agility, reflexes, acute senses and {{enhanced}} strength. In {{preparation for the}} role, Stewart gained 50 pounds and grew his hair much longer than its <b>usual</b> length.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of striker Mario Mandžukić, Torres changed his shirt number from 19 back to his <b>usual</b> 9, which he wore during {{the remainder of the}} 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay {{the healing of}} skin wounds. Aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed {{following}} <b>usual</b> treatment.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{was also}} {{known to the}} Incas and used (along with the <b>usual</b> copper and tin) in a special bronze alloy for knives.|$|E
5|$|Circular colorings can {{be defined}} using homomorphisms into {{circular}} complete graphs, refining the <b>usual</b> notion of colorings.|$|E
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the intertropical convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than <b>usual,</b> {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than <b>usual.</b> Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|FIDE Master (shortened as FM). The <b>usual</b> way for {{a player}} {{to qualify for the}} FIDE Master title is by {{achieving}} a FIDE rating of 2300 or more.|$|E
5|$|For certain {{cities such}} as The Entertainment Quarter in Sydney, the site is paved with asphalt {{specifically}} for Cirque's tents {{in order to provide}} stability that the <b>usual</b> grass covering would not.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{does not}} {{natively}} render at true HD resolution (at least 720 lines of vertical resolution). In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the <b>usual</b> 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the <b>usual</b> one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|His {{last meal}} was the <b>usual</b> prison fare of cheese, bread, olives, and tea, along {{with half a}} bottle of wine.|$|E
5|$|If the {{operation}} also has two-sided inverses and is associative, then the magma is a group. The inverse of x can be denoted by x−1 and follows all the <b>usual</b> rules for exponents.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that hexamethylbenzene contains a carbon atom with six bonds, {{rather than the}} <b>usual</b> four.|$|E
5|$|In India, a Hindi-language {{adaptation}} of The <b>Usual</b> Suspects, titled Chocolate, {{was released in}} 2005.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jones as The Amazing Criswell: A local psychic TV entertainer. Criswell helps Ed with <b>usual</b> {{production}} duties, finding {{investors and}} acting in Ed's films.|$|E
5|$|Macrodontia {{is where}} teeth {{are larger than}} the <b>usual</b> size.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{applications}} of Hilbert spaces exploit {{the fact that}} Hilbert spaces support generalizations of simple geometric concepts like projection and change of basis from their <b>usual</b> finite dimensional setting. In particular, the spectral theory of continuous self-adjoint linear operators on a Hilbert space generalizes the <b>usual</b> spectral decomposition of a matrix, and this often {{plays a major role}} in applications of the theory to other areas of mathematics and physics.|$|E
5|$|Microdontia is a {{condition}} where teeth are smaller than the <b>usual</b> size.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 June, Lambert woke at his <b>usual</b> time and {{appeared}} in good health. As he began to shave, he complained of breathing difficulties. Ten minutes later, he collapsed and died.|$|E
5|$|Records correct as of 1 January 2017. Italics denote {{attendance}} {{record set}} at ground not designated as <b>usual</b> home ground.|$|E
5|$|September 18, 1936- A Category2 {{hurricane}} {{parallels the}} Delmarva Peninsula, causing higher than <b>usual</b> tides at Lewes.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that have}} no long-distance migratory relatives, such as the {{waxwings}} Bombycilla, are effectively moving in response to winter weather {{and the loss of}} their <b>usual</b> winter food, rather than enhanced breeding opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Sugarloaf was the <b>usual</b> cone-form {{in which}} refined sugar was {{produced}} and sold {{until the late}} 19th century. This shape is still in use in Germany (for preparation of Feuerzangenbowle), in Iran and Morocco.|$|E
5|$|The International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE). Marathi or English is the <b>usual</b> {{language}} of instruction.|$|E
5|$|The Kwik-E-Mart is a {{convenience}} store that sells the <b>usual</b> fare at extraordinarily high prices, including the always popular Squishee. The Kwik-E-Mart chain was started somewhere in the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} on the field were so poor that the schools' marching bands declined the <b>usual</b> halftime parade across the field and instead played from the cinder path around the field.|$|E
5|$|The symbols x, t, and a {{represent}} their <b>usual</b> quantities; distance, time, and acceleration respectively.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara spine {{is made up}} of hourglass-shaped amphicoelous vertebrae, concave {{both before}} and behind. This is the <b>usual</b> {{condition}} of fish vertebrae and some amphibians, but is unique to tuatara within the amniotes.|$|E
5|$|The unusually severe disease killed up to 20% {{of those}} infected, {{as opposed to}} the <b>usual</b> flu {{epidemic}} mortality rate of 0.1%.|$|E
5|$|The <b>usual</b> {{synthesis}} of metformin, originally described in 1922, involves the one-pot reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 2-cyanoguanidine over heat.|$|E
5|$|Their <b>usual</b> {{position}} {{was the second}} battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by light troops. They were eventually disbanded with after the Marian reforms of 107 BC.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two reasons}} why {{tropical}} cyclones rarely strike California: sea surface temperatures, and the <b>usual</b> upper level steering winds in the eastern Pacific, with sea surface temperatures being more important.|$|E
5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the <b>usual</b> substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} <b>usual</b> binding-site.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is {{insoluble}} in the <b>usual</b> acids, but is soluble in alkaline {{molten salts}} and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na2CO3, NaNO3, Li3N, Mg3N2, Sr3N2, Ba3N2 or Li3BN2, which are therefore used to etch BN.|$|E
5|$|Extremely rare albino individuals, {{sometimes}} called white panthers, also occur among jaguars, {{as with the}} other big cats. As <b>usual</b> with albinos in the wild, selection keeps the frequency close to the rate of mutation.|$|E
5|$|St. Paul's special {{election}} day was April 25, 1978. Again, {{more than the}} <b>usual</b> number of voters appeared for a {{special election}}, who again, overturned the city's gay rights ordinance by more than two to one.|$|E
