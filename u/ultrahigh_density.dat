40|$|Designing an <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>density</b> linear {{superlattice}} array {{consisting of}} periodic blocks of different semiconductors {{in the strong}} confinement regime via a direct synthetic route remains an unachieved challenge in nanotechnology. We report a general synthesis route for the formulation of a large-area <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>density</b> superlattice array that involves adjoining multiple units of ZnS rods by prolate US particles at the tips. A single one-dimensional wire is 300 - 500 nm long and consists of periodic quantum wells with a barrier width of 5 nm provided by ZnS and a well width of 1 - 2 nm provided by CdS, defining a superlattice structure. The synthesis route allows for tailoring of ultranarrow laserlike emissions (fwhm approximate to 125 meV) originating from strong interwell energy dispersion along with control of the width, pitch, and registry of the superlattice assembly.

Pastures were grazed from May to August in 2014 and 2015 at equal stocking rates within years but varied among years. Stocking densities were 225, 000 kg ha- 1 for <b>ultrahigh</b> stocking <b>density,</b> 7, 000 kg ha- 1 for 4 -PR- 1, and 5, 000 kg ha- 1 for 4 -PR- 2.

Standing dead biomass did not differ among treatments. Utilization was greater in <b>ultrahigh</b> stocking <b>density</b> treatments than 4 -PR- 1, likely due to trampling amounts, which were greatest in <b>ultrahigh</b> stocking <b>density.</b> Remaining herbage was lowest in <b>ultrahigh</b> stocking <b>density</b> treatments.

High data rates are achieved by parallel operation of large twodimensional arrays of cantilevers that can be batch fabricated by silicon-surface micromachining techniques. The very high precision required to navigate the storage medium relative to the array of probes is achieved by microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based x and y actuators.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the idea of}} a photon rocket through the {{complete}} annihilation of matter with antimatter, first proposed by Sänger, is not a utopian scheme as it is widely believed. Its feasibility appears to be possible by the radiative collapse of a relativistic high current pinch discharge in a hydrogen-antihydrogen ambiplasma down to a radius determined by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Through this collapse to <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>densities</b> the proton-antiproton pairs {{in the center of the}} pinch can become the upper GeV laser level for the transition into a coherent gamma ray beam by proton-antiproton annihilation, with the magnetic field of the collapsed pinch discharge absorbing the recoil momentum of the beam and transmitting it to the spacecraft. The gamma ray laser beam is launched as a photon avalanche from one end of the pinch discharge channel. The idea of the photon rocket was first proposed by Sänger [1], but at that time considered to be utopian. Sänger showed if matter could be completely converted into photons, and if a mirror can deflect the photons into one direction, then a rocket driven by the recoil from these photons could reach relativistic velocities where the relativistic time dilation and length contraction must be taken into account, makin...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of data bits in magnetic recording media at <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>densities</b> is compromised by thermal `flips' [...] magnetic spin reversals [...] of nano-sized spin domains, which erase the stored information. Media that are magnetized {{perpendicular to the}} plane of the film, such as ultrathin cobalt films or multilayered structures, are more stable against thermal self-erasure than conventional memory devices. In this context, magneto-optical memories seem particularly promising for ultrahigh-density recording on portable disks, and bit densities of ∼ 100 Gbit inch^- 2 have been demonstrated using recent advances in the bit writing and reading techniques. But the roughness and mobility of the magnetic domain walls prevents closer packing of the magnetic bits, and therefore presents a challenge to reaching even higher bit densities. Here we report that the strain imposed by a linear defect in a magnetic thin film can smooth rough domain walls over regions hundreds of micrometers in size, and halt their motion. A scaling analysis of this process, based on the generic physics of disorder-controlled elastic lines, points to a simple way by which magnetic media might be prepared that can store data at densities in excess of 1 Tbit inch^- 2.
