30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a MG energy {{management}} model. The main contribution of the paper is an easy formulation and solution {{of the problem in}} the presence of incentive responsive loads. Two objectives are formulated to minimize the operational cost and pollutants emission from the MG sources. Initially a non-linear problem is formulated and later it is converted into a linear problem with an assumption and without losing any accuracy of the result. A mixed integer linear programing (MILP) technique is applied for the solution of the converted problem. Using GAMS software, the solution is achieved in very less time as compared to the other solution tools, which is also an important factor of our paper. Use of DR program during the generation scheduling helps in the fulfillment of the gaps created by the uncertainties of the wind turbine (WT) and PV sources, which is also an improving step toward the <b>uncertainties</b> <b>management</b> of the RERs.|$|R

40|$|Dealing with <b>uncertainties</b> {{in water}} <b>management</b> is an {{important}} issue and is one which will only increase in light of global changes, particularly climate change. So far, <b>uncertainties</b> in water <b>management</b> have mostly been assessed from a scientific point of view, and in quantitative terms. In this paper, we focus on the perspectives from water management practice, adopting a qualitative approach. We consider it important to know how uncertainties are framed in water management practice in order to develop practice relevant strategies for dealing with uncertainties. Framing refers to how people make sense of the world. With the aim of identifying what are important parameters for the framing of <b>uncertainties</b> in water <b>management</b> practice, in this paper we analyze uncertainty situations described by decision-makers in water management. The analysis builds on a series of ¿Uncertainty Dialogues¿ carried out within the NeWater project with water managers in the Rhine, Elbe and Guadiana basins in 2006. During these dialogues, representatives of these river basins were asked what uncertainties they encountered in their professional work life and how they confronted them. Analysing these dialogues we identified several important parameters of how uncertainties get framed. Our assumption is that making framing of uncertainty explicit for water managers will allow for better dealing with the respective uncertainty situations.

50|$|Motivation for post-estimate fusion {{is often}} {{consideration}} of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>management.</b> That is, the post-estimate fusion helps {{to narrow the}} uncertainty intervals of data-driven or model-based approaches. At the same time, the accuracy improves. The underlying notion is that multiple information sources can help to improve performance of an estimator. This principle has been successfully applied {{within the context of}} classifier fusion where the output of multiple classifiers is used to arrive at a better result than any classifier alone. Within the context of prognostics, fusion can be accomplished by employing quality assessments that are assigned to the individual estimators based on a variety of inputs, for example heuristics, a priori known performance, prediction horizon, or robustness of the prediction.|$|E
