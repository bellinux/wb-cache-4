5|$|Since {{wind speed}} is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy {{production}} is never {{as much as}} the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 15–50%; values at the <b>upper</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements.|$|E
5|$|As the Super League war {{built up}} in the mid-1990s, the Roosters {{recruited}} high-profile coach Phil Gould and star five-eighth Brad Fittler, both from the Penrith Panthers. This helped to quickly send the Roosters back to the <b>upper</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the ladder. Fittler's presence proved invaluable; during his reign, the Roosters competed in four grand finals in five years. In 2002, the club captured its 12th premiership — the first in 27 years — defeating minor premiers the New Zealand Warriors 30–8 in the 2002 NRL grand final.|$|E
5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at the <b>upper</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} a method for growing carbon fiber from single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) molecular arrays. In one embodiment, the present invention involves a macroscopic molecular array of at least about 106 tubular carbon molecules in generally parallel orientation and having substantially similar lengths {{in the range of}} from about 50 to about 500 nanometers. The hemispheric fullerene cap is removed from the <b>upper</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the tubular carbon molecules in the array. The <b>upper</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the tubular carbon molecules in the array are then contacted with a catalytic metal. A gaseous source of carbon is supplied to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the array while localized energy is applied to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the array in order to heat the end to a temperature in the range of about 500 ° C. to about 1300 ° C.

5|$|Britain's hold on Gibraltar was {{reconfirmed}} in 1729 by the Treaty of Seville, which satisfied neither side; the Spanish {{had wanted}} Gibraltar returned, while the British disliked {{the continuation of}} the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across the <b>upper</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as La Línea de Contravalación (the Lines of Contravallation), were later to give their name to the modern town of La Línea de la Concepción. Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|The Qum-Darya bow was {{superseded}} in {{the modern}} area of Hungary by an 'Avar' type, with more and differently-shaped laths. The grip laths stayed essentially the same except that a fourth piece was sometimes glued {{to the back of}} the handle enclosing it with bone on all four faces. The belly lath was often parallel-sided with splayed ends. The siyah laths became much wider in profile above the nock and less rounded, giving a bulbous aspect. The nock was often further away from the <b>upper</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the siyah than on Qum-Darya type examples. Additional laths were usually added to the belly and back of the siyah thus enclosing both ends of the stave on four faces. This made a total of up to 12 laths on an asymmetrical bow with stiff, set back handle. Examples measured in situ suggest bow lengths of 120–140cm. When unstrung the siyahs reversed sharply forward at an angle of 50-60 degrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column {{was composed of}} nine cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus, an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer than in most other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times {{the length of the}}ir width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad <b>upper</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like Plateosaurus, it had five digits on each hand and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest finger in the hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look.|$|E

5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} <b>upper</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter {{than the rest of the}} upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the <b>upper</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
