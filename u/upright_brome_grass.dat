5000|$|The site is ancient {{woodland}} {{on heavy}} clay soils {{which are often}} waterlogged. The invertebrate fauna are described by Natural England as [...] "exceptional", including over thirty butterfly species, such as the nationally rare black hairstreak and the scarce wood white and purple emperor. The woodland is wet ash and maple, with other trees including elm and hornbeam. The understorey has species indicative of long tree cover, such as Poa nemoralis and wood millet. There are many common breeding birds and in the ponds and ditches there are breeding smooth and great crested newts. The railway cutting is dominated by <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bromus erectus, {{commonly}} known as erect <b>brome,</b> <b>upright</b> <b>brome</b> or meadow brome, is a dense, course, tufted perennial grass. It can grow to 120 cm. Like many <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> the plant is hairy.|$|R

40|$|Included {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of the Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument are a number of noxious weeds for which the BLM mandates control. In addition to listed weeds are nonnative <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> [Bromus tectorum and Bromus rubens), which can potentially convert native ecosystems to biologically impoverished annual grasslands. Although <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> occur virtually throughout the new Monument, they remain at relatively low biomass, with denser stands patchily distributed in former disturbances due to agriculture, road development, and fire. We discuss case studies indicating that this type of distribution often precedes habitat conversion by <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> and we review various investigations related to how and why coverage expands. Measures should be taken to monitor the spread of <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> and management strategies related to road development, tourism, fire, grazing, and habitat alteration and restoration should be consistent with the need to contain the distributions and abundances of these destructive weeds...|$|R

40|$|Fine fuels from non-native, annual <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> have {{overcome}} native plants {{across much of}} Zion Canyon in Zion National Park. This invasion threatens the single road that provides access into—and escape from—the canyon, creating a threat to human life should a large wildfi re occur there. In addition, native riparian plant communities in Zion Canyon have been degraded by non-native plants, and recurrent fire caused by annual grasses could further reduce native plant diversity. Results from {{this study suggest that}} burning can have a more lasting effect than annual mowing in reducing fine fuel loads, extending the period between repeated maintenance treatments. When burning is coupled with fall herbicide application, added control can extend the maintenance interval even further through reduction of <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> density...|$|R
