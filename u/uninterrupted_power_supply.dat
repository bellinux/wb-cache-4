The competence of medical laboratory technicians was improved in five Ethiopian universities. In-service training was too disruptive to normal services which already suffered from staff shortages. The Centre for Disease Control Ethiopia and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) together with university faculty assessed medical laboratory education. The curriculum was revised and standardized to include practical training which formed part of the final assessment. Faculty staff were trained in grant writing and quality management systems.

With distributed energy resources (DERs) accessing it in high density, the distribution network transforms from passive to active with bi-directional flow. According {{to the definition of}} CIGRE [1], an active distribution network (ADN) utilizes DERs and flexible grid topology to manage power flows. It has been estimated that 80 % of the supply interruptions faced by customers are because of failures that occur in the distribution network. In an ADN, the loads no longer have only a single <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> path because of the introduction of DERs, such as distributed generation (DG), batteries (BEs), and plugged-in electric vehicles (EVs). The increasing penetration levels of DERs together with suitable control strategies are making it possible for an ADN to meet higher reliability requirements and improve <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> security [2, 3, 4].

(Electrical And Electronic Engineering) DC to AC {{converters}} {{are used}} daily in industry, shipping and aviation as <b>power</b> [...] <b>supplies,</b> standby <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> or <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> <b>Power</b> levels vary {{from a few}} watts to several megawatts. This thesis investigates a composite converter with a high frequency link as such a DC to AC converter. There are two basic building blocks, the primary inverter as a push-pull inverter and the secondary converter as a cyclo-converter. A existing 2. 5 kVA system with bipolar transistors in the primary inverter and asymmetrical thyristors in the secondary converter is investigated. In the primary inverter, regenerative snubbers are used to minimise switching losses. A second 2. 5 kVA system with mosfets in the primary inverter and IGBT's in the secondary is developed. Switching losses in the primary inverter are minimised by including a resonant circuit concisting of a non-linear inductor and linear capacitor. This resonant circuit in the primary inverter, was originally simmulated by a PSPICE simmulation program, after which it was build up experimentally. The simmulated results and experimental results coincided, {{and development of the}} secondary converter started. The switches in the secondary had to comply to two conditions viz, low conducting lossses and the ability to switch at switching frequencies higher than 20 kHz. IGBT's were consequently chosen and were implemented with the necessary gate drive circuits. With the higher switching frequency of 25 kHz to the 5 kHz of the first system, the ripple on the load current was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the construction of the composite converter with the gate drive switches was easy and compact, and the total cost of developing such a converter were reduced...|$|R

The research presented here investigates a health monitoring technology that may give an early indication of degraded material properties in a concentric ring composite flywheel. The existence of degraded material properties is manifested as a change in mass eccentricity due to asymmetric growth of the outermost flywheel ring. A test rig concept to investigate the technology is developed in detail using a systems engineering design process. Successful detection of the change in mass eccentricity was verified analytically through dynamic modeling of the flywheel rotor and magnetic suspension system. During steady state operation detection was determined to be feasible via measurements of the magnetic bearing currents and shaft position provided by the magnetic suspension feedback sensors.

Power quality declines due to many factors. Some of which includes lightning, switching transients, brown outs, sharing of neutrals in large infrastructural areas. It also causes harmonic distortions. Poor power quality leads to large economical loses. the loses are in the range of several billion dollars. Poor Power quality affects the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> system and cause damage to the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> systems and cause more economical loss to the consumers. Low power quality mainly affects the domestically appliances like personal computer, inductive motors and commercial appliances like aircraft controlling systems, rectifiers, etc. Power quality monitoring is the mechanism widely used to monitor the <b>power</b> over <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> systems and made the record of fluctuations in the waveform, voltage supply, harmonic distortion, etc. Harmonic distortions widely play role in power quality and increase frequencies of harmonics will generate great destruction to the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> systems.

40|$|The {{modern age}} of power {{electronics}} {{began with the}} introduction of thyristors in the late 1950 s. Now there are several types of power devices available for high-power and high-frequency applications. The most notable power devices are gate turn-off thyristors, power Darlington transistors, power MOSFETs, and insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). Power semiconductor devices are the most important functional elements in all power conversion applications. The power devices are mainly used as switches to convert power from one form to another. They are used in motor control systems, <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> high-voltage dc transmission, <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> induction heating, and in many other power conversion applications. A review of the basic characteristics of these power devices is presented in this section. Thyristor and Triac The thyristor, also called a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR), is basically a four-layer three-junction pnpn device. It has three terminals: anode, cathode, and gate. The device is turned on by applying a short pulse across the gate and cathode. Once the device turns on, the gate loses its control to turn off the device. The turn-off is achieved by applying a reverse voltage across the anode and cathode. The thyristor symbol and its volt-ampere characteristics are shown in Fig. 30. 1. There are basically two classifications of thyristors: converter grade and inverter grade. The difference between a converter-grade and an inverter-grade thyristor is the low turn-of...|$|R
