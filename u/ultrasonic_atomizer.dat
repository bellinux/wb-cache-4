40|$|Consolidation of {{contemporary}} paintings is a practice {{as complicated as}} delicate mainly due {{to the possibility of}} modifying the works' finishing. Conservators sometimes find limits facing these troubles because of the difficulty of applying adhesives with a paintbrush. The authors, in their attempt to give a practical and useful solution to this problem, have experimented in this work with different adhesives which are adequate for consolidation {{of contemporary}} paintings. They also have evaluated different application methods, and all of these tests were developed on poorly-bounded paintings. The study on combined methods of application was undertaken in order to compare the use of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> with a low-pressure micro-table and an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> without a low-pressure micro-table. In this occasion, the study just wanted to analyze the deviation of colorimetric and gloss parameters for detecting if surfaces suffer aesthetic variations which may interfere with the works' concept. Conclusions finally show {{that it is possible to}} heavily consolidate poorly-bounded paintings by using an aqueous adhesive in a low concentration and an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer.</b> The combination with a low-pressure micro-table will depend on the necessity of a punctual or general action of the adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel, patent-pending {{approach}} to the application of wood resins based on an ultrasonic principle was developed in this study. Liquid polymeric methane diphenyl–diisocyanate (pMDI) resin was successfully atomized using a bench-scale 25 kHz <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer.</b> The optimal average sizes of the resin droplets generated at a flow rate of 0. 7 mL/min and power input of 5. 0 J/s were about 90 mm.

Particle size distributions were measured in non-reacting flow using a Malvern 2600 HSD Laser Diffraction Particle Sizer. A sub-scale ramjet combustor was designed and fabricated which utilized a sudden expansion inlet dump together with inlet air swirl for flame stabilization. An airblast atomizer produced sufficiently small particles for good combustion, but at the cost of a high pressure drop across the atomizer, making it impractical for use in a slurry fueled ramjet.

40|$|The fine {{atomization}} of liquids {{by means}} of low-frequency <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizers</b> (about 50 kHz) results from unstable surface waves generated on the free surface of a thin liquid film, This thin liquid film develops as the liquid spreads fast over the atomizing surface of the atomizer.

Each particular application (air conditioning, drugs delivery, combustion [...] ) has specific requirements {{in terms of}} mean droplet size, spray shape, spray velocity and liquid flow rate. Forcing frequency and liquid properties are the main factors affecting mean droplet diameter and droplets size distribution. Physical and statistical modeling is applied to predict spray characteristics or to design specific atomizers for required droplets dimensions.

Numerical simulations of the gas flow field were done in order to establish effects of the cavity on flow development {{both inside and outside the}} air nozzles. PDPA measurements were made of gas velocity and turbulence intensity, droplet mean and fluctuating velocity, and droplet size across planes at various distances downstream. High speed imaging is used in the flow region near the orifice exit where recirculation zones are generated and there is concern about metal droplet deposition on atomizer surfaces. Shadowgraphy show presence of shock waves and cells in the emerging gas jets. It was found that the Hartman cavity has little effect on droplet sizes generated; also little effect on spray development. The rectangular slit orifices for the 2 gas jets and the liquid jet generate a spray, after impingement, which is somewhat rectangular in cross section. As the spray develops downstream, it changes shape under influence of entrainment from the gas surrounding the spray. After a distance of 254 mm from nozzle exit, width and breadth of the jet are equal but significant shape change occur further downstream.

Herein we demonstrate a composite microsphere formulation, composed of mesoporous silica spheres (MPS) and poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), enables the controlled delivery of a prime-boost vaccine via the encapsulation of plasmid DNA (pDNA) and protein in different compartments. Method with modified dual-concentric-feeding needles attached to a 40 kHz <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> was studied. These needles focus the flow of two different solutions, which passed through the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer.</b> The process synthesis parameters, which {{are important to the}} scale-up of composite microspheres, were also studied. These parameters include polymer concentration, feed flowrate, and volumetric ratio of polymer and pDNA-PEI/MPS-BSA. This fabrication technique produced composite microspheres with mean D[4, 3] ranging from 6 to 34 μm, depending upon the microsphere preparation. The resultant physical morphology of composite microspheres was largely influenced by the volumetric ratio of pDNA-PEI/MPS-BSA to polymer, and this was due to the precipitation of MPS at the surface of the microspheres. The encapsulation efficiencies were predominantly in the range of 93 - 98 % for pDNA and 46 - 68 % for MPS. In the in vitro studies, the pDNA and protein showed different release kinetics in a 40 day time frame.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this Ph. D. thesis {{research}} is a new piezoelectrically driven micromachined <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> concept that utilizes fluid cavity resonances in the 15 MHz range along with acoustic wave focusing to generate the pressure gradient required for droplet or jet ejection. This ejection technique exhibits low-power operation while addressing the key challenges associated with other atomization technologies including production of sub- 5 um diameter droplets, low-temperature operation, the capacity to scale throughput up or down, and simple, low-cost fabrication. This thesis research includes device development and fabrication as well as experimental characterization and theoretical modeling of the acoustics and fluid mechanics underlying device operation. The main goal is to {{gain an understanding of}} the fundamental physics of these processes in order to achieve optimal design and controlled operation of the atomizer. Simulations of the acoustic response of the system for various device geometries and different ejection fluid properties predict the resonant frequencies of the device and confirm that pressure field focusing occurs. High-spatial-resolution stroboscopic visualization of fluid ejection under various operating conditions is used to investigate whether the proposed atomizer is capable of operating in either the discrete-droplet or continuous-jet mode. The results of the visualization experiments combined with a scaling analysis provide a basic understanding of the physics governing the ejection process and allow for the establishment of simple scaling laws that prescribe the mode (e. g., discrete-droplet vs. continuous-jet) of ejection. In parallel, a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the fluid interface evolution and droplet formation and transport during the ejection process provides in-depth insight into the physics of the ejection process and determines the limits of validity of the scaling laws. These characterization efforts performed in concert with device development lead to the optimal device design.

40|$|A {{fountain}} type <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> {{was chosen}} to be a possible device {{to be used to}} assist in the alleviation of global warming. Atomization of seawater by an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> will enhance more cloud condensation nuclei; as a result, more UV radiation will be reflected back into the space. There are two crucial spray characters: droplet size and the number of droplets. The droplet size needs to be in a certain size range, so that they can stay in the atmosphere. The number of droplets needs to be as high as possible; the more cloud nuclei, the more UV radiation is reflected. The characteristics of sprays are affected by many parameters: liquid properties and the atomizer design. In this study, we characterized two different atomizers: one with a fixed frequency atomizer at 1. 72 MHz and one with adjustable frequency and voltage atomizer with a calculated resonant frequency of 2. 24 MHz. In addition for the fixed atomizer, different liquid media: tap water (20 ° C), hot water (46 ° C), cold water (14 ° C) and salt waters with different percents salinity (2 % - 3. 5 % by volume), were studied. A Phase Doppler Anemometer was used to measure the characteristics of sprays: droplet velocity, droplet size and number of droplets in a required size range. It was found that the droplet velocity is barely affected by the liquid properties and liquid depth except for the hot water. The relatively high temperature liquid appears to alter the characteristics of the piezo disk; in addition, the inconsistent temperature could vary the characteristics of the spray. The droplet size is strongly dependent on liquid properties and frequency of vibration. The number of droplets is obviously affected by liquid properties and atomizer designs; there is not yet a known correlation between the number of droplets and other parameters. A theoretical study was undertaken in order to compare predicted acoustic properties of acoustic waves with the measured number of droplets generated. The mathematical model was constructed based on applying boundary conditions to a general 2 - Dimensional wave equation in cylindrical coordinates. The predicted results satisfy the boundary conditions very well. Since we deal with high frequency acoustic waves, the number of wave modes used in the prediction is significant. It is important to be ensure that all the cut-on wave modes are included otherwise the predicted results will not be very accurate. The more modes that are included, the more computer storage is required; therefore, the number of modes need to be enough to obtain accurate result but not too many to be over the limit of computer storage. The high number of modes used also decreases computer speed, increasing the running time. The mathematical model was used to predict acoustic properties. It was found that the predicted maximum acoustic pressure inside the central small region, where the disk is located, has the best correlation with the number of droplets for all liquid media and all operating conditions. The mathematical model can only predict which operating condition and atomizer design will provide the maximum acoustic pressure. As a result, we can optimize the fountain type <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> in order to obtain the best result, suiting each application applied. If the geometry is changed, the model is also required to be re-written so that it will predict accurate results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The characteristics of the acoustic field generated by HRT are investigated. Results show that the acoustic frequency decreases with the increase of the resonator length, the sound pressure level (SPL) increases with the increase of nozzle pressure ratio (NPR), and it is also noted that increasing resonator length can cause SPL to decrease, which has rarely been reported in published literature. Further theoretical analysis reveals that the resonance frequency of a droplet has several modes, and when the acoustic frequency equals the droplet’s frequency, heightened droplet responses are observed with the maximum amplitude of the shape oscillation. The experimental results for different resonator cavity lengths, nozzle pressure ratios and droplet diameters confirm the non-linear nature of this problem, and this conclusion is in good agreement with theoretical analysis.

These microcapsules had smooth surfaces and limited surface defects. The in vitro release of lysozyme in a 35 -day period showed a continuous release to 50. 9 % of encapsulated lysozyme with a moderate high burst release of 25. 9 %. The released lysozyme kept its integrity and activity. In order to further decrease lysozyme burst release, the cryoprotectants, such as sugars, were screened as the freeze drying media. The burst release of these microcapsules was reduced but a slowed-down release profile in a 14 -days period was also observed. Finally, several polymer-organic solvent systems were screened as the candidates of protein microencapsulation. Polystyrene-chloroform system showed the best ability to encapsulate aqueous solution...|$|E
30|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are already being}} used in the mass production of structural components in the automotive industry, particularly at the BMW Group. Adhesive bonding is generally considered to be the best technique for joining CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced plastic) light-weight structures. The conventional NDT (nondestructive testing) methods currently being used focus on the detection of material defects, e.g. debonding. These methods give little information about the surface properties or bond quality. A new ENDT (extended nondestructive testing) method is the BonNDTinspect system, based on a patent held by the Fraunhofer IFAM. An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> nozzle creates a water-aerosol and the small water droplets are sprayed onto the surface. Depending on the surface properties (surface energy or contamination state), the aerosol will form wide or narrow drops on the surface. We determined a test for certain contaminations, including release agents, oil, and fingerprints, the detection of which is critical to ensure the performance of adhesively joined CFRP structures. The BonNDTinspect system is an inline-capable NDT technique that is suitable for distinguishing surface states for adhesive bonding of CFRP. We verify this statement with destructive tests, including the single-lap shear test. It was found by using an extension of the evaluation criteria {{that it is possible to}} detect contamination such as water-soluble release agent, CFRP dust and fingerprints. The investigated contamination with hydraulic oil allows only a clear differentiation between cleaned and contaminated. A contamination with corundum is not detectable by the BonNDTinspect system alone.|$|E
40|$|Mercury was {{identified}} as a hazardous air pollutant in Title 3 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. It has been singled out for particular scrutiny because of its behavior in the environment (bioaccumulation) and its potential for deleterious effects on humans and wildlife. After studying the sources of mercury in the environment, the US Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that coal-fired boilers generate a significant fraction of the total anthropogenic emissions. Therefore, the agency is currently considering whether to impose mercury control requirements on coal-fired boilers in the electric utility industry. However, the costs for potential control measures (such as sorbent injection) can be extremely high. Mercury removal with chloric acid solutions was tested. The presence of NO increased Hg removal. It appeared that both gas-gas and gas-liquids reactions were operating, with the gas-phase reactions involving NO becoming increasingly important as the solute concentration was raised. From these studies, it was concluded that even higher Hg{sup 0 } removals could be obtained if more of the reagent was made available for reaction in the gas phase. For this reason (and also to simulate a more real-world duct-injection process) a new series of tests was initiated in which an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> was used to inject small droplets of the oxidizing solutions into a flowing gas stream containing Hg{sup 0 } vapors and other typical flue-gas components. The results of those tests are described in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop a new {{microencapsulation}} technique that could address traditional difficulties that have been encountered during the microencapsulation of protein drugs. Reservoir-type microcapsules were produced using a dual microdispenser system or a coaxial <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer,</b> based on midair collision between component materials followed by interfacial phase separation of a polymeric membrane. It was found that the reported process had no negative effect on functional integrity of the encapsulated model protein, lysozyme. Furthermore, the microcapsules released the encapsulated lysozyme at near zero-order for an extended period when tested without drying. The reported example demonstrated a complete release of intact lysozyme over 50 days. It is believed that these results are additive effects of following features of the new microencapsulation method. First, the method minimizes the exposure of encapsulated proteins to a large water/organic solvent interfacial area, in which the proteins can easily accumulate and be denatured. Second, the method utilizes only a minimal energy for producing microdrops and does not generate damagingly strong mechanical stresses. Third, the contact between the encapsulated drugs and the hydrophobic polymer and their degradation products is minimal in the reservoir-type microcapsules, which could otherwise cause extensive denaturation of the encapsulated proteins. The new method provides a simple and efficient way of making protein-loaded microcapsules, which will lead to commercially viable products in the near future. To this end, post-encapsulation processes such as collection and drying of microcapsules are yet to be improved. ...|$|E

In this work nucleation and spinel phase development in the Zn-Cr-O system were investigated {{from the viewpoint of}} structural and morphological phenomena occurred during nanophased particle synthesis through aerosol reaction. The aerosol was generated from nitrates precursor solution using <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>atomizer</b> operated at 1. 7 MHz. The influence of different decomposition schedules on the particle chemical content and morphology was determined by adjusting the processing parameters (aerosol droplet density 3. 9 x 106 droplets/cm 3, droplet velocity 0. 035 m/s, max. temperature 900 oC and residence times 3, 6 and 9 s). A composite particle structure comprised of primary crystallites sized from 22 to 44 nm is revealed by SEM and TEM analysis. XRD structural analysis (crystallite size, microstrains, unit cell and ionic occupancies) is performed in accordance with procedure based on Koalariet-Xfit program. A certain degree of non-stochiometry is characteristic for all powders. Homogenous distribution of the constituting elements and Zn/Cr ratio of about 0. 68 are proved by EDAX mapping analysis in 470 nm sized as-prepared particles. After additional treatment at 1000 oC octahedral crystals form with the (111) surface dominat. Evaluated spinel non-stochiometry (Zn/Cr= 0. 58) {{is a result of the}} ZnO dissolving (1. 9 %wt) in the stoichiometric ZnCr 2 O 4. Determination of the way by which the ZnO is incorporated into the spinel lattice is performed according to the procedure based on calculation of both formation and attachment energies...|$|E
