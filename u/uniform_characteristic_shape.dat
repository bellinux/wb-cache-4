50|$|The Hamamelidaceae are {{distinguishable}} {{from other}} {{families in the}} Saxifragales due to the range of floral characteristics that are generally uniform though all genera. <b>Uniform</b> <b>characteristics</b> include stipules borne on stems with leaves often 2-ranked.

The area is located in an elevated terrain, at about 101 m (304 ft), which permits the natural draining of waters on all four points of the compass. As a result, flooding is rare.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple, flexible, and efficient algorithm for constructing a possibly non-convex, simple polygon {{that characterizes the}} shape of a set of input points in the plane, termed a <b>characteristic</b> <b>shape.</b> The algorithm is based on the Delaunay triangulation of the points. The shape produced by the algorithm is controlled by a single normalized parameter, which can be used to generate a finite, totally ordered family of related <b>characteristic</b> <b>shapes,</b> varying between the convex hull at one extreme and a uniquely defined shape with minimum area. An optimal O(n log n) algorithm for computing the <b>shapes</b> is presented. <b>Characteristic</b> <b>shapes</b> possess a number of desirable properties, and the paper includes an empirical investigation of the shapes produced by the algorithm. This investigation provides experimental evidence that with appropriate parameterization the algorithm is able to accurately characterize {{the shape of a}} wide range of different point distributions and densities. The experiments detail the effects of changing parameter values and provide an indication of some "good'' parameter values to use in certain circumstances. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{alternative ways}} to develop efficient force and position (“touch”) sensors for new musical interfaces. We have studied three basic types of conductive materials – complex, composite, and porous – and evaluated {{the possibilities of}} using each to develop inexpensive and reliable touch sensors. We have built several sensor prototypes with varying electrical <b>characteristics,</b> <b>shapes</b> and sizes, and have evaluated {{them in terms of}} their response to applied forces and positions. Our goal is to provide digital musical instrument designers with straightfoward means to circumvent the limited offering of commercial sensors, which are restricted to a few technologies with predefined electrical <b>characteristics,</b> <b>shapes</b> and sizes.
