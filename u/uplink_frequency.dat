50|$|Only one 70-cm {{downlink}} transmitter {{is active}} {{at any one}} time. Due to performance degradation of the primary transmitter on 437.026 MHz, the secondary transmitter on 437.051 MHz is being used at the current time. All Microsats transmit using several watts of transmitter power making their signals easily received on the Earth below. AMSAT-OSCAR-16 accepts 1200 bit/s 3.5 kHz deviation Manchester encoded FSK on any of its <b>uplink</b> <b>frequencies.</b> It transmits using 1200 bit/s binary phase shift keying (BPSK), a very robust binary modulation scheme.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the high}} orbital speed of the amateur-satellites, the uplink and {{downlink}} frequencies will vary {{during the course of}} a satellite pass. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect. While the satellite is moving towards the ground station, the downlink frequency will appear to be higher than normal and therefore, the receiver frequency at the ground station must be adjusted higher in order to continue receiving the satellite. The satellite in turn, will be receiving the uplink signal at a higher frequency than normal so the ground station's transmitted <b>uplink</b> <b>frequency</b> must be lower in order to be received by the satellite. After the satellite passes overhead and begins to move away, this process reverses itself. The downlink frequency will appear lower and the <b>uplink</b> <b>frequency</b> will need to be adjusted higher. The following mathematical formulas relate the doppler shift to the velocity of the satellite.|$|E

The satellite dish at each location must be precisely pointed to avoid interference with other satellites. At each VSAT site the <b>uplink</b> <b>frequency,</b> bit rate and power must be accurately set, under control of the service provider hub.|$|E

5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{transponder}} {{can be one}} of {{two types}} of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a [...] satellite transponder receives signals over a range of <b>uplink</b> <b>frequencies</b> usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals.|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS) {{developed}} by NASA has demonstrated the breakthrough technologies of Ka-band transmission, spot-beam antennas, and onboard processing. These technologies have enabled {{the development of}} very small and ultrasmall aperture terminals (VSAT s and USAT's), which have capabilities greater than have been possible with conventional satellite technologies. The ACTS High Speed VSAT (HS VSAT) is an effort at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field to experimentally demonstrate the maximum user throughput data rate {{that can be achieved}} using the technologies developed and implemented on ACTS. This was done by operating the system <b>uplinks</b> as <b>frequency</b> division multiple access (FDMA), essentially assigning all available time division multiple access (TDMA) time slots to a single user on each of two <b>uplink</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Preliminary results show that, using a 1. 2 -m antenna in this mode, the High Speed VSAT can achieve between 22 and 24 Mbps of the 27. 5 Mbps burst rate, for a throughput efficiency of 80 to 88 percent...|$|R
5000|$|The AWS band uses {{microwave}} frequencies in two segments: from 1710 to 1755 MHz for uplink, and from 2110 to 2155 MHz for downlink. [...] The service {{is intended to}} be used by mobile devices such as wireless phones for mobile voice, data, and messaging services. Most manufacturers of smartphone mobile handsets provide versions of their phones that include radios that can communicate using the AWS spectrum. Since for downlink AWS uses a subset of UMTS frequency band I (2100 MHz) some UMTS2100 capable handsets do detect AWS networks but cannot register on them due to the difference in <b>uplink</b> <b>frequencies</b> (1710-1755 MHz for AWS vs. 1920-1980 MHz for UMTS2100).|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency-division}} {{multiple access}} (FDMA) channel-access scheme {{is based on}} the frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme, which provides different frequency bands to different data-streams. In the FDMA case, the data streams are allocated to different nodes or devices. An example of FDMA systems were the first-generation (1G) cell-phone systems, where each phone call was assigned to a specific <b>uplink</b> <b>frequency</b> channel, and another downlink frequency channel. Each message signal (each phone call) is modulated on a specific carrier frequency.|$|E
50|$|Transponder ranging {{turn-around}} {{had to be}} manually enabled by an astronaut. It consumed an appreciable {{fraction of}} the downlink capacity {{and it was only}} needed occasionally, typically during handover from one ground station to the next. After the new uplink station achieved a 2-way coherent transponder lock in which the spacecraft generated its carrier at 240/221 times the received <b>uplink</b> <b>frequency,</b> the new ground station ranged the spacecraft. Then the ranging signal was turned off and the range measurement was continually updated by Doppler velocity measurements.|$|E
50|$|Each Apollo {{spacecraft}} {{was assigned}} a frequency pair. For certain phase modulation (PM) downlinks, the uplink to downlink frequency ratio was exactly 221/240. The ALSEP lunar surface experiments shared a common uplink and did not,insofar as is known, implement a coherent transponder. (The passive laser retroreflectors left by the Apollo 11, 14 and 15 missions provide much greater accuracy, and have far outlived the active electronics in the other ALSEP experiments.) The Lunar Communications Relay Unit (LCRU) on the Lunar Rover had its own downlink frequency (to avoid interference with the LM) but shared the LM's <b>uplink</b> <b>frequency</b> as it did not implement a coherent transponder. To keep the VHF transmitters on the LM and LCRU from both trying to relay uplink voice and interfering with each other, separate voice subcarriers were used on the common S-band uplink: 30 kHz for the LM and 124 kHz for the LCRU.|$|E

50|$|Galaxy 15, {{like many}} {{communications}} satellites rebroadcasts the signals it receives on its uplink frequencies to the corresponding C-Band downlink frequencies. Therefore, {{the potential for}} interference only existed when Galaxy 15 drifted into the line of sight of a ground uplink segment intended for another communications satellite operating on the same <b>uplink</b> <b>frequency</b> range {{in the path of}} Galaxy 15. The magnitude of the interference risk depended on a large number of variables, including the size of the uplink antenna used (the larger the antenna, the lower the risk to hit Galaxy 15), the location of the uplink and whether inside the Galaxy 15 footprint, and the onboard gain capabilities of the satellite proximate to Galaxy 15. Satellite operators devised a variety of strategies to mitigate the potential interference to their birds' downlink transmissions including, temporarily transferring uplinks to larger uplink antenna, deliberately off-pointing uplink antennas to put Galaxy 15 into the null, maneuvering the satellite being passed to maintain a minimum angular separation, increasing the satellite's gain sensitivity settings allowing a lowering of the uplink power needed and latterly moving the uplink to a location where Galaxy 15 had no uplink coverage (i.e. Hawaii). These techniques were successfully able to reduce, mitigate and minimize for commercial satellite operations most interference potential during a Galaxy 15 fly by. Smaller sized stationary receive only sites, like those used by amateurs or SMATV which have a wider beam width reception potential, may have experienced interference, while for the most part commercial operators experienced no adverse effects from Galaxy 15 during its failure period thanks to the execution of the mitigation practices devised {{in the wake of the}} crisis.|$|E

In addition, the plate must be totally reflective for S-band frequencies. A dielectrically loaded dichroic plate is described that {{was developed to meet}} this need.
