50|$|Owing {{to their}} large {{magnetic}} moment (µ2 = 63µB2) Gd3+ ions {{are the most}} popular MRI contrast agents. They are toxic in aqueous solutions, but can be neutralized by chelation or by encapsulating them into carbon nanotubes or fullerenes, resulting in gadonanotubes and gadofullerenes. The as-prepared nanotubes have their ends capped by carbon that hinders their filling. They are cut open by a chemical or/and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>treatment,</b> and their side walls are chemically modified (functionalized) to impart solubility in water and biological compatibility. Then the nanotubes are sonicated in an aqueous solution of GdCl3 to form gadonanotubes, where the Gd3+ forms clusters of 2-5 nm diameter which contain up to 10 ions. The small size of the clusters is responsible for the superparamagnetism and superior MRI contrast properties of gadonanotubes. The non-encapsulated Gd is removed by repeated washing with water.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Ligand exchange=== As-synthesized UCNPs {{are usually}} capped with organic ligands that aid {{in size and}} shape control during preparation. These ligands make their surface {{hydrophobic}} and hence are not dispersible in aqueous solution, preventing their biological applications. One simple method to increase solubility in aqueous solvents is direct ligand exchange. This requires a more favored ligand to replace the initial ones. The hydrophobic native ligand capping the NP during synthesis (usually a long chain molecule like oleic acid) is directly substituted with a more polar hydrophilic one, which are usually multi chelating (e.g. poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-phosphate, poly(acrylic acid)) and hence provides better stabilisation/ binding resulting in their exchange. A shortcoming of this method is the slow kinetics associated with the exchange. Generally the new ligand is also functionalized with a group like thiol that allows for facile binding to the NP surface. The protocol for direct exchange is simple, generally involving mixing {{for an extended period}} of time, but the work-up can be tedious, conditions must be optimized for each system, and aggregation may occur However the two-step process of ligand exchange involves the removal of original ligands followed by coating hydrophilic ones, which is a better method. The ligand removal step here was reported through various ways. A simple way was wash the particles with ethanol under <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>treatment.</b> Reagents like NOBF4 or acids are used to strip the native ligands off of the NP surface to attach favorable ones later on. This method shows less tendency for NP aggregation than the direct exchange, and can be generalized to other types of nanoparticles.|$|E
