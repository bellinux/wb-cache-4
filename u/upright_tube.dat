50|$|Mr. Charles Frederick Cheffins, {{mechanical}} draughtsman, saith, that on 27 July 1830, {{he went to}} the manufactory of Mr. Galloway, and saw {{the boiler}} exhibited by him in operation. There was no vessel containing a column of water attached to said boiler, but that, on the contrary, there was a considerable quantity of smoke issuing out from the upper extremity of the upright open pipe or chimney (Y). He asked Mr. Galloway, jun., where said column of water was placed, so as to afford resistance to the passage of the heated air? That Mr. Galloway, jun. told him they did not use a column of water to this boiler, but that in order to obtain a resistance they had diminished the area of the upright open pipe or chimney, so that its area should be less than the area of the flue in the boiler (but which area, to the best of the deponent's judgment, was more than thirty square inches; that is to say, the pipe measured five Inches by eight), thereby effecting the desir d object. That deponent farther observed, that the ante-chamber or magazine through which the furnace was supplied with fuel was not surrounded by water, as represented in the plaintiffs' specification and drawing. That the deponent considers that the plaintiffs have been enabled to dispense with such contrivance, from the reason that the heated air, instead of being subjected to a considerable pressure {{at the end of the}} flues, is suffered to escape freely into the atmosphere through an open pipe or chimney, whose sectional area, to the best of deponent's belief, measures five inches by eight inches. That upon asking Mr. Galloway, jun. how long said boiler had been in operation, he was answered, that it had been in constant work for seven months. That a boiler was shown to deponent constructed with a vessel to contain water, and an <b>upright</b> <b>tube</b> similar to drawing in plaintiffs' specification, but which deponent was informed had only been used for experiments, and that the said boiler was not in operation at the time deponent saw it.|$|E

5000|$|The Type XIII {{differed}} {{considerably from}} {{the series of}} tractor configuration monoplanes with which Louis Blériot is generally associated. It was a high-wing pusher configuration monoplane, with the [...] Gnome engine inset into {{the trailing edge of}} the square-tipped wing, which had inset ailerons and was braced by a deep wire-braced truss underneath. The wing was mounted on a conventional wire-braced wooden box girder using six uprights and a pair of substantial diagonal members to transmit the thrust of the engine to the main airframe. The pilot sat immediately in front of the wing leading edge, with the four passengers seated two by two behind him. A front-mounted elevator was carried on two pairs of V-booms, and a fixed lifting horizontal surface with a rectangular rudder above it was mounted on top of the rear of the fuselage structure. The main undercarriage consisted of a pair of wheels each in a trailing arm structure which was free to slide on <b>upright</b> <b>tubes</b> mounted outboard of the fuselage, and sprung by bungee cords.|$|R

If a woman stands <b>upright,</b> the vaginal <b>tube</b> points in an upward-backward direction and forms an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the uterus and of about 60 degrees to the horizontal.

5000|$|The greatly {{elongated}} head {{is set on}} a short, thick neck, {{and the end of}} {{the snout}} bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch. The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their teeth. Instead of having a pulp cavity, each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, <b>upright,</b> parallel <b>tubes</b> of vasodentin (a modified form of dentine), with individual pulp canals, held together by cementum. The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500. The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw, and have a dental formula of: [...] These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition. The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars. The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten nasal conchae, more than any other placental mammal.|$|R
40|$|Simple {{invertebrate}} metazoa offer many potentialities {{for study}} {{of growth and}} differentiation - potentialities which have not been realized because the organisms usually {{have been difficult to}} handle in the laboratory. A simple coelenterate, the brackish-water colonial hydroid Cordylophora lacustris, was selected for the present work, and was domesticated so that ii: it could be grown and manipulated under controlled laboratory conditions. Methods have been developed permitting exponential increase in hydranth number with a doubling time of about three days. Five ions - Na. +, K+, ca++, Mg++, c 1 - - {{have been found to be}} required for growth in the defined aqueous environment, and other variables influencing growth rate have been systematically studied. The colonies are fed daily with living larvae of the brine shrimp, Artemia. The control of the feeding reaction has. been studied. It has been found that, as in Hydra (Loomis, 1955), a single molecular species released from captured prey induces the feeding reaction. The active compound has been isolated from Artemia extract and identified as the imino acid proline, and reagent proline has been found to induce the feeding reaction at lo- 5 molar. Magnesium, and possibly phosphate ions, have be. en shown to influence the response to proline. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this discover ~ is from the point of view of comparative biochemistry and evolution, for previous workers have found that the feeding reactions of three other Hydrozoa are controlled by reduced glutathione. Time-lapse cinematography of the colonies has revealed proximallyoriented peristaltic waves which apparently act to circulate nutrients through the colonies. These waves are rhythmic, and occur about once every twentyfive minutes in resting colonies. After feeding, the frequency of the waves;increases to one every eight minutes, and falls back to the resting rate over the course of several hours. The most striking feature of the peristalsis is that it is synchronized throughout a colony, in that the waves begin at the tip of each hydranth simultaneously. The time-lapse movies have also elucidated a series of rhythmic movements which occur during the reconstitution of hydranths from tissue fragments. The major emphasis of the. study has been an attempt to gain an understanding of the asexual development of a Cordylophora colony. While at first glance a colony appears to be a fore. st of little trees, on closer examination one finds that a colony may be considered a series of tubes of uniform diameter. The shape of a colony may be considered to result from the (1) relative rates of growth, (2) spacing, and (3) angles of these tubes. A descriptive study of the development of shape under one set of culture conditions has been made. On the basis of the three parameters, thre~ types of tubes may be distinguished: stolon <b>tubes,</b> <b>upright</b> <b>tubes,</b> and branch tubes. These tubes were all found to grow at constant, but different rates. This linear growth of tubes posed a paradox, since the number of hydranths in a colony had been found to increase exponentially. It was shown that the dry weight of a colony also increases exponentially, and a model was developed permitting the resolution of linear growth of parts iv into exponential growth of the whole. Study of the development of individual colonies using. a marking technique showed that the development of shape in these colonies proceeded essentially as predicted by the model...|$|R
