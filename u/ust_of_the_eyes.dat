40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the reasons for}} postvitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage (PDVH), and to analyze <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> PDVH onset, <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> PDVH, <b>the</b> visual outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment, and factors that affect visual acuity after treatment. Materials and Methods: Overall, 292 eyes from 236 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) underwent vitrectomy from 2006 to 2010. Fifty eyes out of 43 patients had severe postoperative vitreous hemorrhage. The average follow-up duration was 6. 8 ± 3. 8 months (range, 2 - 12 months). Results: Recurrent vitreous hemorrhage (VH) after primary vitrectomy occurred in 40 eyes (80 %) with an average time of VH onset of 62. 5 ± 32. 8 days (range, 3 - 170 days). VH occurred after silicone oil removal occurred in 10 eyes (20 %), with an average time of VH onset of 27. 4 ± 20. 3 days (range, 1 - 60 days). The reasons for PDVH included chronic errhysis from retinal neovessels (47. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> residual fibrous vascular membrane (12. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> fibrovascular ingrowth at sclerotomy sites (4. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> iris neovessels and neovascular glaucoma (4. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> retinal vein occlusion (2. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> retinal tears (8. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> retinotomy (1. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> epichoroidal bleeding (1. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> polycythemia rubra vera (1. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> hypoperfusional retinopathy (4. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> and unknown reasons (12. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes).</b> Visual acuity increased in 43 eyes (86 %) after surgical or nonsurgical treatment. The improvement in visual acuity after treatment was not affected by age, sex, duration of diabetes, time of PDVH onset, frequency of surgery, or treatment methods. Conclusion: Postvitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage commonly occurs two months after vitrectomy. Residual epiretinal neovascularization {{is the most common}} cause of PDVH. Active surgical or nonsurgical treatment for severe vitreous hemorrhage can obviously improve the patients′ visual prognosis...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>eye</b> is <b>the</b> {{most natural}} optical system {{available}} to us.

The information obtained from <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> allows us to make decisions that range from menial to critical and even life-saving. However the human visual system seems to lack perfection in adapting to new conditions and degrading vision. Aberrations are the major factors that affect <b>the</b> image quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> A large amount of lower order aberrations are found in the peripheral visual field and higher order aberrations altered in from the center to the peripheral in the visual field. Understanding <b>the</b> aberrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> can help to learn more about <b>the</b> optical function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to understand <b>the</b> optical function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>eye</b> by reconstructing <b>the</b> wavefront aberration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and investigating <b>the</b> tomography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> knowledge <b>of</b> vision, aberration, and <b>the</b> basic optics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> is introduced.

The main aim is to investigate <b>the</b> optical function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> particularly <b>the</b> crystalline lens. For this purpose, a complex model eye is designed with adjustable lens at both on- axis and off-axis field; a new computer based ray-tracing algorithm is applied to find the wavefront aberration and the refractive index profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> At <b>the</b> end, the wavefront aberration is reconstructed for <b>the</b> model <b>eye,</b> including those from different angles into periphery. Another objective is to reconstruct the lens by applying tomography algorithms, in this thesis; a modified back projection algorithm is introduced and tested, from which the refractive index distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens can be reconstructed, however, at this stage, the reconstructing method still needs to be improved to gain a reliable refractive index distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens...|$|R
