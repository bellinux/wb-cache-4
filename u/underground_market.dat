Those efforts continued after SEPTA Regional Rail trains moved from the train terminal above the market to the new <b>underground</b> <b>Market</b> East Station (now Jefferson Station) below it in 1984. In 1990, ownership of the Reading Terminal and the market passed to the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority (PCCA), and in 1994, Philadelphia City Council established a new, non-profit Reading Terminal Market Corporation (RTMC) to operate the market. The RTMC and the PCCA continued the revitalization program begun by the Reading Company, recruiting new tenants and increasing promotion of the market. By the mid-1990s to the 2000s, the market was once again living up to its founder's' vision. Over 90% of its leasable space was occupied by profitable and stable vendors. The market is currently open 7 days a week, but not all vendors are open on Sundays. The Pennsylvania Dutch vendors are open Wednesday through Saturday.|$|E

500|$|As American {{alternative}} {{bands like}} Sonic Youth, which had {{grown out of}} the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought {{to capitalize on the}} <b>underground</b> <b>market</b> that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about $500, the band achieved huge (and unexpected) commercial success with its second album, Nevermind. The band's members cited punk rock as a key influence on their style. [...] "Punk is musical freedom", wrote frontman Kurt Cobain. [...] "It's saying, doing, and playing what you want."

We find evidence that transactions costs are considerable in the <b>underground</b> gun <b>market</b> in Chicago, and to some extent in other cities as well. The most likely explanation is that the <b>underground</b> gun <b>market</b> is both illegal and 'thin'- relevant information about trading opportunities is scarce due to illegality, which makes search costly for market participants and leads to a market thickness effect on transaction costs.

However, since the Chinese authorities had banned the importation and consumption of opium, the Company engaged them in the First Opium War, and at its conclusion, under the Treaty of Nanjing, gained access to five Chinese ports, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Ningbo; in addition, Hong Kong was ceded to the British Crown.

40|$|Online Social Media (OSM) is {{extensively}} used {{by contemporary}} Internet users to communicate, socialize and disseminate information. This {{has led to}} the creation of a distinct online social identity which in turn has created the need of online social reputation management techniques. A significant percentage of OSM users utilize various methods to drive and manage their reputation on OSM. This has given rise to <b>underground</b> <b>markets</b> which buy/sell fraudulent accounts, `likes', `comments' (Facebook, Instagram) and `followers' (Twitter) to artificially boost their social reputation. In this study, we present an anatomy of purchased followers on Twitter and their behaviour. We illustrate in detail the profile characteristics, content sharing and behavioural patterns of purchased follower accounts. Previous studies have analyzed the purchased follower markets and customers. Ours is the first study which analyzes the anatomy of purchased followers accounts. Some of the key insights of our study show that purchased followers have a very high unfollow entropy rate and low social engagement with their friends. In addition, we noticed that purchased follower accounts have significant difference in their interaction and content sharing patterns in comparison to random Twitter users. We also found that <b>underground</b> <b>markets</b> do not follow their service policies and guarantees they provide to customer. Our study highlights the key identifiers for suspicious follow behaviour. We then built a supervised learning mechanism to predict suspicious follower behaviour with 88. 2 % accuracy. We believe that understanding the anatomy and characteristics of purchased followers can help detect suspicious follower behaviour and fraudulent accounts to a larger extent...|$|R

While the use and importance of the Internet has been largely studied, previous work overlooked the role that phone numbers can play in understanding online threats. In this work we aim at determining if leveraging phone numbers analysis can improve {{our understanding of the}} <b>underground</b> <b>markets,</b> illegal computer activities, or cyber-crime in general. This knowledge could then be adopted by several defensive mechanisms, including blacklists or advanced spam heuristics. Our results show that, in scam activities, phone numbers remain often more stable over time than email addresses.
