Taildog and Agile differed primarily in range; Taildog was intended as a short-range dogfighting weapon, while Agile was a replacement for the Sidewinder and set range requirements at least as good as that missile, producing a much larger design.|$|E

25|$|The residences did {{not fully}} keep <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> rapid growth; by 1910, there were 1,877 {{official}} rooms and some unrecognised residences, which meant that {{an average of three}} to four people lived in a single room; this density decreased steadily during the decades to follow. Kiruna became a municipalsamhälle (a community within a municipality) in 1908. This caused unhappiness in local organisations, such as Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Arbetareförening, that had hoped for a status as köping, which would have kept more of the mining income inside the locality. In return, the mining company LKAB paid for a hospital, fire station, sewage, roads, a church (opened 1912) and the priest's home.|$|E
25|$|The Allies mounted more gas attacks {{than the}} Germans in 1917 and 1918 {{because of a}} marked {{increase}} in production of gas from the Allied nations. Germany was unable to keep <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> pace despite creating various new gases for use in battle, mostly {{as a result of}} very costly methods of production. Entry into the war by the United States allowed the Allies to increase mustard gas production far more than Germany. Also the prevailing wind on the Western Front was blowing from west to east, which meant the British more frequently had favorable conditions for a gas release than did the Germans.|$|E
25|$|P. gibbosus {{is a part}} of a mimicry {{group with}} a wide variety of other wasps that also exhibit black and yellow banding and coloring. It has been {{observed}} that mimicry is high in spring and early summer, generally absent in midsummer, and infrequent in late summer. This implies that some members of the mimicry group, including P. gibbosus, may be selected to avoid the midsummer season when insectivorous birds are abundant and have not yet learned to avoid the models which the mimics resemble. The colony cycle of P. gibbosus lines <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> scheduling in such a way that minimizes the amount of predation the species faces.|$|E

However, the statistical models used to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> figure did not account {{for the fact that the}} number-two engine was mounted at the tail close to all the hydraulic lines, nor the possibility that an engine failure would release many fragments in many directions. Since then, more modern aircraft engine designs have focused on keeping shrapnel from penetrating the cowling or ductwork, and have increasingly utilized high-strength composite materials to achieve the required penetration resistance while keeping the weight low.|$|E

[...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress.

Dave has also said that song had been {{inspired}} by Jimmy Giuffre's song [...] "The Train and the River". According to the band's manager, Larry Page, the song's characteristic riff came about while working out the chords of the Kingsmen's [...] "Louie Louie".

[...] Born and raised in Macau, China, Wen was very much familiar with both the legend of Hua Mulan and the Ballad of Mulan {{at the time of}} her audition for the role, having grown up being read the poem by her mother. Wen explained, [...] "I think every Chinese kid grows <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> story," [...] additionally likening the poem's popularity in China to that of the Western Parson Weems fable in which American president George Washington chops down his father's beloved cherry tree.|$|E

Originally the script had called for more overt religious imagery, though censors at Fox objected to depictions of faith healer Samuel being beaten to death whilst in a cruciform pose, leading to scenes being cut.|$|E

The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: [...] "Max came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio. When people make drastic decisions to do things like that and it backfires, it usually ends up, in one way or another, costing them their jobs." ...|$|E
