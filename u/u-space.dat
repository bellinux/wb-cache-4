In section (2. 2) we give the definition of CC-distance, we state the Theorem of Chow and, following [3], we analize the structure of the tangent set to a CC-space. In section (2. 3) we prove the existence (see [5]) of the minimal upper gradient of a continuous function in CC-spaces, continuous with respect to the Euclidean distance. Chapter 3 is the core of the thesis, here we begin giving the definition of a Carnot group and proving some basic properties of the CC-distance associated to a basis of the first layer of the Lie algebra.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for hydrograph separation in mountain watersheds, which aims at identifying flow sources among ungauged headwater sub-catchments {{through a combination}} of observed streamflow and data on natural tracers including isotope and dissolved solids. Daily summer and bi-daily spring season water samples obtained at the outlet of the Juncal River Basin in the Andes of Central Chile were analysed for all major ions as well as stable water isotopes, O- 18 and D. Additionally, various samples from rain, snow, surface streams and exfiltrating subsurface water (springs) were sampled throughout the catchment. A principal component analysis was performed in order to address cross-correlation in the tracer dataset, reduce the dimensionality of the problem and uncover patterns of variability. Potential sources were identified in a two-component <b>U-space</b> that explains 94 % of the observed tracer variability at the catchment outlet. Hydrograph separation was performed through an Informative-Bayesian model. Our results indicate that the Juncal Norte Glacier headwater sub-catchment contributed at least 50 % of summer flows at the Juncal River Basin outlet during the 2011 - 2012 water year (a hydrologically dry period in the Region), even though it accounts for only 27 % of the basin area. Our study confirms the value of combining solute and isotope information for estimating source contributions in complex hydrologic systems, and provides insights regarding experimental design in high-elevation semi-arid catchments. The findings of this study can be useful for evaluating modelling studies of the hydrological consequences of the rapid decrease in glacier cover observed in this region, by providing insights into the origin of river water in basins with little hydrometeorological information.

40|$|When {{simulating}} sky images, one {{often takes}} a galaxy image F (x) {{defined by a}} set of pixelized samples and an interpolation kernel, and then wants to produce a new sampled image representing this galaxy as it would appear with a different point-spread function, a rotation, shearing, or magnification, and/or a different pixel scale. These operations are sometimes only possible, or most efficiently executed, as resamplings of the Fourier transform F ̃ (u) of the image onto a <b>u-space</b> grid that differs from the one produced by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the samples. In some applications it is essential that the resampled image be accurate to better than 1 part in 103, so in this paper we first use standard Fourier techniques to show that Fourier-domain interpolation with a wrapped sinc function yields the exact value of F ̃ (u) in terms of the input samples and kernel. This operation scales with image dimension as N 4 and can be prohibitively slow, so we next investigate the errors accrued from approximating the sinc function with a compact kernel. We show that these approximations produce a multiplicative error plus a pair of ghost images (in each dimension) in the simulated image. Standard Lanczos or cubic interpolators, when applied in Fourier domain, produce unacceptable artifacts. We find that errors < 1 part in 103 can be obtained by (1) 4 -fold zero-padding of the original image before executing the x → u DFT, followed by (2) resampling to the desired u grid using a 6 -point, piecewise-quintic interpolant that we design expressly to minimize the ghosts, then (3) executing the DFT back to x domain.

40|$|We have {{mentioned}} that each chapter {{in this thesis}} is conceived of as an independent paper, except for Chapter 3, which {{is a collection of}} results on non- continuous functions. Consequently each chapter contains a clearly marked introductory section, in which its back- ground and content are explained. In this abstract we shall summarize the remarks in these introductory sections. In chapter 1 we present an n-arc theorem for Peano spaces which is an extension of the theorem in § 2 of [32], which Menger called the second n-arc theorem in [17]. Whereas in the second n-arc theorem n disjoint arcs are constructed joining two disjoint closed sets A and B, in chapter 1 we split the closed set A into n dis- joint closed subsets A 1 A 2, •••, An and give necessary and sufficient conditions for there to be n disjoint arcs joining A and B, one meeting each A 1. At the end of chapter 1 we present a conjecture, which {{we have been able to}} verify in special cases. In [35] Whyburn proved a theorem concerning the weak connected separation of two non-degenerate connected closed sets A and B by a quasi-closed set L in a locally cohesive space X. In chapter 2 we show that A and B can in fact be taken as arbitrary closed sets in this theorem; that is,,we remove the restriction of non-degeneracy and connectedness on A and B. In chapter 3 we study the circumstances under which a connectivity function is peripherally continuous. The study of the abstract relations between non- continuous functions was initiated by Stallings in [23]. In this paper he introduced the 1 pc polyhedron and showed that a connectivity function was peripherally continuous on an 1 pc polyhedron. Whyburn took up the study of non- continuous functions in [33]. [34] and [35]. He introduced the locally cohesive space, which is more general than the 1 pc polyhedron, and proved that a connectivity function was peripherally continuous on a locally cohesive Peano space. For technical reasons, the locally cohesive space is not permitted to have local cut points. It is obvious, however, that on many Peano spaces having local, cut points a connectivity function remains peripherally continuous, In § 2, 3 of chapter 3 we formulate a sequence of properties Pn(X), which permit the space X to have local cut points, and we prove in each case that a connectivity function f : X →Y is peripherally continuous when X has property Pn(X). Each of these properties is an improvement on the last, and the final one, the <b>U-space,</b> satisfactorily incorporates the class of Peano spaces with local cut points on which we are able to prove that a connectivity function is peripherally continuous. An interesting feature of § 3 of chapter 3 is provided by two "weak separation theorems," and more will be found about these in the introduction to chapter 3. In § 4 of chapter 3 we show that a connectivity function is peripherally continuous on a locally compact ANR. This affirmatively answers a question that Stallings raised in [23]. The <b>U-space</b> that we have introduced in § 3 of chapter 3 imposes a "unicoherence condition" in the space X (as do all the properties Pn(X) considered in § 3, chapter 3). In § 5 of chapter 3 we generalize the <b>U-space</b> to the S-space. This imposes a "multicoherence condition" on the space X, and we prove that a connectivity function is peripherally continuous on a cyclic S-space. We close chapter 3 by considering the question of placing weaker conditions than connectivity on the function f : X → Y which will still ensure that f is peripherally continuous. It is well known that if X is a unicoherent Peano continuum and A 1, A 2, … is a sequence of disjoint closed subsets of X no one of which separates X, then Un= 1 An does not separate X. In [28] van Est proved this theorem for the case where X is a Euclidean space of n dimensions. In chapter 4 we give an example which shows that this theorem does not hold if X is an arbitrary Peano space • In chapter 5 we provide a new angle to Lebesgue's covering lemma. We show that if the Lebesgue number ᵹ of an open covering U 1, U 2, •••• Un of a compact metric space X. ρ is finite. then it can be defined by the formula ᵹ = min ρ (E, F), where E and F are any compartments contained in no common U 1 In chapter 6 we show that an involution on a cyclic Peano space leaves some simple closed curve setwise invariant. Whyburn has given a proof of R. L. Moore’s decomposition theorem for the 2 -sphere in [31] (a refinement of this proof is presented in [36]). His proof is accomplished by showing that the decomposition space satisfies Zippin’s characterization theorem for the 2 -sphere. In chapter 6 we present an alternative way of showing that the decomposition space satisfies Zippin's characterization theorem. Our proof closely follows Alexander's proof of the Jordan curve theorem as given by Newman in[21], and so consists of arguments that are well-known in another context. In [30] Whyburn gave a proof of the cyclic connectivity theorem. and in all subsequent appearances of this theorem in the literature Whyburn's proof has been used. Whyburn divided the proof of the theorem into three parts lemma 1, lemma 2, and the deduction of the theorem from lemmas 1 and 2. In chapter 8 we give an alternative proof of lemma 1. Our proof is based on the fact that a cyclic Peano space has a base of regions whose closures do not separate the space, and it proceeds by an induction on a simple chain of these regions. ...|$|E
