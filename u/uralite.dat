50|$|In many mafic igneous rocks, such as gabbro and diabase, scapolite replaces {{feldspar}} by {{a secondary}} or metasomatic process. Some Norwegian scapolite-gabbros (or diorite) examined microscopically furnish examples of {{every stage of}} the process. The chemical changes involved are really small, {{one of the most}} important being the assumption of a small amount of chlorine in the new molecule. Often the scapolite is seen spreading through the feldspar, portions being completely replaced, while others are still fresh and unaltered. The feldspar does not weather, but remains fresh, and the transformation resembles metamorphism rather than weathering. It is not a superficial process, but apparently takes place at some depth under pressure, and probably through the operation of solutions or vapours containing chlorides. The basic soda-lime feldspars (labradorite to anorthite) are those that undergo this type of alteration. Many instances of scapolitization have been described from the ophites (diabases) of the Pyrenees. In the unaltered state these are ophitic and consist of pyroxene enclosing lath-shaped plagioclase feldspars; the pyroxene is often changed to <b>uralite.</b> When the feldspar is replaced by scapolite the new mineral is fresh and clear, enclosing often small grains of hornblende. Extensive recrystallization often goes on, and the ultimate product is a spotted rock with white rounded patches of scapolite surrounded by granular aggregates of clear green hornblende: in fact the original structure disappears.|$|E

On Friday last the Picture House, Oxford Street, opened its doors for the {{reproduction}} of that extremely successful play, [...] "The Miracle", as performed at Olympia. As most of our readers may be aware, the Picture House is in Oxford Street, at the junction of Poland Street, and exactly opposite to that long neglected playhouse, the Princess's Theatre. One steps from the street down a mosaic pavement straight into the stalls, which are fitted with tip-ups, upholstered in canary silk. Here and there the walls, in cream and gold, are relieved with exquisitely panelled paintings of seventeenth century figures, while {{the lower part of}} the walls are of solid mahogany.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn acoustic resonance based technique using a free-free bar {{has been extended}} to investigate the complex (storage and loss) moduli of non-magnetic materials having circular cross section. Using this technique, the bar can be selectively excited in three independent vibrational modes, i. e. torsional, flexural and longitudinal modes. The torsional mode yields the shear modulus. Either the flexural or longitudinal mode {{can be used to}} obtain Young's modulus. These resonant modes can be tracked continuously by means of a phase-locked-loop (PLL) as the temperature (and resonant frequency) of the rod is changed. The in-phase amplitude of the receiver output of the electrodynamic transducer is proportional to the quality factor,Q, of the material. It can be used to continuously track the loss tangent (= 1 /Q) of the material as a function of temperature and frequency. Results for complex shear modulus and Young's modulus were obtained for a castable epoxy type PR 1592 and complex shear modulus for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and <b>Uralite</b> 3130.

40|$|SUMMARY. Eocene tholeiitic basalts occur {{throughout}} {{the length of}} New Caledonia where their emplacement preceded that of the peridotite massifs. In the south, two areas of basaltic rocks are intimately associated with Eocene sediments, which have been overridden by the peridotites. The aphyric, holocrystalline basalts consist of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, titanomagnetite, and minor quartz together with their abundant alteration products, which include epidote and <b>uralite.</b> The chemical compositions ofthese rocks fail to show agreement with oceanic tholeiitites, as suggested by earlier writers, although strong similarities exist with the basalts of the Papuan Ultramafic Belt. B AS ALTS of Lower Tertiary age are widespread in New Caledonia nd constitute {{one of the major}} occurrences of this rock type in the south Pacific (fig. I). Routhier (I 953) recorded basaltic flows, pillow lavas, pyroclastic deposits, volcanogenic argillites, cherts, and intercalated sediments as outcropping more or less continuously over 2 oo km of the east coast of the island between Bourail and Koumac; to these rocks he ascribed a vague Palaeogene age. The structural and stratigraphic relationships of the basalts are important in that these rocks appear to underlie the large, perched, peridotite massifs of the eastern coast of New Caledonia (Routhier, I 953; Brother...|$|E

The coordinates for Robinson???s geological map were estimated using Google Earth imageryRocks of the northwestern Sierra de San Andr??s of the Vizcaino Peninsula of Baja California Sur, Mexico, form a partial, dismembered ophiolite sequence. Serpentinized harzburgite with minor dunite, orthopyroxenite, and pediform and disseminated chromite comprise the ultramafic section. Ultramafic rocks of cumulate origin are absent. An interior m??lange of sheared serpentinite contains exotic blocks of altered serpentinite, metavolcanic, and metasedimentary rocks which range from greenschist to probable high-grade blueschist facies. A disrupted but intercalated section of layered clinopyroxene-plagioclase ?? olivine cumulates and olivine melagabbro cumulates overlie the ultramafic rocks along low-angle faults. Orthopyroxene (bronzite) is the major intercumulate phase in the olivine melagabbro. Non-cumulate <b>uralite</b> gabbro is exposed in isolated fault blocks adjacent to the cumulate gabbro. Hornblende-bearing plagiogranite locally intrudes the <b>uralite</b> gabbro, resulting in an intrusive breccia. Plagiogranite with a diabasic texture composes another fault block which {{may be part of}} a sheeted dike or sill complex. At least 400 m of microporphyritic plagioclase ?? clinopyroxene pillow lava is exposed. In addition, small scattered fault blocks of plagioclase ?? clinopyroxene spilite and keratophyre may represent rocks derived from a deeper level in the complex. Pillow lava is conformably overlain by tuffaceous shale, friable Buchia piochi-bearing shale, potassium feldspar-poor volcanic arenite, conglomerate and pebblestone of the Upper Jurassic Eugenia Formation. The Turonian middle member of the Valle Formation overlies the ophiolite along low- to high-angle faults of small displacement. The ophiolite complex is cut by a west-trending shear zone and by northwest-trending faults. The latter are probably related to the Cenozoic right-lateral fault system of the northern Vizcaino Peninsula. Chemical analyses of ten gabbroic and volcanic rocks exhibit low K 2 O content and AFM trends characteristic of other ophiolites and abyssal tholeiite. This, together with stratigraphic evidence, suggests that the ophiolite is a piece of remnant oceanic crust which formed close to the Late Jurassic continental margin. It is suggested that prior to emplacement, the ophiolite formed the trenchward part of the upper plate of a Jurassic subduction zone. As a result of water derived from dehydration of the down-going oceanic crust, serpentinite diapirs formed in the mantle above the subducted plate and rose upward to a position below the overlying oceanic plate. The emplacement of the diapirs may have produced Cretaceous and Tertiary uplifting of the Vizcaino Peninsula...|$|E
40|$|This {{treatise}} {{provides a}} record of the stratigraphy and structure in the southernmost extension of the Witwatersrand System and is based on the results obtained from bore-hole cores and from detailed mapping underground. Several disconformities encountered in these sediments are interpreted as marginal disconformities of a geosynclinal basin. It is contended that the bankets were formed in neritic and littoral environments closely associated with profiles of equilibrium., such as disconformities, where conditions favour the concentration of heavy minerals, including gold and uraninite. The composite radiometric log of the area south of the Sand river, drawn up by Dr. D. J. Simpson in 1951, is revised by including into it the portion of the log of bore-hole K. A. 2 in which the Intermediate Reefs occur. Chloritoid is confined to the Lower Footwall beds, the Khaki Shale Marker and the Upper Shale Marker. The variation of the optical properties of chloritic minerals indicate that a wide range of these minerals exist in the sediments. Pyritic stringers appear to be natural concentrations of such heavy minerals as pyrite, ilmenite, chromite and zircon. Heavy mineral investigations, to be of correlative value, {{in the case of the}} Witwatersrand System would require considerable basic research.

40|$|The area {{described}} {{lies in the}} State of Oaxaca, about 130 kms {{south of}} the city of Oaxaca. The country rock, dominantly composed of feldspar, is in an area formerly mapped as "Paleozoic metamorphic. " The rock has a gneissic structure, carries 5 percent quartz and contains ferromagnesian bands. The feldspar is antiperthite, with a calcic oligoclase as "host " and anorthoclase as the second constituent. A second generation of feldspar, composed of a granular aggregate of plagioclase and potash feldspar has replaced the large antiperthite grains to a considerable degree. The feld-spar rock may be classed as an anorthosite, by analogy with the host rock in the similar titaniferous deposit in Virginia described by Clarence Ross. The distribution of the dark minerals in the feldspar rock is characteristic of a replacement genesis. Although in the hand specimen the dark mineral seems to be mostly chlorite, thin sections show that the original minerals were augite, hornblende and, rarely, olivine, which have been more or less completely altered to <b>uralite,</b> several varieties of chlorite and to serpentine. The ore minerals are apatite, futile and ilmenite. The zones of min-eralization, and the ore minerals themselves are aligned parallel to the gneissic structure. However, the second gentration of feldspar, the ore minerals, and probably the ferromagnesian minerals were formed after the stress was relieved. In considering the genesis of the deposit, features that are similar and features that are dissimilar to the Virginia deposit are tabulated and dis-cussed. Photomicrographs of sections of the ore and of the rock accom-pany the article and the microscopic evidence of replacement textures is pointed out. Based principally on the microscopic evidence, but also on the analogy with the deposit in Virginia, the xvriter concludes that the titanium minerals and the apatite formed as deuteric minerals in the still hot, but solid igneous rock, as a result of fluid emanations from the residual ma•mna from xvhich the "anorthosite " crystallized.

40|$|Plutonic rocks {{ranging in}} {{composition}} from gabbro to granite are {{widespread in the}} province of Thrace in northern Greece, intruding the Rhodope Massif and the Circum Rhodope Belt. Magmatism in this area is considered to be of Eocene to Miocene age. The Maronia pluton is situated south of the Komotini town, in southwest Thrace intruding the Circum Rhodope Belt. The Circum Rhodope Belt is divided into two units: the Makri unit (also known as the phyllite series) and the overlying Drimos-Melia unit. Late studies reject the concept of the Circum Rhodope Belt being a Mesozoic cover of the Rhodope Massif and accept the idea that its rocks belong to two distinct greenschists belts. To the west the Maronia pluton intrudes marbles and calc-phyllites of the metasedimentary series of the Makri unit while to the east it intrudes a metamorphic sequence, comprised mostly of phyllites, greenschists and gneisses of the overlying metavolcanosedimentary series of the same unit. The intrusion caused thermal metamorphism in the country rocks. The pluton was emplaced during the Oligocene and is considered to be the youngest of the Tertiary plutons that intrude western Thrace. Based on the Q’/ANOR classification diagram three main rock groups can be distinguished: a) the basic, b) the intermediate and c) the acid group. a) The basic group is composed of gabbro, a dark-coloured, medium grained rock, having clinopyroxene, red-brown biotite, plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxides. Olivine and orthopyroxene are rare. Interstitial K-feldspar is also present. b) The intermediate group is composed of monzonite, quartz monzonite, monzogabbro, quartz monzogabbro and mafic microgranular enclaves. Monzonite shifts to quartz monzonite with an increase of interstitial quartz up to 6 vol%. These rocks are fine- to medium-grained with monzonitic texture. They consist of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, hornblende, red-brown biotite, orthoclase and Fe-Ti oxides and apatite as accessory minerals. Non-perthitic orthoclase encloses poikilitically plagioclase, biotite, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides. Patches of a second generation of K-feldspar is often recognised in the poikilitic K-feldspar. Biotite often encloses grains of accessory minerals as well as orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. The latter is the most abundant pyroxene. Pinkish orthopyroxene is often altered to <b>uralite.</b> It is partially enclosed by either biotite or clinopyroxene {{and it seems to be}} the first mineral to crystallize. Hornblende, wherever present, occurs both as primary crystals and as an alteration product of pyroxenes. ...|$|E
40|$|The Dunka Road Cu-Ni {{prospect}} {{is located}} within what is informally {{known as the}} Partridge River Intrusion (T. 60 W., R. 13 W.), {{which is part of}} the 1. 1 b. y. (Keweenawan) Duluth Complex. Seven major lithologic units, along with several internal ultramafic subunits, have been identified and are correlatable over the prospect. The ultramafic subunits (layers of picrite to dunite) exhibit relative uniform thicknesses and are present at the same relative stratigraphic position within the major lithologic units. The major lithologic units, delineated by Severson and Hauck (1990) and Geerts et al., 1990, are defined as upward from the basal contact as follows: Unit I, a fine- to coarsegrained sulfide-bearing anorthositic troctolite to pyroxene troctolite (450 ft. thick) with associated ultramafic subunits I(a) and I(b); Unit II, a medium- to coarse-grained troctolite to pyroxene troctolite (200 ft. thick) with a basal ultramafic subunit II(a); Unit III, a fine-grained, mottled textured troctolitic anorthosite to anorthositic troctolite (250 ft. thick); Unit IV, a coarse-grained pyroxene troctolite to anorthositic troctolite (300 ft. thick); Unit V, a coarse-grained anorthositic troctolite (300 ft. thick); Unit VI, a fine- to coarse-grained troctolitic anorthosite to troctolite (400 ft. thick) with basal ultramafic subunit VI(a); and Unit VII, a coarse-grained troctolitic anorthosite to anorthositic troctolite (400 + ft. thick) with basal ultramafic subunit VII(a). Most sulfide mineralization occurs within Unit I. The sulfide mineralization is both interstitial and widespread, but variable in modal percentage (rare to 5 %), continuity, and thickness (few inches to tens of feet). Sulfide mineralization is generally related with proximity to: hornfels inclusions; the basal contact with the footwall Virginia Formation; and some of the internal ultramafic subunits within Unit I. Primary sulfide mineralization includes chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, cubanite, and pentlandite. Minor amounts of bornite, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, talnakhite, mackinawite, and/or valleriite along with both native copper and gold have also been identified. Pt+Pd values range from 100 to > 2400 ppb over 5 and 10 foot intervals, and occur as isolated values or within stratigraphic horizons within Unit I. Several Cu/PGE-enriched horizons (using a 0. 5 % Cu and > 800 Pt+Pd cut-off) have been identified and occur laterally throughout the prospect. Intersected by 76 drill holes, the most continuous horizon (RED Horizon) is found directly beneath ultramafic subunit II(a), within the uppermost portion of Unit I. This horizon ranges from 5 to 100 feet thick (average 33 ft.) and contains average values of 0. 6 % Cu and 1000 ppb Pt+Pd. Two other horizons (ORANGE Horizon and YELLOW Horizon) occur beneath the RED Horizon and are intersected by 67 and 48 drill holes, respectively. These are less continuous horizons that range from 5 to 140 feet thick (average 35 ft.) and contain average values of 0. 6 % Cu and 750 ppb Pt+Pd. Only one PGE-enriched horizon has been identified outside of Unit I. This horizon (MAGENTA Horizon) occurs in Unit VI, and is located approximately 150 feet beneath ultramafic subunit VII(a). Although it has been identified in only six drill holes to date, it ranges from 6 to 40 feet thick (average 25 ft.) and contains average values of 0. 7 % Cu and 1500 ppb Pt+Pd. The predominant host rock for these Cu/PGE-enriched horizons is coarse-grained anorthositic troctolite, which may exhibit some subtle fracturing associated with minor alteration. The alteration assemblage within these mineralized zones is serpentine, <b>uralite,</b> and saussurite. This type of alteration assemblage has also been observed throughout the entire prospect, but is not always associated with mineralization. Although the majority of sulfide mineralization is believed to be primary, mineralized zones that are intersected by fractured/altered zones can contain secondary sulfides and textures, suggesting local enrichment. The majority of the sulfide is coarsegrained (5 mm) and commonly rimmed by secondary red-brown biotite. Ilmenite occurs in two habits within these zones, as euhedral to subhedral laths interstitial to silicate crystals, and as "blebiii like" shiny black droplets within the sulfides. This second ilmenite habit has only been identified in sulfide-bearing zones that are enriched in Pd and/or Pt. A total of 16 samples (13 mineralized, 3 unmineralized) were analyzed for PGEs. Results of the PGE scans indicate that the original magma contained all of the dissolved sulfides and PGEs upon reaching the final site of the intrusion. Therefore, the mineralized horizons contain values of PGEs similar to that of the mantle. No PGE-enriched reefs are found at Dunka Road, most probably due to low concentrations of PGEs in the original mantle melt. The geochemistry of samples taken from the Dunka Road prospect support this theory.
