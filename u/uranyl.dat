5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb <b>uranyl</b> ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of <b>uranyl</b> phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|Incorporated uranium becomes <b>uranyl</b> ions, which {{accumulate}} in bone, liver, kidney, and reproductive tissues. Uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces and aquifers.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the <b>uranyl</b> salts {{of uranium}} and polyatomic ion uranium-oxide {{cationic}} forms, the uranates, salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion, {{are generally not}} water-soluble.|$|E
5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} raw ore and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce <b>uranyl</b> nitrate. Ether was then {{added in a}} liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the <b>uranyl</b> nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This {{became known as the}} Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{content in}} bulk may be {{determined}} by treating with a large excess of <b>uranyl</b> zinc acetate; the hexahydrate (UO2)2ZnNa(CH3CO2)·6H2O precipitates and can be weighed. Caesium and rubidium do not interfere with this reaction, but potassium and lithium do. Lower concentrations of sodium may {{be determined by}} atomic absorption spectrophotometry or by potentiometry using ion-selective electrodes.|$|E
5|$|To extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is {{dissolved}} in nitric acid, and a reducing agent (FeSO4, or H2O2) {{is added to}} the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of <b>uranyl</b> nitrate (UO2(NO3)2). The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu4+ compounds.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. This {{leads to}} an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as <b>uranyl</b> phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E
5|$|Most {{ingested}} uranium is excreted during digestion. Only 0.5% {{is absorbed}} when insoluble forms of uranium, {{such as its}} oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble <b>uranyl</b> ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay {{for many years in}} bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Uranyl</b> nitrate, UO2(NO3)2·6H2O can be {{heated to}} yield UO3. This occurs during the {{reprocessing}} of nuclear fuel. Fuel rods are dissolved in HNO3 to separate <b>uranyl</b> nitrate from plutonium and the fission products (the PUREX method). The pure <b>uranyl</b> nitrate {{is converted to}} solid UO3 by heating at 400°C. After reduction with hydrogen (with other inert gas present) to uranium dioxide, the uranium {{can be used in}} new MOX fuel rods.|$|E
25|$|Dissolving {{uranium oxide}} {{in a strong}} acid like sulfuric or nitric acid forms the double {{positive}} charged <b>uranyl</b> cation. The <b>uranyl</b> nitrate formed (UO2(NO3)2·6H2O) is soluble in ethers, alcohols, ketones and esters; for example, tributylphosphate. This solubility is used to separate uranium from other elements in nuclear reprocessing, which begins with the dissolution of nuclear fuel rods in nitric acid. The <b>uranyl</b> nitrate is then converted to uranium trioxide by heating.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{trioxide}} (UO3), {{also called}} <b>uranyl</b> oxide, uranium(VI) oxide, and uranic oxide, is the hexavalent oxide of uranium. The solid {{may be obtained}} by heating <b>uranyl</b> nitrate to 400°C. Its most commonly encountered polymorph, γ-UO3, is a yellow-orange powder.|$|E
25|$|Phosphate is {{a strong}} {{complexing}} agent for the hexavalent <b>uranyl</b> (UO22+) species; for this reason, apatite and other natural phosphates can be very rich in uranium.|$|E
25|$|From {{nitric acid}} one obtains <b>uranyl</b> nitrate, trans-UO2(NO3)2·2H2O, {{consisting}} of eight-coordinated uranium with two bidentate nitrato ligands and two water ligands {{as well as}} the familiar O=U=O core.|$|E
25|$|The aqueous {{homogeneous}} reactors (AHRs) use {{a solution}} of <b>uranyl</b> sulfate or other uranium salt in water. Historically, AHRs have all been small research reactors, not large power reactors. An AHR known as the Medical Isotope Production System is being considered for production of medical isotopes.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{which are}} {{expected}} to be diamagnetic may exhibit this kind of weak paramagnetism. It arises from a second-order Zeeman effect in which additional splitting, proportional to the square of the field strength, occurs. It is difficult to observe as the compound inevitably also interacts with the magnetic field in the diamagnetic sense. Nevertheless, data are available for the permanganate ion. It is easier to observe in compounds of the heavier elements, such as <b>uranyl</b> compounds.|$|E
25|$|Uranium dioxide {{is a black}} {{semiconducting}} solid. It {{can be made by}} reacting <b>uranyl</b> nitrate with a base (ammonia) to form a solid (ammonium uranate). It {{is heated}} (calcined) to form U3O8 that can then be converted by heating in an argon / hydrogen mixture (700°C) to form UO2. The UO2 is then mixed with an organic binder and pressed into pellets, these pellets are then fired at a much higher temperature (in H2/Ar) to sinter the solid. The aim is to form a dense solid which has few pores.|$|E
25|$|Cation {{exchange}} processes {{have previously}} been investigated {{as a potential}} treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an ion exchange resin can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and <b>uranyl</b> sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from mine water. Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form. A South African company that won the 2013 IChemE (ww.icheme.org) award for water management and supply (treating AMD) have developed a patented ion-exchange process that treats mine effluents (and AMD) economically.|$|E
25|$|Four {{methods of}} {{separation}} were pursued. Seaborg performed {{the first successful}} separation of a weighable quantity of plutonium in August 1942, using a process involving lanthanum fluoride. Isadore Perlman and William J. Knox, Jr., looked into peroxide separation because most elements form soluble peroxides in neutral or acid solution. They soon discovered that plutonium was an exception. After {{a good deal of}} experimentation, they found that they could precipitate it by adding hydrogen peroxide to a dilute <b>uranyl</b> nitrate solution. They were then able to get the process to work but it produced tons of precipitate, where the lanthanum fluoride process would produce kilograms.|$|E
25|$|Negative stain – {{suspensions}} containing nanoparticles or fine {{biological material}} (such as viruses and bacteria) are briefly {{mixed with a}} dilute solution of an electron-opaque solution such as ammonium molybdate, <b>uranyl</b> acetate (or formate), or phosphotungstic acid. This mixture is applied to a suitably coated EM grid, blotted, then allowed to dry. Viewing of this preparation in the TEM should be carried out without delay for best results. The method is important in microbiology for fast but crude morphological identification, but {{can also be used}} as the basis for high resolution 3D reconstruction using EM tomography methodology when carbon films are used for support. Negative staining is also used for observation of nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{that have}} {{dimensions}} {{small enough to}} be electron transparent, such as powdered substances, small organisms, viruses, or nanotubes, can be quickly prepared by the deposition of a dilute sample containing the specimen onto films on support grids. Biological specimens may be embedded in resin to withstand the high vacuum in the sample chamber and to enable cutting tissue into electron transparent thin sections. The biological sample can be stained using either a negative staining material such as <b>uranyl</b> acetate for bacteria and viruses, or, {{in the case of}} embedded sections, the specimen may be stained with heavy metals, including osmium tetroxide. Alternately samples may be held at liquid nitrogen temperatures after embedding in vitreous ice. In material science and metallurgy the specimens can usually withstand the high vacuum, but still must be prepared as a thin foil, or etched so some portion of the specimen is thin enough for the beam to penetrate. Constraints on the thickness of the material may be limited by the scattering cross-section of the atoms from which the material is comprised.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} <b>uranyl</b> cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E
500|$|Salts of many {{oxidation}} {{states of}} uranium are water-soluble {{and may be}} studied in aqueous solutions. The most common ionic forms are [...] (brown-red), [...] (green), [...] (unstable), and [...] (yellow), for U(III), U(IV), U(V), and U(VI), respectively. A few solid and semi-metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium(II), but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state. Ions of [...] liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable. The [...] ion represents the uranium(VI) state and is known to form compounds such as <b>uranyl</b> carbonate, <b>uranyl</b> chloride and <b>uranyl</b> sulfate. [...] also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents, the most commonly encountered of which is <b>uranyl</b> acetate.|$|E
500|$|Uranium {{was also}} used in {{photographic}} chemicals (especially uranium nitrate as a toner), in lamp filaments for stage lighting bulbs, to improve the appearance of dentures, and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes. Uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool. <b>Uranyl</b> acetate and <b>uranyl</b> formate are used as electron-dense [...] "stains" [...] in transmission electron microscopy, to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in negative staining of viruses, isolated cell organelles and macromolecules.|$|E
500|$|Uranium Trioxide Plant (aka Uranium Oxide Plant aka UO3 Plant) – took {{output from}} other plants (i.e. liquid <b>uranyl</b> nitrate hexahydrate from U plant and PUREX plant), made uranium {{trioxide}} powder ...|$|E
500|$|... {{resulted}} in human fatalities, those deaths {{were associated with}} the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and <b>uranyl</b> fluoride rather than with uranium itself. Finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature.|$|E
500|$|Another {{separation}} method uses polymeric resins as a polyelectrolyte. Ion exchange {{processes in}} the resins result in separation of uranium. Uranium from resins is washed with a solution of ammonium nitrate or nitric acid that yields <b>uranyl</b> nitrate, UO2(NO3)2·6H2O. When heated, it turns into UO3, which is converted to UO2 with hydrogen: ...|$|E
500|$|Henri Becquerel {{discovered}} radioactivity {{by using}} uranium in 1896. Becquerel made the discovery in Paris by leaving {{a sample of}} a uranium salt, K2UO2(SO4)2 (potassium <b>uranyl</b> sulfate), {{on top of an}} unexposed photographic plate in a drawer and noting that the plate had become [...] "fogged". He determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate.|$|E
500|$|Uranium has a valence from 3 to 6, {{the last}} being most stable. In the {{hexavalent}} state, uranium {{is very similar}} to the group 6 elements. Many compounds of uranium(IV) and uranium(VI) are non-stoichiometric, i.e. have variable composition. For example, the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO2+x, where x varies between −0.4 and 0.32. Uranium(VI) compounds are weak oxidants. Most of them contain the linear [...] "uranyl" [...] group, [...] Between 4 and 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the <b>uranyl</b> group. The <b>uranyl</b> group acts as a hard acid and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. [...] and [...] are also the common form of Np and Pu in the +6 oxidation state. Uranium(IV) compounds exhibit reducing properties, e.g., they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Uranium(III) is a very strong reducing agent. Owing to the presence of d-shell, uranium (as well as many other actinides) forms organometallic compounds, such as UIII(C5H5)3 and UIV(C5H5)4.|$|E
500|$|Normal {{functioning}} of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal. Uranium is also a reproductive toxicant. Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation, the primary form of 238U decay, has a very short range, and will not penetrate skin. Alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers. [...] <b>Uranyl</b> (...) ions, such as from uranium trioxide or <b>uranyl</b> nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds, {{have been shown to}} cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals. While the CDC has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium, exposure to uranium and its decay products, especially radon, are widely known and significant health threats. Exposure to strontium-90, iodine-131, and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure, but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons.|$|E
500|$|Np(VI) or , the neptunyl ion, shows a light pink or reddish {{color in}} an acidic {{solution}} and yellow-green otherwise. It {{is a strong}} Lewis acid and is the main neptunium ion encountered in solutions of pH3–4. Though stable in acidic solutions, it is quite easily reduced to the Np(V) ion, {{and it is not}} as stable as the homologous hexavalent ions of its neighbours uranium and plutonium (the <b>uranyl</b> and plutonyl ions). It hydrolyzes in basic solutions to form the oxo and hydroxo ions NpO2OH+, , and [...]|$|E
500|$|Uranium ore {{was crushed}} and {{dissolved}} in acids. Impurities were separated and uranium oxide was precipitated. Radium {{was returned to}} Union Minière under the contract with the company. [...] The uranium oxide was then purified. It was dissolved in nitric acid to produce <b>uranyl</b> nitrate. This was then dissolved [...] in ether, drawn off and precipitated {{by the addition of}} ammonia, producing ammonium diuranate. The ammonium diuranate was heated in a furnace and reduced with hydrogen and hydrofluoric acid to produce uranium tetrafluoride. Heating and mixing with calcium metal reduced it to metallic uranium, leaving calcium fluoride behind as a slag. The metallic uranium was then cast into billets. These were extruded into rods and sealed in aluminium cans.|$|E
500|$|Analogously to its neighbours, uranium and plutonium, {{the order}} of the {{neptunium}} ions in terms of complex formation ability is Np4+ > [...] ≥ Np3+ > [...] (The relative order of the middle two neptunium ions depends on the ligands and solvents used.) The stability sequence for Np(IV), Np(V), and Np(VI) complexes with monovalent inorganic ligands is F− > [...] > SCN− > [...] > Cl− > the order for divalent inorganic ligands is [...] > [...] > [...] These follow the strengths of the corresponding acids. The divalent ligands are more strongly complexing than the monovalent ones. [...] can also form the complex ions [...] (M = Al, Ga, Sc, In, Fe, Cr, Rh) in perchloric acid solution: the strength of interaction between the two cations follows the order Fe > In > Sc > Ga > Al. The neptunyl and <b>uranyl</b> ions can also form a complex together.|$|E
2500|$|... a {{more stable}} <b>uranyl</b> peroxide, often found in the surface of spent nuclear fuel exposed to water. Reports on the {{corrosion}} of uranium metal have been published by the Royal Society.|$|E
2500|$|... {{magnesium}} diuranate (MgU2O7), {{which forms}} {{part of some}} yellowcakes. It {{is worth noting that}} uranates of the form M2UO4 do not contain [...] ions, but rather flattened UO6 octahedra, containing a <b>uranyl</b> group and bridging oxygens.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{surfaces}} of the lava flows have started to show new uranium minerals such as UO3·2H2O (eliantinite), (UO2)O2·4H2O (studtite), <b>uranyl</b> carbonate (rutherfordine), and two unnamed compounds [...] and Na3U(CO3)2·2H2O. These are soluble in water, allowing mobilization and transport of uranium. They look like whitish yellow patches {{on the surface of}} the solidified corium. These secondary minerals show several hundred times lower concentration of plutonium and several times higher concentration of uranium than the lava itself.|$|E
2500|$|Staining – uses {{heavy metals}} such as lead, uranium or {{tungsten}} to scatter imaging electrons and thus give contrast between different structures, since many (especially biological) materials are nearly [...] "transparent" [...] to electrons (weak phase objects). In biology, specimens can be stained [...] "en bloc" [...] before embedding and also later after sectioning. Typically thin sections are stained {{for several minutes}} with an aqueous or alcoholic solution of <b>uranyl</b> acetate followed by aqueous lead citrate.|$|E
