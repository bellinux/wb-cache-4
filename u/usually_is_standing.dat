50|$|Like other bodhisattvas, Ksitigarbha <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> seen <b>standing</b> on a lotus base, symbolising {{his release}} from rebirth. Ksitigarbha's face and head are also idealised, {{featuring}} the third eye, elongated ears and the other standard attributes of a buddha.|$|R
25|$|Maitreya is {{typically}} pictured seated, with either both {{feet on the}} ground or crossed at the ankles, on a throne, waiting for his time. He is dressed in the clothes of either a bhikṣu or Indian royalty. As a bodhisattva, he would <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> and dressed in jewels. Usually he wears a small stupa in his headdress that represents the stupa with relics of Gautama Buddha to help him identify it when his turn comes to lay claim to his succession and can be holding a dharmachakra resting on a lotus. A khata is always tied around his waist as a girdle.|$|R
50|$|He <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> {{represented}} <b>standing</b> on {{a little}} hill, with a dove on his shoulder.|$|R
2500|$|The body posture {{for users}} of urinals <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> the <b>standing</b> position, except for urinals {{intended}} for females {{which may be}} used in more of a [...] "hovering" [...] position (partial squat), or even a full squatting position.|$|R
25|$|The vice-presidents {{assist the}} president. At {{any given time}} there <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> between three and five vice-presidents. <b>Usually</b> vice-presidents <b>are</b> long <b>standing</b> {{members of the board}} of {{trustees}} who have been particular active, often as committee chairs. It is common for vice-presidents to eventually become president, and they are often chosen to be vice-president with this in mind.|$|R
50|$|The {{supporters}} are a golden (or) lion on the dexter (viewer's left) and a golden (or) kangaroo on the sinister (viewer's right). The supporters <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> depicted <b>standing</b> upon the motto ribbon as they hold the shield in an upright position.|$|R
50|$|Swathing (windrowing) is {{more common}} in the {{northern}} United States and Canada because the curing time for grain crops is reduced by cutting the plant stems. In regions with longer growing seasons, grain crops <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> left <b>standing</b> and harvested directly by combines.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "flattop" [...] {{is a type}} {{of short}} haircut where the hair {{on the top of the}} head <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>standing</b> upright and cut to form a flat-appearing deck. This deck may be level, or it may be upward or {{downward}} sloping. This type of haircut <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> performed with electric clippers, either freehand or using the clipper-over-comb method.|$|R
50|$|Rokita is a Polish folk devil. He was {{specifically}} busy corrupting peasants, as opposed to, say, Boruta who {{dealt with the}} noblemen. While sometimes shown in any rustic setting, he <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> pictured <b>standing</b> on or near a willow tree {{at the edge of}} a swamp.|$|R
50|$|The drum, made of an {{inflated}} animal bladder or taut animal hide, is {{secured to}} {{the centre of}} a long stick. A thick string is then attached to {{each end of the}} stick, securing the bladder. It <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> played <b>standing</b> upright by drawing the bow over the string.|$|R
5000|$|Mystery Box: [...] The contestants {{found another}} huge mystery box where the judges <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>standing.</b> Inside {{the box was}} the competitors' loved ones. The theme of this episode's mystery box was a dish that is {{inspired}} by their respective loved ones. Natasha's, Jessie's, and Luca's were chosen to be the top three dishes, with Luca's being singled {{out to be the}} best.|$|R
60|$|The milking of {{the cows}} was a sight Mrs. Poyser loved, {{and at this}} hour on mild days she <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> <b>standing</b> at the house door, with her {{knitting}} in her hands, in quiet contemplation, only heightened to a keener interest when the vicious yellow cow, who had once kicked over a pailful of precious milk, was about to undergo the preventive punishment of having her hinder-legs strapped.|$|R
50|$|The Hellespontine Sibyl was the priestess {{presiding}} over the Apollonian oracle at Dardania. The Sibyl is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Trojan Sibyl. The word Sibyl comes (via Latin) from the ancient Latin word sibylla, meaning prophetess or oracle. There were many Sibyls in the ancient world but this one is known for her prediction of the Crucifixion, and <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> shown <b>standing</b> beside a Cross.|$|R
50|$|One side of {{the ground}} is fully seated with {{terracing}} and a television tower behind it, with a grandstand/dressing rooms in the corner. In winter, temporary stands and temporary corporate facilities boost the capacity to around 5,000. It <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>standing</b> room only come game day, {{with some of the}} better seats on the balconies of the blocks of flats overlooking the ground. The oval is situated directly across the road from both Coogee Beach and Randwick Rugby Club.|$|R
50|$|Krishna {{is often}} {{depicted}} wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, {{and playing the}} bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> shown <b>standing</b> with one leg bent {{in front of the}} other in the Tribhanga posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as an amorous man with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{material}} {{of the cape}} has varied with different writers, sometimes being depicted as bulletproof'''' and fire resistant, and other times being made of simple fabric that tears easily and is continuously replaced. For example, in the Batman: The Animated Series episode [...] "Robin's Reckoning", Batman fell through a floor heavily compromised by machine-gun fire and landed badly, hurting his leg. He ripped up his cape and used some pieces of broken wood to make an impromptu ankle splint. He is also commonly seen with the cape able to wrap around his entire body, <b>usually</b> whenever he <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> or sometimes, when walking.|$|R
25|$|In {{classical}} depictions, Athena <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> portrayed <b>standing</b> upright, {{wearing a}} full-length chiton. She is sometimes dressed in armor, {{and is often}} represented wearing a Corinthian helmet raised high atop her forehead. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis {{with the head of}} the gorgon (gorgoneion) in the center and snakes around the edge. It <b>is</b> in this <b>standing</b> posture that she was depicted in Phidias's famous lost gold and ivory statue of her, 36 m tall, the Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon.|$|R
5|$|Krishna {{is often}} {{depicted}} wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, {{and playing the}} bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> shown <b>standing</b> with one leg bent {{in front of the}} other in the Tribhanga posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic and seductive man with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.|$|R
50|$|With {{most of the}} {{population}} remaining active in (or indirectly dependent on) the agricultural sector, the main pressure in most areas remained land clearing for crop and cattle farming. Enough wild green <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> left <b>standing</b> (and partially used, for example, to collect firewood, timber and fruits, or to graze pigs) for wildlife to remain viable. The elite's (nobility and higher clergy) protection of their own hunting privileges and game often protected significant woodlands.|$|R
40|$|It <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> {{assumed that}} the {{resonator}} based on a waveguide has the eigen oscillations that are formed by interference of two waves which propagate in different directions and have equal amplitudes. These patterns <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> called <b>standing</b> waves. We {{have shown that the}} eigen oscillations of a resonator which is filled by a layered dielectric can be base on the evanescent (non-propagating) waves. In some cases we need only one eigen wave to compose the eigen oscillation of a closed cavity. Comment: PDF, 3 pages with 7 figures, corrected typo...|$|R
40|$|The 90 th General Assembly {{opened its}} Regular Session on January 12 and {{recessed}} on April 9. Meetings of the House and Senate education committees <b>were</b> <b>usually</b> <b>standing</b> room only for discussions {{of a broad}} range of bills on early childhood, K- 12, and higher education issues. The purpose of this policy brief is to review the K- 12 bills that garnered the most attention and have been signed into law by firstterm Governor Asa Hutchinson. These highlights are organized into several categories as shown in This Brie...|$|R
50|$|Breeding occurs {{once a year}} {{in spring}} or early summer in {{southern}} areas of its range (southern Australia and New Zealand), and after the monsoon in tropical regions. The nest is a platform built of branches and sticks, often still green with leaves in the forks of trees, <b>usually</b> eucalypts that <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> in water. Nests are often located near other waterbirds such as other cormorants, herons, ibises or spoonbills. Four or five pale blue oval eggs measuring 46 x 31 mm are laid. The eggs are covered with {{a thin layer of}} lime, giving them a matte white coated appearance. They become increasingly stained with faeces, as does the nest, over the duration of the breeding season.|$|R
2500|$|Cramer <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>standing</b> up {{with the}} fisheye lens Steadicam close to his face, while {{providing}} stock picks and investing advice. His voice inflection often changes from calm to shouting then back to a calm tone. Cramer also throws various objects around the set. Whenever one of his books is mentioned by a caller, he grabs the book, flashes it, and tosses {{it to the floor}} as a plug gag. In addition, he has a panel of oversized red buttons, which activate various sound effects. [...] The online version of the show's sound board is available at madmoney.cnbc.com.|$|R
50|$|It is {{commonly}} used for weather forecast broadcasts, wherein a news presenter <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> seen <b>standing</b> {{in front of a}} large CGI map during live television newscasts, though in actuality it is a large blue or green background. When using a blue screen, different weather maps are added on the parts of the image where the color is blue. If the news presenter wears blue clothes, his or her clothes will also be replaced with the background video. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in movies and videogames.|$|R
5000|$|Chhinnamasta (छिन्नमस्ता, , [...] "She {{whose head}} is severed"), often spelled Chinnamasta and also called Chhinnamastika and Prachanda Chandika, {{is one of}} the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and a ferocious aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. Chhinnamasta can be easily {{identified}} by her fearsome iconography. The self-decapitated goddess holds her own severed head in one hand, a scimitar in another. Three jets of blood spurt out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two attendants. Chhinnamasta <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> depicted <b>standing</b> on a copulating couple.|$|R
50|$|The angle {{subtended}} at P between Z and X is the Local Hour Angle (LHA)of X. If Z {{is on the}} Greenwich Meridian, {{then that}} Angle must be the Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA) of X. If Z {{is not on the}} Greenwich Meridian, then you have the Local Hour Angle (LHA) of X, and if you know the GHA of X, {{all you need to do}} is add subtract the LHA of X accordingly, to discover the Longitude of Z. As you <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>standing</b> on the point Z, you have your Longitude. If the sum comes to more than 360 degrees, simply subtract 360, the answer is simple.|$|R
50|$|Blood Curse puts an {{emphasis}} on stealth gameplay. When the player enters a shibito's vicinity, a heartbeat-like drum will sound to warn the player. Shibito <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> found <b>standing</b> guard at certain points, preventing entry; or patrolling the area on a set path. Should the player get a shibito's attention, it will attack the player until the latter's death. It is possible to knock a shibito out for {{a small amount of}} time; however, it will eventually resurrect and attack again. If the player manages to successfully hide from an alerted Shibito, it may give up and resume its idle activity.|$|R
50|$|Moltopera {{has stated}} its belief in giving vivid and {{rational}} directions. In {{an article by}} Tom Huizenga for Deceptive Cadence, it is pointed out that an opera has to compete {{with all the other}} 21st century possibilities of entertainment like 3D films or PlayStation, as their primary target group has easy and wide access to these other free time activities. Moltopera believes the best example of this way of thinking is their Don Giovanni Sextet rendition, which <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> sung <b>standing</b> in a half circle around Leporello, but László Ágoston directing a full, moving episode from it.|$|R
5000|$|To [...] every {{possible}} size of bar stock ({{every possible}} {{fraction of a}} millimetre or inch in diameter or thickness) is impossible. Thus, bar stock is stocked by metals supply houses in various standard sizes, arrayed in discrete steps. For example, round bar with diameters of even millimetres (or in the USA, on the eighths of an inch) can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> ordered from <b>standing</b> [...] Bar diameters of nonstandard sizes can also be obtained, but only as a separate mill run from the rolling mill. Thus {{they are much more}} expensive than the standard sizes, can take much longer delivery time, and are not desirable as inventory for the supply house or the machine shop (because the chance of selling or using any particular custom size is slim).|$|R
50|$|In {{his best}} works, Pantoja {{introduced}} an impressive combination of sophistication and geometric abstraction achieved {{by means of}} powerful contrast of light and shadow. His portraits are noted for the meticulous detail of representing the intricate embroidery of dresses and jewelry designs. The subject <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> portrayed <b>standing</b> against a dark background. The face and hands are depicted with a more flat and subtle technique. Among his portraits are: Philip III, Queen Margarita of Austria, 1606, Prado, Madrid). Infanta Isabel Clara Eugenia (1599), Alte Pinakothek, Munich. (Duchess of Braganza, 1603, col.; Unknown lady, col. Marquess of Viana; D. Diego de Valmayor, 1605, Hermitage, St Petersburg.|$|R
50|$|In Spain, menhirs {{associated}} with the western European megalithic industry are relatively unusual compared to dolmens, but still are common sights in the northern half of the country, where at least 500 menhirs have been reported. They are particularly common in the Basque Country, Navarre, northern Burgos and Palencia, Cantabria, and the Pyrenees, where they <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> encountered <b>standing</b> alone or in small groups (cromlech) in elevated locations; the Arlobi menhir {{is one of the}} most recent examples of a menhir. Most of the menhirs in northern Spain appear to date back to the stone age; they <b>are</b> not <b>usually</b> {{associated with}} burials, but in at least one instance (the Menhir of Cuesta del Molino in Burgos) burials dating at least 2000 years after the menhir was originally built have been found.|$|R
50|$|With a large {{rectangular}} pressing-floor, such as Christ <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> shown <b>standing</b> in, {{the screw}} might be located centrally, with framework on both sides. Either a large plate underneath the screw would press down on grapes {{placed in the}} rectangular floor, or a smaller one on grapes in a circular barrel-like basket sitting on the floor, the juice usually flowing out onto the floor and being collected from a discharge point in that. Both the real presses shown below are of this latter type. As the general standard of artistic depictions of complicated mechanicisms improved in the Renaissance, with a fuller understanding of graphical perspective, some images after about 1500 show more realistic large plates pressing down on Christ, still a difficult depiction for the artist to represent.|$|R
5000|$|The Bodmin Unionists {{had already}} {{selected}} Major-General Sir Frederick Cuthbert Poole as the Coalition candidate to replace Sir Charles Hanson who had indicated he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> {{down at the}} next election. [...] Poole was Hanson's son-in-law. [...] Poole has <b>usually</b> <b>been</b> described as a Coalition Conservative but The Times newspaper did refer {{to him as a}} Coalition Liberal in its report on the by-election polling day.|$|R
2500|$|Parlor magic [...] is {{done for}} larger audiences than {{close-up}} magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>standing</b> and {{on the same level}} as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians by T.A. Waters, [...] "The phrase [...] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance." [...] Also, many magicians consider the term [...] "parlor" [...] old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be [...] "platform," [...] "club" [...] or [...] "cabaret." [...] Examples of such magicians include Jeff McBride, David Abbott, Channing Pollock, Black Herman, and Fred Kaps.|$|R
60|$|As they <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> in the crowd, their {{conversation}} ran partly on Repeal and O'Connell, and partly on matrimony and Anty Lynch, as the lady <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> called {{by those who}} knew her best.|$|R
60|$|We {{have come}} across real infants {{now and then}} in the course of visits to married friends; they have been brought to us from {{outlying}} parts of the house and introduced to us for our edification; and we have found them gritty and sticky. Their boots have <b>usually</b> <b>been</b> muddy, and they have wiped them up against our new trousers. And their hair has suggested the idea that they have <b>been</b> <b>standing</b> on their heads in the dust-bin.|$|R
