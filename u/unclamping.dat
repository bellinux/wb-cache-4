The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the renal effect of Mg following <b>unclamping</b> of the supraceliac aorta. Mongrels were divided into two groups, control (group C, n= 7) and Mg group (group Mg, n= 7). In group Mg, 30 mg/kg MgSO 4 was injected as a bolus immediately prior to <b>unclamping</b> the supraceliac aorta and thereafter as an infusion (10 mg/kg/hr).

Anesthesia was maintained with a continuous infusion of sufentanil (0. 5 - 1 &mu;g/kg/hr), isoflurane (0. 5 - 1 %), and air/O 2 (FIO 2 = 0. 5). Fluid loading with Ring-er’s lactate and 5 % albumin was initiated ten to twenty minutes before aortic <b>unclamping.</b> Hemodynamic measurements and assessment of RVF were per-formed ten to twenty minutes before and after aortic <b>unclamping.</b> Aortic un-clamping after fluid loading decreased right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDV, RVESV) but increased right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (p < 0. 01). There were no significant changes in cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and cardic filling pressures: central venous pressure (CVP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pres-sure (PCWP). There was a poor correlation between RVEDV and PCWP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Unclamped laparoscopic hand-assisted partial nephrectomy was performed on eight consecutive patients from June 2009 to March 2010. All patients had predominantly endophytic renal masses with a preferential enhancing rim noted on the pre-operative computed tomography. The <b>unclamped</b> hand-assisted approach was utilized for no warm ischemia, minimal blood loss, and enhanced visualization of the tumor bed with improved operative exposure. RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 55. 8 years. All patients underwent <b>unclamped</b> hand-assisted partial nephrectomy (ie, zero ischemia). Mean estimated blood loss was 368. 8 cc (range, 100 to 800 cc) and mean operation time was 236. 9 minutes (range, 175 to 272 minutes). There were no intra-operative complications and no open conversions. There was one grade II (ileus with small pneumothorax) and one grade IV (pulmonary embolism) in the 90 -day peri-operative period. There was one positive surgical margin, which was recognized intra-operatively.

30|$|An {{earthquake}} {{fault rupture}} permanently deforms the surrounding crust, changing {{the stress on}} nearby faults {{as a function of}} their location, geometry and sense of slip (rake). The Coulomb stress change is defined as ΔCFF = Δτ + μΔσ, where τ is the shear stress on the fault (positive in the inferred direction of slip), σ is the normal stress (positive for fault <b>unclamping),</b> and μ is the apparent friction coefficient.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The causative role of consumptive {{coagulopathy}} in {{the development}} of bleeding complications after supraceliac (SC) aortic cross-clamping (AXC) has been challenged by recent reports that ascribe this coagulopathy to primary fibrinolysis. This theory is {{made on the basis of}} evidence that tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen (Ag) levels increase after SC AXC. However, t-PA Ag levels reflect both active and inactive (bound to serum t-PA inhibitors) forms of serum t-PA, and elevations confirm the presence of fibrinolysis only in conjunction with an increase in t-PA activity. Methods: To investigate the etiology of this coagulopathy, we submitted eight pigs to SC AXC and six pigs to infrarenal (IR) AXC for 30 minutes. Blood was drawn from the portal vein, the hepatic vein, and the carotid artery before AXC, just before <b>unclamping,</b> and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen (FBG), platelets (PLT), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), t-PA Ag, t-PA activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), and α 2 -antiplasmin (AP) activities were measured. Statistical analysis was performed by using repeated measures analysis of variance and t tests Results: The PT did not differ between the two groups at any point. After <b>unclamping,</b> in the SC group there was a drop in PLT levels (P =. 005), a decrease in FBG levels (P <. 001), and a trend toward PTT prolongation (P =. 06) compared with baseline. In contrast, there were no changes in PTT, PLT levels, or FBG levels in the IR group. TAT, a serum marker of thrombin generation, increased with SC AXC (P =. 04), remained elevated 5 minutes after <b>unclamping</b> (P =. 08), and returned to normal 30 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> In contrast, TAT levels did not change in the IR control group. In the SC AXC group, the TAT levels did not differ between the three test sites at any time. SC AXC was associated with an increase in t-PA Ag just before <b>unclamping</b> (P <. 001) and 5 minutes after <b>unclamping</b> (P =. 002), but IR AXC was not. t-PA activity levels decreased in both experimental groups 30 and 60 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> Levels of α 2 -AP activity decreased to a similar degree in both groups after <b>unclamping</b> when compared with baseline Conclusion: Thirty minutes of SC AXC results in intravascular thrombosis that cannot be localized to the ischemic visceral circulation. This intravascular thrombosis is associated with consumption of clotting factors. Thirty minutes of SC AXC causes an activation of fibrinolytic pathways that does not result in a hyperfibrinolytic state. An increase in t-PA Ag without a rise in t-PA activity does not represent true fibrinolysis, but rather an increase in the bound, inactive forms of serum t-PA. Both IR and SC AXC result in decreased fibrinolytic activity (“fibrinolytic shutdown”) after release of the aortic clamp.  (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 100 - 8. ...|$|E

METHODS: Invasive intraoperative monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PaCO 2, and right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) monitoring of blood flow parameters (mean velocity "Vm" and pulsatility index "PI") by transcranial Doppler were performed as well as evaluation of the four parameters during these subsequent periods: pre-cross-clamping, pre-unclamping, <b>unclamping</b> and 1 - 5 - 10 - 20 minutes after abdominal aortic <b>unclamping.</b> RESULTS: No significative changes of MAP, PaCO 2, Vm and PI were noticed during the aortic cross-clamping period (77. 5 +/- 18. 5 SD minutes). During aortic <b>unclamping</b> Vm and MAP decreased (64 +/- 20 vs 52 +/- 20 cm/sec, p < 0. 05, and 101 +/- 8 vs 80 +/- 15 mmHg, p < 0. 01, respectively). At the 1 th post-unclamping minute {{there was an increase}} from pre-unclamping values of Vm (75 +/- 20 cm/sec, p < 0. 05) and PaCO 2 (42 +/- 1. 5 vs 36 +/- 2 mmHg, p < 0. 05), with persistent reduction of MAP (92 +/- mmHg, p < 0. 05), even more evident at the 5 th post-unclamping minute (Vm = 93 +/- 25 cm/sec; PaCO 2 = 46 +/- 1. 2 mmHg, p < 0. 001, and MAP returned to pre-unclamping value), in which there was also a decrease of PI (0. 65 +/- 0. 16 vs 0. 78 +/- 0. 2, p < 0. 05). At the 10 th minute Vm (83 +/- 24 cm/sec, p < 0. 02) and PaCO 2 (41 +/- 1. 5 mmHg, p < 0. 05) increments were present together with persistent reduction of PI (0. 69 +/- 0. 17, p < 0. 05), while at the 20 th post-unclamping minute also Vm, PaCO 2 and PI returned to their pre-unclamping values. CONCLUSIONS: The Vm decrease at aortic <b>unclamping</b> might correlate with the acute changes in MAP (blood steal hypovolemia) and is likely due to an inadequate cerebral autoregulatory response to abrupt MAP changes. The arterial CO 2 increase after aortic <b>unclamping</b> could lead to a dilation of cerebral arterioles and a rise of CBF (increase of Vm and decrease of PI).

40|$|Power modules {{typically}} {{comprise of}} several power devices {{connected in parallel}} {{for the purpose of}} delivering high current capability. This is especially the case in SiC where small active area and low current MOSFETs are the only option due to defect density control and yield issues in the epitaxial growth of SiC wafers. Electrothermal variations between parallel connected devices can emerge from manufacturing variability, non-uniform degradation rates, variation in gate driving just to mention a few. The impact of electrothermal variation between parallel-connected devices as a function of device technology is thus important to consider especially since failure of the power module requires only failure in a single device. Furthermore, the impact of these electrothermal variations in parallel-connected devices on the total electrothermal ruggedness of the power module under anomalous switching conditions like <b>unclamped</b> inductive switching is important to consider for the different device technologies. In this thesis, the impact of initial junction temperature variation, switching rates and thermal boundary conditions between parallel-connected diodes have been evaluated for SiC Schottky and silicon PiN diodes under clamped and <b>unclamped</b> inductive switching. Finite element simulations have been used to support the experimental measurements. Similar studies have been performed in CoolMOS super-junction MOSFETs, silicon IGBTs and SiC power MOSFETs. New insights regarding the failure of parallel connected devices under <b>unclamped</b> inductive switching have been revealed from the models and measurements.

Large and small waves also share the same latency distributions and spectral sensitivity. We suggest that small waves may result from the activation of damaged membrane areas. Large waves have an average amplitude of approximately 5 nA in voltage-clamped photoreceptors. It probably requires several square microns of cell membrane to support this much photocurrent. Thus the amplification inherent in the discrete wave process may involve spatial spread of activation from unimolecular dimensions to several square microns of cell membrane surface.

Methods and results: We evaluated protein C activation during cardiopulmonary bypass and coronary reperfusion in 20 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. During cardiopulmonary bypass {{and during the}} 10 minutes after aortic <b>unclamping,</b> the plasma levels of protein C (mean ± standard error of the mean) decreased from 123 % ± 7 % to 74 % ± 5 % of normal mean. In contrast, the levels of activated protein C in plasma increased from 122 % ± 8 % to 159 % ± 21 %, and the activated protein C/protein C ratio increased from 1. 04 ± 0. 08 to 2. 29 ± 0. 31 (P =. 006, 2 -tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test). Patients were stratified {{on the basis of}} the increase in activated protein C in the coronary sinus plasma at 10 minutes after reperfusion by means of the arbitrary value of 1. 5 for the activated protein C/protein C ratio. Within 24 hours, the patients with low increases in activated protein C (ratio 1. 5). The rapid increase in activated protein C during the first 10 minutes after aortic <b>unclamping</b> indicated protein C activation in the reperfused vascular beds.

40|$|The authors {{present the}} {{fundamental}} equations of piezoelectricity and references. They show how a second {{form of the}} equations and {{a second set of}} coefficients can be found, through inversions involving the elasticity tensor. They show how to compute the clamped permittivity matrix from the <b>unclamped</b> matrix. The authors list the program pzansys. ftn and present examples of its use. This program does the conversions and calculations needed by the finite element program ANSYS...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of high resistivity CdTe which {{are relevant to}} its use for electro-optic modulation have been investigated at 3. 39 and 10. 6 µ. The <b>unclamped</b> electro-optic characteristic n 0 ^ 3 r 41 of CdTe {{was found to be}} 12 × 10 ^– 11 m/V and the absorption coefficient is 0. 006 cm^– 1. Our measurements indicate that CdTe will be a very important material for electro-optic modulation in the infrared...|$|R
