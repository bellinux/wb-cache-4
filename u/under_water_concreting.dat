A {{large number}} of non-dispersible {{underwater}} concrete materials will be extensively used in works which span over rivers and sea, so {{it is important to}} study the performance of non-dispersible <b>under</b> <b>water</b> <b>concrete</b> structures. Non-dispersible underwater concrete is the concrete mixing with special additives-anti-washout admixture, which is a kind of water-soluble polymers with long-chain structure and strong absorption capacity. In the present paper, the axial and eccentric compression performance of non-dispersible underwater concrete columns were experimentally investigated. The failure modes and loading capacity of the columns of non-dispersible underwater concrete were mainly discussed. The experimental results showed that the compression performance of non-dispersible underwater reinforced concrete columns and the common reinforced ones are similar in some aspects...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a research aimed at studying the effect of replacing part of portland cement with fly ash and bottom ash, both from municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI). Fly ash was subjected to a washing treatment to reduce the chloride content, while bottom ash was subjected to dry grinding or wet grinding <b>under</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Concretes</b> with addition of different types of ashes, including a traditional coal fly ash, were manufactured. Fresh and hardened properties of the concretes were compared in order to study the advantages and the side effects of each type of addition. Results showed that MSWI bottom ash is potentially attractive as mineral addition for the production of concrete, provided that the risk of entrapment of hydrogen bubbles produced by corrosion of aluminium metallic particles in the fresh concrete is prevented. This could be achieved by wet grinding the bottom ash so that reactions leading to gas development exhaust within the slurry before this is added to the concrete mixture. However, by considering bottom ashes from different incinerators, a great variability was observed in the time required to complete the hydrogen gas production. Nevertheless, when the hydrogen development in the fresh concrete could be avoided, wet ground MSWI bottom showed a good pozzolanic behavior and proved to give a significant contribution {{to the development of the}} strength and impermeability of concrete...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} aim at {{investigating}} the thermal stability of concrete paste blended with ordinary Portland cement and saw dust ash (OPC/SDA). The SDA is thermally activated at 800 oC for 2 hours and the concrete pastes prepared with constant consistency. The pastes {{were kept in}} moulds at room temperature and 100 % relative humidity for 24 hours and then hydrated for 28 days <b>under</b> <b>water.</b> The hydrated <b>concrete</b> pastes were exposed for 2 hours to temperatures of 200, 400, 600, and 800 oC. The hydrated concrete specimens were tested for compressive strength and thermal shock stability after heat treatment. It was found that, the compressive strength of the control cement paste concrete increase up to 400 oC and suffers a more loss of compressive strength as the treatment temperatures were increased. However, the blended cement paste concrete experience an increase in compressive strength with temperature up to 600 oC and then, the strength decrease as the treatment temperature was increased up to 800 oC. The replacement of OPC with 10 % SDA in the blended cement paste concrete increases the thermal shock resistance by about 4 {{times that of the}} control cement paste concrete. Blending o...|$|R

So it is necessary to make scheme and to do high protection of to achieve maximum beneficiary. Necessity of this management is going to be felt by developing these sources and human's interference. However, in the past overtopping phenomenon was the first reason of dam's destruction, but nowadays by increasing of spate design's period, the significant problem that researchers are interfere with, is seepage problem. The purpose of solving the underground problems is to procure height of water as a function of coordinate and time. In observation of practical industries, we can use the mathematical models that simulate the water flow in porous media. Often, in large areas, examinations are impossible and too expensive.

40|$|The authors {{used the}} Monte Carlo {{transport}} code Los Alamos High-Energy Transport (LAHET) {{to study the}} shielding effectiveness of common shielding materials for high-energy neutrons. The source neutron spectrum was from the interaction of an 800 -MeV proton beam and iron target. In a normal incident, the neutrons collided with walls made of six common shielding materials: <b>water,</b> <b>concrete,</b> iron, lead, polyethylene, and soil. The walls were of four different thicknesses: 25, 50, 75 and 100 cm. They then tallied the neutron spectra {{on the other side}} of the shielding wall and calculated the neutron doses. For the high-Z materials [...] iron and lead [...] they find that many neutrons with energies between 1 [...] 10 MeV are created when high-energy neutrons interact with shielding materials. For materials containing low-Z elements [...] <b>water,</b> soil, <b>concrete,</b> and polyethylene [...] the spectra show higher energy peaks at about 100 MeV. The studies show that for a given wall thickness, concrete is more effective than the other materials. They also studied the effectiveness of combinations of materials, such as <b>concrete</b> and <b>water,</b> <b>concrete</b> and soil, iron and polyethylene, or iron polyethylene and concrete...|$|R
40|$|Hundreds of ready-mix {{concrete}} trucks are dispatched daily from {{ready-mix concrete}} plants. On average, a concrete truck has a carrying capacity ranging from 7 to 9 cubic metres of concrete, requiring about 1500 litres of water. In addition, 500 to 1300 litres of water {{are used to}} wash out the excess concrete when the truck returns. Based on these figures, {{it is clear that}} the ready-mixed concrete industry consumes large amounts of fresh water. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using the wash water as mixing <b>water</b> in new <b>concrete.</b> The specific goal of this project is to determine the influence of the high pH and dissolved solids content of the wash water on the durability of concrete, particularly with respect to de-icing salt induced corrosion of steel reinforcement. Two types of mix designs were used in this research: a standard class N and a higher strength, structural C 2 concrete. Two sets of concretes specimens were made with both mix designs: one with wash water and one with clean water. The project consists of a multi-component experimental program, beginning with wash water characterization, then pore solution and cement chemistry, followed by an evaluation of the effect of wash <b>water</b> on <b>concrete</b> workability and mechanical properties, resistance to de-icing salt scaling, and corrosion of reinforcing steel embedded in the concrete. In addition, the effect of the wash water on the effectiveness of air entraining agents (AEA) is being determined using air void analysis of specimens with different AEA contents. On the basis of the results obtained from the comparative study using wash water versus tap water, it appears that wash water can be used as mixing water for the production of concrete without compromising the durability properties related to corrosion and salt scaling performance. In addition, the mechanical and plastic properties of wash <b>water</b> <b>concrete</b> meet all standards pertaining to the use of wash <b>water</b> <b>concrete</b> and are similar to those of tap <b>water</b> <b>concrete.</b> Finally, the pore solution, thermal analyses, and water analyses of wash water and tap water showed comparable results. Overall, with regards to the tests conducted thus far, the use of wash water as mixing <b>water</b> in <b>concrete</b> poses no durability concerns...|$|R

This study evaluates the characteristics of concrete produced with Atlantic ocean and Lagoon <b>water.</b> <b>Concrete</b> produced with tap water (regarded as potable drinking water) serves as the control experiment. Compressive strength, workability and density were used to evaluate the characteristics of concrete specimens. All the concrete samples have true shnnp with Lagoon <b>water</b> <b>concrete</b> having low workability and both tap and Atlantic ocean <b>water</b> <b>concrete</b> having medilllll workability. The concrete specimens produced with the three types of water fall into the category of normal weight concrete as their densities lie within the range of 2200 - 2600 kg m- 3 specified.

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{concrete}} is growing with the exploding scope of construction industry. This {{called for the}} extensive production and usage of cement. Among all the ingredients of concrete, cement has deleterious effects on environment. As the usage of concrete is inevitable, pre-emptive measures {{should be taken to}} reduce the usage of cement in concrete while maintaining the same engineering properties. To address this cause, research has been carried out on various constituents and parameters of concrete which lead to the realization of new construction materials and practices. But the scope of effects on concrete caused by altering the properties of water has long been neglected. On account of this obscurity, this can be potential area of interest. When water is magnetized, it exhibits structural changes which increases the specific surface area of water. When this magnetized water is used in concrete instead of normal water, it is found that the compressive strength increases considerably. This additional strength attained by the usage of magnetized water can be used to address the need to reduce cement usage. In this attempt to reduce the usage of cement, fly ash which has immense potential to be used in construction industry, can be used to replace cement in concrete to a considerable extent when magnetic water is used. The present research work is carried out to investigate the effect of Magnetic Water on the Compressive strength studies on fly ash based magnetic <b>water</b> <b>concrete</b> (M 30 & M 40 grade). Examine the effect of magnetic water on compressive strength studies are also conducted to evaluate microstructure on fly ash based magnetic <b>water</b> <b>concrete</b> (M 30 & M 40 grade).
