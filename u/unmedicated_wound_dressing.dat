Methods: Eighty-four patients were randomly allocated into a traditional care group, a surgical <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> group, and a modified surgical <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> group. Each group comprised 28 patients. The following outcomes were observed and analyzed: infection rate, <b>wound</b> closure time, <b>dressing</b> change frequency, cost of wound care, and patients' comfort. Results: The infection rate, <b>wound</b> closure time, <b>dressing</b> change frequency, and cost of wound care were much higher in the traditional care group than in the surgical <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> group and modified surgical <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> group.

40|$|Introduction: A {{variety of}} effects {{may result in}} the {{occurrence}} of a wound which may result in immediate loss of {{all or part of}} organ functioning, sympathetic stress response, hemorrhage and blood clotting, bacterial contamination and death of cells. Careful asepsis is {{the most important factor in}} keeping these effects to a minimum and promoting the successful care of wounds which is dependent on the nurse’s knowledge and understanding of normal wound healing physiology, method of closure and the optimal treatment of the wound and with this knowledge, nurses can provide a systematic and holistic patient assessment, and consider any potential wound related complications (Vuolo JC 2006). Aim: This investigation aimed to assess <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> performances among nursing personnel in the three surgical wards of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (O. O. U. T. H.) Shagamu Ogun State Nigeria. Methodology:The investigators utilized the descriptive method of research. A total of sixty nursing personnel in the male, female, and paediatric surgical wards were randomly selected for the investigation. Performance of <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> was assessed through an investigators formulated questionnaire and evaluation checklist based on the concept of sterile <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> technique. Results: Nurses have a very good performance of <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> as they applied the concepts/principles of sterile technique in the performance of the procedure. There was no significant difference between nurses in the performance of <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> and their demographic variables such as age, gender, religion, and educational qualification.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{majority}} of wound infections after median sternotomy in obese patients are {{triggered by the}} breakdown of skin sutures and subsequent seepage of skin flora. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate negative pressure <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> treatment for the prevention of infection. We hypothesized that negative pressure <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> treatment for 6 to 7 days applied immediately after skin closure reduces the numbers of wound infections. MethodsIn a prospective study, 150 consecutive obese patients (body mass index ≥  30) with cardiac surgery performed via median sternotomy were analyzed. In the negative pressure <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> treatment group (n =  75), a foam dressing (Prevena, KCI, Wiesbaden, Germany) was placed immediately after skin suturing, and negative pressure of − 125 mm Hg was applied for 6 to 7 days. In the control group (n =  75), conventional wound dressings were used. The primary end point was wound infection within 90 days. Mann–Whitney U test and Fisher exact test were used. Freedom from infection was estimated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. ResultsThree of 75 patients (4 %) with continuous negative pressure <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> treatment had <b>wound</b> infections compared with 12 of 75 patients (16 %) with conventional sterile <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> (P = . 0266; odds ratio, 4. 57; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 23 - 16. 94). Wound infections with Gram-positive skin flora were found in only 1 patient in the negative pressure <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> treatment group compared with 10 patients in the control group (P = . 0090; odds ratio, 11. 39; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 42 - 91. 36).

40|$|To {{develop a}} gentamicin-loaded <b>wound</b> <b>dressing,</b> {{cross-linked}} hydrogel films were prepared with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and dextran using the freezing–thawing method. Their gel properties such as gel fraction, swelling, {{water vapor transmission}} test, morphology, tensile strength, and thermal property were investigated. In vitro protein adsorption test, in vivo wound healing test, and histopathology were performed. Dextran decreased the gel fraction, maximum strength, and thermal stability of hydrogels. However, it increased the swelling ability, water vapor transmission rate, elasticity, porosity, and protein adsorption. The drug gave a little {{positive effect on the}} gel properties of hydrogels. The gentamicin-loaded <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> composed of 2. 5 % PVA, 1. 13 % dextran, and 0. 1 % drug was more swellable, flexible, and elastic than that with only PVA because of its cross-linking interaction with PVA.

To meet these requirements a new type of polyurethane <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> which consists of a microporous top layer (pore size < 0. 7 pm) supported by a sublayer with a highly porous sponge-like structure containing micropores (pore size < 10 pm) as well as macropores (pore size: 50 - 100 pm) was designed. The pores of both layers are interconnected and form a continuous structure in the membrane. Membranes according to this design were prepared either by means of a two-step or by means of a one-step casting process. Both fabrication methods are based on phase inversion techniques. Asymmetric polyurethane Biomer @ membranes prepared by the two-step casting process were tested in vivo as full thickness skin substitutes using guinea pigs.
