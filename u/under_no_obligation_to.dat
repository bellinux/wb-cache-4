5|$|The game's city {{environment}} is modeled after Chicago, including {{many of its}} landmarks, such as the 'L', the Willis Tower (then known as the Sears Tower), Wrigley Field, and Soldier Field. The streets feature a number of objects into which the player can crash, including trash bins, parking meters, mailboxes, and traffic lights. In Checkpoint, other vehicles move in accordance with traffic lights, but the player is <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> obey them.|$|E
5|$|From these positions, the New Zealanders {{were ordered}} to capture Belhamed, Sidi Rezegh proper and Ed Duda. This was to precede a renewed {{break-out}} offensive by the 70th Division. Scobie had informed Lieutenant-General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the XIII Corps commander, responsible for all operations near Tobruk, that the positions between him and Ed Duda were strongly defended. Godwin-Austen assured Scobie that he was <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> attack until the New Zealand Division had taken Ed Duda. Undertaking a night assault, the New Zealand infantry captured Belhamed despite strong resistance, but their attacks to take their other objectives were repulsed.|$|E
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Power of Four were {{circulated}} {{to all of}} the members of the British and Irish Lions tour squad and the song was pre-added to the playlists on their tour iPods. The song was not released as a single however it was permitted to be broadcast by radio stations and it was made available to download on the Internet. The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that they would know the words by the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman that the players were <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> sing it.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitutional}} crisis continued as the Prime Minister announced that, under the Constitution of Tuvalu, {{he was only}} required to convene Parliament once a year, and was thus <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> summon it until December 2013.|$|E

25|$|A {{constitutional}} crisis developed in mid 2013 when prime minister Willy Telavi took the position that, under the Constitution, {{he was only}} required to convene parliament once a year, and was thus <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> summon it until December 2013.|$|E

25|$|It is {{considered}} a great mitzvah (commandment) of kindness and compassion to pay a home visit to the mourners.

25|$|According to the Mishnah he was <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> {{keep the}} ill-phrased, illegal vow. According to Rabbi Jochanan, in his {{commentary}} on the Mishnah, it was Jephthah's obligation to pay the vow in money. According to the commentators of the rabbinic Jewish tradition, Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life.|$|E
25|$|The {{trench coat}} became an {{optional}} item of dress in the British Army, and {{was obtained by}} private purchase by officers and Warrant Officers Class I who were <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> own them. No other ranks were permitted to wear them. Another optional item was the British Warm, a wool coat similar to the greatcoat that was shorter in length, also worn by British officers and Warrant Officers Class I as an optional piece.|$|E
60|$|Back to {{the spot}} where he had left Werper went the ape-man, joy in his heart now, where fear and sorrow had so {{recently}} reigned; and in his mind a determination to forgive the Belgian and aid him in making good his escape. But {{when he came to the}} place, Werper was gone, and though Tarzan called aloud many times he received no reply. Convinced that the man had purposely eluded him for reasons of his own, John Clayton felt that he was <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> expose his wife to further danger and discomfort in the prosecution of a more thorough search for the missing Belgian.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{although}} the monetary transactions between {{them had been}} many, {{as luck would have}} it--entirely without his own design--they chanced in the main to have turned to his, Porson's, advantage. Thus, owing chiefly to his intelligent development of its possibilities, the land which he bought from the Monk estate had increased enormously in value; so much so, indeed, that, even if he lost all the other sums advanced upon mortgage, he would still be considerably to the good. Therefore, as it happened, the Colonel was really <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> him. In these circumstances, Mr. Porson did not quite know how a cold-blooded offer of an advance of cash without security--in practice a gift--would be received.|$|R

25|$|Though Phorm {{initially}} claimed Virgin Media {{had signed}} an exclusive contract and {{were committed to}} implementing Phorm's Webwise tracking system, Virgin Media have since distanced themselves from this and now state that they have only signed a preliminary contract with Phorm {{to better understand the}} tracking technology, and are <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> implement it. Reports on the Guardian website in May 2008 suggested Virgin Media may be further distancing themselves from the controversial system.|$|E

25|$|The United States and Israel do {{not have}} a formal treaty of alliance, as the US does with other nations, and it is <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> come to Israel’s defense. However, the US does refer to Israel and other nations without {{treaties}} as allies. The US has supported Israel with foreign aid, providing nearly $3 billion in grants annually to Israel since 1985; Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid since World War II.|$|E
30|$|Maternity wards, then, {{may be seen}} as sanctuaries, where {{immigration}} {{agents are}} barred and care professionals are <b>under</b> <b>no</b> legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report patients.

60|$|But however {{this may}} be, {{we know the}} opening of new {{countries}} to slavery tends to the perpetuation of the institution, and so does keep men in slavery who would otherwise be free.

The calling of a by-election was delayed until the High Court of Tuvalu ordered {{the prime minister}} to issue a notice to hold the by-election. The Nukufetau by-election, 2013 was held on 28 June. The Nukufetau by-election was won by the opposition candidate Elisala Pita.

25|$|Many Danish nationalists {{felt that}} at least the city of Flensburg, in Central Schleswig, should be {{returned}} to Denmark regardless of the plebiscite's results, due to the sizeable Danish minority there and a general desire to see Germany permanently weakened in the future. Christian X agreed with these sentiments, and ordered Prime Minister Zahle to include Flensburg in the re-unification process. As Denmark had been operating as a parliamentary democracy since the Cabinet of Deuntzer in 1901, Zahle felt he was <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> comply. He refused the order and resigned several days later after a heated exchange with the King.|$|E
25|$|Asked {{about the}} {{more than a dozen}} {{abducted}} whites expected to be available for release, Matilda informed the Texians that she knew only about a Mrs. Webster and her two children (who, unknown to her, had just made their escape) and that the Comanche chiefs had decided to ransom them. The Texians believed this was against the conditions for the negotiations which they believed stated that all abducted whites had to be released before the council. The Comanche, of course, had a different view, since the chiefs and bands not in attendance were <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> release anyone, as they had never agreed to anything.|$|E

I would as soon you should buy them of Mr. Ridgely, or any other person at the bank, as of any one else, provided {{you can get them}} as cheaply. I suppose, after the bank debt shall be paid, there will be some money left, out of which I would like to have you pay Lavely and Stout twenty dollars, and Priest and somebody (oil-makers) ten dollars, for materials got for house-painting.

25|$|During the {{previous}} year inquiries {{had been made of}} other municipalities as to their experience in the operation of motor buses, principally with a view to motorbus operation on the Carlton Road service, as Bamford was <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> continue his service of horsebuses. As a result, three Thorneycroft double-deckers were ordered for early delivery following Bamford’s withdrawal earlier in the year. Bamford had agreed to take over the tenancy of the Muskham Street stables from 25 March in succession to Common’s Nottingham Carriage Company, which had gone into liquidation, but, following the refusal of the West Bridgford Urban District Council to grant licences for operation in their area, Bamford was released from his agreement.|$|E
25|$|During this process, {{the role}} of the referees is advisory. The {{publisher}} is typically <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> accept the opinions of the referees, though she will most often do so. Furthermore, the referees in scientific publication do not act as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically are not aware of each other's identities or evaluations. Proponents argue that if the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the publisher can more easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. There is usually no requirement that the referees achieve consensus, with the decision instead often made by the publisher based on her best judgement of the arguments. The group dynamics are thus substantially different from that of a jury.|$|E

5000|$|Consequently, as Napoleon was {{considered}} an outlaw when he surrendered to Captain Maitland of [...] {{at the end of}} the Hundred Days, he was not protected by military law or international law as a head of state, and so the British were <b>under</b> <b>no</b> legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> either accept his surrender or to spare his life; however, they did so, exiling him to the remote South Atlantic island of Saint Helena.|$|R
