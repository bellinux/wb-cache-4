25|$|Denture-related {{stomatitis}} (also termed denture sore mouth, denture stomatitis, chronic atrophic candidiasis, Candida-associated denture induced stomatitis, and denture-associated erythematous stomatitis) is {{a common}} condition where mild inflammation and redness of the oral mucous membrane occurs beneath a denture. In about 90% of cases, Candida species are involved, which are normally a harmless component of the oral microbiota in many people. Denture-related stomatitis {{is the most common}} form of oral candidiasis (a yeast infection of the mouth). It is more common in elderly people, and in those who wear a complete <b>upper</b> <b>denture</b> (a denture which replaces all the upper teeth, worn by someone with no natural teeth in their upper jaw).

40|$|Background: Oral {{candidiasis}} is {{a common}} opportunistic infection of the oral cavity caused by an overgrowth of Candida species, the commonest being Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a harmless commensal organism inhabiting the mouths but it can change into pathogen and invade tissue and cause acute and chronic disease. Dentures predispose to infection with Candida {{in as many as}} 65 % of elderly people wearing full <b>upper</b> <b>dentures.</b> Purpose: The purpose of this case report is to discuss thrush in patient wearing full denture which rapidly developed. Case: This paper report a case of 57 year-old man who came to the Oral Medicine Clinic Faculty of Dentistry Airlangga University with clinical appearance of pseudomembranous candidiasis (thrush). Case Management: Diagnosis of this case is confirmed with microbiology examination. Patient was wearing full <b>upper</b> <b>dentures,</b> and from anamnesis known that patient wearing denture for 24 hours and he had poor oral hygiene. Patient was treated with topical (nystatin oral suspension and miconazole oral gel) and systemic (ketoconazole) antifungal. Patient also instructed not to wear his denture and cleaned white pseudomembrane on his mouth with soft toothbrush. Conclusion: Denture, habit of wearing denture for 24 hours, and poor oral hygiene are predisposing factors of thrush and it can healed completely after treated with topical and systemic antifungal. </span...|$|R

The insertion of a radio frequency identification (RFId) tag into dentures could be used as an aid to identify decomposed bodies, by storing personal identification data in a small transponder that can be radio-transmitted to a reader connected to a computer. A small passive, 12 x 2, 1 mm, read-only RFId-tag was incorporated into the manufacture of three trial complete <b>upper</b> <b>dentures</b> and tested for a signal. The aim {{of this article is to}} demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing such a dental prosthesis, the technical protocols for its implantation in the denture resin and its working principles. Future research and tests are required in order to verify human compatibility of the tagged denture and also to evaluate any potential deterioration in strength when subjected to high temperatures, or for damage resulting from everyday wear and tear. It should also be able to withstand the extreme conditions resulting from major accidents or mass disasters and procedures used to perform a forensic identification...|$|R

Results were compared with those or more comprehensive microbiological investigations. Forty four samples were obtained from the denture bases and adjacent palatal mucosa of 12 patients wearing full <b>upper</b> <b>dentures.</b> The specimens were then collected in Reduced Transport Fluid and processed in the anaerobic glove box. Samples were plated on Enriched Trypticase Soy Agar (ETSA) and cultured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In addition plaque samples were plated on Sabouraud medium. Facultative bacteria predominated in both denture and palatal plaques. Significantly greater numbers of cocci were recovered in the samples from palatal mucosa. More rods were found in denture plaque. Anaerobes were present in both instances. Among the anaerobes, saccharolytic Bacteroides were identified with the highest frequency, while Veillonella species were present in the greatest quantity. Recovery of yeasts was similar for both ETSA and Sabouraud media incubated aerobically.

40|$|Articulation is the {{production}} of speech sounds in any language. These sounds are minimal units of speech and in isolation {{do not have any}} meaning. Words are formed only when speech sounds are combined. Every individual produces speech sounds in a different way, thus producinga different acoustic effect. Different modes of sound production create different forms of sounds which are appropriately classified into phonemes. The research included 50 patients with complete <b>upper</b> <b>dentures,</b> and deals with the effect of dimension, retention and duration of speech. Dimension was measured on 6 points which are relevant to soundmaking, retention was graded on a scale 1 - 4 and duration was between 0 - 5 years. Words with sounds in which the palate affects their articulation were chosen, and sounds produced by all the patients were recorded. The soundmaking was analyzed and compared with the soundmaking of the control group, which comprised 50 students with all their natural teeth. The results obtained by statistical analysis show that accommodation has a significant effect on accurate soundmaking. Moreover,they also point to the fact that accurate dimension and good retention must be included. Only harmony of all three elements ensures good results of prosthodontic therapy...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} reproduction of different thickness and palatal rugae materials on complete dentures speech using Computerized Speech Lab (CSL) (spectrogram). Materials and Methods. Three completely edentulous male patients (aged 50 â 60 years) were selected for reading a paragraph. Twelve <b>upper</b> <b>dentures</b> were constructed, four for each patient. The patientsâ speech groups were divided into five groups, Group I: patients without dentures; Group II: patients rehabilitated with conventional acrylic dentures; Group III: patients with conventional acrylic dentures with rugae reproduction; Group IV: patients with dentures with metallic framework of minimal thickness and direct ragged metallic palatal surface at rugae area; Group V: patients with dentures with palatal rugae constructed from resilient acrylic resin material with thickness less than conventional denture. Speech samples were recorded after insertion of each denture for groups using Computerized Speech Lab (CSL) (spectrogram). The sounds selected were lingopalatal /s/z/sh/t/d/ and /l/. Results. Group III produced high mean significant difference with /sh/t/ sound. For Group IV, the difference was noticed with /s/z/sh/t/ and /d/ sounds, while for Group V the difference was shown with /z/l/ sound (P< 0. 05). Conclusion.

Firstly, {{based on a}} commercially available two-tone disclosing, the concentration of the dyes in the blue disclosing solution was calculated. This blue dye was used to disclose dental plaque accumulated on natural teeth and complete <b>upper</b> <b>dentures</b> (on two different backgrounds). Digital images were acquired under visible light, in the n-IR spectrum and with a narrow band-pass interference (NIB) filter tuned to the absorption spectrum of the blue dye. The results showed that disclosing dyes and disclosed dental plaque are transparent in the n-IR spectrum whilst the NIB filter maximised the contrast of dental plaque in the images when using the blue stain. A number of computerised segmentation methods were applied to these images showed automation of dental plaque detection to identify reliable methods to quantify plaque coverage. Although minor human intervention was still required in the segmentation process, the continuous development of new software promises that full automation in plaque quantification is almost a reality. Finally, analysis of the inter- and intra-examiner reliability of the commonly used Quigley and Hein index showed moderate reliability, highlighting the need for automated, quantitative and more reproducible methodology.

More than a {{third of}} edentulous patients are not fully satisfied with their complete dentures and mainly complain of insufficient stability, retention, and pain during mastication. Solving the problem may include relining by materials that are based on silicone or acrylic. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the level of patientsâ satisfaction before and after relining <b>upper</b> <b>dentures</b> with soft and rigid liners. Methods. The patients (n = 24) were divided into two study groups. Maxillary denture relining of the first group of patients was performed with hard acrylic based resins while in the second group of patients complete denture was relined with a silicone-based soft liner. They were asked the questions from the specifically adapted the Oral Health Impact Profile Questionnaire for edentulous patients before and three months after relining dentures. Results. After relining the patients showed a higher degree of satisfaction with their dentures in all the tested domains (masticatory function, psychological discomfort, social disability and retention and hygiene). The patients with soft denture relines were more satisfied. Conclusion. Relining of maxillary complete dentures significantly positively impacts the quality of life of patients in all the tested domains (masticatory function, psychological discomfort, social disability, pain and oral hygiene).

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 99 patients who wore partial or total acrylic resin-based <b>upper</b> <b>dentures</b> were included in this study. The subjects completed an epidemiological data form that includes the patient's gender, age, local factors (hygiene habits, remove denture to sleep, use of mouthwash, present condition of the denture, age of the denture) and functional factors (vertical dimension at rest, vertical dimension of occlusion, occlusion, retention, and static and dynamic stability). To detect yeasts, samples were collected from the inner surface of the dentures and from the palatal mucosa in contact with it. Subsequently, the samples were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar, observing macro and microscopic characteristics. RESULT: In the present study, we did not find any significant relationship between the gender and disease onset.

The degree of correlation between presence of biofilm and mucosa erythema was also evaluated. Twenty-four complete denture wearers (45 - 80 years old) were divided into 2 groups: experimental paste and standard toothpaste (Sorriso-Kolynos, Brazil). Both groups received soft toothbrushes. The internal surfaces of <b>upper</b> <b>dentures</b> were stained using 1 % sodium fluorescein and photographed at a 45 Â° angle at 0, 15, 30 and 60 days. The slides were scanned and the areas of interest (denture total area and biofilm area) were measured (Image Tool software). The degree of erythema was evaluated on slides according to the Prosthesis Tissue Index. There was a significant reduction (1 %) {{in the degree of}} biofilm (ANOVA/Tukey) between the two initial visits (0 and 15 days) and the two final visits (30 and 60 days), and in the average erythema scores (Kruskal-Wallis) between 0 and 60 days, in both groups. The Mann-Whitney test showed a significant difference (1 %) between pastes in terms of biofilm degree, but no difference was found for the erythema score.

The in vivo efficacy of three different brands of alkaline peroxide tablets (Polident, Efferdent, and Fittydent) and two mouthwashes (CloSYS II and Corsodyl) to eliminate Candida albicans on dentures was evaluated in this in vivo study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety denture wearers with clinical evidence of denture stomatitis were randomly divided into 5 test groups and 1 control group. Each group was further divided into three subgroups in which the dentures were subjected to 15 -, 30 -, and 60 -min disinfection procedures. The dentures of each test group were treated with one of the cleaners, while those of the control group were treated with distilled water. Swab samples from the palatal surfaces (2 cm x 2 cm template delimited area) of the <b>upper</b> <b>dentures</b> were obtained before and after 15, 30, and 60 min periods of cleaner use and examined mycologically.
