Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally.

25|$|Because {{there are}} often many {{different}} possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures, {{it is important to}} <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are related. Such relations are described by coordinate transformations which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (x,y) and polar coordinates (r,θ) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive x axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x=rcosθ and y=rsinθ.|$|E
25|$|Nine of {{the sons}} {{returned}} to their father Israel from Egypt, stockpiled with grain on their donkeys. They relayed to their father all that had happened in Egypt. They spoke of being accused of as spies and that their brother Simeon, had been taken prisoner. When Reuben, the eldest, mentioned {{that they needed to}} bring Benjamin to Egypt to prove their word as honest men, their father became furious with them. He couldn't <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were put in a position to tell the Egyptians all about their family. When the sons of Israel opened their sacks, they saw their money that they used to pay for the grain. It was still in their possession, and so they all became afraid. Israel then became angry with the loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.|$|E
500|$|Sorrell {{admitted}} in a retrospective interview that MediEvil presented [...] "a mountain of challenges" [...] {{due to the}} fact that, like many other developers at the time, were new to 3D gaming. He also admitted that some members of the team spent long nights without sleeping in order to finish the game on time. He described it as [...] "a huge learning project" [...] for the team. During development, the Cambridge team played beta versions of successful platformers such as Super Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot which helped them <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> might solve some challenges in building a 3D action game for the first time.|$|E

50|$|By {{the summer}} of 1963, Maarten Schmidt at Caltech had shown that certain starlike objects (now called quasars) were {{actually}} distant objects emitting enormous amounts of energy. Nobody <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> could be so bright. In an effort to unravel this mystery, several hundred astronomers, astrophysicists, and general relativists gathered for a conference in Dallas, held in early December that year. This would be the First (of what since then has become the biennial) Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics.|$|R
500|$|In {{his study}} of the {{cultural}} and literary legacy of Brussels, André De Vries remarked that Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was [...] "crude by Hergé's later standards, {{in every sense of the}} word". Simon Kuper of the Financial Times criticised both Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo as the [...] "worst" [...] of the Adventures, being [...] "poorly drawn" [...] and [...] "largely plot-free". Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that Hergé had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, Hergé cast the Bolsheviks as [...] "absolute evil" [...] but was unable to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did not know this either, thereby observing the Soviet [...] "world of misery" [...] and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as [...] "fairly straightforward" [...] and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as [...] "pantomime cut-outs".|$|E

The whole process of developing them became very cooperative between the coaching staff and the player. They would set the standards.|$|R
2500|$|The {{cast and}} crew {{included}} 700 extras {{who had to be}} trained to simulate blindness. Actor Christian Duurvoort from Meirelles' City of God led a series of workshops to coach the cast members. Duurvoort had researched the mannerisms of blind people to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> perceive the world and how they make their way through space. Duurvoort not only taught the extras mannerisms, but also to convey the emotional and psychological states of blind people. One technique was reacting to others as a blind person, whose reactions are usually different from those of a sighted person. Meirelles described, [...] "When you're talking to someone, you see a reaction. When you're blind, the response is much flatter. What's the point ?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Yet it {{has been}} argued whether or not {{identification}} with the external object should still be the core of a correct approach to sensation, for there are many who state the definition thus because they regard the link with external reality as crucial. If sensations are defined as [...] "raw feels", there arises a palpable threat to the reliability of knowledge. The reason has been given that, if one sees them as neurophysiological happenings in the brain, it is difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> could have any connection to entities, whether in the body or the external world. It has been declared, by John McDowell for example, that to countenance qualia as a [...] "bare presence" [...] prevents us ever gaining a certain ground for our knowledge. The issue is thus fundamentally an epistemological one: it would appear that access to knowledge is blocked if one allows the existence of qualia as fields in which only virtual constructs are before the mind.|$|E

Guccini did not endorse the article, which was based on an interview he did not know would be published, and commented: [...] "I cannot <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> chose that title, I write songs for an audience of people in their thirties, I do not see how an audience of sixteen year olds fresh out of school could relate with the things I say". In the same year, Guccini separated from his wife Roberta (the song [...] "Eskimo" [...] is about this event), and started cohabitating with Angela. In 1978 they had a daughter, Teresa, to whom the songs [...] "Culodritto" [...] and [...] "E un giorno..." [...] are dedicated. [...] In 1979 the live album Album concerto, recorded in a concert with Nomadi, was released. It was peculiar because the songs were performed in duet with Augusto Daolio, and because it included previously unreleased songs: [...] "Dio è morto", [...] "Noi", and [...] "Per fare un uomo".|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that many people say is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've got, and if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} made a shock unannounced return {{during a}} live segment which aired on 19 February 2015 during EastEnders Live Week commemorating the 30th anniversary. Speaking of her return, Gillian Taylforth said: [...] "When Dominic [...] approached {{me with his}} plan, I was so shocked I got into my car and burst into tears! 'Kathy' has always been so close to my heart and it's absolutely wonderful returning to the show and reprising the role." [...] It was then confirmed that Taylforth would reprise her role indefinitely. While Taylforth was initially only contracted to the series for six months, she said that she'd love {{to stay on the}} series for good. Of the return, Treadwell-Collins said [...] "Six months ago, we set ourselves that challenge of bringing Kathy back to the Square in a credible way. And I believe we have succeeded." [...] Taylforth revealed that she was initially hesitant about the storyline. [...] "I couldn't <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> could work around the fact that she could do that to her children" [...] the actress explained. Taylforth said [...] "it had to be right." [...] In September 2015, Treadwell-Collins revealed to the Daily Mirror that the story was inspired by the real life John Darwin disappearance where John—also known as the Canoe man—with the help of his wife Anne faked his death in a canoe accident in March 2002 in order to claim the insurance. Kathy's husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) had convinced her to fake her death to keep her children safe.|$|E
2500|$|When I was young, {{literary}} critics often rejoiced that {{the hypocrisy of}} the Victorians had been discredited, or expressed confidence that the operation would soon be complete. So far from that, it has returned in a peculiarly stifling form to take possession of critics of Eng. Lit.; Mr Pecksniff has become {{the patron saint of}} many of my colleagues. As so often, the deformity is the result of severe pressure between forces in themselves good. The study of English authors of the past is now centred in the universities, and yet there must be no censorship - no work of admitted literary merit may be hidden from the learners. Somehow we must save poor Teacher's face, and protect him from the indignant or jeering students, local authorities or parents. It thus came to be tacitly agreed that a dead author usually hated what he described, hated it as much as we do, even, and wanted his book to shame everybody out of being so nasty ever again. This is often called fearless or unflinching criticism, and one of its ill effects is to make the young people regard all literature as a terrific nag or scold. Independently of this, a strong drive has been going on to recover the children for orthodox or traditional religious beliefs; ... and when you understand all that, you may just be able to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> manage to present James Joyce as a man devoted to the God who was satisfied by the crucifixion.

To achieve this, the Machine Gun Corps was formed in October 1915 with Infantry, Cavalry, and Motor branches, followed in 1916 by the Heavy Branch.
