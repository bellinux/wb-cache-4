40|$|Blends of low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) and ethylene-octene copolymer (EOC) were obtained. The effect of EOC content and absorbed radiation dose on the mechanical and thermomechanical properties of LDPE/EOC blends are investigated.

All these polyester polyols are then used to prepare segmented polyurethanes following a two-stage process, by reacting them successively with 4, 4 -diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and 1, 4 -butanediol. The resulting materials are then evaluated with respect to their thermal and dynamic or static mechanical properties. The observed characteristics and behaviors are quite similar between AA- or MGA-based polyurethanes, except for the tendency of AA-based samples to display partially crystallized soft domains.

The results show that when the pouring temperatures are between 640 o C and 680 o C, the slurry of A 356 aluminum alloy with spherical primary α-Al grains can be prepared under the given conditions. The more the bend numbers in the channel are, the better the slurry is, i. e. the primary α-Al grains are more spherical and finer.

If the superconductor is in strip form for winding into edge-cooled pancakes, an organic adhesive and insulation can provide a convenient means of meeting these criteria.

Very few organic materials are known to retain any appreciable <b>ultimate</b> <b>elongation</b> at liquid helium temperatures.
