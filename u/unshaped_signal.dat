This article is from Volume 1, Issue 2. Digital notch filtering, lowpass filtering, and input shaping are three well-known methods for shaping reference commands to reduce vibration in flexible systems. Both filters and input shapers are used to modify signal commands {{in such a way as}} to minimize vibration. In <b>unshaped</b> <b>signal</b> generation of tower cranes, the load on the crane will always have residual oscillation or swaying due to the craneâ€™s motion. Filters and input shapers minimize this motion by shaping the original command through a series of impulses designed to be out of phase with the unshaped oscillation thus canceling the vibration. Since the introduction of robust input shaping (Singer, 1990) substantial evidence has led to the assessment that input shaping is superior to both notch and lowpass filtering for suppressing vibration in mechanical systems (Singer 1999). This project examines the validation of theoretical developments in the comparison between notch filtering, lowpass filtering, and input shaping utilizing portable bridge and tower cranes. Also, work was previously done with the WinCC software, provided by Siemens, in order to create a user interface in which the position of the tower crane trolley and payload are displayed on the WinCC along with the available workspace and a set of controls for actuating the crane. This project further develops the user interface of the WinCC software by providing a predictor which predicts the trolley motion of the tower crane.

40|$|Adaptive {{feedback}} cancellation methods may {{integrate the}} use of probe signals {{to assist with the}} biased optimal solution in acoustic systems working in closed-loop. However, injecting a probe noise in the loudspeaker decreases the signal quality perceived by users of assistive listening devices. To counter this, probe signals are usually shaped to provide some level of perceptual masking. In this letter we show the impact of using a shaping filter on the system behavior in terms of convergence rate and steady state error. From this study, it can be concluded that shaping the probe signal may have detrimental influence in terms of system performance. Accordingly, we propose to use the <b>unshaped</b> probe <b>signal</b> combined with an inverse filter of the shaping filter to identify the feedback channel. This restructure of the problem restores convergence rate of LMS type algorithms. Furthermore, we also show that an adequate forward path delay is required to obtain an unbiased solution and that the suggested scheme reduces this delay...|$|R

Not only that, satellites in formation enable new possibilities, like taking measurements from plasma from different points at the same time, thus creating a more complete 3 D profile. Though formation flying has several advantages in terms of reducing costs and production time, it increases the requirements in control strategies not only for the spacecraft alone but also to coordinate their relative formation structure. Those less expensive and faster deployable satellites are usually less rigid than their larger counterparts: therefore they pose new challenges in spacecraft and formation flight control. This thesis investigates the effects of flexible satellites in the relative dynamics of single and formation flying satellite. It proposes a way of planning an optimal, minimum fuel, trajectory with linear programming, and design an LQR controller for the satellites to follow this trajectory. The system response to input shaped and <b>unshaped</b> reference <b>signal</b> is compared for the flexible satellite with linear and nonlinear actuators. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
