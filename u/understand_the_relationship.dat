500|$|Experimental {{research}} on consciousness presents special difficulties, {{due to the}} lack of a universally accepted operational definition. In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness, the subjects are human, and the criterion used is verbal report: [...] in other words, subjects are asked to describe their experiences, and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness. [...] For example, subjects who stare continuously at a Necker cube usually report that they experience it [...] "flipping" [...] between two 3D configurations, even though the stimulus itself remains the same. [...] The objective is to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between the conscious awareness of stimuli (as indicated by verbal report) and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior. In several paradigms, such as the technique of response priming, the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness, and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification (double dissociation).|$|E

500|$|Genetic {{studies to}} date have been {{inconclusive}} about the closest relative of the Sorraia. On one hand, studies using mitochondrial DNA showed {{a relationship with the}} Przewalski's Horse, in that Przewalski's Horse has a unique haplotype (A2) not found in domestic horses, which differs by just one single nucleotide from one of the major Sorraia haplotypes (JSO41, later A7). In comparison, genetic distances within the domestic horse are as large as 11 nucleotide differences. [...] However, this relationship with the Przewalski's Horse was contradicted in another study using microsatellite data that showed that the genetic distance between the Prewalski's Horse and the Sorraia was the largest. Such conflicting results can arise when a population passes through a genetic bottleneck, and evidence suggests that the Sorraia, among other rare breeds, has recently passed through a bottleneck, effectively obscuring the position of this breed in the family tree of the domestic horse. Thus, the morphological, physiological, and cultural characteristics of the Sorraia are the subject of continued study to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between various Iberian horse breeds and wild horse subspecies.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Robert Bridges's {{analysis}} of the poem became a dominant view and would influence later interpretations of the poem. Bridges, in 1895, declared that the poem was the best of Keats's odes but he thought that the poem contained too much artificial language. In particular, he emphasised {{the use of the word}} [...] "forlorn" [...] and the last stanza as being examples of Keats's artificial language. In [...] "Two odes of Keats's" [...] (1897), William C Wilkinson suggested that [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is deeply flawed because it contains too many [...] "incoherent musings" [...] that failed to supply a standard of logic that would allow the reader to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between the poet and the bird. However, Herbert Grierson, arguing in 1928, believed Nightingale to be superior to [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", [...] "Ode on Melancholy", and [...] "Ode to Psyche", arguing the exact opposite of Wilkinson as he stated that [...] "Nightingale", along with [...] "To Autumn", showed a greater amount of logical thought and more aptly presented the cases they were intended to make.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} labour process theory—the attempt to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between {{management}} control, worker skill and wages in industrial workplaces—Filtzer emphasised the continuing absence of control by Soviet workers {{over their own}} labour process. The Soviet elite would not radically change the labour process by democratising it and introducing truly equal wages for everyone in society, but nor could they generate the culture of consumerism that in the West was used to help explain the wage and skill structure. [...] In these circumstances, attempts to coordinate production quotas, wages and expected levels of worker effort failed and continued to fail into the 1980s. [...] The wage reform of 1956–1962 was a failure, as it could neither fix nor improve the economic conflict between workers and the elite in the Soviet Union. [...] On the shop floor, workers continued to directly bargain with low-level management over effort, wages and what [...] "skill" [...] they would exert. In particular, Filtzer notes that Soviet workers were constantly forced into a position of exerting more skill than was officially called for in plans or quotas. This was because Soviet workers often had {{to find their own}} ways of working around problems that made their efforts difficult, such as building their own tools to carry out tasks that could not be performed with the tools provided, or by devising entirely new production processes of their own when existing processes were not suitable. This was a condition only seen to such an extent in the West in industries that were insulated from market forces. Because this was common in Soviet industry, workers and managers in the Soviet Union had many reasons to work together in the setting of wages, quotas and skill expectations, even after the wage reform. Filtzer wrote that Mikhail Gorbachev attempted a very similar series of wage reforms in 1986 (Perestroika), which ultimately failed and had to be replaced with a decentralised system in 1991.|$|E
