30|$|If the <b>utility</b> is the {{satisfactory}} {{degree of}} {{goods or services}} for consumer, then <b>utility</b> function means the function relationship in number between <b>utility</b> and the preference of goods. Let the <b>utility</b> function U (x) as satisfactory model for x in the choice set for each to specify degree of preference. Generally U (x) is between 0 and 1 (Farquhar 1984), which measures satisfactory degree the consumers feel by the consumption of specified combining goods. The <b>utility</b> function, we also have known, has get many mathematic forms such as the power <b>utility</b> function (Jana and Pavol 2010), the exponential <b>utility</b> function (Bhuvaneswari and Seethalakshmi 2011), Epstein-Zin <b>utility</b> function (Tan et al. 2006) etc., or is a cardinal <b>utility</b> function and a ordinal <b>utility</b> function. And the <b>utility</b> function has also been applied to many fields such as the information <b>utility</b> function, the multi-attribute <b>utility</b> function, the rent-seeking <b>utility</b> function, the traffic <b>utility</b> function, the objective <b>utility</b> function, the cost <b>utility</b> function, the HARA (hyperbolic absolute risk aversion, absolute risk aversion) <b>utility</b> function, the PD (partial distribution, partial tail distribution) <b>utility</b> function, the PRA (power risk aversion) <b>utility</b> function, the Logit (logistic) <b>utility</b> function and so on.

50|$|An example {{application}} involves local <b>utility</b> user taxes. <b>Utility</b> user {{taxes are}} levied {{on the use}} of <b>utility</b> services, whether provided by a public or private entity, with the tax proceeds nearly always spent by local governments on purposes completely unrelated to the particular <b>utility</b> service being taxed. Local <b>utility</b> taxes are generally levied as a percentage of <b>utility</b> service cost, and are imposed in addition to local <b>utility</b> fees and charges. <b>Utility</b> user taxes typically appear as a separate charge on the local <b>utility</b> bill. <b>Utility</b> user taxes are imposed on one or more <b>utility</b> services, including water, electricity, sewer, gas, telephone, cable television, and refuse collection. When local <b>utility</b> rates are increased, the cost of <b>utility</b> service increases which generally also results in an increase in the amount of <b>utility</b> users tax that is paid by the consumer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experiment}} {{contends that}} there is no way of aggregating <b>utility</b> which can circumvent the conclusion that all units should be given to a <b>utility</b> monster, because every different system has a monster and defeating one <b>utility</b> monster creates another. For example, in Rawls' maximin or difference principle, maximin sets a group's aggregate <b>utility</b> as that of the being with least <b>utility.</b> Thus, giving units to the <b>utility</b> monster fails to change the group's <b>utility</b> unless the <b>utility</b> monster has the least <b>utility.</b> Even if the <b>utility</b> monster has the least <b>utility,</b> maximin would only prefer allocating units to the monster until it catches up with the member that has next-to-least <b>utility.</b> This would defeat the [...] "happy" [...] <b>utility</b> monster of average <b>utility.</b> But if the person who has the least <b>utility</b> gains only a tiny amount of <b>utility</b> from each unit of resources, they may never catch up with the next person, so they can similarly consume all of the resources in the world. It can be shown that all consequentialist systems based on maximizing a global function are subject to <b>utility</b> monsters.|$|R
30|$|The {{theory is}} not yet ripe from <b>utility</b> given out a {{management}}. The earlier <b>utility</b> management (Zhang and Wang 2005) should have both <b>utility</b> assessment and <b>utility</b> control to guide education as the conscious of the <b>utility</b> management (Xiao 2003), to be an aim of the management by the <b>utility</b> maximization (Li et al. 1998). <b>Utility</b> Management Automation System {{is a sort of}} supervisory control and data acquisition system for the electric <b>utility</b> system (Fereidunian et al. 2009). The <b>utility</b> from the economics were applied broadly in finance and insurance about risk and consume such as Markowitz combining model (Feng 2010). Using <b>utility</b> in library was applied to <b>utility</b> function about purchasing books (Lin 2005) and <b>utility</b> modeling of book usage (Zhang 2009) and <b>utility</b> statistics of books (Yan 2009 a) and the <b>utility</b> management for the electronic resources (Yan and Xu 2010). The using <b>utility</b> after customer obtaining goods was not involved but the <b>utility</b> were only as the contents of the management. All we mentioned above conveyed a motion of management <b>utility</b> rather than the <b>utility</b> management that had not the <b>utility</b> as the main purpose of the management and also had not established the relation between <b>utility</b> function and applied analysis. It is an issue of the <b>utility</b> management in the article management. We dedicate to using <b>utility</b> management to the possession of articles in the <b>utility</b> value, as the premise of the management with the effective usage of empirical data to analyze the usefulness of continuing degree of these, and to mine the potential usefulness, to make full use of these, the maximum of use impact and management effectiveness (Yan and Wu 2011).|$|R

40|$|Recent {{literature}} in the last Maximum Entropy workshop introduced an analogy between cumulative probability distributions and normalized <b>utility</b> functions.

A <b>utility</b> density function is non-negative and integrates to unity. These two properties {{form the basis of}} a correspondence between <b>utility</b> and probability. A natural application of this analogy is a maximum entropy principle to assign maximum entropy <b>utility</b> values. Maximum entropy <b>utility</b> interprets many of the common <b>utility</b> functions based on the preference information needed for their assignment, and helps assign <b>utility</b> values based on partial preference information.
