The Open Netcentric Interoperability Standards for Training and Testing (ONISTT) project has applied and extended the Department of Defense Netcentric Data Strategy and semantic web concepts {{to the more}} limited but attainable objective of “purpose-aware ” interoperability. The core of the ONISTT approach for purpose-aware interoperability comprises (1) a formal description of exercise needs and confederation resources, captured in domain-specific ontologies expressed via the Web Ontology Language; and (2) an Analyzer written in XSB Prolog that applies general logical reasoning and domain-specific rules {{to determine whether a}} candidate confederation can satisfy the requirements of a proposed exercise. In the ONISTT knowledge capture phase, knowledge bases (KBs) are constructed by populating the ontologies with instance data. In the Analyzer employment phase, an exercise planner identifies the specific exercise tasks and primary training audience, and may assign specific resources (both operational and LVC systems) to roles derived from the exercise tasks. For each required interaction between two roles, the Analyzer assesses whether the capabilities provided by the assigned resources are likely to provide a satisfactory level of substantive interoperability.

The use of standard OPC for monitoring enables data acquisition from a set of devices that use different communication protocols as inverters or other electronic devices present in PV systems enabling <b>universal</b> connectivity and <b>interoperability.</b> Using the OPC standard allows promoting interoperation of software objects in distributed-heterogeneous environments and also allows incorporating in the system remote supervision and diagnosis {{for the evaluation of}} grid connected PV facilities. The supervision system analyses the monitored data and evaluates the expected behaviour of main parameters of the PV array: Output voltage, current and power. The monitored data and evaluated parameters are used by the fault detection procedure in order to identify possible faults present in the PV system. The methodology presented has been experimentally validated in the supervision of a grid connected PV system located in Spain. Results obtained show that the combination of OPC monitoring along with the supervision and fault detection procedure is a robust tool that can be very useful in the field of remote supervision and diagnosis of grid connected PV systems.

The presented model eases the task of providing a Web Service by consuming deployment and management tasks. It eases the development of consumer agent applications by letting developers program against what a service does, not where it is or whether it is currently deployed. It extends the platform-independent ethos of Web Services by providing deployment mechanisms which can be used independent of implementation and deployment technologies.
