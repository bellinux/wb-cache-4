5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a <b>uniform</b> <b>acceleration,</b> {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a <b>uniform</b> <b>acceleration</b> starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{simultaneously}} with Einstein, also Minkowski (1908) considered the special case of uniform accelerations {{within the framework}} of his space-time formalism. He recognized that the world-line of such an accelerated body corresponds to a hyperbola. This notion was further developed by Born (1909) and Sommerfeld (1910), with Born introducing the expression [...] "hyperbolic motion". He noted that <b>uniform</b> <b>acceleration</b> can be used as an approximation for any form of acceleration within special relativity. In addition, Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham (1910) showed that Maxwell's equations are invariant under a much wider group of transformation than the Lorentz-group, i.e., the spherical wave transformations, being a form of conformal transformations. Under those transformations the equations preserve their form for some types of accelerated motions. A general covariant formulation of electrodynamics in Minkowski space was eventually given by Friedrich Kottler (1912), whereby his formulation is also valid for general relativity. Concerning the further development of the description of accelerated motion in special relativity, the works by Langevin and others for rotating frames (Born coordinates), and by Wolfgang Rindler and others for uniform accelerated frames (Rindler coordinates) must be mentioned.|$|E

40|$|Geodesic {{equations}} of {{the vacuum}} C-metric are derived and solved for various cases. The solutions describe {{the motion of}} timelike or null particles with conserved energy and angular momentum. Polar, nearly-circular orbits around weakly accelerated black holes may {{be regarded as a}} perturbation of circular Schwarzschild geodesics. Results indicate that circular Schwarzschild geodesics of radius $r_ 0 > 6 m$ are stable under small <b>uniform</b> <b>accelerations</b> along the orbital plane. These stable orbits undergo small oscillations around $r_ 0 $, behaving like a harmonic oscillator driven by a periodic force plus another constant force. Circular orbits with axis parallel to the direction of black hole acceleration are also considered. In this case an algebraic relation expressing the condition of stability is obtained. This refines the stability analysis done in previous literature. We also present an analysis of radial geodesics along the poles. There exist a solution where a particle remains at unstable equilibrium at a fixed distance directly behind the accelerating black hole. Examples of numerical solutions are presented for other more general cases. Comment: 24 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
