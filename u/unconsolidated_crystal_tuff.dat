40|$|A re-investigation of the {{volcanic}} rocks of the Skye Central Complex (SCC), NW Scotland, provides {{evidence for the}} widespread transport (up to 20 km) of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) across the Palaeogene landscape. Detailed mapping and logging of volcaniclastic rocks (previously interpreted as agglomerates, felsites and lavas [1]) within the SCC, has allowed us to identify several distinct silicic ignimbrite lithofacies: (1) lithic-rich massive lapilli tuff, locally with normal and reverse grading, and/or diffuse stratification; (2) poorly sorted massive lithic breccia; (3) fines-rich massive lapilli tuff containing abundant accretionary lapilli; (4) rheomorphic lapilli tuff; and (5) rare massive <b>crystal</b> <b>tuffs.</b> These lithofacies provide evidence for extensive silicic pyroclastic activity within the SCC, and can be correlated to recognise two distinct eruption phases in its evolution, which had not previously been constrained. At Fionn Choire on the NW margin of the Cuillin Hills on Skye, massive lapilli tuffs (unwelded, incipiently welded and intensely welded/rheomorphic), <b>crystal</b> <b>tuffs</b> and breccias crop out.

40|$|The massive sulfide {{deposits}} at Jerome, consisting {{largely of}} pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite, are concordant stratabound lenses in massive quartz-bearing <b>crystal</b> <b>tuffs</b> of Precambrian age and overlying bedded tuffaceous rocks. The <b>crystal</b> <b>tuffs</b> were eraplaced as submarine pyroclastic flows. The evidence permits the interpretation that the massive sulfide lenses are essentially syngenetic {{and related to}} hydrothermal brines that discharged into a submarine basin. The host rocks and sulfide lenses were folded and metamorphosed. Two periods of folding can be recognized; during the second period, the older folds were deformed along vertical axes, {{and some of the}} chalcopyrite in the major lens migrated downward to form shoots of intersecting veins in the <b>crystal</b> <b>tuff</b> and chloritized tuff (black schist).

The intrusive complex has an extension of 1. 2 x 0. 8 km occupying an area of 0. 5 km². It is constituted mainly by monzonite and trachyte. At the south flank of the massif, there exits a pyroclastic dyke and at the northwest flank, an intrusive welded <b>crystal</b> <b>tuff.</b> The pyroclastic dyke is 40 to 80 cm wide and intrudes into the basement porphyritic granite. This rock is constituted by welded tuff breccia with large amount of lapilli-size angular lithic fragments of trachyte. Along the contact plane of this dyke, there is an intercalation of the trachyte. The <b>crystal</b> <b>tuff</b> is characterised by abundant alkaline feldspar phenocrysts and mineral fragments of alkaline feldspar, quartz, biotite, and amphibole, showing a crystal matrix-supported texture. Large phenocrysts are aggregations of idiomorphic alkaline feldspar crystals with a general size of 2 mm and a maximum one of 6 mm. The matrix is composed mainly of mineral fragments of less than 1 mm in general size. The size-frequency diagram for the mineral fragments suggests {{that they have been}} originated from an explosive eruption. The matrix is strongly welded and completely devitrified showing a cryptocrystalline texture. The crystals were concentrated by sorting {{with the help of the}} volcanic gas ascending in the volcanic conduit during a continuous and effusive phase of the eruption.

The Primrose Pyroclastics consist of vitric, <b>crystal</b> and lithic <b>tuffs,</b> pyroclastic breccias, shale·lenses and quartz-sericitechlorite schists derived from the pyroclastic rocks. The Primrose Pyroclastics contain probable ignimbrites and therefore may have been deposited on land. They are overlain to the east by massive lavas of the Mt, Black Volcanics. On the, west the Primrose Pyroclastics are flanked by and appear to intertongue with the Rosebery Group consisting of shale, quartz-wacke, greywacke conglomerate and dolomitic siltstone. The Cambrian rocks, particularly the volcanic formations, in the Rosebery area,have undergone low-grade regional metamorphism that has·produced mineral assemblages of the lower greenschist facies together with schistose fabrics. In the Rosebery Mine area the detailed stratigraphic sequence is: massive pyroclastics (vitric, <b>crystal</b> and lithic <b>tuff),</b> black slate, host rock (siltstone with <b>crystal</b> <b>tuff</b> bands), Barite orebody, host rock, Z. n-Pb sulphide orebody with an Fe-Cu-rich basal zone, footwall schists, and footwall pyroclastics (<b>crystal</b> <b>tuff).</b> The contact between the massive pyroclastics and the underlying black slate or host rock appears, -ion part, to be a disconformity.

These compare well with theoretical convection velocities in magmas. Pyroxene/pla-gioclase mobility within basaltic magmas is greater than sand mobility in aqueous systems. The advent of the current activity which produced the scour is associated with a change from discontinuous to continuous nucleation (Goode, 1976), probably due to the increased turbulence in the crystallization zone.
