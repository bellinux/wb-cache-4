40|$|Abstract. A goal of {{this paper}} is to compare results for discriminatory auctions to results for <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auctions</b> when {{suppliers}} have capacity constraints. We have a pretty good understanding of what equilibrium results look like for the <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auctions.</b> But an unresolved problem is what happens when a discriminative auction is run and suppliers have capacity constraints. We formulate a supply function equilibrium (SFE) model in continuous offer schedules with inelastic, time varying demand and with single step marginal cost function to compare two auction institutions in the presence of capacity constraints. We show that payments made to the suppliers in the unique equilibrium of the discriminatory auction can be less than the payments in the <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction,</b> depending on which <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction</b> equilibrium is selected. For the high demand and/or low excess capacity cases we also characterize mixed strategy supply function equilibrium under the discriminatory auction...|$|R
40|$|In <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auctions</b> {{of shares}} there exist collusive equilibria in which bidders capture the entire surplus from the auction {{as well as}} {{competitive}} equilibria in which the auctioneer captures the entire surplus from the auction. We provide experimental evidence that, in <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auctions,</b> non-binding pre-play communication facilitates convergence to collusive equilibrium outcomes. On the other hand, regardless of the opportunities for communication, in discriminatory-auction experiments subject strategies conform closely with the unique equilibrium in undominated strategies in which bidders' gains are equal to the smallest "tick size" in the bidding schedule. This evidence suggests that <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auctions</b> of Treasury securities may result in lower revenues than the currently employed discriminatory procedure.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} {{efficiency in}} a <b>uniform-price</b> multi-unit <b>auction</b> {{with a positive}} reservation price. I demonstrate that the reservation price is an important policy tool that may increase efficiency (or welfare) in multi-unit <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auctions.</b> I show that the higher the reservation price is, the higher is the sellerʼs revenue and the higher is the efficiency of a final allocation of units that could be attained in a multi-unit <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction.</b> The reservation price increases the bidderʼs equilibrium strategy in a specific way that is inherent to the <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction.</b> Thus the reservation price effect on efficiency {{is in contrast to}} other auction formats; e. g., the reservation price decreases efficiency in the Vickrey auction and single-unit auctions with symmetric bidders.

40|$|Abstract. The fixed-supply <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction</b> {{suffers from}} {{existence}} of “collusive-seeming equilibria ” {{in which all}} bidders dramatically shade their bids and very low prices may be realized. Our main result is that such equilibria do not exist {{in a family of}} “money-prize perturbations ” of the <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction,</b> in which a small payment discount is split among all rationed bidders. To shed light on what drives this result, we also examine three natural variations with endogenous supply – called “adjustable-supply”, “increasable-supply”, and “decreasable-supply ” auctions – in an illustrative degenerate model. Collusive-seeming equilibria exist in the decreasable- but not in the adjustable- nor increasable-supply auctions. Finally, we apply McAdams (2000) to prove existence of a pure strategy “competitive equilibrium ” in the <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction</b> as well as in all of its money-prize perturbations, under assumptions which guarantee that an appropriate single-crossing property is satisfied. 1...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the essential properties of bidder equilibrium {{strategies in the}} multi-unit <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction.</b> In the auction the seller offers several identical units for sale, specifies a minimum accepted bid (reservation price) and sets maximum number of bids that any bidder can submit. Under these restrictions bidders use strictly increasing strategies in a symmetric equilibrium more often, {{and in many cases}} the reservation price increases the bidder's strategy which is typical in single-unit auctions. Such an auction procedure implies a unique equilibrium strategy in some cases. Thus the number of bid restriction and reservation price present in real-life multi-unit auctions restore some properties of equilibrium strategies typical for single-unit auctions.

Incorporating survey results from 2, 316 naval officers across Navy Aviation, we analyzed the impact that market-based mechanisms would have on quantity, quality, and cost for retained naval aviators. Using these responses, we developed individual quality scores and reservation prices to apply three auction mechanisms to the retention goals and costs of the FY- 2013 ACCP program.

40|$|Wholesale {{electricity}} markets are commonly organized around a spot energy market. Buyers and suppliers submit {{bids and offers}} for each hour and the market is cleared at the price that balances supply and demand. Buyers with bids above the clearing price pay that price, and suppliers with offers below the clearing price are paid that same price. This <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction,</b> which occurs both daily and throughout the day, is complemented by forward energy markets. In practice, between 80 and 95 percent of wholesale electricity is traded in forward energy markets, often a month, or a year, and sometimes many years ahead of the spot market. However, because forward prices reflect spot prices, in the long run, the spot market determines {{the total cost of}} energy. It also plays a critical role in the least-cost scheduling and dispatch of resources, and provides an essential price signal both for short-run performance and long-run investment incentives. Arguments that the <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auction</b> yields electricity prices that are systematically too high are incorrect. However, insufficiently hedged spot prices will result in energy costs that fluctuate above and below the long-run average more than regulated prices and more than is socially optimal. Tampering with the spot price would cause inefficiency and raise long-term costs. The proper way to dampen the impact of spot price fluctuations is with long-term hedging. Although re-regulation can provide a hedge, there are less costly approaches. <b>Auctions,</b> electricity <b>auctions,</b> <b>uniform-price</b> <b>auctions...</b>|$|R
