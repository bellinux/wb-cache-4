2500|$|Improved {{telescopes and}} {{mathematical}} techniques allowed astronomers in the 19th and 20th centuries to estimate many of Io's physical properties, {{such as its}} mass, diameter, and albedo, {{as well as to}} resolve large-scale surface features on it. In his 1805 book Celestial Mechanics, in addition to laying out his mathematical argument for the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede, Laplace was able to use perturbations on the orbit of Io by Europa and Ganymede to provide the first estimate of Io's mass, 1.73 of the mass of Jupiter, which was one-quarter of the modern value. Through the mid-20th century, additional mass estimates using this technique would be performed by Marie-Charles Damoiseau, John Couch Adams, Ralph Allen Sampson, and Willem de Sitter, all of which were less than the modern value with the closest being Sampson's 1921 estimate of 4.5 of the mass of Jupiter, which was 4% less than the currently accepted mass. Io's diameter was estimated using micrometer measurements and occultations of background stars by Io. Edward E. Barnard used a micrometer at the Lick Observatory in 1897 to estimate a diameter of , 8.5% larger than the accepted modern value, while Albert A.

These measurements allowed astronomers to estimate Io's density, given as 2.88g/cm3 following the Beta Scorpii occultation. While this is 20% less than the currently accepted value, it was enough for astronomers to note the differences between the densities of the inner two Galilean satellites (Io and Europa) versus the outer two Galilean satellites (Ganymede and Callisto). The densities of Io and Europa suggested that they were composed primarily of rock while Ganymede and Callisto contained more ices.|$|E
