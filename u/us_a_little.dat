5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
500|$|One black {{motorist}} {{observed in}} the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a [...] "small cloud" [...] had appeared. By the late afternoon, [...] "it casts a shadow of apprehension on our hearts and sours <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> 'Where,' it asks us, 'will you stay tonight?'". They often had to spend hours in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring.|$|E
500|$|When Sullivan {{turned to}} comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval. Peter Gammond writes of [...] "misapprehensions and prejudices, {{delivered}} to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd. ... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements {{that could not}} be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art." [...] As early as 1877 The Figaro wrote that Sullivan [...] "has all the ability to make him a great composer, but he wilfully throws his opportunity away. ... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more-or-less excellent fooling." [...] Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan's theatre scores. The Theatre wrote that [...] "Iolanthe sustains Dr Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced." [...] However, comic opera, no matter how skilfully crafted, was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. The Athenaeum's review of The Martyr of Antioch declared: [...] "t is an advantage to have the composer of H.M.S. Pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art." ...|$|E

500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of awe at the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. I can even do it with my left hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe even play <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E

2500|$|After President Trump {{took office}} in January 2017, Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, began {{to work on a}} plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They faced {{opposition}} from both Democrats and moderate Republicans, who claimed that the bill would leave too many people uninsured, and more conservative Republicans, who protested that the bill kept too many of the ACA's regulation and spending increases, and was thus not a full repeal. Numerous attempts at repeal failed. On June 27, after a meeting with President Trump at the White House, McConnell signaled improvements for the repeal and replacement: [...] "We're not quite there. But I think we’ve got a really good chance of getting there. It’ll just take <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit longer." [...] During a Rotary Club lunch on July 6, McConnell said, [...] "If my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur." ...|$|E

2500|$|The new Pro mode was {{critically}} acclaimed {{as the primary}} feature that distinguished Rock Band 3 from other music games in the field. Minkley stated that the inclusions of Pro features [...] "at once dramatically expand {{the potential of the}} game and fundamentally change the approach required to play and enjoy it". Reviewers appreciated the training modes, including their integration into the overall game's career progression and the breadth of material that is covered. Nina Shen Rastogi of Slate commented that Rock Band 3s training modes [...] helps to overcome the discouraging early period of trying to learn guitar as [...] "the gaming elements will mask the rote, homeworklike nature of the guitar training process". Kuchera noted that the modes were aimed at those who have some understanding of music theory already; [...] "If this is your first introduction to music theory, though, you may need a little more explanation", he concluded. This lament was similarly stated by Machkovech, who felt the lessons had [...] "text that was written by a musical savant" [...] that would be too confusing to those without musical backgrounds and too simple for those trained in music arts. [...] Chris Kohler of Wired described the experience he and a friend had where after playing though Devo's [...] "Whip It" [...] on Pro guitar and keyboard, they were able retain enough muscle memory to play their respective parts on real instruments, albeit not perfectly; Kohler summarized his experience that [...] "Just playing Rock Band 3 taught <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of actual music".|$|E
2500|$|Brown was {{introduced}} to Harold Prince through his association with Daisy Prince, and was hired to write songs for the Broadway musical Parade, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank. Parade, directed by Hal Prince, and with a book by Alfred Uhry, won Brown the 1999 Tony Award for Best Original Musical Score. During this production, Livent, one of the producers of Parade, pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they'd hoped. RCA Victor, the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, [...] "Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent's shows. But when Livent pulled out of 'Parade,' the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. I {{had to go to}} Billy Rosenfield and ask him: 'What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?' Billy said, 'Sure.'" [...] Brown had to try to scrounge money from every corner, [...] "In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin's $25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of musical theatre composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money. Somehow, we pulled it together." [...] Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while allying for bankruptcy protection.|$|E
2500|$|De Gaulle {{hosted a}} superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms {{limitation}} talks and détente {{efforts in the}} wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: [...] "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan." [...] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, [...] "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's [...] "unconditional support" [...] of the United States during that [...] "crucial time". De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the Élysée Palace to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved {{in the wake of}} the U-2 incident.|$|E
