40|$|Purpose:The {{purpose of}} this study as a part of Trafikverkets {{continues}} improvement work is to create ahigher society value with less delayed train traffic. This study will analyze if it’stechnical/administrative possible to eliminate or reduce the delays which accrue when switcheswith <b>swing</b> <b>nose</b> crossing is not in control. The issue has been segmented in three sub issues: 1. How does a switch with <b>swing</b> <b>nose</b> crossing work and which factors leads to a stop intraffic? 2. What knowledge does train engineer have and how do they work today? 3. Is it possible to change the current regulation without decrease the safety?Methodology:Literature study, interview and observation has been performed to see which issues switcheshas and what underlying effects that causes them. A workshop has been held with teacher andstudents in a school for train engineer. Collected data has been analyzed for compilation of thestudies result. Findings:As the regulation is written today it creates a complete stop in traffic when a switch with swingnose crossing goes in control. The studies result shows that train engineers has anunderstanding of the how switches with <b>swing</b> <b>nose</b> crossing works and therefore could it bepossible to alter the regulation. A change in this regulation could mean less delayed traintraffic. But also a greater risk for more collision between train and switches which could lead tothat more switches have to be repaired. A standardized approach in how to control a switchcould decrease this risk. Implications:The {{purpose of this}} study through the problem definition is deemed answered. Theunderstanding on the train engineer awareness <b>of</b> switches with <b>swing</b> <b>nose</b> crossing and theirdemands has been a great significance for the development work. More interviews andworkshops would have enhanced the scientific result. Recommendation:I advocate for a change in the regulation so that train engineer are allowed to pass a switch with swingnose crossing even if it’s not in control. There is also of great weight to study the back laying reasonsfor why train engineer misjudge switches position and why the switches doesn’t go in control...|$|R

2500|$|In 1924, Louis Armstrong {{joined the}} Fletcher Henderson dance band for a year, as {{featured}} soloist. The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong {{was a master}} of his hometown style, {{but by the time}} he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young Coleman Hawkins), sounded [...] "stiff, stodgy," [...] with [...] "jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality." [...] The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of [...] "Mandy, Make Up Your Mind" [...] by George W.

50|$|Though younger pace bowlers tend to rely {{exclusively}} on speed, as bowlers age {{they tend to}} develop this more sophisticated art <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> bowling.

40|$|NOTES INÉGALES IS A COMMON PRACTICE IN THE per- formance of French baroque music. It {{indicates}} that {{the first of a}} pair of equally notated notes is played longer, similar to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> eighths in jazz. The perfor- mance of that inequality is an ongoing source of debate, but the actual performance has not been studied yet. In an experiment, eight harpsichordists and eight baroque violinists performed six melodies of French baroque gavottes in three tempo conditions. The mean ratio of inequality was 1. 63, with mean ratios of individual per- formers varying between 1. 89 and 1. 33. Another sig- nificant source of variance was the metric structure, with larger inequality found at metrically important points. Tempo also had an important influence, but individual interpretation varied greatly. For example, while most performers played more evenly while tempo increased, some performers chose the opposite strategy. Pitch interval had only a minor impact on the execution of the notes inégales, but also showed differences between performers. The results show the importance of personal style in music performance: although the music played is highly standardized, we show how the timing of different performers can be influenced by dif- ferent aspects of the musical structure...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{applicability}} of multi-criteria decision analysis preference elicitation techniques in cognitively impaired individuals. - Method: A convenience sample of 16 cognitively impaired subjects and 12 healthy controls was asked {{to participate in a}} small pilot study. The subjects determined the relative importance of four decision criteria using five different weight elicitation techniques, namely simple multi-attribute rating technique, simple multi-attribute rating technique using swing weights, Kepner-Tregoe weighting, the analytical hierarchical process, and conjoint analysis. - Results: Conjoint analysis was judged to be the easiest method for weight elicitation in the control group (Z = 10. 00; p = 0. 04), while no significant differences in difficulty rating between methods was found in cognitively impaired subjects. Conjoint analysis elicitates weights and rankings significantly different from other methods. Subjectively, cognitively impaired subjects were positive about the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the weight elicitation techniques. However, it seems the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> weights can result in the employment of shortcut strategies. - Conclusion: The results of this pilot study suggest that individuals with mild cognitive impairment are willing and able to use multi-criteria elicitation methods to determine criteria weights in a decision context, although no preference for a method was found. The same methodologic and practical issues can be identified in cognitively impaired individuals as in healthy controls and the choice of method is mostly determined by the decision context...|$|R

500|$|Hirst's batting {{continued}} to be more successful than his bowling, {{to the point where}} commentators regarded him as primarily a batsman, who bowled occasionally. In 1900, he scored 1,960 runs at an average of 40.83, his best batting record to date, but his total of wickets fell to 62 at an average of 26.90, his worst average until 1914. His only representative cricket came in end-of-season festival matches, including a Gentlemen v Players match. Yorkshire won the County Championship, the first of three consecutive victories in which Hirst played a leading role. After his achievements in the season, Hirst was selected as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year.

40|$|Background: Extracellular vesicles (EV), the {{collective}} term for vesicles released from cells, consist of vesicle species {{ranging in size}} from 30 nm to 5 µm in diameter. These vesicles are most commonly isolated by differential centrifugations, which pellets particles based on their differential movement through the liquid medium in which they are immersed. Multiple parameters, including the utilization of different rotor types, can influence the yield and purity of isolated vesicles; however, the understanding of how these factors affect is limited. Materials and methods: Here, we compare the influence of multiple centrifugation parameters, including the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>swinging</b> bucket and fixed angle rotors, as well as different centrifugation times, for the isolation of the smallest EVs, “exosomes. ” In particular, we determine the yields of exosomal RNA and protein, as well as the nature of the isolated vesicles and possible protein contamination with methods such as electron microscopy, western blot and flow cytometry. Results: Our results show that application of a specific g-force or rotation speed by itself does not predict the ability of pelleting exosomes, and that prolonged centrifugation times can achieve greater yields of exosomal RNA and protein, whereas very long centrifugation times result in excessive protein concentrations in the exosome pellet. Conclusion: In conclusion, rotor type, g-force and centrifugation times significantly influence exosome yield during centrifugation-based isolation procedures, and current commonly recommended isolation protocols may not be fully optimized for yield and purity of exosomes...|$|R
