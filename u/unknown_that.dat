5|$|Because it was <b>unknown</b> <b>that</b> Michael became extratropical before landfall, {{it was the}} {{initially}} {{considered the}} first tropical cyclone to strike Newfoundland since Hurricane Luis in 1995. Furthermore, Michael was also considered the first hurricane to make landfall in Canada since Hurricane Hortense in 1996. When the Meteorological Service of Canada and the National Research Council flew a Convair research flight into Michael on October19, {{it was the first}} successful research flight made into a tropical cyclone by those agencies. Subsequent flights have been made into Tropical Storm Karen, Hurricane Isabel (while inland), Hurricane Juan, and Hurricane Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the <b>unknown</b> <b>that</b> is to come.|$|E

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{is a fairly}} new and growing field of study. Though it can date back {{as early as the}} days of Plato and Aristotle, it was not identified as a specific practice.

These topics are important to education and as a result it is important to understanding human cognition, learning, and social perception.|$|E
25|$|According to {{morphological}} data, Diplomystidae {{is usually}} {{considered to be}} the most primitive of catfish and the sister group to the remaining catfish, grouped in a clade called Siluroidei. Recent molecular evidence contrasts the prevailing hypothesis, where the suborder Loricarioidei are the sister group to all catfish, including Diplomystidae (Diplomystoidei) and Siluroidei; though they were not able to reject the past hypothesis, the new hypothesis is not unsupported. Siluroidei was found to be monophyletic without Loricarioid families or Diplomystidae with molecular evidence; morphological evidence is <b>unknown</b> <b>that</b> supports Siluroidei without Loricarioidea.|$|E
25|$|Venice, Southern Italy and Sicily {{served as}} {{outposts}} of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy. Venice's close mercantile {{links to the}} Byzantine empire resulted in the architecture of that city and its vicinity being a blend of Byzantine and northern Italian influences, although nothing from the ninth and tenth centuries has survived except for {{the foundations of the}} first St. Mark's Basilica. This building was presumably similar to Justinian's Church of the Holy Apostles based on its layout, but how it was roofed is <b>unknown.</b> <b>That</b> southern Italy was reconquered and ruled by a Byzantine governor from about 970 to 1071 explains the relatively large number of small and rustic Middle Byzantine-style churches found there, including the Cattolica in Stilo and S. Marco in Rossano. Both are cross-in-square churches with five small domes on drums in a quincunx pattern and date either to the period of Byzantine rule or after. The church architecture of Sicily has fewer examples from the Byzantine period, having been conquered by Muslims in 827, but quincunx churches exist with single domes on tall central drums and either Byzantine pendentives or Islamic squinches. Very little architecture from the Islamic period survives on the island, either.|$|E

500|$|While {{there has}} been {{speculation}} that the song is about drugs such as LSD or marijuana, particularly with lines such as [...] "take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship" [...] and [...] "the smoke rings of my mind", Dylan has always denied the song is about drugs. Though he was using marijuana {{at the time the}} song was written, Dylan was not introduced to LSD until a few months later. Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer's spirit or muse, or the singer's search for transcendence. In particular, biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his book Like a Complete <b>Unknown</b> <b>that</b> the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration. Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for Jesus Christ and for the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The song may also reference gospel music, with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation.|$|E
500|$|The {{two main}} {{standalone}} spectroscopy techniques for forensic chemistry are FTIR and AA spectroscopy. [...] FTIR is a nondestructive process that uses infrared light {{to identify a}} substance. [...] The attenuated total reflectance sampling technique {{eliminates the need for}} substances to be prepared before analysis. [...] The combination of nondestructiveness and zero preparation makes ATR FTIR analysis a quick and easy first step in the analysis of unknown substances. [...] To facilitate the positive identification of the substance, FTIR instruments are loaded with databases that can be searched for known spectra that match the unknown's spectra. [...] FTIR analysis of mixtures, while not impossible, presents specific difficulties due to the cumulative nature of the response. [...] When analyzing an <b>unknown</b> <b>that</b> contains more than one substance, the resulting spectra will be a combination of the individual spectra of each component. [...] While common mixtures have known spectra on file, novel mixtures can be difficult to resolve, making FTIR an unacceptable means of identification. [...] However, the instrument can be used to determine the general chemical structures present, allowing forensic chemists to determine the best method for analysis with other instruments. [...] For example, a methoxy group will result in a peak between 3,030 and 2,950 wavenumbers (cm−1).|$|E

500|$|Of Hannah Rosebery's homes, {{the lease}} on Lansdowne House was {{surrendered}} shortly before her death, when the Roseberys purchased 38 Berkeley Square. This property {{was transformed into}} one of London's most luxurious town houses. However, Lady Rosebery did not {{live to see the}} work completed. Her son Harry sold the house in 1938, and it was demolished. A year later a bomb landed on the empty site during World War II. The Durdans was bequeathed to her daughter, Sybil, in 1929 and was sold together with its contents in 1955. Lord and Lady Rosebery's library there was given to the nation at this time. Mentmore, the grandest of the Roseberys' homes, was sold by Lady Rosebery's grandson, the 7th Earl of Rosebery, in 1977, together with the Rothschild art collection, which Lady Rosebery had not only been intensely interested in but had enlarged considerably. She personally catalogued the collection, and prophetically wrote in the preface [...] "In time to come, when, like all collections, this will be dispersed (and I hope this will be long after my death) this book may be of value." [...] Her two-volume work and the collection it described remained so <b>unknown</b> <b>that</b> [...] "" [...] (a group attempting to halt the sale of Mentmore to keep the collection within Britain) failed largely due to widespread public ignorance of both house and collection. A few pieces of furniture and paintings were taken to Dalmeny, (the only house to remain in the family) where they are displayed today, and three pictures including Drouais' Madame de Pompadour were purchased for the National Gallery. The remainder of the collection was dispersed in a week-long sale and is now scattered across the globe.
