As Jesus vs. Santa became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series. Fox refused to pick up the series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two were initially skeptical of possible television deals, noting that previous endeavors had not turned out successful. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids' show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned the development of the show into a series.|$|E

Bidding reached $30,000, but some bids were considered illegitimate and Trade Me staff removed them, and in other cases, bidders themselves requested to be removed.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{worked to}} keep the script's pop-culture {{references}} up-to-date over the years of development. Kinberg confirmed that the film would make fun of Deadpool's portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It also makes jokes at that expense of Green Lantern. While Miller {{felt that it was}} okay for audience members to not understand all of the jokes in the film, he wanted to avoid things specifically targeted to comic fans, saying that [...] "any joke that an audience needs to look <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> after the movie is not something I’m in favour of." [...] The film's post-credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where the title character breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool. In the scene, Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home. He also confirms that Cable will appear in the sequel.
