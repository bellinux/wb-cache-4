40|$|An {{alternative}} {{version of}} the theory of multiplicative <b>unitaries</b> is presented. Instead of the original regularity condition of Baaj and Skandalis we formulate another condition selecting manageable multiplicative <b>unitaries.</b> The manage-ability is the property of multiplicative <b>unitaries</b> coming from the quantum group theory. For manageable multiplicative <b>unitaries</b> we reproduce all the essential results of the original paper of Baaj and Skandalis and much more. In particular the existence of the antipode and its polar decomposition is shown. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this article, {{we study}} {{geometric}} <b>unitaries</b> of JB-algebras (in particular, self-adjoint parts of C∗-algebras). We {{will show that}} the geometric <b>unitaries</b> of a JB algebra are precisely those central algebraic <b>unitaries</b> (or central symmetries). We will also show that the group of surjective isome-tries on a JB-algebra A (with point-norm topology) is the semi-direct product of the canonical action of its Jordan automorphism group (with point-norm topology) on the group of geometric <b>unitaries</b> of M(A) (with the strict topol-ogy). As a consequence, a continuous isometric action of a connected group on a unital JB-algebra is automatically an action by Jordan automorphisms (without knowing a priori that those isometries preserve the identity) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{entangling}} power of <b>unitaries</b> {{was introduced by}} Zanardi, Zalka and Faoro [PRA, 62, 030301].

We show that the permutations with zero entangling power are, up to local <b>unitaries,</b> the identity and the swap. We construct the permutations with the minimum nonzero entangling power for every dimension. With the use of orthogonal latin squares, we construct the permutations with the maximum entangling power for every dimension. Moreover, we show that the value obtained is maximum over all <b>unitaries</b> of the same dimension, with possible exception for 36. We numerically classify, according to their entangling power, the permutation operators of dimension 4 and 9, and we give some estimates for higher dimensions.

Various types of masas have been identied and investigated, often categorized by their groups of normalizing <b>unitaries.</b> At one end of the spectrum are the regular or Cartan masas; these have suciently many normalizing <b>unitaries</b> to generate M. At the other end are the singular masas; the only normalizing <b>unitaries</b> of such a masa A are the <b>unitaries</b> of A, [4]. In [...] ...|$|R
