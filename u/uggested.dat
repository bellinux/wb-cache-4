40|$|Summary. Nucleocytoplasmic {{determination}} ofmale ste-rility in Thymus vulgaris L. {{has been}} assumed in all pa-pers attempting {{to explain the}} remarkably high frequen-cies of male steriles found in natural populations of this species. This paper provides strong evidence that both nuclear and cytoplasmic genes {{are involved in the}} deter-mination of male sterility of this species, giving a com-plex inheritance. Interpopulation and intrapopulation crosses have shown that the ratio of females versus hermaphrodites among offsprings varied widely from 1 : 0 to 1 : 1. Furthermore, interpopulation crosses consistently yielded a higher frequency of females than intrapopula-tion crosses. Nucleocytoplasmic inheritance was demon-strated by an absence of male fertiles in backcrosses and asymmetrical segregation i reciprocal crosses.

40|$|RNA of {{more than}} 40 {{hantavirus}} i olates, originating from rodents and humans of widely separated geographical reas, was copied to cDNA using reverse transcriptase and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

DNA products were digested with 20 restriction endonucleases and cleavage patterns were analysed. For strains of known sequence, the restriction patterns observed were consistent with those predicted from sequence data, demonstrating that the amplified pro-ducts originated from target virus RNA. Further analyses <b>uggested</b> that all amplified viruses could be easily typed into one of five restriction patterns using only five enzymes.
