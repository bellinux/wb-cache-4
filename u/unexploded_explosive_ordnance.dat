50|$|During the Cold War {{period of}} 1958 to 1965, Canada {{permitted}} the United States to practise high-altitude photographic reconnaissance over Grey Goose Island with the RB-52C Stratofortress. M120 photoflash bombs were used, and possibly practice bombs. Small-calibre machine gun rounds {{may have been}} fired. Because {{of the possibility that}} <b>unexploded</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>ordnance</b> or other munitions are buried in the ground, or may still remain on the island, Canada’s Department of National Defence has retained the area. However, occasionally, the island's wildlife resources are harvested by the Cree.|$|E
