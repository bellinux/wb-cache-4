5|$|The fleet {{made its}} first {{landfall}} at Cozumel, and Cortés remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> of them. At Cozumel, Cortés heard rumours of bearded men on the Yucatán mainland, who he presumed were Europeans. Cortés sent out messengers to them {{and was able to}} rescue the shipwrecked Gerónimo de Aguilar, who had been enslaved by a Maya lord. Aguilar had learnt the Yucatec Maya language and became Cortés' interpreter.|$|E
25|$|To about 1620, {{the fashionable}} hat was the capotain, {{with a tall}} conical crown rounded {{at the top and}} a narrow brim. By the 1630s, the crown was shorter and the brim was wider, often worn cocked or pinned <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side and {{decorated}} with a mass of ostrich plumes.|$|E
25|$|The slouch hat {{was first}} worn by {{military}} forces in Australia in 1885, looped <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side so that rifles could {{be held at the}} slope without damaging the brim. After federation, the slouch hat became standard Australian Army headgear in 1903 and since then it has developed into an important national symbol and is worn on ceremonial occasions by the Australian army.|$|E

25|$|To {{produce a}} shock wave, {{an object in}} a given medium (such as air or water) must travel faster than the local speed of sound. In {{the case of an}} {{aircraft}} travelling at high subsonic speed, regions of air around the aircraft may be travelling at exactly the speed of sound, so that the sound waves leaving the aircraft pile <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> another, similar to a traffic jam on a motorway. When a shock wave forms, the local air pressure increases and then spreads out sideways. Because of this amplification effect, a shock wave can be very intense, more like an explosion when heard at a distance (not coincidentally, since explosions create shock waves).|$|E
25|$|The game uses Autolog, the competition-between-friends system {{developed}} by Criterion for , and since {{used in other}} titles in the Need for Speed series. Autolog in Most Wanted plays a larger role and gives more information to players. Activities in-game allow players to earn Speed Points which can boost players up on the Most Wanted list. Autolog recommendations have now been integrated into the game world, rather than sit externally on the menu system. Most Wanted features a new social system called Cloudcompete, which strings together Most Wanted across all platforms in an inspired example of cross-compatibility. One profile is used for all versions of the game, allowing the player to rank <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> format and continue progress on another.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Eugénie hat {{was named}} after Eugénie de Montijo, wife of Napoleon III, whose fashion choices were publicised in fashion sketches and closely scrutinised across Europe and the United States. The design became popular in the 1850s and 1860s, when it was {{also known as the}} empress hat. It was characterised by its forward tilt and featured feathers and ribbons. Typically it was made of velvet or felt. Mary Brooks Picken noted that the hat was generally small in its original incarnation, often with the brim turned <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> or both sides, with what were generally ostrich feathers as a trim. It would normally be tilted towards the right. Originally, the hat was worn for horseriding and travelling.|$|E

25|$|On October 20th, the French ship-of-the-line Triton under Captain Comte de Ligondès, {{cruising}} on the Bay of Biscay, fell in {{with the}} British ship-of-the-line Jupiter, under Captain Francis Reynolds, and the frigate Medea, under Captain James Montagu. At about 5 PM both sides were at close quarters; Jupiter ranged <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side of the Triton, Medea on the other, about nightfall, and they cannonaded the Triton hotly. The French captain succeeded in turning the same broadside to both his assailants, putting Medea out of action with a thirty-six pound shot below the water line after the first half-hour of fight, but he was wounded in both arms soon afterward and had {{to hand over the}} command to Lieutenant de Roquart. Medea retreated from the action; Triton and Jupiter continued to exchange fire for more two hours, until a squall of wind and rain, and the impenetrable darkness of the night separated the combatants.|$|E

500|$|The two rap {{tracks in}} the session used the Massenburg EQ plug-in, [...] "the '9' send goes to the eighth-note delay track {{immediately}} above the two rap tracks" [...] and Digidesign Extra Long Delay. Strange also used compressors, including the Alta Moda Unicomp, which he felt works well on vocals, {{as well as the}} kick and snare drums. Boi-1da's track mostly used SSL and compression, but the bass used an API 550a. A Digidesign compressor limiter was set <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> of the horn sounds while the Massenburg EQ was used on an OB8 sound. Answering Eminem's request, string overdubs were arranged and recorded by Jordan Evans and Matthew Burnett—providing additional production—and Robert Reyes recorded the choir's vocals.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side of the room, and my guys were lined up {{on the other side of}} the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E
