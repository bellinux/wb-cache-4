One hundred and sixty questionnaires were distributed to teacher training colleges-and to members <b>of</b> the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zimbabwe’s</b> Faculty <b>of</b> Education. A 72 % response was received. The results revealed that although most institutions have set guidelines for the assessment of student teachers, these were not often followed and the bases of criteria used varied enormously. It was also revealed that the majority (75 %) of the institutions have lists of criteria used for assessment in written form. Despite this, impressionistic, rather than analytic methods for assessing teaching practice are still prevalent. This study indicates that there are serious weaknesses in the current system of teaching practice assessment and suggestions on how this could be improved are made...|$|R

40|$|An Occasional Paper on In-Service {{training}} in Zimbabwe. To {{a greater extent}} than many other industrialising countries, Zimbabwe has sought to ensure that externally funded research and study be pursued in ways that relate directly to their own development concerns. If a study is worth permitting, then it should seek as far as possible to address itself to priorities that are consistent with national needs and interests. This implies that if a study is in some measure to serve these needs, there must be a process of renegotiation with the authorities so that the research agenda can be localised. An essential result of this process of localisation must be a reporting back both to the policy community and to the research community {{during the course of the}} study. In the case of this present research, this reporting took two forms. At the end of the first three weeks of work, during July 1987, a seminar on results was arranged at the Zimbabwe Institute for Development Studies (ZIDS), and copies of the preliminary paper were provided to the Ministry of Labour and Ministry of Education. At the end of the second short trip of two weeks in July 1988, two seminars were arranged. One involved key training directors and training experts from the private sector, including several of the largest enterprises in Zimbabwe.

2500|$|The {{educational}} system in Zimbabwe {{which was once}} regarded as {{among the best in}} Africa, has gone into crisis because of the country's economic meltdown. Almost a quarter of the teachers have quit the country, absenteeism is high, buildings are crumbling and standards plummeting. One foreign reporter witnessed hundreds of children at Hatcliffe Extension Primary School in Epworth, 12 miles west of Harare, writing in the dust on the floor because they had no exercise books or pencils. The high school exam system unravelled in 2007. Examiners refused to mark examination papers when they were offered just Z$79 a paper, enough to buy three small candies. Corruption has crept into the system and may explain why in January 2007 thousands of pupils received no marks for subjects they had entered, while others were deemed [...] "excellent" [...] in subjects they had not sat. Various disused offices and storerooms have been turned into makeshift brothels at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zimbabwe</b> in Harare by students and staff who have turned to prostitution to make ends meet.

40|$|This {{study was}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the influence of socio-cultural factors on HIV prevention strategies among HIV discordant couples in Harare, Zimbabwe. HIV sero-discordance is a scenario whereby one partner is HIV-positive and the other is HIV-negative. HIV sero-discordant couples are a unique and vulnerable population that encounters many peculiar challenges. When dealing with this population, researchers have to deal with contradictory ideas and perceptions presented by each partner making up the couples and also understand the relationship in the context of cultural values, norms and the dynamic of power and oppression. In addition to this, the concept of HIV sero-discordance and the frequency of its occurrence are poorly understood in most African communities. Despite the growing evidence of HIV discordance, HIV prevention strategies have largely focused on clinical aspects at the expense of socio-cultural issues that impact on HIV prevention strategies targeted at HIV sero- discordant couples. The study seeks to contribute to the conceptualization and design of intervention programs dealing with sero-discordance. The study is underpinned by the symbolic interactionism theory and was qualitative in design involving 13 HIV discordant couples in heterosexual relationships enrolled in the HIV Preventions Trials Network 052 Study (HPTN 052 Study) being undertaken by the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zimbabwe’s</b> department <b>of</b> medicine. The study utilized 2 Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and 10 in-depth interviews (IDI) to collect data. The study’s findings indicate that discordant couples are in fact critical stakeholders in the uptake of all the available HIV prevention strategies. Failure to acknowledge this tenet is self-defeating as evidenced by the perception of viewing condom use within a marriage as humiliating for a woman. The study further noted that practitioners in the HIV prevention domain must guard against over-relying on the scientifically demonstrated efficacy of the strategies. The study recommends that HIV prevention strategies must be socially and culturally acceptable and embedded for them to be more efficacious. SociologyM. A.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{sustainable}} conservation management in Southern Africa with due consideration and diligence for the indigenous {{communities of the}} areas involved. Southern African conservation restricts the mobility of black peasants and enhances the mobility of white tourists. Nowhere is this inequality {{more evident than in}} plans for a vast, trans-boundary conservation area known as the Great Limpopo. The scheme would open borders for animals and visitors while confining smallholders to small locales. How have well-meaning conservationists come to promote such a biased, structurally racist set of ideas? Disguising this bias, the Great Limpopo relies upon convoluted assumptions regarding space and time. For space, supporters of the Great Limpopo have elaborated two scales for planning and social intervention. The scheme conjures a Cape-to-Cairo bio-region and landscape of leisure, the African scale for tourists. For peasants, the same planners - especially in Zimbabwe - have crafted an intensive, place-based model of development. White tourists will expand across the African continent whereas black smallholders should involute in “communities. ” Yet, within in geographical scale, each group will gain in freedom and power. This false of sense of equality extends from space to time. Southern African bio-regional thinking looks to the future, imagining wildlife ranges and and profitable hotels where neither currently exists. In anticipation of unseen growth, policy-makers open borders for the tourist trade. Meanwhile, the same planners ignore the obvious peasant future of growing populations. Assuming stasis, planners close boundaries and enclose the landscape. Such untenable notions have already been overtaken by events, especially in Zimbabwe, where tourists are now afraid to travel and para-military bands destroy fences. It is time to rethink transboundary conservation in the Great Limpopo and elsewhere. Funding for this study was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (though the BASIS program of the Land Tenure Center, <b>University</b> <b>of</b> Wisconsin), by Rutgers University, and by the Social Science Research Council (through a MacArthur Foundation-funded NGO summer fellowship).

40|$|A conference {{paper on}} rural {{development}} integrated programmes in Zimbabwe. The programme recognizes that communities can overcome poverty if they create among themselves {{a new vision}} for the future, work together to achieve this vision, and are assisted with appropriate resources and technological capacity to implement their development initiatives. IRDP aims to establish a model for eradicating rural poverty through support, initially for three years, of development initiatives in nine rural sites in six countries in southern Africa, namely Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. IRDP developed four main objectives for its work in southern Africa: • To mobilize rural communities to work together, optimizing their institutional capacities to support sustainable and integrated development • To increase community capacity towards sustainable development, especially among economically marginalized groups, • To increase the capacity of individuals, families and communities to follow healthy and defensive lifestyles • To develop community capacity especially among women and the youth in life skills, family and community values, and sensitive and responsible leadership. To achieve these objectives, IRDP has taken an approach that includes, among many other things, adopting and advocating for policies that favour sustainable rural development at selected sites, national and SADC levels. IRDP further developed six cross-cutting impact services that provide strategic support to the whole programme, aiming to increase the programme’s impact, and therefore, chances of its success. The services function at the programme management and community levels, and consist of: monitoring and evaluation, technology, organizational learning, networking, communication, and public policy and promotion. This document has been written to highlight how public policy and promotion, the last in the list above, can be utilized to further IRDP’s objectives, as well as suggesting methodologies for using this service within the programme.
