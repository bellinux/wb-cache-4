This process {{is accompanied by}} hydrolysis of both the ester and the amide group {{but it is not}} the free amine that is isolated but the urea 14 by reaction with potassium cyanate. In the next step the carboxylic acid group is esterified with ethanol and the <b>urea</b> <b>group</b> replaced with a benzoyl group. The final step is a claisen condensation of 15 with ethyl quininate 16, which after acidic workup yields racemic quinotoxine 17. The desired enantiomer is obtained by chiral resolution with the chiral dibenzoyl ester of Tartaric acid. The conversion of this compound to quinine is based on the Rabe/Kindler chemistry discussed in the timelime.|$|E
50|$|The work, however, {{on which}} Fischer's fame chiefly rests, was his {{studies of the}} purines and the sugars. This work, carried out between 1882 and 1906 showed that various substances, little known at that time, such as adenine, xanthine, in {{vegetable}} substances, caffeine and, in animal excrement, uric acid and guanine, all belonged to one homogeneous family and could be derived from one another and that they corresponded to different hydroxyl and amino derivatives of the same fundamental system formed by a bicyclic nitrogenous structure into which the characteristic <b>urea</b> <b>group</b> entered. This parent substance, which at first he regarded as being hypothetical, he called purine in 1884, and he synthesized it in 1898.
