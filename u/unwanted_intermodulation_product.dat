40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new predistortion lineariza-tion scheme for single sideband mixers {{to be used}} for removing <b>unwanted</b> harmonics and <b>intermodulation</b> <b>products</b> of the digital intermediate frequency (IF) in an heterodyne transmitter. The proposed algorithm called poly-harmonic predistortion lineariza-tion relies on an orthogonal expansion in the frequency domain of the nonlinearities for the mixer modeling. It takes into account memory effects which are piece-wise quasi-memoryless and enables the independent cancellation of unwanted spurious sidebands of the digital IF harmonics. The poly-harmonic pre-distortion linearization scheme for the weak-nonlinear regime was implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and experimentally investigated for the linearization of a 4 -path polyphase single sideband upconverter. The ability of the poly-harmonic predistortion algorithm to linearize the 4 -path polyphase mixer for input signals with high envelope fluctuation is demonstrated. - 70 dBc/- 62 dBc/- 60 dBc spurious rejection and 18 dB/ 10 dB/ 8 dB linearization improvement of the 3 rd order distortions are achieved for a two-tone RF signal, a 64 -tone 10 MHz bandwidth multisine signal and OFDM signal respectively. The combination of the polyphase multipath technique and the poly-harmonic predistortion linearization technique offers an attractive filterless approach for the development of multi-mode broadband software defined radio.

First, the strong jamming signals mix within the victim receiver front-end to produce <b>intermodulation</b> <b>products</b> that may fall on its desired receive channel and cause interference. The strong signals may also saturate the receiver circuits and cause desensitization.
