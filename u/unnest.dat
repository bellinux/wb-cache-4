We thus get a formal semantics of nested databases as well as operations for nesting and unnesting which keep {{as much information as}} possible and therefore build the ideal passage between relations of different nesting levels. The organisation of the paper is as follows: In Section 1 we give a short introduction to nested relational databases. Section 2 illustrates the domain theoretic approach. In particular, the snack-powerdomain which models set-types is defined, and the interpretation of database relations in the new setting is given. We begin Section 3 with giving an intuitive, picture-oriented account of nested snacks (these will model nested relations). After that we turn to defining nest and <b>unnest</b> and proving the result claimed above. Finally we show how the snack representation of a nested relation behaves under <b>unnest</b> and nest in Section 4. 2 Nested Relational Database...|$|E

In this paper, we derive incremental expressions for the nest and <b>unnest</b> operators in nested relations. The expressions are derived for both general nested relations using set operators for updating relations and for partitionnormal form (PNF) relations using extended set operators for updating relations After deriving the incremental expressions, two algorithms are presented for maintaining views defined by nest and <b>unnest</b> operators in PNF. 1 Introduction Efficient maintenance of materialized views is important in improving the performances of database systems, especially of data warehouses. To maintain materialized views, one has a choice between recomputing the views from scratch or maintaining the views incrementally.

40|$|Containment and disjointedness are two {{important}} properties in updating materialized views. The disjointedness {{means that the}} tuples to be inserted into the view must be disjoint from the view, and the containment means that the tuples {{to be removed from}} the view are contained in the view. In this paper, we show that the disjointedness and containment for at relations are not precise for partitioned normal form nested relations. We then give our denitions of containment and disjointedness for nested relations. After that, we prove that these denitions are faithful and precise. To achieve the proofs, we also derived some properties for the <b>unnest</b> operators on nested relations...|$|E

While previous work has considered XML views {{for the purpose of}} querying relational databases (e. g. Silkroute), in this paper we consider the problem of updating a relational database through an XML view. Using the nested relational algebra as the formalism for an XML view of a relational database, we study the problem of when such views are updatable. Our results rely on the observation that in many XML views of relational databases, the nest operator occurs last and the <b>unnest</b> operator does not occur at all. Since in this case the nest operator is invertible, we can consider this important class of XML views as if they were flat relational views...|$|E
40|$|XPath {{queries are}} usually {{translated}} into an algebra that combines traditional relational operators and XML-speciffic ones.

In XQuery, two additional issues shall be handled - tree construction {{and the presence of}} user-deffined functions. The recursive nature of functions pushes the problem outside of the range of relational algebra. This thesis presents a novel evaluation framework based on an expanding network of relational operators, called R-program. In this environment, functions are evaluated in bulk instead of evaluating each call separately. Besides obvious advantages of bulk evaluation, R-programs also allow rearrangement of data flow across function boundaries. A set of program transformations employing these capabilities is described; together with rule-based static interprocedural analysis algorithms used to determine the applicability of the transformations...|$|E

40|$|Queries against {{databases}} are {{formulated in}} declarative languages. Examples are the relational query language SQL and XPath or XQuery for querying data stored in XML. Using a declarative query language, the querist {{does not need}} to know about or decide on anything about the actual strategy a system uses to answer the query. Instead, the system can freely choose among the algorithms it employs to answer a query. Predominantly, query processing in the relational context is accomplished using a relational algebra. To this end, the query is translated into a logical algebra. The algebra consists of logical operators which facilitate the application of various optimization techniques. For example, logical algebra expressions can be rewritten in order to yield more efficient expressions. In order to query XML data, XPath and XQuery have been developed. Both are declarative query languages and, hence, can benefit from powerful optimizations. For instance, they could be evaluated using an algebraic framework. However, in general, the existing approaches are not directly utilizable for XML query processing. This thesis has two goals. The first goal is to overcome the above-mentioned misfits of XML query processing, making it ready for industrial-strength settings. Specifically, we develop an algebraic framework that is designed for the efficient evaluation of XPath and XQuery. To this end, we define an order-aware logical algebra and a translation of XPath into this algebra. Furthermore, based on the resulting algebraic expressions, we present rewrites in order to speed up the execution of such queries. The second goal is to investigate rewriting techniques in the relational context. To this end, we present rewrites based on algebraic equivalences that <b>unnest</b> nested SQL queries with disjunctions. Specifically, we present equivalences for unnesting algebraic expressions with bypass operators to handle disjunctive linking and correlation. Our approach can be applied to quantified table subqueries as well as scalar subqueries. For all our results, we present experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approaches...|$|E
