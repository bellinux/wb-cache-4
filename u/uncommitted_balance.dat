40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (Trust Fund) was established in 1970 to help fund {{the development of a}} nationwide airport and airway system and to fund investments in air traffic control facilities. It provides all of the funding for FAA's accounts such as the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which provides grants for construction and safety projects at airports, the Facilities and Equipment (F&E),which funds technological improvements to the air traffic control system, and the Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D). In addition, the Trust Fund provides some funding for FAA's operations account. To fund these accounts, the Trust Fund relies on a number of taxes for revenue, including passenger ticket, fuel, and cargo taxes that are paid by passengers and airlines. Since 1970, revenues have generally exceeded expenditures [...] resulting in a surplus or an <b>uncommitted</b> <b>balance.</b> In 2004, the Trust Fund's year end <b>uncommitted</b> <b>balance</b> was about $ 2 billion. A number of structural changes in the aviation industry and external events have affected revenues flowing {{into and out of the}} Fund and have caused some aviation stakeholders to speculate about the Fund's financial condition. The various taxes that accrue to the Trust Fund are scheduled to expire in 2007. GAO was asked to provide information and analysis about the financial outlook of the Trust Fund. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Actual trust-fund revenues fell short of FAAs revenue forecasts for 9 of the past 11 years, contributing {{to a decline in}} the trust funds <b>uncommitted</b> <b>balance</b> from over $ 7 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $ 770 million in fiscal year 2010. Inaccurate forecasts for the taxes related to domestic passenger tickets, which account for over 70 percent of trust-fund revenues, drove the aggregate overforecast, but inaccurate forecasts for other taxes also had an effect. This inaccuracy is largely attributable to unexpected events affecting aviation, such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the recession in 2009; the budget process requiring the forecasts to be developed over a year in advance of the fiscal year; and lags in recognizing structural changes in the airline industry, such as airlines increased reliance on ancillary fees for which excise taxes for the trust fund are not collected. Changes in the methodology for forecasting trust-fund revenues and the assumption of forecasting responsibility by Treasury, begun in fiscal year 2011, may also affect the future accuracy of forecasts, but {{it is too soon to}} tell what effect the changes will have after just 1 fiscal year. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (Trust Fund), and the excise taxes that support the Trust Fund are scheduled for reauthorization {{at the end of}} fiscal year 2007. FAA is primarily supported by the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from a series of excise taxes paid by users of the national airspace system (NAS). The Trust Fund's <b>uncommitted</b> <b>balance</b> decreased by more than 70 percent from the end of fiscal year 2001 through the end of fiscal year 2005. The remaining funding is derived from the General Fund. This report focuses on the portion of revenues generated from users of the NAS and addresses the following key questions: (1) What advantages and concerns have been raised about the current approach to collecting revenues from NAS users to fund FAA, and to what extent does available evidence support the concerns? (2) What are the implications of adopting alternative funding options to collect the revenues contributed by users that fund FAA's budget? (3) What are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} authorizing FAA to use debt financing for capital projects? This report is based on interviews with relevant federal agencies, including FAA, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congressional Budget Office. GAO also obtained relevant documents from these agencies, other key stakeholders, and academic and financial experts. ...|$|E
