Special attention has to be paid to intertidal and inshore zones where, due to sea-level rise, coastlines have changed and many former coastal sites are now submerged in shallow water. Mapping the detailed inshore topography is therefore important to reconstruct former coastlines, identify sunken archaeological structures and locate potential former harbour sites.

The control of a High-Speed Supercavitating Vehicle (HSSV) poses unique challenges, since only small regions at the nose (cavitator) and on the afterbody (fins) are in contact with water and can be used as control surfaces. The interaction between supercavity dynamics and control surface actuation is complex and nonlinear. Experiments were conducted with a semi-axisymmetric, ventilated supercavity and a single wedge-shaped, 45 degree swept, cavitypiercing fin in the high-speed water tunnel at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Motion control was combined with water tunnel testing to create a hardware-in-the-loop system that can (a) provide critical hydrodynamic parameters for control models and (b) serve as a test bed for fin control strategies.

40|$|Direction of Arrival (DOA) {{estimation}} {{finds its}} practical importance in sophisticated video conferencing by audio visual means, locating <b>underwater</b> <b>bodies,</b> removing unwanted interferences from desired signals etc. Some efficient algorithms for DOA estimation are already {{developed by the}} researchers. The performance of these algorithms {{is limited by the}} fact that the receiving antenna array is affected by some uncertainties like mutual coupling, antenna gain and phase error etc. So considerable attention is there in recent research on this area. In this research work the effect of mutual coupling and the effect of antenna gain and phase error in uniform linear array (ULA) on the direction finding of acoustic sources is studied. Also this effect for different source spacing is compared. For that, estimates of the directions of arrival of all uncorrelated acoustic signals in the presence of unknown mutual coupling has been found using conventional Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT). Also DOAs are computed after knowing the coupling coefficients so that we can compare the two results. Simulation results have shown the fact that the degradation in performance of the algorithm due to mutual coupling becomes more if the sources become closer to each other. Also we have estimated DOAs in the presence of unknown sensor gain and phase errors and we have compared this results with the results we got by considering ideal array. Finally in this case also the effect of gain and phase error as the source spacing varies has been tested. Simulation results verify that performance degradation is more if the sources become closer...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental method of selecting the optimum slenderness ratio {{of a body}} with cylindrical midsection. Whether such a body is a large submarine or its arch enemy, the depth charge, the problem rem a ins to find a slenderness ratio which will permit the fastest possible velocity consistent with the power or sinking weight available. Considerable {{research has been done}} to determine the hydrodynamic characteristics of nose shapes both alone and combined with various afterbodies. In one of our reports we have pointed out that any one of several different nose shapes could be used on a particular body with little change in the total drag coefficient, and tests for certain afterbody shapes would probably bring similar results. Due to practical considerations, most bodies have a cylindrical midsection. Therefore, a typical <b>underwater</b> <b>body</b> of axial symmetry consists of arbitrarily selected nose and afterbody shapes separated by a cylindrical midsection. For dynamic stability, any <b>underwater</b> <b>body</b> must have fins which increase the surface area and, to some degree, the residual drag. We must necessarily consider the effect of such fins on slenderness ratio. In the following discussion of a particular concrete example, the emphasis has been placed on a body with a nose and afterbody with fins, of the same geometrical shape as the MK 13 - 1 torpedo (less shroud ring). The MK 13 - 1 torpedo is dynamically stable, has a cylindrical midsection, and has been tested with other nose shapes. After examination of the factors affecting the optimum slenderness ratio, it is found that a reasonably large variation from the theoretical optimum value will have little practical effect on the velocity of the body. Because of practical factors involved in the design of an undersea body, it may be desirable from the designer's point of view to have a relatively large slenderness ratio. This investigation shows that as far as drag per unit volume is concerned, the designer will will pay very little, if any, penalty if he disregards the drag factor and bases his selection of slenderness ratio entirely on such items as tactical requirements of maneuverability, structural design and utilization of internal space...|$|E

This paper presents the CFD analysis of a hydrodynamic depressor carried out using the software FLUENT. The incompressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equation with Standard k- turbulence model is solved to estimate hydrodynamic performance of the depressor. The characteristics such as lift and drag forces, lift and drag coefficients, velocity and pressure distribution around the wings and body of the depressor are evaluated at a negative angle (angle that gives a lift component of force in the downward direction) of attack.

Hence, the two-phase flow is a subject which is interesting for many researchers all around the world. In this paper, the non-linear free surface deformations which occur during the water-exit of a circular cylinder due to its buoyancy are solved using finite volume discretization based code, and using Volume of Fluid (VOF) scheme for solving two phase flow. Dynamic mesh model is used to simulate dynamic motion of the cylinder. In addition, the effect of cylinder mass in presence of an external force is studied. Moreover, the oblique exit and entry of a circular cylinder with two exit angles is simulated. At last, water-exit of a circular cylinder in six degrees of freedom is simulated in 3 D using parallel processing. The simulation errors of present work (using VOF method) for maximum velocity and height of a circular cylinder are less than the corresponding errors of level set method reported by previous researchers. Oblique exit shows interesting results; formation of waves caused by exit of the cylinder, wave motion in horizontal direction and the air trapped between the waves are observable. In 3 D simulation the visualization of water motion on the top surface of the cylinder and the free surface breaking on the front and back faces of the 3 D cylinder at the exit phase are observed which cannot be seen in 2 D simulation.

The choice of a small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) form has been motivated by its excellent properties of seakeeping qualities, combined with a non-conventional low resistance underwater hull shape, currently under patenting process, which is able to reduce to a minimum the resistance of the vessel especially at higher speeds.
