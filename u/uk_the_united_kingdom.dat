5000|$|There are two {{sovereign}} {{states in the}} isles: Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Ireland, sometimes called the Republic of Ireland, governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with {{the remainder of the}} island forming Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland {{is a part of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply the United Kingdom, which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The Isle of Man and the two states of the Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey, are known as the Crown Dependencies. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence; responsibility for international representation rests largely upon the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the <b>UK.</b> <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> is made up of four constituent parts: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and Northern Ireland in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have [...] "devolved" [...] governments, meaning that each has its own parliament or assembly and is self-governing with respect to certain areas set down by law. For judicial purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England and Wales (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdiction, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{not a legal}} requirement, {{accreditation}} {{is often}} stipulated and supported by local governments. In order to ensure equally high standards of certification across Europe, the European Commission for Enterprise and Industry set out a European-wide policy for accreditation. This ensures consistency in the accreditation market and is {{designed to protect the}} consumer. Accordingly, it is mandatory for every European member-state to have a single national Accreditation Body (NAB). In the <b>UK,</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> Accreditation Service (UKAS) is the formally appointed National Accreditation Body, following the adoption the European regulation. The new Regulation (EC Regulation 765/2008), which came into force on 1 January 2010, requires each member state to appoint a single national accreditation body. UKAS has therefore been appointed by statutory instrument providing, for the first time, a legal basis for its role. The accreditation Regulations 2009 (Statutory Instrument No 3155/2009) making the appointment were signed on 30 November 2009 by Lord Drayson, Minister for Science and Innovation, and announced in a Written Statement to Parliament. In the statement, Lord Drayson said: “The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has a long standing and effective relationship with UKAS that both parties value highly. We will continue to work together not only to ensure that the requirements of the EC Regulation are fulfilled but to improve the quality and breadth of accreditation in the UK.” Outside of Europe, there is not a set regulation. For example, in the USA there are multiple Accreditation Bodies, whereas within Australasia there is the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand. For those countries without a designated National Accreditation Body, the International Accreditation Forum lists member Accreditation Bodies International Accreditation Forum Members and Recognition Categories [...] that only accredit competent bodies, providing buyer confidence.|$|E
