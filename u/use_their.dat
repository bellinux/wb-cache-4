40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1992 This project {{investigates the}} {{subtraction}} methods used by secondary school students. Four subtraction questions, presented in vertical form, were answered by 1, 370 students from Forms 1 to 6 {{at a private}} school for boys. The study documented subtraction methods which the students had not been taught at school but had made up. It was found that 136 students (9. 9 % of the sample) <b>used</b> <b>their</b> own methods. One question revealed 37 different ways of working out the subtraction. The proportion of students <b>using</b> <b>their</b> own methods increased exponentially with year level. The students who <b>used</b> <b>their</b> own methods were compared with students who used taught methods. Analysis of pooled results from different year levels revealed a significantly higher proportion of students <b>using</b> <b>their</b> own methods in the under-achieving maths classes.

40|$|This fMRI work studies brain {{activity}} of healthy volunteers who manipulated a virtual {{object in the}} context of a digital game by applying two different control methods: <b>using</b> <b>their</b> right hand or <b>using</b> <b>their</b> gaze. The results show extended activations in sensorimotor areas, not only when participants played in the traditional way (<b>using</b> <b>their</b> hand) but also when they <b>used</b> <b>their</b> gaze to control the virtual object. Furthermore, with the exception of the primary motor cortex, regional motor activity was similar regardless of what the effector was: the arm or the eye. These results have a potential application in the field of the neurorehabilitation as a new approach to generate activation of the sensorimotor system to support the recovery of the motor functions...|$|R
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to <b>use</b> <b>their</b> venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, <b>use</b> <b>their</b> venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} {{of studies that}} illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example of}} local resistance to globalization. Women there <b>use</b> <b>their</b> wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind.

Microbats may <b>use</b> <b>their</b> vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances.
