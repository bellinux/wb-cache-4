5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>have</b> expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus may {{be known}} from less {{complete}} remains outside of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming.

Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may represent an eastern representative of the genus. Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>have</b> also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus, but most of these have been misidentified; there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>have</b> been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial.

Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>have</b> provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
