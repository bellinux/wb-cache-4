The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E

5|$|Crushing {{can also}} be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due to}} environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} gender stereotypes for leaders <b>using</b> <b>a</b> more indirect method than is typical in stereotype research. Rather than reveal the leader 2 ̆ 7 s gender, {{this study used}} vignettes in which the leader 2 ̆ 7 s gender was unknown. Consistent with their hypothesis, the authors found that participants {{were more likely to}} infer a male (female) gender identity than a female (male) gender identity when presented with <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> masculine (feminine) style. They also hypothesized that <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-consistent leadership style would be viewed more positively than <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent style. Contrary to this hypothesis, results revealed that men <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent (feminine) style were actually evaluated more positively than men <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-consistent style. It is interesting that a perceived female leader who <b>used</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent (masculine) style was evaluated more positively than a perceived male leader who <b>used</b> <b>a</b> masculine style, but only by female participants. Possible explanations for these results are discussed...|$|R
