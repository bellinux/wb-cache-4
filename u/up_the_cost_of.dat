5|$|Anglo-Norman warfare was characterised by attritional {{military}} campaigns, {{in which}} commanders tried to raid enemy lands and seize castles {{in order to}} allow them to take control of their adversaries' territory, ultimately winning slow but strategic victories. Pitched battles were occasionally fought between armies but these were considered risky engagements and usually avoided by prudent commanders. The armies of the period comprised bodies of mounted, armoured knights, supported by infantry. Crossbowmen become more numerous in the 12th century, alongside the older shortbow. At the heart of these armies was the familia regis, the permanent military household of the king, which was supported in war by feudal levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign. Mercenaries were increasingly employed, driving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> warfare considerably, and adequate supplies of ready cash became essential for the success of campaigns.|$|E

He succeeded, as the budget lawmakers and new governor Eliot Spitzer agreed to appropriate enough money for DOT to continue paying the Thruway Authority for snow removal, litter pickup and mowing along the entire highway save the bridge.

25|$|The Commissioners met for {{the first}} time on 6 June 1760, and planned the {{take-over}} of all of the drainage mills in the region, the construction of new ones, and the digging of the main drainage channels which would feed surface water to the mills and into the rivers. To finance these operations, there were empowered to borrow money, and to charge a drainage rate of 1 shilling (5p) per acre, rising to 1/6d (7.5p) after seven years. The costs of carrying out such work were grossly optimistic, and the commissioners were soon in financial difficulties. Despite this, and heavy flooding in the winter of 1761/2, which resulted in no taxes being collected, the Commissioners owned eight mills by 1774, each of which used a scoop wheel to lift water into the rivers. The costs of maintenance and repair of the mills were high, not helped by the Naval shipbuilding programme driving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> oak.|$|E
25|$|As the Nintendo Entertainment System grew in {{popularity}} and entered millions of American homes, some small video rental shops began buying their own copies of NES games, and renting {{them out to}} customers for around the same price as a video cassette rental for a few days. Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game, and unlike movie rentals, a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day. Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals, but didn't take any formal legal action until Blockbuster Video began to make game rentals a large-scale service. Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> games. Nintendo lost the lawsuit, but did win on a claim of copyright infringement. Blockbuster was banned from including original, copyrighted instruction booklets with their rented games. In compliance with the ruling, Blockbuster produced their own short instructions—usually {{in the form of}} a small booklet, card, or label stuck on the back of the rental box—that explained the game's basic premise and controls. Video rental shops continued the practice of renting video games and still do today.|$|E
25|$|Other {{variations}} of the standard minifigure produced for Star Wars sets included the light-up light-saber (L.U.L.S.) minifigures. These figures were released {{as a part of}} the more expensive Star Wars Episode III sets in 2005. These figures look like standard minifigures, but to facilitate internal electronics, their parts cannot be removed; the only exception to this is the headgear, the left hand and arm, and each of the legs from the hips. When the head is pressed down, an LED illuminates the light-saber blade. These figures rely on battery power for their special feature. The batteries last three hours and are not intended to be replaced, although replacement is possible. Many fans, especially children, were amenable to this innovation. Others however, particularly adult collectors, found these figures contentious, considering them to be an unwelcome gimmick. The fact that in two cases unique characters were produced solely as L.U.L. minifigs, with no standard version available to collectors, was also an unpopular decision. Following the initial release of these figures Lego announced no more were to be produced, due to their unpopularity and more expensive production. One set, the 7261 Clone Turbo Tank, which featured an L.U.L. version of Jedi Knight Mace Windu, was even reissued with a standard version of the minifig and an extra Clone Trooper figure to make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the set. There was also at least one high end City themed set (a Police Station/HQ) that included a police officer with a light up 'torch'. Another L.U.L.S. minfig in police uniform appeared without the 'saber' part of the light saber and a yellow LED in the 'handle' of the light saber, reusing the L.U.L.S. design outside the Star-wars setting as an effective 'torch'. He appeared in a high end City set based on a standard and well selling City Police HQ design. A complaint about the set was that the L.U.L.S. minifig was contained in a 'try me' compartment of the box allowing customers (and excited children) to wear down his battery while he was still on the shelf. The set was discontinued after a year with a separate identical design but with 3 extra normal minifgs replacing the L.U.L.S. minfig.|$|E

In late 1917, the Navy proposed to expand the eight-four plan by adding two more battlecruisers; this was approved, and two more Amagi-class ships were ordered. However, having eight [...] gun ships (four battleships and four battlecruisers) on order put an enormous financial strain on Japan, which was spending {{about a third of}} its national budget on the Navy.

500|$|The {{ownership}} group filed {{a motion}} saying that the lawsuit {{and the release of}} the emails by the city were meant to drive <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> leaving Seattle and force the ownership group to sell the team. The motion requested that all emails and other records be released to the team. Slade Gorton, lead attorney for the city, responded by pointing out that it was PBC that started the fight that led to the lawsuit when they filed for arbitration to break the lease. The motion was denied by the presiding judge, who said the team failed to make a [...] "good-faith effort" [...] to resolve the dispute and that it failed to show that trial preparations were hindered by the records not being made public. However, the ruling also said the team could bring up the issue again if it could prove the relevance or the confidentiality of the records.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, Wade Dean {{formed the}} Glacier Mining Company and filed mining {{claims to the}} sulfur on Adams' [...] summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first {{assessment}} work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to [...] thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, {{it could not be}} carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made {{over the course of the}} mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned Forest Service lookout, a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed [...] lean-to was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above [...] could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of [...] recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of [...] This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit ice cap. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean’s desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959. [...] Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} {{psychological}} {{experiments in the}} 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.|$|R
5000|$|While this {{aggregation}} {{of buying}} power allows pediatricians to negotiate lower prices for products, concerns {{have been raised}} by economists and consumer groups that the bundling contracts that require pediatricians to buy all of their vaccines from one company inhibit competition, impede {{the introduction of new}} vaccines, reduce physician choice and, ultimately, drive <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> vaccines to physicians, the government, and taxpayers. [...] In response to this criticism, pharmaceutical companies have stated bundling is one of the options available to pediatricians, and the contracts are lawful and provide real value.|$|R
30|$|Many of the {{barriers}} young people face stem from weak fundamentals that constrain job creation and income generation more generally {{in much of}} the region. These include poor infrastructure, weak governance and corruption, regulations that drive <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> doing business, and limited access to credit. While youth employment strategies cannot address all of these challenges, they should go beyond standard active labor market programs to include, for example, interventions that encourage and support youth self-employment and entrepreneurship and programs that improve productivity and livelihoods in agriculture. To this point, youth employment strategies have not been framed in this way.|$|R

2500|$|While the Brussels {{metropolitan}} area grew quickly, {{the population of}} the City of Brussels proper declined considerably. [...] In 1910, Brussels had 185,000 inhabitants; in 1925 this number fell to 142,000. [...] Reasons for this depopulation were manifold. [...] First, the fetid stench of the disease-laden Senne river caused many to leave the city. [...] Second, cholera broke out in 1832 and 1848, which led to the Senne being completely covered over. [...] Third, the rising price of property and rental rates caused many inhabitants to search for affordable living situations elsewhere. [...] Higher taxes on patents, which were up to 30% higher than those in neighboring municipalities, stifled economic development and drove <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> city living. [...] These higher patent prices were abandoned in 1860. Finally, the industrialization that occurred in the neighboring areas drew workers out of the city. [...] These social changes helped speed the process of Francization in the central city. In 1920, three bordering municipalities, each having a large number of Dutch-speaking inhabitants, were amalgamated into the City of Brussels.|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2013, the USAF {{believes}} that the LRS-B can reach Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2025. Reportedly, the main risk is funding, {{in light of the}} F-35 Lightning II's acquisition difficulties and a lack of an [...] "urgent threat". Prior bomber programs were hindered by a lack of funding, only 21 B-2 Spirits were produced out of 132 planned and fewer B-1 Lancers were built than were envisioned; both programs were scaled down due to spiraling per aircraft costs. Research funding was allocated, as stealthy technologies to counter anti-access/area-denial threats were spared from budget cuts. The USAF stated the LRS-B is a top priority as it is believed that China will overcome the B-2's low-observable features by the 2020s. Where possible, existing technologies and proven subsystems will be used in order to keep it within budget, instead of developing new and riskier ones. Components such as engines and radars may be off-the-shelf or adaptions of existing models, such as derivative technologies of the F-35. The LRS-B is intended to perform any long range mission, rather than one specialized mission, which drove <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the B-2. The USAF expects it to cost $1 billion each with development costs factored in, and aims for a per-aircraft cost of $550 million, considered reasonable for a limited production run military aircraft.|$|E
