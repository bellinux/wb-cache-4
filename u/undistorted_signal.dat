In the easterly direction, {{transmissions}} are attenuated, so, in Eastern Europe, only a weak signal can be heard. However, {{because of a}} defect in the antenna system, only the carrier frequency is properly screened to the east; the sidebands suffer less attenuation, so that, in the east, sideband reception is adequate (especially if using an SSB receiver) but distorted. Following the collapse of one mast in the four-mast phased array on October 8, 2012, the two-mast reserve antenna has been in use, resulting in a reduced signal in parts of France but a stronger and <b>undistorted</b> <b>signal</b> in northern Europe and the British Isles.|$|E

When played through distortion, the intermodulation leads to the production of partials closely related in frequency to the harmonics of the original two notes, producing a more coherent sound. The intermodulation makes the spectrum of the sound expand in both directions, and with enough distortion, a new fundamental frequency component appears an octave lower than the root note of the chord played without distortion, giving a richer, more bassy and more subjectively 'powerful' sound than the <b>undistorted</b> <b>signal.</b> Even when played without distortion, the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound, owing to the resultant tone effect. Power chords also have the advantage of being relatively easy to play (see [...] "Fingering" [...] below), allowing fast chord changes and easy incorporation into melodies and riffs.|$|E

It is known that under certain conditions the output of a linear system is more gaussian than the input. Hence, an inverse filter is searched, such that its output is minimally gaussian. We use the kurtosis {{as a measure of}} the non-gaussianity of the signal. A maximum of the kurtosis {{as a function of the}} deconvolving filter coefficients is searched. The search is done iteratively using the gradient ascent algorithm, and the coefficients at the maximum point correspond to the inverse filter coefficients. This filter may be applied to the distorted signal to obtain the original <b>undistorted</b> <b>signal.</b> While a similar approach has been used before, it was always directed at a particular kind of a signal, commonly of impulsive characteristics.

40|$|Abstract — Transcoding is a {{technique}} to convert one video bitstream into another. While homogeneous transcoding is done at the same coding standard, inhomogeneous transcoding converts from one standard format to another standard. Inhomogeneous transcoding between MPEG- 2, MPEG- 4 or H. 263 was performed using the same transform. With the standardisation of H. 264 also a new transform basis and different block size was defined. For requantization from block size��to��this leads {{to the effect that}} the quantization error of one coefficient in a block of size��is distributed over multiple coefficients in blocks of size��.

40|$|Measuring {{voice quality}} for {{telephony}} {{is not a}} new problem. However, packet-switched, best-effort networks such as the Internet present significant new challenges for the delivery of real-time voice traffic. Unlike the circuit-switched public switched telephone network (PSTN), Internet protocol (IP) networks guarantee neither sufficient bandwidth for the voice traffic nor a constant, acceptable delay. Dropped packets and varying delays introduce distortions not found in traditional telephony. In addition, if a low bitrate codec is used in voice over IP (VoIP) to achieve a high compression ratio, the original waveform can be significantly distorted. These new potential sources of signal distortion present significant challenges for objectively measuring speech quality. Measurement techniques designed for the PSTN may not perform well in VoIP environments. Our objective is to find a speech quality metric that accurately predicts subjective human perception under the conditions present in VoIP systems. To do this, we compared three types of measures: perceptually weighted distortion measures such as enhanced modified Bark spectral distance (EMBSD) and measuring normalizing blocks (MNB), word-error rates of continuous speech recognizers, and the ITU E-model. We tested the performance of these measures under conditions typical of a VoIP system. We found that the E-model had the highest correlation with mean opinion scores (MOS). The E-model is well-suited for online monitoring because it does not require the original (<b>undistorted)</b> <b>signal</b> to compute its quality metric and because it is computationally simple...|$|E

Earlier {{studies have shown}} an impairing eﬀect on memory of spoken words when being presented in noise or long reverberation. Digital distortions, e. g. packet loss, echoes or jitter are assumed to have similar eﬀects on working memory. Digital distortions are often caused by packet loss. In this experiment eﬀects on working memory due to packet loss in GSM- coded speech was investigated and compared to a noise condition. Word lists with 10 words in each list were presented via headphones. To ensure that the sub jects perceived all words correctly the sub jects were asked to repeat all words directly after listening to them. After all ten words had been presented {{they were asked to}} write down as many words as they could remember. Four conditions were compared: one <b>undistorted</b> <b>signal,</b> one signal distorted by noise (signal to noise ratio S/N 4 dB), one signal which was distorted by light and one with severe packet loss.

In consistence with previous studies, an impairing eﬀect of noise on the participants’ ability to recall the spoken words was shown, while packet loss did not aﬀect recall of spoken words. It is suggested that further studies with other kinds of distortions should be carried out. Future studies should also include recall of spoken lectures or stories, as it is assumed that diﬀerent memory process are used under such conditions.

Unlike analyses used in previous studies, our approach does not rely on peak measurements and can provide a more sensitive measure of processing delays. Young and old adults (mean ages 22 and 70 years) performed a non-speeded discrimination task between two faces. The phase spectrum of these faces was manipulated parametrically to create pictures that ranged between pure noise (0 % phase information) and the <b>undistorted</b> <b>signal</b> (100 % phase information), with five intermediate steps. Results Behavioural 75 % correct thresholds were on average lower, and maximum accuracy was higher, in younger than older observers. ERPs from each subject were entered into a single-trial general linear regression model to identify variations in neural activity statistically associated with changes in image structure. The earliest age-related ERP differences occurred in the time window of the N 170. Older observers had a significantly stronger N 170 in response to noise, but this age difference decreased with increasing phase information. Overall, manipulating image phase information had a greater effect on ERPs from younger observers, which was quantified using a hierarchical modelling approach. Importantly, visual activity was modulated by the same stimulus parameters in younger and older subjects. The fit of the model, indexed by R 2, was computed at multiple post-stimulus time points. The time-course of the R 2 function showed a significantly slower processing in older observers starting around 120 ms after stimulus onset. This age-related delay increased over time to reach a maximum around 190 ms, at which latency younger observers had around 50 ms time lead over older observers. Conclusion Using a component-free ERP analysis that provides a precise timing of the visual system sensitivity to image structure, the current study demonstrates that older observers accumulate face information more slowly than younger subjects. Additionally, the N 170 appears to be less face-sensitive in older observers. </p...|$|E

Second, the ICM seeks institutional reform to cut ‘red tape’ but not cost-effective service delivery. The third and fourth pillars of the ICM promote price, tax and spatial information risk and opportunity cost transparency.

40|$|Due to {{distances}} and relative motions among the transmitter, target object, and receiver, the time-base between any transmitted and received signal will undergo distortion. Pre-distortion of the transmitted signal {{to compensate for}} this time-base distortion allows reception of an <b>undistorted</b> <b>signal.</b> In most radar applications, an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) {{would be used to}} store the pre-calculated waveform and then play back this waveform during transmission. The Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR), however, has transmission durations that exceed the available memory storage of such a device. A waveform generator capable of real-time pre-distortion of a radar waveform to a given time-base distortion function is needed. To pre-distort the transmitted signal, both the baseband radar waveform and the RF carrier must be modified. In the GSSR, this occurs at the up-conversion mixing stage to an intermediate frequency (IF). A programmable oscillator (PO) is used to generate the IF along with a time-varying phase component that matches the time-base distortion of the RF carrier. This serves as the IF input to the waveform generator where it is mixed with a baseband radar waveform whose time-base has been distorted to match the given time-base distortion function producing the modulated IF output. An error control feedback loop is used to precisely control the time-base distortion of the baseband waveform, allowing its real-time generation. The waveform generator produces IF modulated radar waveforms whose time-base has been pre-distorted to match a given arbitrary function. The following waveforms are supported: continuous wave (CW), frequency hopped (FH), binary phase code (BPC), and linear frequency modulation (LFM). The waveform generator takes as input an IF with a time varying phase component that matches the time-base distortion of the carrier. The waveform generator supports interconnection with deep-space network (DSN) timing and frequency standards, and is controlled through a 1 Gb/s Ethernet UDP/IP interface. This real-time generation of a timebase distorted radar waveform for continuous transmission in a planetary radar is a unique capability...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} systems are moving towards a heterogeneous solution, where small-cell base stations such as pico-cells and femto-cells are used concurrently with macro- cell base stations in high data traffic areas. Small-cell networks {{are expected to}} provide much larger wireless data rates and capacity in small areas while only consuming {{a fraction of the}} power. However, power amplifier nonlinearity does not scale down with the size of the base station; a similar degree of nonlinearity correction is required in both small-cell and macro-cell base stations, meaning that the power consumed by the signal linearization circuits is the same. An analog-radio frequency pre-distortion (ARF-PD) solution, operating at a fraction of a conventional digital pre-distortion's power consumption, has been proposed to support the unrestrained growth of wireless communication. This thesis forms part of an ongoing research project aimed at developing a fully integrated ARF-PD solution - a promising, low-power alternative to digital pre-distortion for future wireless communications. Specifically, it focuses on delivering an integrated design of a low-power high-linearity broadband radio frequency (RF) vector multiplier, which can be used as part of the ARF-PD solution. An RF vector multiplier {{is considered one of the}} major function blocks in analog pre-distortion solutions, as it allows the analog pre-distorter to interface with the <b>undistorted</b> <b>signal</b> in the RF domain. In the thesis, two RF vector multiplier designs are proposed and implemented in integrated circuits. In the first implementation, the RF vector multiplier is designed to directly apply pre-distortion to the RF signal. This architecture imposes a need for high gain in the RF vector multiplier, which results in large transistor size and high power consumption in the output stage. The design is able to achieve promising simulation results, however, performance limitations and disadvantages are also clearly exposed compared to commercial products. To resolve the issues discovered, an alternative ARF-PD architecture is adopted to relax the output power level needed from the RF vector multiplier. In addition, a self-linearized variable gain amplifier topology is proposed to improve system linearity. Overall, the second design shows significant improvement in bandwidth, linearity and output noise level, while only consuming half of the power consumed by the first design. Ultimately, simulation results have shown satisfying performance for both RF vector multipliers as part of an ARF-PD system.

FVR is {{an adaptation of}} the virtual reference (VR) method, which consists in referencing signals detected by each electrode in a grid to their spatial average. Signals may however be distorted with the VR approach, in particular when the skin region where the detection system is positioned does not cover the entire muscle. Methods: Simulated and experimental EMGs were {{used to compare the}} performance of FVR and VR in terms of interference reduction and distortion of monopolar signals referred to a remote reference. Results: Simulated data revealed the monopolar EMG signals processed with FVR were significantly less distorted than those filtered by VR.

Moreover, FVR method outperformed VR in removing power line interference when it was distributed unevenly across the signals of the grid. Conclusion: Key results demonstrated that FVR improves the VR method as it reduces interference while preserving the information content of monopolar signals. Significance: Although the actual distribution of motor unit action potential is represented in monopolar EMGs, collecting high quality monopolar signals is challenging.

50|$|The inputs to the {{algorithm}} are two waveforms represented by two data vectors containing 16 bit PCM samples. The first vector contains the {{samples of the}} (<b>undistorted)</b> reference <b>signal,</b> whereas the second vector contains the samples of the degraded signal. The POLQA algorithm consists of a temporal alignment block, a sample rate estimator of a sample rate converter, {{which is used to}} compensate for differences in the sample rate of the input signals, and the actual core model, which performs the MOS calculation. In a first step, the delay between the two input signals is determined and the sample rate of the two signals relative to each other is estimated. The sample rate estimation is based on the delay information calculated by the temporal alignment. If the sample rate differs by more than approximately 1%, the signal with the higher sample rate is down sampled. After each step, the results are stored together with an average delay reliability indicator, which is a measure for the quality of the delay estimation. The result from the re-sampling step, which yielded the highest overall reliability, is finally chosen. Once the correct delay is determined and the sample rate differences have been compensated, the signals and the delay information are passed on to the core model, which calculates the perceptibility as well as the annoyance of the distortions and maps them to a MOS scale.

With wavelet decomposition, pulse signal can be decomposed into different scales of wavelet coefficients and recomposed according to the low-frequency coefficient of the bottom and high-frequency coefficients of various layers. During the process of wave recomposition, the coefficients related to noise can be rejected while the valuable information in the pulse signal maintained, and all the processes achieve the restoration of pulse signal. What is more, after simulating the wavelet transform algorithm using MATLAB, {{the consequences of this}} simulation indicate that multiple interferences can be effectively suppressed while keeping the pulse <b>signal</b> <b>undistorted</b> and it sustains the relevant characteristics of pulse signal...|$|R
40|$|New generations {{wireless}} communication systems require linear efficient RF power amplifiers for higher data transmission rates. However, conventional RF power amplifiers are normally designed for peak efficiency under maximum output power condition. Consequently, {{when the power}} is backed-off from its maximum point, the amplifier efficiency drops sharply. As a result, the mean amplifier efficiency is {{much lower than the}} efficiency at peak power level. The Chireix outphasing power amplifier {{is one of the most}} promising techniques that can simultaneously provide high efficiency and high linearity. Such approach was the origin of the term LINC (LInear amplification using Nonlinear Components), a technique that allows the power amplifiers to continuously operate at their peak power efficiency while providing an almost <b>undistorted</b> output <b>signal.</b> In this project, a Chireix outphasing amplifier for 2. 14 GHz with load compensation has been fabricated using GaN HEMTs delivered by CREE. A considerable efficiency improvement has been achieved. The simulation result shows that the drain efficiency of 74 % is obtained at 49 dBm peak output power, and the efficiency is kept above 55 % over 10 dB power back-off range. The drain efficiency of 70 % is measured at 48. 5 dBm output power. To meet an increasing demand for {{wireless communication}} terminals to handle multi-band multi-mode operation, multi-band multi-mode power amplifiers are urgently needed. An investigation into how to implement multi-band Chireix's outphasing amplifiers has been carried out. Two proposals for implementing potential dual-band Chireixâs amplifiers have been presented. In addition, a comparison of the efficiency under the condition of static load modulation has been made between GaN HEMT devices and LDMOS devices. The result of the comparison is that GaN HEMT devices conspicuously outperform LDMOS devices in terms of drain efficiency under static load modulation.

40|$|Though shorter laser pulses {{can also}} be produced, pulses of the 100 fs range are {{typically}} used in femtosecond kinetic measurements, which are comparable to characteristic times of the studied processes, making detection of the kinetic response functions inevitably distorted by convolution with the pulses applied. A description of this convolution in terms of experiments and measurable signals is given, followed by a detailed discussion {{of a large number}} of available methods to solve the convolution equation to get the <b>undistorted</b> kinetic <b>signal,</b> without any presupposed kinetic or photophysical model of the underlying processes. A thorough numerical test of several deconvolution methods is described, and two iterative time-domain methods (Bayesian and Jansson deconvolution) along with two inverse filtering frequency-domain methods (adaptive Wiener filtering and regularization) are suggested to use for the deconvolution of experimental femtosecond kinetic data sets. Adaptation of these methods to typical kinetic curve shapes is described in detail. We find that the model-free deconvolution gives satisfactory results compared to the classical “reconvolution ” method where the knowledge of the kinetic and photophysical mechanism is necessary to perform the deconvolution. In addition, a model-free deconvolution followed by a statistical inference of the parameters of a model function gives less biased results for the relevant parameters of the model than simple reconvolution. We have also analyzed real-life experimental data and found that the model-free deconvolution methods can be successfully used to get undistorted kinetic curves in that case as well. A graphical computer program to perform deconvolution via inverse filtering and additional noise filters is also provided as Supporting Information. Though deconvolution methods described here were optimized for femtosecond kinetic measurements, they can be used for any kind of convolved data where measured experimental shapes are similar...|$|R
40|$|Measurement {{of changes}} in optical {{properties}} of intact muscle fibers during contraction {{has proven to be}} difficult or, in some cases, impossible due to movement of the muscle relative to the incident beam. In this paper we describe a technique for immobilizing single fibers in clear gelatin, which permits measurement of light scattering <b>signals</b> <b>undistorted</b> by movement artifacts. We also describe the phase and amplitude relationship between changes in intensity of light scattering (at 90 degrees to incident beam) and tensions induced by electrically activating single fibers. With tensions that range up to 50 % Po (Po = maximal tension measured by exposure of fibers to 200 mM K+), the maximal increase in light scattering is about 25 % of that for resting fibers. The scattering increase precedes tension, and at low temperatures the interval between the two peaks can be 50 [...] 100 msec. We interpret these data on intact fibers, as we did our earlier data from studied on skinned fibers, as indicating that increases in light scattering power of muscle are primarily due to attachment of myosin cross-bridges to actin filaments...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic {{nonlinearity}} {{limits the}} use of Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs) in nonlinear ultrasound modalities, such as contrast and tissue harmonic imaging. In this paper, we experimentally investigate {{the performance of a}} linearization method based on the appli-cation of pre-distorted analog excitation signals whose spectral content compensates the harmonic distortion introduced by the CMUT. The pre-distortion is based on the accurate knowledge of the CMUT non-linear behavior, achieved by estimating the electrical impedance at several bias voltages. We tested the method using a 256 -element, 7. 5 MHz CMUT linear array probe connected to the ULA-OP 256 imaging system. We measured the acoustic pressure generated in water by a CMUT array element excited with both 4 MHz <b>undistorted</b> and pre-distorted <b>signals.</b> When using the pre-distorted signal, the sec-ond harmonic pressure level was reduced by 13 dB, resulting in a final harmonic-to-fundamental level of - 30 dB. Fundamen-tal and second harmonic B-mode images of a commercial tis-sue-mimicking phantom were finally generated using both un-distorted and pre-distorted signals. By computing the second harmonic residual power in a region of interest, a reduction of 13 dB was confirmed using the proposed linearization method in a nonlinear ultrasound imaging context...|$|R
