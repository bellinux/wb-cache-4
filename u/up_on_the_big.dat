25|$|Transitioning from a {{television}} screen {{to a movie}} meant that sets and designs needed to be more detailed, with {{a higher level of}} polish to stand <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> screen. Zimmerman felt obliged to improve on the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge. Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; Zimmerman had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked but had never had the time or money to rework it previously.|$|E
6000|$|Little Joe Otter stopped {{swimming}} and {{stared up at}} Jerry Muskrat. [...] "They look all right to me," [...] said he, as he started to climb <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock.|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} on 17 July 2009 {{that the movie}} would be live action, with computer animated effects, and David Frankel as director and Rob Lieber to adapt Magyk. As of 2009, a re-write of the script was being done with screenwriter Mulroney while Warner Brothers were working with a studio to create some early conceptual design/look development. Sage commented: [...] "It is very exciting to know that others are putting their creative input into my work—quite amazing really. [...] I'm {{really looking forward to}} seeing the whole Septimus world <b>up</b> there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> screen coming to life." ...|$|R
60|$|So Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock side of Billy Mink {{and they}} all stood {{side by side in}} their little brown bathing suits looking down into the Smiling Pool.|$|E
60|$|So said Jerry Muskrat, as {{he climbed}} <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock {{in the middle of}} the Smiling Pool, with Paddy the Beaver beside him, and watched the dear Smiling Pool {{dimpling}} and smiling in the moonlight, as he had so often seen it before the great trouble had come.|$|E
60|$|And {{what do you}} think? Why, old Grandfather Frog {{actually}} got so excited that he climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock to {{show them how to}} dive. Splash! Went Grandfather Frog into the Smiling Pool. Splash! Went Billy Mink right behind him. Splash! Splash! Went Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat, right at Billy Mink's heels.|$|E
60|$|The young caribou {{found the}} trail, put his nose down into it, then started {{cautiously}} {{back toward the}} rock to nose the other hole {{in the snow and}} be sure that it smelled just like <b>the</b> first one. <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rock <b>the</b> <b>big</b> lynx drew further back; the herd pressed close, raising their heads high to see what he was doing; and the young caribou stole up and put his nose down into the trail again. Then three living catapults shot over the high rim of the rock and fell upon him. Like a flash <b>the</b> <b>big</b> lynx was <b>on</b> his feet, drawing himself up to his full height and hurling a savage screech of exultation after the flying herd. Then he, too, shot over the rock, fell fair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neck of the struggling young caribou, and bore him down into the snow.|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} talked over, and Roger called his parents <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone.

When asked how he knew his system was sound, Mel Elfin, the rankings' founder, often answered that he knew it because those three schools always landed on top. When a new lead statistician, Amy Graham, changed the formula in 1999 to one she considered more statistically valid, the California Institute of Technology jumped to first place. Ms. Graham soon left, and a modified system pushed Princeton back to No. 1 the next year." ...|$|R
60|$|Bobby Coon helped Grandfather Frog <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock, {{and when}} he had made himself comfortable, Mrs. Muskrat told him all about Farmer Brown's boy and his traps, and how Jerry had been caught in one by the tail, and she ended by asking for his advice, because they all knew that he was so wise.|$|E
60|$|Every one {{agreed with}} Little Joe Otter, and {{immediately}} {{they began to}} plan a grand hunt for the traps of Farmer Brown's boy. The Muskrats and the Otters started to search {{the banks of the}} Smiling Pool, and the Coons and the Minks, all but Billy, started for the Laughing Brook. Billy climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock to watch, and Grandfather Frog slowly swam back to his big green lily-pad to wait for some foolish green flies for his breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the last}} one had arrived, Mother Muskrat climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock and called Jerry Muskrat up beside her, where all could see him. Then she made a speech. [...] "Friends of the Smiling Pool and Laughing Brook," [...] began Mrs. Muskrat, [...] "I have called you {{together}} {{to show you what}} has happened to my son Jerry and to ask your advice." [...] She stopped and pointed to Jerry's sore tail. [...] "What do you think did that?" [...] she demanded.|$|E

5000|$|... "Hi, I'm Robert Osborne. One of {{the things}} that fascinated moviegoers about Marlon Brando early in his movie career is you never knew in what guise he was gonna show up. The only thing that seemed {{consistent}} about him was the fact that he mumbled a lot. He mumbled in his very first film — Stanley Kramer's The Men — he mumbled even more in his second and third films, A Streetcar Named Desire and Viva Zapata! So imagine the jokes that went around when it was announced that film number four for Marlon Brando was gonna be a movie version of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Brando, the mumbler, speaking Shakespeare? I mean — ya gotta be kidding. But, indeed, soon <b>up</b> there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> screen, was Brando playing Mark Antony, delivering the famous funeral oratory, for his great assassinated friend, Julius Caesar, speaking his lines clearly and brilliantly, and surprising everybody yet again.|$|R
60|$|Once, <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Toledi, I saw {{a curious}} bit of their education. I was {{paddling}} {{across the lake}} one day, when I saw a shellbird lead her brood into a little bay where I knew the water was shallow; and immediately they began dipping, though very awkwardly. They were evidently taking their first lessons in diving. The next afternoon I was near the same place. I had done fishing--or rather, frogging--and had pushed the canoe into some tall grass out of sight, and was sitting there just doing nothing.|$|E
60|$|Everybody {{looked at}} {{everybody}} else in dismay. Then everybody began to talk at once, and if Farmer Brown's boy could have heard all the things said about him, his cheeks certainly would have burned. Indeed, I am afraid {{that they would have}} blistered. Such excitement! Everybody had a different idea, and nobody would listen to anybody else. Old Mr. Mink lost his temper and called Grandpa Otter a meddlesome know-nothing. It looked very much as if the convention was going to break up in a sad quarrel. Then Mr. Coon climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock and with a stick pounded for silence.|$|E
60|$|Now the Old Pasture is very large. It lies at {{the foot}} of the Big Mountain, and even extends a little way <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Mountain. There is room in it for many people to pick berries all day without even seeing each other, unless they roam about a great deal. You see, the bushes grow very thick there, and you cannot see very far in any direction. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had climbed a little way up in the sky by the time Farmer Brown's boy reached the Old Pasture, and was smiling down on all the Great World, and all the Great World seemed to be smiling back. Farmer Brown's boy started to whistle, and then he stopped.|$|E
5000|$|But the [...] "jail" [...] {{turns out}} to be a cover for a robber baron named [...] "Big Mac" [...] (Jack Elam) who {{proceeds}} to recruit Amos and Theodore for an upcoming train robbery. Still determined to go straight, the boys attempt to extricate themselves from the situation by attempting to warn the local sheriff. The sheriff not available, they are told to visit the saloon as there is a visiting U.S. Marshall. After dressing up as bar-room dance girls to hide themselves from Big Mac's gang, having another encounter with Hitchcock and making a trade for blankets to hide themselves, Amos and Theodore accidentally end <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> train <b>Big</b> Mac is targeting before. Amos and Theodore, with the help of Jeff Reed (Matheson), an army intelligence officer who posed as an enlisted soldier to uncover a conspiracy of military robberies, and Major Gaskil's daughter Millie (Davalos), they arrest the robbers and their inside man Lt. Jim Ravencroft (Robert Pine). Soon after given pardons, Amos and Theodore decide to resume working at Russell Donovan's farm.|$|R

60|$|When Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink {{reached the}} Smiling Pool, they climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock, and there Little Joe sulked and sulked, until finally Grandfather Frog {{asked what the}} matter was. Little Joe wouldn't tell, but Billy Mink told the whole story. When he told how Buster had been too smart for Little Joe, it tickled him so that Billy had to laugh in spite of himself. So did Grandfather Frog. So did Jerry Muskrat, who had been listening. Of course this made Little Joe angrier than ever. He {{said a lot of}} unkind things about Buster Bear and about Billy Mink and Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat, because they had laughed at the smartness of Buster.|$|E
60|$|Just as Old Mother West Wind and her Merry Little Breezes {{came down}} from the Purple Hills, and jolly, round, red Mr. Sun threw his nightcap off and began his daily climb up in the blue sky, Great-Grandfather Frog climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Rock in the Smiling Pool. Early as he was, all the little people who live along the Laughing Brook and around the Smiling Pool were waiting for him. Bobby Coon had found two traps set by Farmer Brown's boy, and Billy Mink had almost stepped in a third. No one felt safe any more, yet no one knew what to do. So they all waited for the advice of Great-Grandfather Frog, who, you know, is {{accounted}} very, very wise.|$|E
60|$|Little Joe Otter simply {{pointed to}} Grandfather Frog. Little Joe had laughed {{so much that}} he couldn't even speak. Spotty looked over to the big green lily-pad and started to laugh too. Then he saw great tears rolling down from Grandfather Frog's eyes and heard little choky sounds. He stopped {{laughing}} and started for Grandfather Frog {{as fast as he could}} swim. He climbed right <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> green lily-pad, and reaching out, grabbed the end of the fish tail in his beak-like mouth. Then Spotty the Turtle settled back and pulled, and Grandfather Frog settled back and pulled. Splash! Grandfather Frog had fallen backward into the Smiling Pool on one side of the big green lily-pad. Splash! Spotty the Turtle had fallen backward into the Smiling Pool on the opposite side of the big green lily-pad. And the fish which had caused all the trouble lay floating on the water.|$|E

50|$|Clouds {{built up}} at {{the west of the}} circuit before Q2 and there was a traffic jam in the pit lane. A {{scramble}} for position started to be evident and only one driver - Nico Rosberg - managed a clean lap without traffic, {{as the rest of the}} field dealt with the thunderstorm that was warned to arrive during Q2 and started tripping <b>up</b> <b>on</b> each other. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> casualty of <b>the</b> session was Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen who got held up by Marcus Ericsson. Räikkönen recorded a lap of 1:42.173, which was not fast enough to get into Q3 as rain started soon after. Joining Räikkönen were Pastor Maldonado, the Force Indias of Nico Hülkenberg and Sergio Pérez and the Toro Rosso of Carlos Sainz Jr., as they could not improve on their original lap times due to the conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Brave Anna {{made her}} racecourse debut in a maiden race over five furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 25 April {{in which she}} made little {{impression}} and finished eighth behind her stablemate Roly Poly. On 21 May at the Curragh the filly started at odds of 9/2 for a maiden over six furlongs and recorded her first success, taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by a length from Lady Beware. On 17 June Brave Anna was sent to England and stepped up in class for the Group Three Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ridden as on her previous start by Seamie Heffernan she started a 16/1 outsider in a sixteen-runner field headed by her stablemate Cuff, the 2/1 favourite. She started slowly and raced towards {{the rear of the}} field in the early stages before beginning to make progress in the last quarter mile. She took the lead a furlong out and held on to win by a short head from Bletchley, with Queen Kindly half a length away in third place. Heffernan commented [...] "She's a lovely filly and came here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of a good win at the Curragh. It's nice we can pitch <b>up</b> here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> day and win again. Aidan told me to give her a chance and hopefully she'd finish out well and that's what she's done." [...] whilst Aidan OBrien said that the filly would improve over longer distances and was a potential 1,000 Guineas contender.|$|R
60|$|When I saw {{the young}} again {{they were taking}} their first lessons. A dismal croaking in the tree-tops {{attracted}} me, and I came over cautiously to see what my herons were doing. The young were standing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> nest, stretching necks and wings, and croaking hungrily; while the mother stood on a tree-top some distance away, showing them food and telling them plainly, in heron language, {{to come and get}} it. They tried it after much coaxing and croaking; but their long, awkward toes missed their hold upon the slender branch on which she was balancing delicately--just as she expected it to happen. As they fell, flapping lustily, she shot down ahead of them and led them in a long, curving slant to an open spot on the shore. There she fed them with the morsels she held in her beak; brought more food from a tuft of grass where she had hidden it, near at hand; praised them with gurgling croaks till they felt some confidence on their awkward legs; then the whole family started up the shore on their first frogging expedition.|$|E

Writer Will Self, writing for The Evening Standard, called it [...] "mirthless, worthless, toothless, useless", while Johnny Vaughan in The Sun stated in his review: [...] "The mind boggles as to how this movie actually got made." [...] Kevin O'Sullivan in The Daily Mirror called it [...] "one of the worst films ever made". Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian wrote, [...] "it's a film which isn't in the slightest bit funny or sexy, and is deeply depressing. It also diminishes the reputation of many excellent TV comics, who are made to look tawdry and naff <b>up</b> there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> screen in an echoing cinema". [...] Catherine Shoard, in a review of the film in The Sunday Telegraph, stated [...] "It's hard to {{know what to say to}} this - it's like finding the right words at a nasty accident... Sex Lives of the Potato Men is probably the lewdest Brit-com since Confessions of a Window Cleaner, and certainly the worst". Shoard also described the film as [...] "Less a film than an appetite suppressant". Ben Davis in the Morning Star later included Sex Lives of <b>the</b> Potato Men <b>on</b> his list of [...] "some of the year's worst films".|$|R
50|$|He {{was living}} in a {{homeless}} shelter in Maine when he produced a demo that was eventually picked up by Artistdirect records, the offshoot of Interscope Records chief Ted Field. Kane moved to L.A. in 2001 and wrote for Seth Binzer of the rock band Crazy Town. Through his relationship with Binzer, one of Kane’s demos ended <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> desk of <b>big</b> wig Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records. Interscope co-founder Ted Field, now of Artist Direct, eventually won the bidding war to secure the right to produce Kane’s music. However, plans to release his album Rise from Ruin foundered in the wake of problems at the label. Kane was approached by Kanye West’s label and also by The Game. The only way Field would let Kane out of his contractual obligations, however, was if each of the artists paid {{a quarter of a million}} dollars to Field, which they were not willing to do. The album was released in March 2004, but is no longer available. Artistdirect Records became Radar Records, which eventually became Radar Pictures.|$|R
