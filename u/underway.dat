5|$|A {{study is}} <b>underway</b> {{concerning}} upgrading or relocating US 220 between I-68 and the Potomac River. The proposed routing would involve MD 53 between I-68 and Cresaptown, and {{is part of}} a larger study of a highway to connect Cumberland with Corridor H near Scherr, West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} were even more prone to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once <b>underway</b> they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5|$|Another worker {{died in an}} {{accident}} on the site while working on the temporary seating. Local authorities' initial assessment was that the worker caused the accident by not following the required safety procedures. , {{an investigation into the}} death was <b>underway.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the American first leg was well <b>underway,</b> there was {{speculation}} of more American dates {{to come in the}} late summer and fall, but E Street guitarist Nils Lofgren said that Springsteen and wife Patti Scialfa would make a decision later on.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be <b>underway.</b> Although this {{could result in the}} Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or planets.|$|E
5|$|Construction for {{the ride}} was well <b>underway</b> in January 2000. During construction, Superior Rigging & Erection was {{responsible}} for erecting the supports and track of the roller coaster.|$|E

5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well <b>underway</b> {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already <b>underway,</b> and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, {{the band}} posted updates to their Facebook page, {{detailing}} {{that they were}} in the process of writing and recording their next album. A few short clips were posted by the band showing some of the guitar work <b>underway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles {{have been observed}} in laboratories. Many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are <b>underway.</b>|$|E

5|$|Replenishment ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to naval vessels while on the move. This process, called <b>underway</b> replenishment, extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective range. Prior to <b>underway</b> replenishment, naval vessels had to enter a port or anchor to take on fuel. In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|E
5|$|Striking firemen delayed Havanas {{departure}} in July 1911. The firemen {{were looking}} for an additional $0.15 per day for meals while the ship was in port. A. G.

Actions under that plan include regular monitoring of populations, management of the threats of fire and P.cinnamomi, and the cold storage of seed. As of December 2009 a recovery plan is being developed. There is also a translocation project <b>underway.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{formation}} of approximately 50 {{officers of the}} Baltimore Police eventually placed themselves between the rioters and the militiamen, allowing the 6th Massachusetts to proceed to Camden Station. The companies boarded the train which quickly got <b>underway</b> for Washington, though the crowd followed the train for some miles attempting to stop it. A total of 12 civilians were killed during the riot and an unknown number were injured.|$|E
5|$|After SS-3s March 1911 launch, Whitehead's {{tried to}} sell SS-3 to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but because the {{evaluation}} of the first two U-5-class boats was still <b>underway,</b> they declined to purchase. Over the next three years Whitehead's attempted to sell the boat to the navies of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time. With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet.|$|E
5|$|After a {{month at}} Valparaíso, Yorktown took on {{refugees}} from the American, Spanish, and Italian legations in mid-January 1892. She got <b>underway</b> on the 19th and arrived at Callao, Peru, on the 25th. While Yorktown lay anchored there, tension between the United States and Chile relaxed and the crisis abated, and the Chilean later government provided compensation {{for the families of}} the American sailors that were killed.|$|E
5|$|Arniston was an East Indiaman {{that made}} eight voyages for the British East India Company (EIC). She was wrecked on 30 May 1815 during a storm at Waenhuiskrans, near Cape Agulhas, South Africa, {{with the loss}} of 372 lives – only six on board survived. She had been {{chartered}} as a troopship and was <b>underway</b> from Ceylon to England on a journey to repatriate wounded soldiers from the Kandyan Wars.|$|E
5|$|As Melbourne was {{the only}} ship of her size (both in {{dimensions}} and ship's company) in the RAN, the carrier underwent a regular rotation of commanding officers to give them experience. Commanding officers were changed on average every fifteen months, with few remaining on board {{for more than two}} years. The majority of Melbournes commanders later reached flag rank. The carrier was also called on to perform <b>underway</b> replenishments and command and control functions.|$|E
5|$|As Philadelphia became industrialized, {{immigrants}} from England, Ireland, and Germany {{settled in the}} city and the surrounding districts. The potato famine was just <b>underway</b> causing emigration from Ireland. In the areas the immigrants settled, tensions that resulted from religious, economic and cultural differences grew between residents. The majority of immigrants coming to Philadelphia were Catholic.|$|E
