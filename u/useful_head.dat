5000|$|Leats {{generally}} start {{some distance}} (a few hundred yards, or perhaps several miles) above the mill or other destination, where an offtake or sluice gate diverts {{a proportion of}} the water from a river or stream. A weir often serves to provide a reservoir of water adequate for diversion. The leat then runs along the edge or side of the valley, at a shallower slope than the main stream. The gradient determines the flow rate together {{with the quality of}} the wetted surface of the leat. The flow rate may be calculated using the Manning formula. By the time it arrives at the water mill the difference in levels between the leat and the main stream is great enough to provide a <b>useful</b> <b>head</b> of water [...] - [...] several metres (perhaps 5 to 15 feet) for a watermill, or a metre or less (perhaps one to four feet) for a water-meadow.|$|E
40|$|Hydroelectric {{power has}} become the most {{promising}} source in power sector to sustain the growth of any nation. In any hydroelectric power plant, hydraulic turbine plays a vital role which affects the overall performance of the plant and if utilized at suboptimal level, may lead to the loss of <b>useful</b> <b>head.</b> So, it becomes vital to predict the behavior of hydro-turbine under actual working conditions. Experimental approach of predicting the performance of hydro turbine is costly and time consuming compared to CFD approach. CFD has emerged out as a powerful tool for predicting the performance of mechanical bodies subjected to dynamic flow conditions. There are ample of evidences where analysts at various levels have taken the advantage of this tool to solve so many problems related to performance analysis. Along with it, simulation technique is key feature. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the turbine for mechanical failure along with predicting its performance under actual operating condition by using CFD which is generally constrained by using a prototype. With the technique of simulation we can not only get the values of performance parameters but also the visualization of concentration and distribution of various parameters like pressure, velocity, stress at various locations where we may get versed with critical zones where the failure is supposed to occur...|$|E

Several different visual layouts are examined: unlabeled layouts that contain multiple groups of items but no group headings, labeled layouts in which items are grouped and each group has a <b>useful</b> <b>heading,</b> and a target-only layout that contains just one item. A number of plausible strategies were proposed for each layout.

The main characteristics are selected and basic aspects of WBL programs profitable different from traditional university programs are designated: relevance to real production processes; student centricity; flexibility of con-tent which is built proceeding from interests of an employer and a student; high extent of integration of various disciplines and fields of knowledge; recognition of the prior certified and independent training; optimization of time expenditure; possibility of the choice of the place of training, its sequence, schedule of control actions, and other advantages. Options of a program implementation of WBL, complexity of their implementation and methods of their overcoming are described. A few critical remarks concerning WBL programs are also presented.

40|$|AbstractThe ventral intraparietal area (VIP) is a {{multimodal}} parietal area, where visual {{responses are}} brisk, directional, and typically selective for complex optic flow patterns. VIP thus could provide signals useful for visual estimation of heading (self-motion direction). A central problem in heading estimation is how observers compensate for eye velocity, which distorts the retinal motion cues upon which perception depends. To {{find out if}} VIP could be <b>useful</b> for <b>heading,</b> we measured its responses to simulated trajectories, both with and without eye movements. Our results showed that most VIP neurons very strongly signal heading direction. Furthermore, the tuning of most VIP neurons was remarkably stable {{in the presence of}} eye movements. This stability was such that the population of VIP neurons represented heading very nearly in head-centered coordinates. This makes VIP the most robust source of such signals yet described, with properties ideal for supporting perception...|$|R

Therefore, for head stability, asymmetric reflexes appear to have functional meaning to oppose the gravity force acting on the head, while it is not useful for eye reflexes because of the small influence of gravity on eye balls. In conclusion, the otolithic contribution to the vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex in cats is clearly important and is responsible for the most important differences between horizontal and vertical plane vestibular responses...|$|R
