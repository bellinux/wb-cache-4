Khoo only had two professional diplomas – a Diploma in Administrative Management and a Certified Diploma in Accounting and Finance from ACCA. He finally received an <b>unconditional</b> <b>offer</b> from the University of Stirling after he impressed the visiting Director of the MBA programme showing how he managed the award-winning shopping mall. In 1989, accompanied by his wife, he left Malaysia to pursue his MBA studies in Scotland and graduated with Distinction in 1991. Instead of returning to Malaysia, he went to Singapore again to seek better opportunities there and was offered the job as Director of Operations for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC).|$|E

According to former U.S. Ambassador to Sudan Tim Carney and Ijaz, Susan Rice, then newly appointed as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, and counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke persuaded Berger to overrule Albright's overture to Khartoum. In early October 1997, the State Department abruptly reversed its diplomatic entendre and proceeded in early November to announce new, more comprehensive trade, economic, and financial sector sanctions against the Sudanese regime.

In addition to differentiating between types of offers, the experimental designs span small and large firms as well as different levels of offer premiums. It is found that in <b>unconditional</b> <b>offers</b> to large groups of subjects (28 [...] 40), the symmetric Nash equilibrium predicts observed tendering frequencies quite accurately. For other experimental designs, the results are mixed. The analysis of shareholder tendering strategies from the experiment yields insights into (i) the effects of takeover offer designs, (ii) the appropriateness of finite-shareholder models for research, and (iii) the costs of free riding when shareholders are nonatomistic...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to use laboratory experiments to test the dynamic theory of free riding among the target shareholders during a takeover attempt. We construct our experiments to reflect the dynamics of unconditional bidding suggested by Harrington and Prokop (1993) and the dynamics of conditional bidding analyzed by Prokop (2003). The experimental results show that the observed tendering probabilities are higher than the theoretically predicted values in the case of unconditional bidding. Thus the actual behavior of shareholders is characterized by much less free riding than predicted by the theory of <b>unconditional</b> tender <b>offers.</b> In the case of conditional offers, the theoretical predictions for the tendering probabilities are confirmed by the laboratory behavior of shareholders in the case of multiple bidding. As suggested by the theory, the tendering probabilities are lower under multiple conditional bids than under <b>unconditional</b> <b>offers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{solution}} concept to three-player coalitional bargaining problems where the underlying economic opportunities are {{described by a}} partition function. This classic bargaining problem is modeled as a dynamic non-cooperative game in which players make conditional or <b>unconditional</b> <b>offers,</b> and coalitions continue to negotiate {{as long as there}} are gains from trade. The theory yields a unique stationary perfect equilibrium outcome-the negotiation value-and provide a unified framework that selects an economically intuitive solution and endogenous coalition structure. For such games as pure bargaining games the negotiation value coincides with the Nash bargaining solution, and for such games as zero-sum and majority voting games the negotiation value coincides with the Shapley value. However, a novel situation arises where the outcome is determined by pairwise sequential bargaining sessions in which a pair of players forms a natural match. In addition, another novel situation exists where the outcome is determined by one pivotal player bargaining unconditionally with the other players, and only the pairwise coalitions between the pivotal player and the other players can form. ...|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{students}} took the IELTS test {{for the sake of}} studying abroad or to get admission into a master’s program in Saudi Arabia. So, there was a genuine motivation behind taking the test other than simply determining their level of proficiency, which was indicated by very few students. The current situation in Saudi Arabia for those who wish to study abroad through the King Abdullah Scholarship Program necessitates them to provide evidence of their language proficiency to show that they can meet the language requirements of the intended program of study. In the past, students were sent to language centers (with the language component being the condition for entry into a program), and, in most cases, they needed to go through a year’s preparation program for English for academic purposes. Such measures were taken due to the prevalent global financial and economic crisis and, most importantly, due to students who spent sometimes more than 1  year in language centers. Therefore, asking {{the students}} to provide evidence of language proficiency and getting <b>unconditional</b> <b>offers</b> afterward has proved to be cost-effective and time-efficient for the government. That was the key role that the proficiency tests played in Saudi Arabia.|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} renewed {{interest}} in the relation between shareholder protection and control arrange-ments, we thoroughly review the optimality of one-share one-vote (1 S 1 V). The issue is what set of rules the entrepreneur will put in place, re take-overs, so as to maximize the IPO value of the firm. The structural changes we admit relative to the original setting of Grossman and Hart (GH, 1988) and Harris and Raviv (HR, 1989) are that both incumbent and rival manage-ment can have private benefits rather than just one of them, and that bids are <b>unconditional</b> <b>offers</b> for all shares. We first explore the set-up where the entrepreneur-founder knows {{the characteristics of the}} incumbent and rival management team and extend the analysis further to the imperfect-foresight problem where the entrepreneur-founder only knows the distribu-tion from which the rival will be drawn. We find that, from the founder’s perspective, 1 S 1 V is never optimal with imperfect foresight, and its optimality is surprisingly rare even with perfect foresight. We also explain why governments rarely step in: from simulations we find that the social impact of the charter choice seems to be far smaller than the private impact (on IPO value or post-take-over value). Lastly, we go beyond the dual-class case, explaining the rol...|$|R
