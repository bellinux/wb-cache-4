In each channel, a typical binary undergoes three evolutional stages before explosion, i. e., <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>phase,</b> supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase, and recurrent nova phase in order of time because the accretion rate decreases with time as the companion mass decreases. We can specify some accreting WDs as the corresponding stage of evolution. Intermittent supersoft X-ray source like RX J 0513. 9 - 6951 and V Sge are corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>phase</b> objects. For <b>the</b> SSS phase Cal 87 -type objects correspond to the WD+MS channel. For the WD + RG channel, soft X-ray observations of early type galaxies gave a statistical evidence of SSS phase binaries. Recurrent novae of U Sco-type and RS Oph-type correspond to the WD + MS channel and WD + RG channel, respectively. Majority of recurrent novae host a very massive WD (~> 1. 35 Mo) and often show a plateau phase in optical light curve correspondingly to the long lasted supersoft X-ray phase: These properties are indications of increasing WD masses.

40|$|We {{present a}} unified model for optical, {{ultraviolet}} (UV), and X-ray light curves of V 1974 Cygni (Nova Cygni 1992). Based on an optically thick wind model of nova outbursts, we have calculated light curves and {{searched for the}} best fit model {{that is consistent with}} optical, UV, and X-ray observations. Our best fit model is a white dwarf (WD) of mass 1. 05 M_ with a chemical composition of X= 0. 46, C+N+O= 0. 15, and Ne = 0. 05 by mass weight. Both supersoft X-ray and continuum UV 1455 Å light curves are well reproduced. Supersoft X-rays emerged on day 250 after outburst, which is naturally explained by our model: our optically thick winds cease on day 245 and supersoft X-rays emerge from self-absorption by <b>the</b> <b>winds.</b> <b>The</b> X-ray flux keeps a constant peak value for 300 days followed by a quick decay on day 600. The duration of X-ray flat peak is well reproduced by a steady hydrogen shell burning on the WD. Optical light curve is also explained by the same model if we introduce free-free emission from optically thin ejecta. A t^- 1. 5 slope of the observed optical and infrared fluxes is very close to the slope of our modeled free-free light curve during <b>the</b> optically thick <b>wind</b> <b>phase.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> stops, optical and infrared fluxes should follow a t^- 3 slope, derived from a constant mass of expanding ejecta. An abrupt transition from a t^- 1. 5 slope to a t^- 3 slope at day 200 is naturally explained by the change from <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>phase</b> to <b>the</b> post-wind phase on day 200.

These set up the steep abundance gradient in the inner disk (R < 14 kpc). At the close of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>phase,</b> chemical enrichment through accretion of metal-poor material from the halo onto the disk gradually reduced the metallicity of the inner region, whereas a slow increase in the metallicity proceeded beyond the solar circle.

Accordingly, we propose that enrichment by large-scale winds is a crucial factor for chemical evolution in the disk.

The flow in models without Supernova (SNIa) heating is considerably ordered, and essentially all the gas lost by the stars is cooled and accumulated in the galaxy center.

40|$|Although {{initially}} {{thought to}} be promising for production of the r-process nuclei, standard models of neutrino-heated winds from proto-neutron stars (PNSs) do not reach the requisite neutron-to-seed ratio for production of the lanthanides and actinides. However, the abundance distribution created by the r-, rp-, or ν p-processes in PNS winds depends sensitively on the entropy and dynamical expansion timescale of the flow, which may be strongly affected by high magnetic fields. Here, we present results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of non-rotating neutrino-heated PNS winds with strong dipole magnetic fields from 10 ^ 14 - 10 ^ 16 G, and assess their role in altering the conditions for nucleosynthesis. The strong field forms a closed zone and helmet streamer configuration at the equator, with episodic dynamical mass ejections in toroidal plasmoids. We find dramatically enhanced entropy in these regions and conditions favorable for third-peak r-process nucleosynthesis if <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> is neutron-rich.

40|$|The {{most popular}} model for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) {{involves}} the coalescence of binary neutron stars. Because the progenitor is actually hidden from view, {{we must consider}} under which circumstances such merging systems are capable of producing a successful sGRB. Soon after coalescence, winds are launched from the merger remnant. In this paper, we use realistic wind profiles derived from global merger simulations in order to investigate the interaction of sGRB jets with these winds using numerical simulations. We analyze the conditions for which these axisymmetric winds permit relativistic jets to breakout and produce a sGRB. We find that jets with luminosities comparable to those observed in sGRBs are only successful when their half-opening angles are below 20. This jet collimation mechanism leads to a simple physical interpretation of the luminosities and opening angles inferred for sGRBs. If wide, low luminosity jets are observed, they might be indicative of a different progenitor avenue such as the merger of a neutron star with a black hole. We also use the observed durations of sGRB to place constraints on the lifetime of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>phase,</b> which {{is determined by the}} time it takes the jet to breakout.

These simulations resolve a problem in some ‘subgrid’ models, where simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-induced starbursts, often making it impossible to form Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). Despite large mass-loading factors (≳ 10 – 20) in <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> simulated here, <b>the</b> peak SFRs are comparable to those in ‘no wind’ simulations. Wind acceleration does not act equally, so cold dense gas can still lose angular momentum and form stars, while these stars blow out gas that would not have participated in the starburst in the first place. Considerable wind material is not unbound, and falls back on the disc at later times post-merger, leading to higher post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. We consider different simulation numerical methods and their effects on <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>phase</b> structure; while most results are converged, we find that the existence of small clumps in the outflow at large distances from the galaxy is quite sensitive to the methodology...|$|R

The proposed equivalent circuit of the SRM <b>phase</b> consists of <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> resistance, <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> inductance and <b>the</b> iron-loss resistance. In this paper, the iron-loss resistance is represented as variable {{with respect to}} the phase current, the dc supply voltage and the rotor position.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new five-level {{inverter}} topology for open-end winding induction motor (IM) drive. The popular existing circuit configurations for five-level inverter include the NPC inverter and flying capacitor topologies. Compared to the NPC inverter, the proposed topology eliminates eighteen clamping diodes having different voltage ratings {{in the present}} circuit. Moreover it requires only one capacitor bank per phase, whereas flying capacitor schemes for five level topologies require six capacitor banks per phase. The proposed topology is realized by feeding <b>the</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding</b> of an open-end induction motor with two-level inverters in series with flying capacitors. The flying capacitor voltages are balanced using the switching state redundancy for full modulation range. The proposed inverter scheme is capable of producing two-level to five-level pulse width modulated voltage across <b>the</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding</b> depending on <b>the</b> modulation range. Additionally, in case of any switch failure in the flying capacitor connection, the proposed inverter topology can be operated as a three-level inverter for full modulation range. The proposed scheme is experimentally verified on a four pole, 5 hp induction motor drive...|$|R
40|$|Time-resolved HST UV eclipse {{spectrophotometry}} {{is presented}} for the magnetic CVs V 1309 Ori, MN Hya, V 2301 Oph, and V 1432 Aql. Separation {{of the light}} curves into wavebands allows the multiple emission components to be distinguished. Photospheric hot spots are detected in V 1309 Ori and V 2301 Oph. The emission- line spectra of V 1309 Ori and MN Hya are unusual, with the strength of N V 1240 and N IV 1718 suggesting an overabundance of nitrogen. Three epochs of observation of the asynchronous V 1432 Aql cover ~ 1 / 3 of a 50 -day lap cycle between the white dwarf spin and binary orbit. The light curves vary from epoch to epoch and {{as a function of}} waveband. The dereddened UV spectrum is extremely bright and the spectral energy distribution coupled with the duration of eclipse ingress indicate that the dominant source of energy is a hot (T~ 35, 000 K) white dwarf. Undiminished line emission through eclipse indicates that the eclipse is caused by the accretion stream, not the secondary star. The hot white dwarf, combined with its current asynchronous nature and rapid timescale for relocking, suggests that V 1432 Aql underwent a nova eruption in the past 75 - 150 yr. The reversed sense of asynchronism, with the primary star currently spinning up toward synchronism, is not necessarily at odds with this scenario, if the rotation of the magnetic white dwarf can couple to the ejecta during <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>phase</b> of <b>the</b> eruption.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a mechanistic, quasi-geostrophic, semi-spectral {{model with a}} self-consistent calculation of the mean zonal flow fields used to numerically simulate sudden stratospheric warmings generated by a single zonal harmonic (m) planetary wave. The development of a warming depends {{on the strength of}} <b>the</b> westerly <b>winds</b> in <b>the</b> lower stratosphere, and the growth rate of a m= 2 warming is accelerated during <b>the</b> westerly zonal <b>wind</b> <b>phase</b> of <b>the</b> quasi-biennial oscillation. An m= 1 warming is characterized by oscillation of wave amplitude and mean flow from resonantly trapped, westward, propagating planetary waves moving in and out of phase with the tropospherically forced stationary planetary wave. An m= 2 critical level develops in the equatorial region and advances poleward, and its warming is characterized by a sudden intensification after an initially slow growth in contrast to slowly developing m= 1 warmings...|$|R
