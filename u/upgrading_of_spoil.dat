50|$|Effective {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>spoil</b> {{is necessary}} because its volume is in general {{three times that}} which it was before excavation. Best practice involves removing the spoil away from the excavation site by mechanical earth moving equipment, or the creation of barrow run fed spoil heaps. In the barrow run method, a ramp is built using spoil transported in barrows along the barrow runs. The spoil heap is progressively enlarged by tipping off the vertical end face of the barrow-run. This method is efficient in storing the maximum amount <b>of</b> <b>spoil</b> in the minimum area, {{where there is no}} mechanised means <b>of</b> removing <b>spoil</b> a long distance from the site.|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{importance}} to mine planning, very few coal mine operators routinely and accurately measure the net bulking <b>of</b> <b>spoil</b> from their mines. With increasing environmental restrictions and space constraints being imposed on mine sites, {{a better understanding}} of the net bulking <b>of</b> <b>spoil</b> is important, as it affects volume storage requirements both in-pit and, more importantly, out-of-pit. Laboratory compression tests have been undertaken on scalped (to a given maximum size to allow testing) spoil specimens to estimate the self-weight and collapse settlement <b>of</b> coal mine <b>spoil.</b> Degradation testing was carried out by exposing scalped soil to the weather and monitoring its degradation and settlement. The results of these tests were used as input into a predictive tool for estimating the net bulking <b>of</b> coal mine <b>spoil.</b> This paper focuses on the laboratory testing program <b>of</b> two <b>spoil</b> types, representing the range from uncemented to cemented coal mine spoil, and presents an estimate of their net bulking based on the predictive tool...|$|R

However, it is argued that that is non existent because the allegation of corruption was originated from the misconception regarding of how Marwan transported the spoils tribute to the capital. Marwan did not directly send the tribute <b>of</b> <b>spoils</b> <b>of</b> war because it was not efficient as the <b>spoils</b> <b>of</b> war was in the form of cattle and hardware. As such, he sold the <b>spoils</b> <b>of</b> war first and then the treasury in the form of Dinars, which easier to be transported was sent directly to the caliph.|$|R

40|$|Slope {{failures}} <b>of</b> <b>spoil</b> piles pose {{a significant}} safety risk in open-cut strip mining due to slaking over time due to overburden pressure and water saturation. Most spoil pile failures {{occur when the}} pit has been previously filled with water and then subsequently dewatered. It {{is important to understand}} how the mechanical properties <b>of</b> base <b>spoil</b> material are affected by slaking when designing safe spoil pile slope angles, heights, and dewatering rates. A new laboratory slaking chamber (360 mm ID, 400 mm high with 20 mm wall thickness) has been designed and constructed to accommodate approximately 60 kg <b>of</b> <b>spoil</b> (unit weight, 18 kN/m 3) and a simulated overburden pressure of 1000 kPa. Consolidation <b>of</b> the <b>spoil</b> can be measured through a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) attached to the system. Using this apparatus, a fresh spoil material collected from a coal mine in Brown Basin Coalfield of Queensland, Australia was subjected to high overburden pressure (0 – 900 kPa) under saturated condition and maintained {{over a period of time}} (0 – 6 months) allowing the material to slake and successfully tested for classification, permeability, and strength properties. Results suggested that the slaking of saturated coal mine spoil increase with overburden pressure and the time duration over which the overburden pressure was maintained. Shear strength and permeability <b>of</b> <b>spoil</b> decreased with increase in spoil slaking...|$|R
