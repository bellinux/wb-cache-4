5|$|The 2013–14 UEFA Europa League {{campaign}} {{started in}} record-breaking fashion. In July 2013, the club won 2–0 {{away from home}} against ÍF Fuglafjørður of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round. This was the Blues' first win in Europe since 2005, and their first away win in Europe since 1966, when they defeated Vålerengen 4–1 during their run to the quarter-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup. In the second leg at Windsor Park, the Blues won 3–0 to go through to the next round 5–0 on aggregate. This was the club's largest aggregate victory in a European tie since defeating Aris Bonnevoie 9–4 on aggregate {{in the first round}} of the 1966–67 European Cup. It was also the first time that a Northern Irish club had won both legs of a European tie in any competition. They followed this <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round by winning away from home again. Despite being massive underdogs for the tie, a 1–0 victory away to Xanthi of Greece made it three consecutive victories in Europe, without conceding a goal in the process – another first for the club. However, in the second leg at home they went down 2–1 after extra time, which eliminated them on the away goals rule. The following season, Linfield's first venture into Europe under new manager Warren Feeney was in the Faroe Islands against B36 Tórshavn in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round, which was also Feeney's first competitive game in charge of the club. Linfield came out 2–1 victors with goals coming from Jamie Mulgrew and Michael Carvill. The return leg was played at Glenavon's ground, Mourneview Park, due to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. Linfield had to settle for a 1–1 draw, but that was enough to secure passage into the second qualifying round for the second successive season, where they were drawn to face AIK from Sweden. An 87th-minute Andrew Waterworth goal in the home leg at Mourneview Park ensured a 1–0 win for Linfield in their 100th competitive European match since 1959.|$|E

25|$|Sehwag, however, {{was caught}} by Lou Vincent for 75, and that started a flurry of wickets for New Zealand. Rahul Dravid, who had had a poor series with only 64 runs in four innings, {{continued}} on that vein of form as he was deceived by a quick arm ball from Daniel Vettori for a two-ball 0 – Vettori's second wicket of the innings. Astle, Mills and Vettori tied down the batsmen, as no boundaries were given <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> eight overs, and Yuvraj felt like he had to attack. He got away with a lofted shot through midwicket for four on the second ball of a Mills over, but shortly afterwards he had a feel at a short ball which landed in Shane Bond's hands – and Yuvraj was gone for a stifled 20. Kaif was still in, but {{he ran out of}} partners, as no one could help him keep the run rate up. Jacob Oram got three wickets to redeem his figures, ending with four for 58, although the latter three came in the last ten overs – one of them was Yadav, who gave a simple leading edge to the wicket-keeper McCullum, and the last was a straight drive from Pathan which fell short of the boundary and into Lou Vincent's hands. With Dhoni adjudged lbw to a ball that struck him in the stomach as well, India were all out for 276, Kaif left stranded on 93 not out after taking a single on the first ball of the over.|$|E
500|$|In 1580, the estate, {{including}} the ruins and the park, was leased from Elizabeth I by Sir Edward Carey, for the nominal rent of one red rose each year.

500|$|Against Harrison's wishes, Boyd had resumed her {{modelling}} {{career in}} May 1971, having long felt isolated by her husband's {{association with the}} Hare Krishna movement. His Concert for Bangladesh aid project had then united the couple, according to their friend Chris O'Dell, who recalls Harrison as [...] "attentive and affectionate" [...] towards Boyd while planning the concerts that summer. The project's subsequent business and legal issues became a source of frustration for Harrison, as {{he spent much of}} 1972 negotiating with government departments for the release of the funds raised for the refugees. In February 1972, Harrison and Boyd were injured in an automobile accident in England, after which, author Alan Clayson writes, [...] "her recovery was impaired by George's pounding on a drum-kit that he'd set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> room." ...|$|E

500|$|George {{is still}} singing {{as they enter}} Alton Benes's hotel. Elaine has not arrived yet, so they sit down with her father and nervously order drinks. They have an awkward {{conversation}} with him; Alton asks who is the [...] "funny guy" [...] (Jerry), to which George says it's Jerry. Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea who got his brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton {{he has to make}} a phone call. He meets Jerry in the bathroom and both mention how terrified they are because of Alton; they decide to go home if Elaine does not show <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ten minutes.

500|$|... (He {{has helped}} His servant Israel) is scored for an unusual {{combination}} of the three highest voices, violins and violas in unison and trumpet. The text continues [...] (in remembrance of His mercy). The [...] played by the trumpet is the melody of the traditional setting of Luther's German version of the Magnificat, a ninth psalm tone variant. The strings, as the only other instruments, play repeated notes in every measure, moving one step down or <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b> The voices imitate each other, also in gentle movement, the first a fifth up in a long upbeat, the second a fifth down one measure later, the third up again, another measure later, described as [...] "scale themes". In contrast, the second idea of the verse, , is on a [...] "disjunct theme". Bach repeats the figure, with a downward quart on each syllable, in the [...] of his Mass in B minor. It has been interpreted {{as a symbol of}} the cross, because a line drawn from the first to the fourth note crosses one from the second to the third. Jones assumes that the [...] "bassett" [...] of the unison strings symbolizes the divine quality of mercy.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, as {{relates to}} the {{placement}} of this sura within the Quran as a whole, Neal Robinson notes what {{he refers to as}} the [...] "dovetailing" [...] of suras. Based on this idea of structure, one sura ends with a topic that is immediately picked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> sura. The Family of 'Imran, sura 3, includes a discussion of male and female {{near the end of the}} sura (3.195). This theme continues at the beginning of sura 4: [...] "People, be mindful of your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and from it created its mate, and from the pair of them spread countless men and women far and wide; be mindful of God, in whose name you make requests of one another." [...] This dovetailing may indicate a complex editorial process involved in ordering the suras.|$|E

Bob Clearmountain was chosen as chief audio engineer to tie the four parts together, and to mix the resulting album. Stone arranged to have a tour bus parked between the two stages for as many as 12 audio engineers to sleep.

Straczynski stated that, {{even though he was}} confident that Deep Space Nine producer/creators Rick Berman and Michael Piller had not seen this material, he suspected that Paramount executives used his bible and scripts to steer development of Deep Space Nine. He and Warner did not file suit against Paramount, largely because Straczynski didn't see it as a productive option, with negative repercussions for both TV series. In 1993 he responded to a Deep Space Nine fan who saw the lack of legal action as proof that Straczynski's allegation was unfounded, [...] "If there is any (to use your term) winking and nudging going on, it's on the level of 'Okay, YOU (Paramount) know what happened, and *I* know what happened, but let's try to be grownup about it for now,' though I must say that the shapechanging thing nearly tipped me back over the edge again.
