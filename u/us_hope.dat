25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step toward}} achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail.

500|$|At {{the start}} of the season, the Australian Board of Control had issued a {{directive}} calling on the umpires to [...] "get tough" [...] in enforcing the laws of cricket, and asked the state associations to [...] "back the umpires to the fullest extent". In the lead-up to the Test, Meckiff was the centre of media attention, and one report described him as cricket's [...] "bogey man". The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff's selection, giving the impression that they considered him an illegitimate bowler. Reaction in England was also hostile, ahead of Australia's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964.

The NAACP issued the statement: [...] "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving <b>us</b> <b>hope</b> and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing." [...] This role generated controversy. Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part. Berry responded: [...] "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie.

As Serbian Education Minister Ljuba Jovanović wrote in Krv Sloventsva, in late May or early June, Prime Minister Pašić reviewed {{the plot of the}} impending assassination with members of his cabinet. On 18 June, a telegram, lacking in specifics, ordered Serbia's Ambassador to Vienna, Jovan Jovanović, to warn Austria-Hungary that Serbia had reason to believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Franz Ferdinand in Bosnia. On 21 June, Ambassador Jovanović met with Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister Bilinski. [...] According to Serbian Military Attaché to Vienna, Colonel Lesanin, Ambassador Jovanović, spoke to Bilinski and [...] "...stressed in general terms the risks the Archduke heir apparent might run from the inflamed public opinion in Bosnia and Serbia. [...] Some serious personal misadventure might befall him.

[...] Jovanović came back from the meeting with Bilinski and told Lesanin that [...] "...Bilinski showed no sign of attaching great importance to the total message and dismissed it limiting himself to remarking when saying goodbye and thanking him: [...] 'Let <b>us</b> <b>hope</b> nothing does happen.'"

Overview Given China’s rise and Asia’s economic ascent, military growth and increasing trade flows, the US ‘pivot to Asia’ reflects an appropriate policy response to changing global realities. The pivot (now called a ‘rebalance’) implies a shift in US attention and resources in the military, diplomatic and economic spheres from the Middle East and Europe towards Asia. This paper seeks {{to clear up}} the uncertainty surrounding <b>US</b> <b>hopes</b> and wishes of allies and to provide Australia with a fuller picture of the opportunities and challenges in our strategic alliance with the US. Of the several US allies in Asia, this paper focuses on three: Japan, Australia and South Korea.

Where Australia is concerned, it considers whether it is in our interests to further support the rebalance, and our ability to provide additional backing...|$|R
