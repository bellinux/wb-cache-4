Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay showed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> desks." [...] Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese. Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying [...] "the horror of biopics," [...] where there is simply an important event after important event.

6000|$|Peterkin {{shook his}} head, and said solemnly, [...] "Ralph, my boy, don't take to joking. It don't {{agree with your}} constitution. You'll get ill if you do; and we can't afford to have you laid <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> hands in these out-o'-the-way regions." ...|$|E

60|$|Weeks before, I had had my {{introduction}} to Old Whitehead, as Gillie called him, on the Madawaska.

60|$|This evening I {{started out}} for a last long {{lingering}} ramble in my beloved Stillwater woods.

I dressed myself comfortably for climbing fences and skimming over snowy wastes. That is, I put on the shortest old tweed skirt I have and a red jacket with sleeves three years behind the fashion, but jolly pockets to put your hands in, and a still redder tam. Thus accoutred, I sallied forth.|$|E
