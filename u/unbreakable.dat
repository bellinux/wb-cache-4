5|$|Waltman was {{not used}} again by TNA until their Final Resolution PPV event on January 15, 2006. There, Waltman {{defeated}} Raven in a Raven's Rules match, forcing Raven to leave TNA in the storyline. Waltman {{was not used}} by the company due to management being angered by his failure to participate at <b>Unbreakable.</b> Despite him not showing up to the event, Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time.|$|E
5|$|At <b>Unbreakable,</b> The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) {{defeated}} the teams of Alex Shelley and Johnny Candido, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), and Team Canada (A-1 and Eric Young) to remain champions in a Four Way Elimination Tag Team match. Johnny was {{a replacement for}} Waltman who missed the event due to undisclosed reasons.

A bit later, Douglas kicked Candido in the crotch and pinned him with a roll-up pin, thus eliminating Shelley and Candido from the contest.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} officially began in January 2013. Ubisoft Montreal, the {{developer}} of Patriots, handled the game's development, with Ubisoft's offices in Barcelona, Toronto, Kiev, Shanghai and Chengdu providing assistance. The game was originally called Rainbow Six <b>Unbreakable,</b> a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic but also the mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell. According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team was confident in their new vision for the game but very nervous when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.|$|E
5|$|Ending S: <b>Unbreakable</b> Bond: Events proceed roughly as in Ending A, {{except that}} Elena is purged of the curse. Aeron must then destroy a monstrous Zeron, saving Elena one last time.

In the epilogue, it is {{revealed}} that the kingdoms manage to end the War of Independence after {{the closing of the}} Scar, the Vestra are granted new lands to settle on by Elyria after Elyria's king receives a letter from Mavda detailing events at the Towers, and Aeron and Elena lived happily together.|$|E
5|$|On release, {{the four}} reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded Kirby's Block Ball for modifying the Breakout formula {{to create a}} new and enjoyable game. They {{especially}} praised the unique power-ups, though Crispin Boyer and Sushi X also felt the game was too short and easy. Nintendo Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its number of stages, but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used. The magazine found the parts where Kirby eats the <b>unbreakable</b> blocks to be innovative. All six of the magazine's reviewers recommended the game.|$|E
5|$|Several other bouts {{were planned}} for Genesis, of these the most {{significant}} were a No Disqualification match and a match to determine the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The No Disqualification match was between Abyss and Sabu. This was a rematch from TNA's <b>Unbreakable</b> PPV event on September11, which Abyss won. Abyss and Sabu also fought in Monster's Ball II at Bound for Glory, which Rhino won. TNA advertised Monty Brown versus Jeff Hardy to determine the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship heading into Genesis.

5|$|Simon Legree is a cruel slave owner—a Northerner by birth—whose {{name has}} {{become synonymous with}} greed. He is arguably the novel's main antagonist. His goal is to demoralize Tom and break him of his {{religious}} faith; he eventually orders Tom whipped to death out of frustration for his slave's <b>unbreakable</b> belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young man, he had abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Barbed Wire Massacre at Turning Point between Abyss and Sabu. This match {{was the result}} of a long-standing rivalry between the two that began at <b>Unbreakable.</b> There, Abyss {{defeated}} Sabu in a No Disqualification match. Abyss and Sabu competed in a Monster's Ball match at Bound for Glory alongside Jeff Hardy and Rhino, which Rhino won. At Genesis, Abyss defeated Sabu in another No Disqualification match. TNA advertised the Barbed Wire Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!. The reasoning behind the match stipulation had to do with Abyss fearing barbed wire in the storyline. Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode ofImpact!, by bashing Sabu over the head with a barbed wire wrapped steel chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and <b>unbreakable</b> glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} bout on {{the card}} was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the challenger Rhino. At Sacrifice, Raven teamed with Sabu to face the team of Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. On the pre-show of the gathering, Zbyszko announced if Jarrett pinned Raven during the contest then he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match. However, he added that if Raven pinned Jarrett during the contest then Jarrett would not have another title match for an entire year. Rhino ended up pinning Raven at the event, with TNA declaring him number-one contender on their website after the show. Tenay promoted Raven versus Rhino for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at <b>Unbreakable</b> on the August19 episode of Impact!.|$|E

Subsequently, he appeared in the films What Just Happened and Surrogates, based on the comic book of the same name.|$|E
5|$|An {{essential}} element for the band’s image is the Slipknot logo. The nonagram {{was created by}} the band’s members around the same time the band was founded. The nonagram is arguably the best-known sigil of Slipknot and it represents a 9 point star – a symbol of unity, loyalty, friendship and remembrance. The logo is composed of three equilateral triangles each rotated at 0, 40, and 80 degrees. Each star point was meant to stand for each of the nine members of the original band. Despite popular belief, the nonagram is not a Satanist symbol, nor does it reflect something perverted, evil, unclean or sadistic. On the contrary, just as the band has officially declared on various occasions, the nonagram marks the <b>unbreakable</b> bond between its members. Chris Fehn is one of the band’s members who has a nonagram tattoo.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro's 1904 {{record for}} games {{won in a}} season (41 wins) has stood for over a century—one of the oldest major records in baseball, {{or in any other}} sport. Under current playing practices, his record is <b>unbreakable.</b> Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 {{complete}} games, for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers in the modern era have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). Since the pitcher's mound was lowered to its current height of 10 inches in 1969, no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.|$|E
5|$|During Christopher Daniels' first {{reign in}} mid-2005, he defended the X Division Championship at several Pro Wrestling Guerrilla shows.

Styles and Samoa Joe.|$|E
