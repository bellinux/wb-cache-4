2500|$|With the {{exceptions}} of the [...] gold dollar coin, the gold three-dollar coin, the three-cent nickel, and the five-cent nickel, the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>denomination</b> of coinage prior to 1933 was conceptually {{linked to the}} precious or semi-precious metal that constituted {{a majority of the}} alloy used in that coin. In this regard the United States followed long-standing European practice of different base-unit denominations for different precious and semi-precious metals. In the United States, the cent was the base-unit of denomination in copper. The dime and dollar were the base-units of denomination in silver. The eagle was the base-unit of denomination in gold although, unlike [...] "cent", [...] "dime" [...] (or [...] "disme"), and [...] "dollar", gold coins never specified their denomination in units of [...] "eagles". Thus, a double eagle showed its value as [...] "twenty dollars" [...] rather than [...] "two eagles".|$|E
50|$|Section V was on duodecimals, {{working with}} {{fractions}} {{in which the}} only denominators were twelfths. These types of problems continue in textbooks and appear in the 1870 edition of White's Complete Arithmetic in the appendix. The definition states: A Duodecimal is a denominate number in which twelve <b>units</b> <b>of</b> any <b>denomination</b> make a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> the next higher denomination. Duodecimals are used by artificers in measuring surfaces and solids.|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} of a small open economy where domestic entrepreneurs face borrowing constraints and finance their investment projects both in domestic and international capital markets. We parametrize the degree of financial exposure as the fraction of borrowing expressed in foreign <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>denomination,</b> and study its interaction with alternative exchange rate regimes. We find that a regime of flexible exchange rates greatly amplifies, relative to fixed rates, the response to domestic shocks. However, when financial exposure is high investment can fall and financial conditions can worsen in response to favorable productivity shocks, due to detrimental balance-sheets effects. Asset price volatility and overall financial instability {{are found to be}} monotonically increasing in financial exposure. In response to a rise in world interest rates, higher financial exposure greatly worsens the performance of flexible exchange rates (relative to the case with no exposure), so that the acclaimed insulating role of the latter (relative to fixed) barely applies to output and vanishes for financial variables. In general, the higher the degree of financial exposure, the closer the resemblance between flexible and fixed exchange rates, a result that provides a theoretical background for a fear-of-floating argument...|$|R
50|$|An Episcopal Area in the United Methodist Church (UMC) {{is a basic}} <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> this <b>denomination.</b> It is {{a region}} presided over by a {{resident}} bishop {{that is similar to}} a diocese in other Christian denominations.

In some cases, such as the Western Jurisdiction of the U.S. as well as some places internationally, an episcopal area covers a very large territory (several U.S. states or countries, respectively).|$|R

Despite the considerable influence of H.

Similarly, immigration historians have described the contributions of this or that ethnic group to the composite American culture, and while they have long recognized the importance of the church for the newcomers, they have seldom identified the local congregation as the preeminent immigrant institution.
