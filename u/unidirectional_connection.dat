Each processor has a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connection</b> into a fast network. Messages may consist of different numbers of packets. Let h denote the maximum number of packets that a processor must send and receive. If all the packets need to be delivered directly, at least h communication steps are needed to solve the problem. We show that by allowing forwarding, only h +O(1) time steps are needed to exchange all the messages, and this is optimal. Our work was motivated by the importance of irregular message exchanges in distributed-memory parallel computers, {{but it can also be}} viewed as an answer to an open problem on scheduling file transfers posed by Coffmann, Garey, Johnsson, and LaPaugh in 1985...|$|E

30|$|Ratings/Interests is a {{category}} that possesses differing importance on OSNs {{but can be}} observed on all of them. On Facebook and Google+, {{it is possible to}} express one’s preference for all kinds of pages (e.g., persons, products, sports). On Twitter and LinkedIn, the pages mainly resemble verified accounts of well-known persons and organizations, respectively. Moreover, the focus lies more on staying informed about these pages rather than publicly demonstrating certain interests. Instagram is quite similar to Twitter with regards to following pages of well-known persons in order to stay up-to-date on them. However, there are currently no indicators that officially verify a celebrity page. Besides the pages mentioned above, the inspected OSNs all provide mechanisms to express one’s favor for the items that are available as disclosed data. When focusing on the user’s control over the visibility of his preferences, pages and disclosed data have to be discussed separately. For disclosed data, the visibility of one’s favor always depends on the visibility of the corresponding item, whereas for pages, the visibility options are different on the inspected platforms. As following pages on Twitter and Instagram is done by establishing a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connection</b> to them, the visibility properties are them same as for network data (see below), which means that the pages users follow are publicly visible. Users of Facebook and Google+ have the option to hide their preferences.|$|E

There is <b>unidirectional</b> retweet <b>connection</b> between two users when {{only one of them}} retweets the other, and there is a <b>unidirectional</b> mention <b>connection</b> with two users when only one of them mentions the other.

We identified that there is homophily among user classes with political engagement (Negative, Trump Supporter, and Hillary Supporter) in all types of connections analyzed, whether for <b>unidirectional</b> or reciprocal <b>connections.</b> Therefore, users with political engagement are more connected and interact more frequently with other users from the same class. The Positive class presented heterophily close to the baseline for all types of connections. This demonstrates that Positive users, despite presenting political speeches, are not so connected with one another and do not build communities. The Whatever users and Neutral users had heterophily in all <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> and homophily in the retweet reciprocal connections and mention reciprocal connections.

30|$|The second {{dimension}} {{builds on}} the recent use of heavy metal as a critical thinking model and educational tool (Angeler et al. 2016; Schmaltz 2016), emphasizing the artistic component of heavy metal (Kahn-Harris 2007) and its potential to increase people’s awareness of environmental sustainability challenges (Fig.  1). Information potential in this link is unidirectional; that is, heavy metal music informs only sustainability science. This <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connection</b> is made via allegories. These relate the music with specific environmental change challenges and ensuing human tensions with the aim to elicit thought and educate people about, and increase their awareness of environmental change. The thin arrow that symbolizes the unidirectional link (Fig.  1) means that the connection between heavy metal music and sustainability is entirely subjective. The unidirectional link also suggests that environmental sustainability issues currently do not influence metal music in ways to result in integral song architectures (lyrics, singing, rhythms, instrumentation) from which a “sustainability metal subgenre” might emanate. Figure  1 also shows a third dimension, in which complex adaptive systems theory and environmental sustainability are linked to describe the dynamics of complex systems of people and nature (social-ecological systems). The complexity of social-ecological systems dynamics has been reviewed recently (e.g., Allen et al. 2014) and will therefore not be explored here. However, this third dimension will {{be considered in the}} broader discussion of the synthesis between heavy metal, complex adaptive systems theory and environmental sustainability.|$|E
40|$|Cultured neurons on multi {{electrode}} arrays (MEAs) {{have been}} widely used to study various as-pects of neuronal (network) functioning. A possible drawback of this approach is the lack of structure in these networks. At the single cell level, several solutions have been proposed to ena-ble directed connectivity, and promising results were obtained. At the level of connected sub-populations, a few attempts have been made with promising results. First assessment of the de-signs’ functionality, however, suggested room for further improvement. We designed a two chamber MEA aiming to create a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connection</b> between the net-works in both chambers (‘emitting’ and ‘receiving’). To achieve this unidirectionality, all inter-connecting channels contained barbs that hindered axon growth in the opposite direction (from receiving to emitting chamber). Visual inspection showed that axons predominantly grew through the channels in the promoted direction. This observation was confirmed by spontaneous activity recordings. Cross-correlation between the signals from two electrodes inside the channels suggested signal propagation at ≈ 2 m/s from emitting to receiving chamber. Cross-correlation between the firing patterns in both chambers indicated that most correlated activity was initiated in the emitting chamber, which was also reflected by a significantly lower fraction of partial bursts (e. a one-chamber-only burst) in the emitting chamber. Finally, electrical stimulation in the emitting chamber induced a fast response in that chamber, and a slower response in the receiving chamber. Stimulation in the receiving chamber evoked a fast response in that chamber, but no response in the emitting chamber. These results confirm the predominantly unidirectional nature of the connecting channels from emitting to receiving chamber...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of offsetting cavopulmonary connections at varying pulmonary flow ratios to determine the optimal geometry of the connection. Background. Previous investigators have demonstrated energy conservation within the streamlined contours of the total cavopulmonary connection {{compared with that of}} the atriopulmonary connection. However, their surgical design of connecting the two cavae directly opposite each other may result in high energy losses. Others have introduced a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connection</b> with some advantages but with concerns about the formation of arteriovenous malformation in the lung excluded from hepatic venous return. Thus, an optimal surgical design has not been determined. Methods. In the present models, the caval connections were offset through a range of 0. 0 to 2. 0 diameters by 0. 5 superior cava diameter increments. Flow ratios were fixed for superior and inferior cavae and varied for right and left pulmonary arteries as 70 : 30, 60 : 40, 50 : 50, 40 : 60 and 30 : 70 to stimulate varying lung resistance. Pressure measurements and flow visualization were done at steady flows of 2, 4 and 6 liters/min to simulate rest and exercise. Results. Our data show that the energy losses at the 0. 0 diameter offset were double the losses of the 1. 0 and 1. 5 diameters, which had minimal energy losses. This result was attributable to chaotic patterns seen on flow visualization in the 0. 0 -diameter offset. Energy savings were more evident at the 50 : 50 right/left pulmonary artery ratio. Energy losses increased with increased total flow rates. Conclusions. The results strongly suggest the incorporation of caval offsets in future total cavopulmonary connections...|$|E

First published September 26, 2012; doi: 10. 1152 /jn. 00332. 2012. -Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) {{has emerged as}} an important method for assessing neural networks, enabling extensive connectivity analyses between multiple brain regions. Among the analysis techniques proposed, partial directed coherence (PDC) provides a promising tool to unveil causal connectivity networks in the frequency domain. Using the MRI time series obtained from the rat sensorimotor system, we applied PDC analysis to determine the frequency-dependent causality networks. In particular, we compared in vivo and postmortem conditions to establish the statistical significance of directional PDC values. Our results demonstrate that two distinctive frequency populations drive the causality networks in rat; significant, high-frequency causal connections clustered {{in the range of}} 0. 2 - 0. 4 Hz, and the frequently documented low-frequency connections < 0. 15 Hz. Frequency-dependence and directionality of the causal connection are characteristic between sensorimotor regions, implying the functional role of frequency bands to transport specific resting-state signals. In particular, whereas both intra-and interhemispheric causal connections between heterologous sensorimotor regions are robust over all frequency levels, the bilaterally homologous regions are interhemispherically linked mostly via low-frequency components. We also discovered a significant, frequency-independent, <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connection</b> from motor cortex to thalamus, indicating dominant cortical inputs to the thalamus in the absence of external stimuli. Additionally, to address factors underlying the measurement error, we performed signal simulations and revealed that the interactive MRI system noise alone is a likely source of the inaccurate PDC values. This work demonstrates technical basis for the PDC analysis of resting-state fMRI time series and the presence of frequency-dependent causality networks in the sensorimotor system. open...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundVulnerability to relapse {{persists}} after remission of {{an acute}} episode of major depressive disorder. This has {{been attributed to}} abnormal biases in the processing of emotional stimuli in limbic circuits. However, neuroimaging studies have not so far revealed consistent evidence of abnormal responses to emotional stimuli in limbic structures, such as the amygdala, in remitted depression. This suggests the problem might lie in the integrated functioning of emotion processing circuits. MethodsWe recruited 22 unmedicated patients in remission from major depressive disorder (rMDD) and 21 age-matched healthy control subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during a face emotion processing task. Dynamic causal modeling was used with Bayesian model selection to determine the most likely brain networks and valence-specific modulation of connectivity in healthy control subjects and rMDD. ResultsIn healthy volunteers, sad faces modulated bi-directional connections between amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex and between fusiform gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex. Happy faces modulated <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> from fusiform gyrus to orbitofrontal cortex. In rMDD, the opposite pattern was observed, with evidence of happy faces modulating bidirectional frontotemporal connections and sad faces modulating <b>unidirectional</b> fusiform–orbitofrontal <b>connections.</b> ConclusionsParticipants with rMDD have abnormal modulation of frontotemporal effective connectivity in response to happy and sad face emotions, despite normal activations within each region. Specifically, processing of mood incongruent happy information was associated with a more richly modulated frontotemporal brain network, whereas mood congruent sad information was associated with less network modulation. This supports a hypothesis of dysfunction within cortico–limbic connections in individuals vulnerable to depression...|$|R

The temporal order of spikes {{turned out to be}} crucial. We here take into account how propagation delays, composed of dendritic and axonal delay times, may affect the temporal order of spikes. In a minimal setting, characterized by neglecting dendritic and axonal propagation delays, STDP eliminates bidirectional connections between two coupled neurons and turns them into <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections.</b> In this paper, however, we show that depending on the dendritic and axonal propagation delays, the temporal order of spikes at the synapses can be different from those in the cell bodies and, consequently, qualitatively different connectivity patterns emerge. In particular, we show that for a system of two coupled oscillatory neurons, bidirectional synapses can be preserved and potentiated. Intriguingly, this finding also translates to large networks of type-II phase oscillators and, hence, crucially impacts on the overall hierarchical connectivity patterns of oscillatory neuronal networks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{serves as}} a {{tutorial}} lecture {{on the use of}} network coding to provide resource efficient, and agile proactive protection. Network coding, which was introduced in [1], allows intermediate network nodes to form linear combinations of packets received on different input links. The use of network coding results in capacity enhancement. This capacity enhancement is used to provide protection channels which are used to carry combinations of redundant data, and are solved by the receivers in order to recover data lost due to network failures. The paper starts by addressing network coding-based protection of bidirectional unicast connections, and explains the use p-Cycles to carry linear combinations of the redundant data units. The paper also discusses an earlier protection strategy which is based on diversity coding, in which the linear combinations are formed at special nodes, including sources, and is used to protect <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections.</b> A generalized network coding-based protection which uses a tree to carry the linear combinations will be presented. Protection of multicast connections using network coding is also explained...|$|R

The power arises primarily from the phase adjustment circuitry used to align data with the clock. This circuitry is usually placed at the receiver, but in our asymmetric link design we take a different approach. We first assume that a link consists of two <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> [...] - one for each direction of the link.

40|$|In {{dynamical}} {{models of}} cortical networks, the recurrent con-nectivity can amplify the input {{given to the}} network in two distinct ways. One is induced {{by the presence of}} near-critical eigenvalues in the connectivity matrix W, producing large but slow activity fluctuations along the corresponding eigen-vectors (dynamical slowing). The other relies on W being nonnormal, which allows the network activity to make large but fast excursions along specific directions. Here we inves-tigate the tradeoff between nonnormal amplification and dy-namical slowing in the spontaneous activity of large random neuronal networks composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We use a Schur decomposition of W to separate the two amplification mechanisms. Assuming linear stochas-tic dynamics, we derive an exact expression for the expected amount of purely nonnormal amplification. We find that amplification is very limited if dynamical slowing must be kept weak. We conclude that, to achieve strong transient amplification with little slowing, the connectivity must be structured. We show that <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> be-tween neurons of the same type together with reciprocal connections between neurons of different types, allow for am-plification already in the fast dynamical regime. Finally, our results also shed light on the differences between balanced networks in which inhibition exactly cancels excitation, and those where inhibition dominates. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper introducess an {{implementation}} of the network coding-based generalized 1 +N protection technique presented earlier by the author in [1] to protect against single link failures. Instead of using two protection circuits {{for a group of}} connections which are to be protected together as in [1], only one protection circuit is used, which {{takes the form of a}} tree. The protection circuit carries linear combinations of the data units originally transmitted on the working circuits, and these linear combinations can be used to recover lost data due to link failures. This recovery is carried out with the assistance of one node on the protection tree, which is chosen to reduce the recovery time. Moreover, unlike the scheme in [1] which protects <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections,</b> this scheme is used to protect bidirectional connections. This protection technique requires exactly the same amount of protection resources used by 1 :N protection, and can therefore be considered as a step towards achieving optimal 1 +N protection. The paper also makes a number of other contributions. It introduces an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation to evaluate the cost of protection using this technique, and compares it to the cost of 1 + 1 protection. The comparison shows that a significant saving in cost can be achieved, while still recovering from failures within a short time.

40|$|The human {{cognitive}} map {{is known to}} be hierarchically organized consisting of a set of perceptually clustered landmarks. Patient studies have demonstrated that these {{cognitive map}}s are maintained by the hippocampus, while the neural dynamics are still poorly understood. The authors have shown that the neural dynamic “theta phase precession” observed in the rodent hippocampus may be capable of forming hierarchical cognitive maps in humans. In the model, a visual input sequence consisting of object and scene features in the central and peripheral visual fields, respectively, results in the formation of a hierarchical cognitive map for object–place associations. Surprisingly, it is possible for such a complex memory structure to be formed in a few seconds. In this paper, we evaluate the memory retrieval of object–place associations in the hierarchical network formed by theta phase precession. The results show that multiple object–place associations can be retrieved with the initial cue of a scene input. Importantly, according to the wide-to-narrow <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> among scene units, the spatial area for object–place retrieval can be controlled by the spatial area of the initial cue input.

Methods were developed to record the discharge of neurons in singing birds to examine the functions of nuclei in the song control pathway previously implicated anatomically. In several cases, lesions and other techniques were employed to test predictions derived from electrode recordings. Four major findings emerge from these studies. (1) Single-unit recordings from telencephalic nucleus hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudale (HVc) show several classes of neurons with apparently specialized roles in song production and/or sensorimotor interaction. (2) The nucleus interfacialis (Nlf; Nottebohm, 1980), which provides an input to HVc and is anatomically the “highest ” nucleus in the descending motor pathway, is uniquely placed among vocal control nuclei to be a generator of timing cues for song. (3) Consistent with the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> between nuclei of the descending pathway, Nlf, HVc, and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA) are activated sequentially prior to sound onset. Three other nuclei with connections to or from the descending tract do not show song-related activity in the adult.

40|$|The {{increase}} of induced gamma-band responses (iGBRs; oscillations > 30 Hz) elicited by familiar (meaningful) objects {{is well established}} in electroencephalogram (EEG) research. This frequency-specific change at distinct locations is thought to indicate the dynamic formation of local neuronal assemblies during the activation of cortical object representations. As analytically power increase is just a property of a single location, phase-synchrony was introduced to investigate the formation of large-scale networks between spatially distant brain sites. However, classical phase-synchrony reveals symmetric, pair-wise correlations and is not suited to uncover the directionality of interactions. Here, we investigated the neural mechanism of visual object processing by means of directional coupling analysis going beyond recording sites, but rather assessing the directionality of oscillatory interactions between brain areas directly. This study {{is the first to}} identify the directionality of oscillatory brain interactions in source space during human object recognition and suggests that familiar, but not unfamiliar, objects engage widespread reciprocal information flow. Directionality of cortical information-flow was calculated based upon an established Granger-Causality coupling-measure (partial-directed coherence; PDC) using autoregressive modeling. To enable comparison with previous coupling studies lacking directional information, phase-locking analysis was applied, using wavelet-based signal decompositions. Both, autoregressive modeling and wavelet analysis, revealed an augmentation of iGBRs during the presentation of familiar objects relative to unfamiliar controls, which was localized to inferior-temporal, superior-parietal and frontal brain areas by means of distributed source reconstruction. The multivariate analysis of PDC evaluated each possible direction of brain interaction and revealed widespread reciprocal information-transfer during familiar object processing. In contrast, unfamiliar objects entailed a sparse number of only <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> converging to parietal areas. Considering the directionality of brain interactions, the current results might indicate that successful activation of object representations is realized through reciprocal (feed-forward and feed-backward) information-transfer of oscillatory connections between distant, functionally specific brain areas...|$|R

40|$|Inspired by {{biological}} {{neural networks}}, Artificial neural networks are massively parallel computing systems {{consisting of a}} large number of simple processors with many interconnections. They have input connections which are summed together to determine the strength of their output, which is the result of the sum being fed into an activation function. Based on architecture ANNs can be feed forward network or feedback networks. Most common family of feed-forward networks, called multilayer perceptron, neurons are organized into layers that have <b>unidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> between them. These connections are directed (from the input to the output layer) and have weights assigned to them. The principle of ANN is applied for approximating a function where they learn a function by looking at examples of this function. Here the internal weights in the ANN are slowly adjusted so as to produce the same output as in the examples. Performance is improved over time by iteratively updating the weights in the network. The hope is that when the ANN is shown a new set of input variables, it will give a correct output. To train a neural network to perform some task, we must adjust the weights of each unit in such a way that the error between the desired output and the actual output is reduced. This process requires that the neural network compute the error derivative of the weights (EW). In other words, it must calculate how the error changes as each weight is increased or decreased slightly. The back-propagation algorithm is the most widely used method for determining EW. We have started our program for a fixed structure network. It’s a 4 layer network with 1 input, 2 hidden and 1 output layers. No of nodes in input layer is 9 and output layer is 1. Hidden layer nodes are fixed at 4 and 3. The learning rate is taken as 0. 07. We have written the program in MAT LAB and got the output of the network. The graph is plotted taking no of iteration and mean square error as parameter. The converging rate of error is very good. Then we moved to a network with all its parameter varying. We have written the program in VISUAL C++ with no. of hidden layer, no of nodes in each hidden layer, learning rate all varying. The converging plots for different structure by varying the variables are taken...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the massive}} number of {{interconnects}} in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), distributing spikes effciently becomes {{a critical issue}} for the efficient hardware emulation of large-scale SNNs. In this work, the AER-SRT (Address Event Representation over Synchronous Serial Ring Topology) architecture for spike transmission is proposed. AER-SRT is a light, easily scalable, packet-based solution implemented with high-speed serial link for multi-chip SNN communication. The channel uses a <b>unidirectional,</b> point-to-point <b>connection</b> between nodes, which provides a high transmission speed. Events (spikes) are distributed among all the nodes in a ring-topology pipeline fashion and the synchronous AER guarantees a collision-free scheme. The fast speed and efficient channel usage limits the spike distribution time to values that allow real-time operation for network sizes that can be calculated with simple design equations. Also, in the proposed communication protocol there is no specific or master node, so new nodes {{can be added to}} the ring by simply modifying two configuration parameters. As a proof of concept, a prototype of the architecture has been implemented and tested on FPGA development boards. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|R
