40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate which variables determine older adults’ intentions to <b>use</b> <b>new</b> media (internet and digital TV). Individual differences (risk aversion, innovativeness) and social influences (internalization, identification and compliance) were included in TAM (Davis, 1986) as key determinants that influence <b>use</b> of <b>new</b> media. Our study confirms the importance of perceived ease of use, and demonstrates that (1) other beliefs (i. e. internalization, identification, compliance) and (2) individual characteristics (innovativeness, risk aversion) can significantly influence older adults’ intentions to <b>use</b> <b>new</b> media. Perception of usefulness did not influence older adults’ intention to <b>use</b> <b>new</b> media...|$|R

5|$|Many {{farmers in}} central Washington build dams on their {{property}} for irrigation and to control frost on their crops. The Washington Department of Ecology, <b>using</b> <b>new</b> techniques involving aerial photographs, estimated there may {{be as many as}} a hundred such dams in the area, most of which are illegal. Six such dams have failed in recent years, causing {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} of damage to crops and public roads. Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally.|$|E
5|$|Waveguide filters were {{developed}} during World War II {{to meet the}} needs of radar and electronic countermeasures, but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in microwave links. Much of post-war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by <b>using</b> <b>new</b> analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators.|$|E
5|$|A {{new stage}} {{adaptation}} of the show debuted in 2003. Based on Clarke's novel The Moonbather, the play was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 to 11 October 2003. <b>Using</b> <b>new</b> actors to perform the roles of Compo, Clegg, and Foggy, the play featured the trio as they attempted {{to get to the}} bottom of the disturbance created by a near-naked man in the town. The play was later performed in Eastbourne by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009.|$|E

5|$|Also on 13 September 1926, {{a further}} {{connection}} between the CCE and the C was opened when tunnels were brought into service from the CCE's Charing Cross station (now Embankment) to Kennington station, the latter having been rebuilt with four platforms. An intermediate station was constructed at Waterloo. Thus fully integrated, combined services operated over the C and CCE routes <b>using</b> <b>new</b> Standard Stock trains. On tube maps, the combined lines were then shown in a single colour, although the separate names continued in use into the 1930s. Before the introduction of 'Northern line' on 28 August 1937, the names 'Edgware, Highgate and Morden line' and 'Morden-Edgware line' {{were used in the}} mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|Because {{microcomputers}} in Japan {{were not}} powerful enough {{at the time}} to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board <b>using</b> <b>new</b> microprocessors from the United States. The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit, features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware {{the most difficult part of}} the whole process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen. Rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game (also {{known as}} the Final Fantasy SGI demo, or Final Fantasy x, {{not related to the}} actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a short game demo {{produced}} by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced <b>using</b> <b>new</b> Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.|$|E

5|$|Following the Japanese Grand Prix on 8 October, {{three teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions around European race tracks between 10–13 October {{to prepare for}} the upcoming Grand Prix. Ferrari opted to spend the four days with test driver Luca Badoer where he tested new mechanical components on the F1-2000 car at the Fiorano Circuit on a wet/dry track. He later moved to the Mugello Circuit where he tried out brake testing, car set-ups, tyre evaluation, endurance runs for the car's engines and continued trying out new car components. Benetton cancelled a test in Barcelona during the period and decided to run at the Silverstone Circuit one week later <b>using</b> <b>new</b> Supertec engines angled at 110° degrees.|$|E
5|$|Ifs {{new owner}} was Robert Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change of {{ownership}} was abrupt {{and led to a}} delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction; Galaxy had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and If and Galaxy appeared in alternate months for the next few years. In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with If was to experiment, <b>using</b> <b>new</b> writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley, the effect was that If became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} June 14, 2010, in Hawaii. Filming {{was moved to}} California in August 2010, primarily at the Long Beach shore and a recreation of Whitecap Bay done in the Universal Studios backlot, as the original Hawaiian location on Halona Cove was plagued with strong tides. After a brief shoot in Puerto Rico, with locations in both Palomino Island and the Fort of San Cristóbal in San Juan, production moved to the United Kingdom in September, where principal photography wrapped on November 18 after 106 days of shooting. Locations included Hampton Court Palace in London, Knole House in Kent, and Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich. Interiors were shot at London's Pinewood Studios, and a replica of an 18th-century London street {{was built on the}} backlot alongside the soundstages. The producers also considered <b>using</b> <b>New</b> Orleans as a location. In October, security was breached at the UK site when a celebrity impersonator gained access to filming at the Old Royal Naval College by dressing up as Captain Jack.|$|E

The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater Mekong region and have established a rapid alert system to enable information about counterfeit drugs to be rapidly reported to the relevant authorities in participating countries. There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory.

5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} opened in 1867 {{as part of}} the Great Northern Railway's line between Finsbury Park and Edgware stations. As part of their only partially completed Northern Heights plan, the London Underground started serving the station in 1941, <b>using</b> <b>new</b> platforms in tunnels beneath the surface station. The platforms of the surface station remain, but were last used in 1954, and the section of the line through them to Finsbury Park was lifted by 1972. One of the original 1867 station buildings still exists, and is in use as a private house.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{president}} Ronald Reagan's and Navy Secretary John Lehman's {{effort to create}} a 600-ship Navy, New Jersey was selected for reactivation in the spring of 1981, and she was towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the end of July 1981 for modernization/reactivation. At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned <b>using</b> <b>New</b> Jersey and her sister ship Iowa to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as point defense system mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5inch gun mounts on New Jersey {{to make room for the}} armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Shikata {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} Link being able to enter and merge onto walls; this feature would eventually {{become one of the}} title's unique gameplay aspects. Within a day, Mouri had created an initial prototype to demonstrate the feature, and seeing it in action led to an influx of ideas. Link was able to transform from a 3D character to a 2D character by entering walls, and then move smoothly around corners to reach places he previously could not. This ability opened up possibilities for creating new puzzles and <b>using</b> <b>new</b> mechanics. At this stage in the project, they were still considering the new game to be an extension of Zelda games on the Nintendo DS, so the prototype itself used the same viewpoint and design of Link from Spirit Tracks. Around October 2010, the prototype was presented to Miyamoto, who approved of the new concept and was happy for development to begin. However, within two weeks of entering production, core members of the development team were reassigned to work on launch games for Nintendo's Wii U console which was scheduled for release in 2012. With the team disbanded, development of the game ceased.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} assets, the team reused very little from the {{previous}} two games, choosing to build {{a large proportion of}} the game from the ground up, especially when it came to the overworld design and NPC behaviors. The Crystal Tools engine, used in the last two XIII games, required a major overhaul as it was not designed for open-world games. In contrast to the previous games, a lot of the game's cutscenes were created while the game was still in development, meaning many placeholder objects and models had to be used until the final assets could be put in place. The team also had to thoroughly check Lightning's various outfits and weapons, to ensure that there were no mistakes in cutscenes with the weapons going through the scenery, and that the character's underwear remained concealed during active battles even for her more revealing outfits. Because the team was mostly <b>using</b> <b>new</b> assets to create the game, the various continents took longer to create than the environments in XIII-2, and story scenes sometimes needed to be redone as the game's overall plot had yet to be finalized when development began. The voice actors, in contrast to the normal procedure doing their performances first and those being used to create the game characters' facial expressions, recorded their lines for the characters well after the various cutscenes had been created.|$|E
