50|$|Because many {{children}} {{would keep the}} <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> they won in games from other players, many school districts considered <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> a form of gambling. <b>Milk</b> <b>caps</b> proved to be major distractions from classes {{and the source of}} various playground arguments. These elements eventually led to the banning of <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> from various schools across North America. Other bannings occurred across Australia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>caps</b> {{generally}} involves {{two types}} of playing discs: <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> and slammers. <b>Milk</b> <b>caps</b> are typically flat circular cardboard discs which are decorated with images on one or both sides. Traditional (or traditional-style) <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> are made of rougher cardboard, are printed with limited colors, and often have a staple in them (as they appeared when used as actual POG bottlecaps), while modern commercial pogs were stiffer, thicker and are often printed with colorful glossy imagery.|$|R
5000|$|The game of <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> {{possibly}} {{originated in}} Maui, Hawaii during the 1920s or 1930s, or possibly with origins in Menko, a Japanese card game {{very similar to}} <b>milk</b> <b>caps,</b> {{which has been in}} existence since the 17th century.

50|$|The Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the United States Department of Defense's {{largest and}} oldest {{exchange}} system, distributes milk-cap-like coinage as change at its stores in contingency areas (those supporting Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom). The reason for adopting <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> as currency was that supply flights overseas had limited capacity and air-freight shipping involved high costs. Metal coinage weighs {{significantly more than}} paper <b>milk</b> <b>caps,</b> which are also much thinner than standard <b>milk</b> <b>caps.</b> While they are only issued in contingency areas, they are redeemable at any AAFES store worldwide.|$|R

5000|$|The 1990s revival is {{credited}} to Blossom Galbiso, {{a teacher and}} guidance counselor who taught at Waialua Elementary School in Oahu. In 1991, Galbiso introduced the game she had played {{as a little girl}} to a new generation of students, soon incorporating <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> into her fifth grade curriculum as a way of teaching math and as a nonviolent alternative to other popular schoolyard games, such as dodgeball. The game quickly spread from Oahu's North Shore, and by early 1992, STANPAC Inc., the small Canadian packaging company that had been manufacturing the <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> distributed by Haleakala Dairy on Maui (the same caps that were collected by Galbiso for her class), was printing millions of <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> every week for shipment to the Hawaiian island chain. The game soon spread to the mainland, first surfacing in California, Texas, Oregon, and Washington before spreading {{to the rest of the}} country. By 1993, the previously obscure game of <b>milk</b> <b>caps,</b> which had almost been forgotten, was now played throughout the world.|$|R
500|$|Lactarius subdulcis {{was first}} {{described}} as Agaricus subdulcis by mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801, before English mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray {{placed it in}} its current genus Lactarius in 1821 in his The Natural Arrangement of British Plants. The specific epithet is derived from Latin words sub [...] "under", and dulcis [...] "sweet", after the milk's delayed sweet taste. As well as mild <b>milk</b> <b>cap,</b> beech <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> is an alternate common name.|$|R
5000|$|The other {{equipment}} {{that is used}} is a slammer: a heavier game piece often made of metal, rubber, or more commonly plastic, which come in various thicknesses and weights. [...] They are typically similar in diameter to <b>milk</b> <b>caps.</b> Metal slammers are not allowed in some games because they are usually heavier than other materials, giving the player with the first turn an unfair advantage, and {{have a tendency to}} damage the <b>milk</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R

5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other <b>milk</b> <b>caps.</b> Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|R

500|$|The {{specific}} epithet [...] "volemus" [...] {{is derived}} from the Latin vola, meaning [...] "the hollow of the hand", suggestive of Fries's reference to the large amount of latex [...] "flowing enough to fill the hand". Common names for L.volemus include the weeping <b>milk</b> <b>cap,</b> the tawny milkcap, the orange-brown milky, the voluminous-latex milky, the lactarius orange, the fishy milkcap, and the apricot <b>milk</b> <b>cap.</b> In the West Virginian mountains of the United States, the mushroom is called a [...] "leatherback" [...] or a [...] "bradley". The latter name may originate from its German name Brätling.|$|R
5|$|It is {{commonly}} known as the peppery <b>milk</b> <b>cap,</b> pepper milkcap, peppery Lactarius, peppery milk mushroom, white peppery milk-cap, or other similar names. Similarly, in German it is known as the Pfeffermilchling ("pepper milk cap").|$|R
50|$|Lactifluus vellereus {{is one of}} {{a handful}} of north {{temperate}} <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> that belong to the genus Lactifluus which has been separated from Lactarius on phylogenetic grounds. Its closest species is L. bertillonii, with which it forms a rather isolated clade in the genus.|$|R
500|$|Despite the unappealing fishy scent that {{develops}} after the mushroom is picked, Lactifluusvolemus is edible and recommended for culinary usage, though, typical of <b>milk</b> <b>caps,</b> {{it has a}} slightly granular texture that some may find unappetizing. The odor disappears during cooking. The latex only has a mild taste. The species is considered good for novice mushroom hunters to eat, and is best prepared by slow cooking {{to prevent it from}} becoming too hard; specimens that have been rehydrated after having been dried will require longer cooking times to eliminate the grainy texture. The mushroom has also been suggested for use in casseroles and thick sauces. Pan frying is not a recommended cooking technique, due to the large amounts of latex it exudes. L.volemus is one of several species of <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> that are sold in rural markets in Yunnan Province, China, and it is among the most popular wild edible mushroom species collected for consumption and sale in Nepal. In their 2009 book on <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> of North America, Bessette and colleagues consider the mushroom [...] "the best-known and most popular edible milk mushroom" [...] in the eastern United States. A Turkish study of the nutritional composition of the fruit bodies concluded that L.volemus is a good source of protein and carbohydrates.|$|R
50|$|Seven other {{companies}} entered the <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> field after {{a comic book}} and card industry convention in January 1993.

50|$|Slammer Whammers were a {{brand of}} pogs (a.k.a. Milkcaps) made by the Los Angeles-based company Imperial Toy Corporation, in the 1990s.

25|$|In {{some older}} guides, the saffron <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> is {{considered}} an excellent mushroom, having 'a crisp texture'. In fact, when naming the mushroom, the mycologist had mistaken the mushroom with Lactarius sanguifluus, which is an excellent, pleasantly crunchy mushroom. Today, most mycologists hold Lactarius sanguifluus in higher esteem than its pretender, Lactarius deliciosus.|$|R
5000|$|Lactarius rufus is a common, {{medium-sized}} {{member of}} the Lactarius genus, whose many members {{are commonly known as}} milkcaps. Known by the common name of the rufous milkcap, or the red hot <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> in North America. It is dark brick red in color, edible, and grows with pine or birch trees.|$|R
5|$|Lactarius deterrimus {{belongs to}} the section Deliciosi of the genus Lactarius. According to {{molecular}} phylogenetics studies, this section forms a definite phylogenetic group within the <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> relatives. Deliciosi species mainly have an orange or reddish-coloured latex and taste mild to slightly bitter. They are strict mycorrhizal associates of conifers. The next closest relative of L.deterrimus is L.fennoscandicus.|$|R
