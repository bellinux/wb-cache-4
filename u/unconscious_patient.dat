40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study how}} the {{cervical}} spine is assessed before discontinuation of cervical spine immobilisation in <b>unconscious</b> trauma <b>patients</b> {{in intensive care}} units. DESIGN: Telephone interview of consultants responsible for adult intensive care units. SETTING: All 25 intensive care units in the South and West region that admit victims of major trauma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical and radiological basis on which the decision is made to stop cervical spine immobilisation in <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> with trauma. RESULTS: In 19 units cervical spine immobilisation was stopped in <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> {{on the basis of}} radiology alone, and six units combined radiology with clinical examination after the patient had regained consciousness. Sixteen units relied on a normal lateral radiological view of the cervical spine alone, five required a normal lateral and anteroposterior view, and four required a normal lateral, anteroposterior, and open mouth peg view. CONCLUSIONS: There are inconsistencies in the clinical and radiological approach to assessing the cervical spine in <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> with trauma before the removal of immobilisation precautions. There is an overreliance on the lateral cervical spine view alone, which {{has been shown to be}} insensitive in this setting...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Treatment of {{diseases}} {{may be one}} of the numerous aspects of the divine verses of Quran. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of playing holy Quran recitation as a tranquilizer on vital signs and arterial oxygen pressure of <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> hospitalized in ICU. Materials and methods: This is a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study conducted on 20 <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> in ICU that were almost homogenous in terms of consciousness level and cause of coma. Participants were divided randomly into case and control groups. For participants in the case group, the Yasin surah with the voice of Al-Menshawi was played every day for 15 minutes by an MP 3 player. The vital signs and arterial oxygen pressure of two groups was checked before and after intervention. The collected data was analyzed by means of SPSS 16 software and by paired t-test. Results: Results of this study showed that after intervention, in the case group, the mean systolic [P= 0. 04] and diastolic [P= 0. 05] blood pressure, pulse rate [P= 0. 001] and arterial oxygen pressure [P= 0. 04] had significant differences in comparison with before intervention. However the difference was not statistically significant about the breath rate and body temperature. discussion: Playing the holy Quran recitation led to the balance in blood pressure and arterial oxygen pressure of patients. Therefore it is possible to use it as a treatment method in order to make a balance in the vital signs of <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients.</b> Keywords: Quran incitation, <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients,</b> vital signs, arterial Oxygen pressure, IC...|$|R

50|$|In modern {{practice}} of ECT a therapeutic clonic seizure is induced by electric current via electrodes placed on an anaesthetised, <b>unconscious</b> <b>patient.</b> Despite much research the exact {{mechanism of action}} of ECT is still not known.

50|$|The coma {{cocktail}} {{is thought}} to have been created in United States as a first line treatment for an <b>unconscious</b> <b>patient</b> in an era where intensive care was new and difficult to maintain. Original coma cocktails included methylxanthines, physostigmine, physical stimulation (such as cold water baths or ammonium carbonate ("smelling salts")), amphetamines, strychnine, picrotoxin, nikethamide and camphor. As medicine and assessment techniques have advanced, the proceeding drugs have been mostly replaced by the modern coma cocktail as described above.|$|E
40|$|Background Hanging {{has been}} {{increasingly}} used to commit suicide. There is no specific treatment besides general intensive care after near-hanging. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) {{has been used}} in <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> after near-hanging. Objective To describe the outcomes in <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> after near-hanging in order to determine whether TH improves the outcome of near-hanging injury. Methods Medical charts were reviewed of <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> after near-hanging who presented to Chonnam National University Hospital between January 2006 and December 2010 and who were considered to be eligible for TH. According to local policy, unconscious survivors after near-hanging, whether or not they experienced cardiac arrest at the scene, were treated with TH if this was agreed by next-of-kin. Results There were 16 survivors of asphyxial cardiac arrest after near-hanging, of whom 13 received TH. Among them, only one (7. 7 %, 95 % CI 1. 4 % to 33. 3 %) attained Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1; the other 15 patients had poor neurological outcomes (CPC 5 in seven patients and CPC 4 in eight patients). Nine of the patients did not experience cardiac arrest at the scene and of these, four received TH and five received normothermic treatment. All patients who did not have cardiac arrest recovered and were discharged with CPC 1. Conclusion In this study, outcomes in <b>unconscious</b> near-hanging <b>patients</b> with cardiac arrest were poor despite treatment with TH. Before recommending TH in near-hanging patients, a prospective, randomised controlled study is required...|$|R

50|$|The head-tilt/chin-lift is {{the primary}} {{maneuver}} used in any patient in whom cervical spine injury is not a concern. The simplest way of ensuring an open airway in an <b>unconscious</b> <b>patient</b> {{is to use a}} head-tilt/chin-lift technique, thereby lifting the tongue {{from the back of the}} throat. The maneuver is performed by tilting the head backwards in unconscious patients, often by applying pressure to the forehead and the chin. Head-tilt/chin-lift is taught on most first aid courses as the standard way of clearing an airway.|$|E
50|$|Evaluation of an {{unconscious}} patients breathing is often {{performed by the}} look, listen, and feel method. The ear is placed over person's mouth so breathing can be heard and felt while looking for rising chest or abdomen. The procedure should not take longer than 10 seconds. As in conscious patients stridor can be heard {{if there is an}} airway obstruction. Back fall of the tongue however results in snoring. In the <b>unconscious</b> <b>patient</b> agonal breathing is often mistaken for airway obstructions. If there is respiratory arrest or agonal breathing CPR is indicated.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, 43 % of {{respondents}} (and 37 % of doctors) {{thought that it}} would be technically possible to draw up a law on a request for euthanasia by conscious patients, but only 23 % (23 % of whom were doctors) thought this possible for <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|R
25|$|Due to {{medications}} given before, during, {{and after}} a surgery, a patient may sometimes not remember interactions with the anaesthetist, nurse anaesthetist, or anaesthesia assistant involved in his anaesthesia care.

30|$|As for the {{question}} of a possible law authorizing the administration of lethal drugs, opinions were equally distributed in favor or against such a law both in the case of conscious patients (48.5 % against versus 51.5 % for) and <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> (47.4 % against versus 52.6 % for).|$|R

30|$|Our survey mixes up {{conscious}} and <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients</b> under WoWt conditions. In the United Kingdom, where {{the rate of}} organ harvesting under Maastricht III conditions {{is one of the}} highest in the world, the most common diagnoses in donors are severe and irreversible brain injuries [22]. However, conscious patients suffering from irreversible severe diseases with no hope for improvement (for example end-stage respiratory disease, locked-in syndrome, atrophic lateral sclerosis) may request both life-support withdrawal (i.e., turn off mechanical ventilation) and subsequent organ donation if not contraindicated [22 – 24]. In France, Leonetti’s law applies to conscious or <b>unconscious</b> <b>patients,</b> in end-of-life situation or with irreversible and severely-disabling diseases [14]. As donation under Maastricht III conditions is still not legally framed, we deliberately considered every possible scenario encountered in other public health systems.|$|R
