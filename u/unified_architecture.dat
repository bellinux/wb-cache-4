This development completely altered {{the character of the}} city center. Before the earthquake, a considerable part of the center was built in the Moorish Revival style. After the earthquake, {{the decision was made to}} rebuild it in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. This effort was undertaken by the Santa Barbara Community Arts Association, which was founded in the beginning of the 1920s and viewed the earthquake as the opportunity to rebuild the city center in the <b>unified</b> <b>architecture</b> style.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{multiplication}} units that are reusable and scalable {{is of interest}} for cryptographic applications, where the operand size in bits is usually large, and may significantly change depending on the required level of security or the specific cryptosystem (e. g., RSA or Elliptic Curve). The use of the Montgomery multiplication (MM) method combined with techniques for time and space scheduling generates efficient and general solutions in this arena. MM {{has proven to be}} useful in both GF(p) and GF(2 ^m), and opened up the door for <b>unified</b> <b>architectures</b> designed to accommodate both fields. The scalable design does not rely on particular characteristics of the fields, it is adjustable for the silicon area available, and it does not limit the precision of the operands (variable precision). This way, the design lasts longer. This paper presents a generalization of the concept of scalable and <b>unified</b> <b>architectures</b> for multiplication in GF(p) and GF(2 ^m). A design framework is initially presented, and followed by a design example of a radix- 8 processing element for a scalable and <b>unified</b> MM <b>architecture.</b> Experimental results show the potential of this method...|$|R

50|$|An OS {{maintains}} catalogues {{of objects}} it manages such as threads, mutexes, memory, and so on. Updates to this catalogue must be strictly controlled. For this reason {{it can be}} problematic when an interrupt handler calls an OS function while the application is {{in the act of}} also doing so. The OS function called from an interrupt handler could find the object database to be in an inconsistent state because of the application's update. There are two major approaches to deal with this problem: the <b>unified</b> <b>architecture</b> and the segmented architecture. RTOSs implementing the <b>unified</b> <b>architecture</b> solve the problem by simply disabling interrupts while the internal catalogue is updated. The downside of this is that interrupt latency increases, potentially losing interrupts. The segmented architecture does not make direct OS calls but delegates the OS related work to a separate handler. This handler runs at a higher priority than any thread but lower than the interrupt handlers. The advantage of this architecture is that it adds very few cycles to interrupt latency. As a result, OSes which implement the segmented architecture are more predictable and can deal with higher interrupt rates compared to the <b>unified</b> <b>architecture.</b>|$|E
