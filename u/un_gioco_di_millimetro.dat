5000|$|It {{still seems}} {{uncertain}} whether {{the game of}} primero is of Spanish or Italian origin. Although Daines Barrington is {{of the opinion that}} it is of Spanish origin, a poem of Francesco Berni is the earliest known writing to mention the game; it affords proof that it was at least commonly played in Italy {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century. His work entitled Capitolo del Gioco della Primiera, published in Rome in 1526, and believed to be the earliest extant work describing a card game, contains some particulars on primero. According to David Parlett, the game's card-point system is found in other Italian games but nowhere else. The game is still very much played in central Europe and Spain with Italian-suited cards, under the name of goffo or bambara, remaining the major native vying game of Italy. Alessandro Striggio's madrigal dramatizing a party of the game [...] "II <b>gioco</b> <b>di</b> primiera" [...] was published in 1569.|$|R
