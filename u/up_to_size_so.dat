25|$|A {{growing concern}} {{regarding}} plastic {{pollution in the}} marine ecosystem {{is the use of}} microplastics. Microplastics are little beads of plastic less than 5 millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in hand soaps, face cleansers, and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the microplastics go through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment screens on wastewater plants. These beads are harmful to the organisms in the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the plastic and become sick. The microplastics are such a concern because it is difficult <b>to</b> clean them <b>up</b> due <b>to</b> their <b>size,</b> <b>so</b> humans can try to avoid using these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use natural, environmentally safe exfoliates.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} an improved algorithm {{that allows us to}} enumerate the number of site animals on the square lattice <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 46. We also calculate the number of lattice trees <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 44 and the radius of gyration of both lattice animals and trees <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 42. Analysis of the resulting series yields an improved estimate, *= 4. 062570 (8), for the growth constant of lattice animals, and, * 0 = 3. 795254 (8), for the growth constant of trees, and confirms to a very high degree of certainty that both the animal and tree generating functions have a logarithmic divergence. Analysis of the radius of gyration series yields the estimate, &= 0. 64115 (5), for the size exponent. KEY WORDS: Lattice animals; exact enumeration; computer algorithms. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the Intelligent Water Drops algorithm (MIWD) was developed then used to determine the most stable configurations of Lennard-Jones (LJ), Binary Lennard-Jones (BLJ) and Morse Clusters. The algorithm is unbiased in that it uses no a priori cluster geometry information or cluster seeds. Results for LJ clusters show that the algorithm is effective and efficient in rediscovering all clusters <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> N = 104 with better success rates specially on difficult clusters compared to previous best methodologies reported in literature. Results on more difficult systems, such as the Binary Lennard Jones clusters <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 50 (with 5 different atomic size ratios) and Morse clusters <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 60 (with 2 interparticle range potentials), also showed the ability of MIWD to handle more complex systems. MIWD was then applied to predict the most stable structures of Janus clusters <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 50 and on size 100 using a LJ potential model with a modulated angular term suited for two-patched Janus particles. Results show that MIWD is able to find well-structured geometries of Janus clusters. It is believed that this has been {{the first time that a}} nature-inspired stochastic algorithm and a variant of the IWD algorithm has been applied to the configurational optimization of Janus clusters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With the {{accelerating}} {{growth of}} biological databases {{and the beginning}} of genome-scale processing, cost-effective high-performance sequence analysis remains an essential problem in bioinformatics. We examine the use of FPGAs for finding repetitive structures such as tandem repeats and palindromes under various mismatch models. For all problems addressed here, we process strings in “streaming mode ” and obtain processing times of 5 ns per character for arbitrary length strings. Using a Xilinx XC 2 VP 100, we can find: (i) all repeats <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 1024, each with any number of mismatches; (ii) all precise tandem arrays with repeats <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 1024; (iii) all palindromes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> 256, each with any number of mismatches, or (iv) a somewhat smaller size of (i) and (iii) with a single insertion or deletion. We sketch methods for filtering the output also in streaming mode. The speed-up factors range from 250 to 6000 over an efficient serial implementation which is itself many times faster than a direct implementation of a theoretically optimal serial algorithm. ...|$|R

Moreover, each result has been automatically verified, again using a variety of techniques – including automated theorem proving, computer algebra and satisfiability solving – and we describe our bootstrapping approach to the generation and verification of these classification results. 1...|$|R
