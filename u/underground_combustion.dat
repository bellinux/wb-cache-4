50|$|Historically {{from time}} to time, {{underground}} seams of coal have caught fire, often from careless or unfortunate mining activities. The pocket of ignited coal is fed oxygen by vent paths {{that have not yet}} been discovered. These can smolder for years. Commonly, exhaust vents in populated areas are soon sensed and are sealed while vents in uninhabited areas remain undiscovered. Occasionally, vents are discovered via fumes sensed by passers-by, often in forested areas. Attempts to extinguish those remaining have at times been futile, and several such combustion areas exist today. The existence of an <b>underground</b> <b>combustion</b> site can sometimes be identified in the winter where fallen snow is seen to be melted by the warmth conducted from below.

To enhance spontaneous combustion management capabilities in the Australian coal industry, a study was undertaken to investigate three innovative techniques that have been successfully used in China. These three are the radon detection technique, the infrared technique and the colloid injection technique. The radon detection technique is for remotely locating the areas of <b>underground</b> spontaneous <b>combustion</b> from a surface location. The infrared detection technique is for locating the spontaneous combustion within a short distance. The colloids injection technique is for controlling spontaneous combustion after it is located.

The hidden danger of coal spontaneous combustion is predicted by observing and analyzing those features, synthesizing its features and the differences at the different stage of development, so that it can provide reliable guidance to prevent underground spontaneous fire. The study of indicator gases to forecast and predict coal spontaneous combustion is more and more important to prevent the spontaneous combustion. For this reason, the paper, according to the indicator gases and critical value, systematically introduces the technology of predicting the hidden danger of <b>underground</b> coal spontaneous <b>combustion</b> such as detecting the carbon monoxide concentration, chromatographing the gas composition, detecting the coal temperature and infrared radiation detection analysis, which provides the guidance for the prediction of the coal spontaneous combustion...|$|R

The company put down a mine shaft 2,000 feet, from which they planned to drive a network of tunnels horizontally, and mine by conventional room-and-pillar. ARCO and TOSCO withdrew from the Tract C-b joint venture, leaving Shell and Ashland. In 1977, Shell sold its part to Occidental, and Ashland later sold out what was then known as the Cathedral Bluffs project to Tenneco. Occidental Petroleum Corporation had been began producing shale oil with in situ methods at its test tract near Debeque, Colorado. Pleased with the test-scale results, Oxy scrapped plans for conventional mining at Cathedral Bluffs in favor of its in situ process, in which they would drive a network of tunnels out from the mine shaft, break the oil shale with explosives, and produce oil <b>underground</b> by controlled <b>combustion.</b> The shale oil would then be pumped to the surface.

40|$|For Underground Coal Gasification (UCG), it is {{necessary}} to evaluate the combustion area in the coal seam precisely. We are planning to use acoustic emission/microseismicity (AE/MS) monitoring for estimation of the <b>underground</b> <b>combustion</b> area. Analyzing the AE/MS waveforms from underground rocks, fracture extension around the combustion reactor can be grasped. For this objective, laboratory experiments are conducted for the UCG model. During burning coal block molded cylindrically by mortar, temperatures inside coal and AE activity were monitored. From the experimental results, it was found that many AE events were generated during combustion of coal, and the AE activity was close related to the change of temperature inside coal block. These AE generations seems to be caused by the crack initiation and extension around coal combustion area in the influence of thermal stress. Therefore, AE/MS monitoring {{is expected to be a}} useful tool to evaluate the UCG combustion reactor. 特集 : 「資源、新エネルギー、環境、防災研究国際セミナー...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the Microgravity Smoldering Combustion (MSC) research program is to understand and predict smoldering combustion under normal and microgravity (near-zero-gravity) conditions to help prevent and control smolder-originated fires, in both environments. Smoldering {{is defined as a}} nonflaming, self-sustaining, propagating, exothermic surface reaction. If a material is sufficiently permeable, smoldering is not confined to its outer surface, but can propagate as a reaction wave through the interior of the material. The MSC program will accomplish its goals by conducting smolder experiments on the ground and in a space-based laboratory, and developing theoretical models of the process. Space-based experiments are necessary because smoldering is a very slow process and, consequently, its study in a microgravity environment requires extended periods of time that can only be achieved in space. Smoldering can occur in a variety of processes ranging from the smolder of porous insulating materials to <b>underground</b> coal <b>combustion.</b> Many materials can sustain smoldering, including wood, cloth, foams, tobacco, other dry organic materials, and charcoal. The ignition, propagation, transition to flaming, and extinction of the smolder reaction are controlled by complex, thermochemical mechanisms that are not well understood. As with many forms of combustion, gravity affects the availability of the oxidizer and the transport of heat, and therefore, the rate of combustion. The smoldering combustion of porous materials has been studied both experimentally and theoretically, usually in the context of fire safety. Smoldering encompasses a number of fundamental processes, including heat and mass transfer in a porous media; endothermic pyrolysis of combustible material; ignition, propagation, and extinction of heterogeneous exothermic reactions at the solid-gas pore interface; and the onset of gas phase reactions (flaming) from existing surface reactions. Smoldering presents a serious fire risk because the combustion can propagate slowly in a material's interior and go undetected for long periods of time. It typically yields a substantially higher conversion of fuel to toxic compounds than does flaming (though more slowly), and may undergo a sudden transition to flaming...|$|R

Particularly in china, the closure of coal workfaces because of spontaneous combustion has contributed to substantial economic loss. To reduce the occurrence of mine fires, the spontaneous coal <b>combustion</b> <b>underground</b> needs to be studied. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed for coal spontaneous combustion under goaf gas drainage conditions.

The goaf was treated as an anisotropic medium, {{and the effects of}} methane drainage and oxygen consumption on spontaneous combustion were considered. The simulation results matched observational data from a field study, which indicates CFD simulation is suitable for research on the distribution of oxygen in coalmines. The results also indicated that near the workface spontaneous combustion was more likely to take place in {{the upper part of the}} goaf than near the bottom, while further from workface the risk of spontaneous combustion was greater in the lower part of the goaf.

In order to achieve a more efficient approach to detect accurately fire source of spontaneous <b>combustion</b> <b>underground</b> mine so that the fire disaster can be prevented as early as possible, a model of heat transfer was proposed and using the thermal infrared imager to detect spontaneous ignition of sulfide ores was designed. The simulation results of thermal modeling show when closing to self-ignition duration and the detective depth is 1  m, the maximum temperature difference is corresponding 2. 78 ∘C in the scope of 1  m× 1  m; Under the same condition, the maximum temperature differences are 4. 23 ∘C and 5. 25 ∘C respectively in the scope of 1. 5  m× 1. 5  m and 2  m× 2  m.

40|$|Timely {{and rapid}} {{intervention}} to <b>underground</b> <b>combustion</b> events (fires, explosions, and spontaneous combustion) {{is the key}} to the successful control of the mine atmosphere and restoring of a coal mine to production. The focus of this paper is the utilization of a GAG 3 A jet engine system to combat either large out-of-control fires or to render an entire mine inert when access to problem areas is difficult or impossible. This system is based upon a Soviet designed agricultural jet engine which consumes aviation fuel with oxygen (O 2) from the intake air and exhausts combustion gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2 O), along with the nitrogen (N 2) from the air and small amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2). The system is designed to approach stoichiometric combustion (ideally, pure burning that scavenges all the oxygen from the intake air). Therefore, these exhaust gases are almost entirely inert gases - i. e., gases which do not contribute to, and in fact, can suppress the combustion process due to the lack of oxygen. Other methods to inert mine areas have been used in the US and internationally, but these methods usually use low flow inertisation equipment or methods. Use of these low-flow inertisation equipment and methods has been successful in proactively rendering gob areas inert and has the ability to inert the entire mine workings. Due to the low flow rate, however, a substantial period o...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} depth, {{distance from}} surface connections and falling quality of coal mined are factors {{that increase the}} risk of spontaneous combustion in working areas. The trend towards high capital investment, high output faces significantly raises the economic consequences of spontaneous combustion. Much work has been directed towards methods of identifying the liability of a coal to spontaneously combust under given conditions. The cost of prevention and combat of spontaneous <b>combustion</b> <b>underground</b> is high, however this work is carried out with little knowledge of the likely location of a heating in a coalface waste. This thesis investigates the airflow patterns in a coalface waste, with a view towards improving the use of prevention and combat methods. The factors that affect the liability of a coal to spontaneously combust, and the methods of prevention and combat are discussed to provide a background to the subject area. An investigation into the flow of nitrogen that was injected from one hole into a coalface waste as a combat measure was conducted.
