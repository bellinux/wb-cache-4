The Windows Vista audio {{engine is}} designed to run faster than the Windows XP audio engine, and has tighter requirements on audio buffer position accuracy. Also, the new Universal Audio Architecture (UAA) model has been introduced, replacing WDM audio, which allows compliant audio hardware to automatically work under Windows without needing device drivers from the audio hardware vendor.|$|E
25|$|In computing, {{a system}} call {{is how a}} process {{requests}} a service from an operating system's kernel {{that it does not}} normally have permission to run. System calls provide the interface between a process and the operating system. Most operations interacting with the system require permissions not available to a <b>user</b> <b>level</b> process, e.g. I/O performed with a device present on the system, or any form of communication with other processes requires the use of system calls.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{technical}} support has improved dramatically, and though HP's help desk earned high praise from many survey respondents in 2007, some NMCI users {{felt that their}} wait times were excessive when they called the help desk. [...] Further, because NMCI's first priority was {{to rein in the}} counterproductive customization and proliferation of applications and networks, users are not given permissions to change computers’ settings.

2500|$|HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is {{sometimes}} allowed but usually its use is discouraged or when allowed, it is extensively filtered. Modern bulletin board systems often {{will have it}} disabled altogether or allow only administrators use it, as allowing it on any normal <b>user</b> <b>level</b> is considered a security risk due to {{a high rate of}} XSS vulnerabilities. When HTML is disabled Bulletin Board Code (BBCode) is the most common preferred alternative. BBCode usually consists of a tag, similar to HTML only instead of < and > the tagname is enclosed within square brackets (meaning: [...] ). Commonly [...] is used for italic type, [...] is used for bold, [...] for underline, [...] for color and [...] for lists, as well as [...] for images and [...] for links.|$|E
2500|$|Standard device drivers can be {{difficult}} to write because they must handle a very wide range of system and device states, particularly in a multithreaded software environment. [...] Badly written device drivers can cause severe damage to a system (e.g., BSoD and data corruption) since all standard drivers have high privileges when accessing the kernel directly. The User-Mode Driver Framework insulates the kernel from the problems of direct driver access, instead providing a new class of driver with a dedicated application programming interface at the <b>user</b> <b>level</b> of interrupts and memory management. If an error occurs, the new framework allows for an immediate driver restart without impacting the system. [...] This is particularly useful for devices that are intermittently connected to the system or support hot swapping via a bus technology such as USB or Firewire.|$|E

2500|$|Many kernels provide {{implementation}} of [...] "capabilities", i.e. {{objects that are}} provided to user code which allow limited access to an underlying object managed by the kernel. [...] A common example occurs in file handling: a file is a representation of information stored on a permanent storage device. [...] The kernel {{may be able to}} perform many different operations (e.g. read, write, delete or execute the file contents) but a <b>user</b> <b>level</b> application may only be permitted to perform some of these operations (e.g. it may only be allowed to read the file). [...] A common {{implementation of}} this is for the kernel to provide an object to the application (typically called a [...] "file handle") which the application may then invoke operations on, the validity of which the kernel checks at the time the operation is requested. Such a system may be extended to cover all objects that the kernel manages, and indeed to objects provided by other user applications.|$|E

In previous work we determined that a <b>user's</b> <b>level</b> of domain knowledge affects the kind of information provided in an answer to a user's question as opposed to just the amount of information, as was previously proposed.

40|$|A {{question}} answering program that {{provides access to}} {{a large amount of}} data will be most useful if it can tailor its answers to each individual user. In particular, a <b>user's</b> <b>level</b> of knowledge about the domain of discourse {{is an important factor in}} this tailoring if the answer provided is to be both informative and understandable to the user. In this research, we address the issue of how the user's domain knowledge, or the level of expertise, might affect an answer. By studying texts we found that the <b>user's</b> <b>level</b> of domain knowledge affected the kind of information provided and not just the amount of information, as was previously assumed. Depending on the user's assumed domain knowledge. a description of a complex physical objects can be either parts-oriented or process-oriented. Thus the <b>user's</b> <b>level</b> of expertise in a domain can guide a system in choosing the appropriate facts from the knowledge base to include in an answer. We propose two distinct descriptive strategies that can be used to generate texts aimed at naive and expert users.
