50|$|Slickline {{comes in}} {{different}} sizes and grades. The larger the size, and higher the grade, generally means the higher line tension can be pulled before the line snaps at the weakest spot and causes a costly 'fishing' job. Due to downhole tools getting stuck because of malfunctions or 'downhole conditions' including sand, scale, salt, asphaltenes, and other well byproducts settling or loosening off the pipe walls because of agitation {{either by the}} downhole tools or a change in downhole inflow, sometimes {{it is necessary to}} pull hard on the tools to bring them back <b>uphole</b> to surface. If the tools are stuck, and the operator pulls too hard, the line will snap or pull apart at the weakest spot, which is generally closer to surface as the further <b>uphole</b> the weak point in the line is, the more weight it has to support (the weight of the line).|$|E

The information is then used to ensure that the depth shown on the log is correct. After that, power can be applied through the tool to set off explosive charges for things like perforating, setting plugs or packers, dumping cement, etc.|$|E

30|$|High-resolution seismic {{reflection}} {{techniques are}} valuable tools for nondestructive imaging of the shallow subsurface. These techniques are usually applied to estimate near-surface geotechnical parameters when {{information about the}} spatial distribution of seismic velocities in heterogeneous unconsolidated sediments is required {{for a wide variety}} of near-surface environmental and engineering applications (e.g., Knödel et al. 1997; Butler 2005; Kirsch 2006; Lehmann 2007). However, it lacks redundancy measures usually considered in conventional methods. Using high-resolution land-streamer seismic acquisition for special applications over a small area can help us regain the redundancy associated with conventional acquisition. In addition, estimating the near-surface velocity using high-resolution seismic techniques instead of <b>upholes</b> reduces cost and spares the environment from drilling hazards (Cox 1999).|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} freepoint tool is an electromechanical tool {{designed to}} measure the amount of torque or stretch of a given length of tubing, drill pipe, or casing. The traditional freepoint tool uses either bow springs or magnets to anchor itself inside the pipe.

The tool is anchored in place. Stretch and or torque is then applied to the pipe. This allows the pipe recovery engineer to obtain a baseline reading of the free pipe. This will give him a starting point to compare his later freepoint readings to. The tool is then run roughly 500 feet past the estimated stuck point. Stretch and torque are applied, and readings are taken. If the tool indicates that the pipe is stuck at that point the tool is pulled <b>uphole</b> and readings are taken again.

Drill logs from each <b>Uphole</b> point was used in conjunction with the theoretical interpretations as a physical set of data to aid in making inferences for boundary distinction. Fifty two (52) <b>Uphole</b> locations were drilled and logged. Each location was drilled to 66 m and logged to 60 m. Litho logy from the bore samples reveals dominantly sand and clay units. The sand sizes ranges from fine to coarse. The records / playbacks have good signal quality with distinct first break times. The UDISYS interpretation software guided by surface (shot depth) correction and shot offset correction displayed a two-layered case. Analysis on the weathering thickness and velocities within the prospect area reveals that <b>uphole</b> locations have weathering thickness ranging from 2. 7 m to 11. 0 m. The highest velocity within the weathering layer is 924 m/s (254 m/s to 924) while the velocity of the consolidated layer ranges from 1528 ms to 1927 ms. Appreciably, this correlates with the formation samples collected at various <b>uphole</b> lithology logs.

40|$|This work {{discusses}} an <b>uphole</b> survey {{with the}} aim of comparing seismic refraction data acquired with the offset-geophone procedure and that acquired using the down-deep hydrophone procedure, and subsequent examination of the validity of each data set for seismic reflection data quality control. Data was obtained at Grid 5594 / 1961 on the Trans-Ramos river 3 -D prospect in the Niger Delta Basin, Nigeria. Interpretation of the offset-geophone data shows that as shots are taken <b>uphole,</b> vertical time of the shots are initially greater than the time of intercept, and decreases <b>uphole.</b> However, at a particular depth, as shots move up, the intercept time overtakes the vertical time. This would happen only if the shot is taken within the consolidated layer. Therefore, the greatest depth at which vertical time is exceeded by the intercept time qualitatively gives a clue to the base of weathering. This value can then be compared with the value obtained from a quantitative interpretation of the data to ascertain the correctness of the results. Interpretation of the down-deep hydrophone data is only based on theoretical equations and it is nearly impossible to check the computed weathering depth.

An <b>uphole</b> survey does not properly define sharp, near-surface velocity changes associated with lithologic and topo-graphic variations such as cliffs, canyons, or outcrops, {{which may be}} delineated by satellite imagery instead. We present a patchy interpolation technique to build a consistent near-sur-face model. The algorithm is based on K-means clustering to integrate geological, geophysical, and remote-sensing infor-mation. A somewhat arbitrary aspect of the method is the choice of how many clusters are used in segregating the data. Linking this parameter to surface geologic formations may be inadequate because P- or S-wave velocities are unlikely to have a sufficiently unique correlation with geologic age and lithology.

30|$|The complex near-surface {{structure}} {{is a major}} problem in land seismic data. This is more critical when data acquisition takes place over sand dune surfaces, where the base of the sand acts as a trap for energy and, depending on its shape, can considerably distort conventionally acquired seismic data. Estimating the base of the sand dune surface can help model the sand dune and reduce its harmful influence on conventional seismic data. Among the current methods to do so are drilling upholes and using conventional seismic data to apply static correction. Both methods have costs and limitations. For upholes, the cost factor and their inability to provide a continuous model is well realized. Meanwhile, conventional seismic data lack the resolution necessary to obtain accurate modeling of the sand basement. We developed a method to estimate the sand base from land-streamer seismic acquisition that is developed and geared to sand surfaces. Seismic data acquisition took place over a sand surface in the Al-Thumamah area, where an <b>uphole</b> is located, using the developed land-streamer and conventional spiked geophone systems. Land-streamer acquisition not only provides a more efficient data acquisition system than the conventional spiked geophone approach, but also in our case, the land-streamer provided better quality data with a broader frequency bandwidth. Such data enabled us to do accurate near-surface velocity estimation that resulted in velocities that are very close to those measured using <b>uphole</b> methods. This fact is demonstrated on multiple lines acquired near upholes, and agreement between the seismic velocities and the upholes is high. The stacked depth seismic section shows three layers. The interface {{between the first and second}} layers is located at 7  m depth, while the interface between second and third layers is located at 68  m depth, which agrees with the <b>uphole</b> result.|$|E

Over 100 foraminiferal taxa were recognized, grouped into nine successive stratigraphic assemblages and correlated directly to the Gradstein & Bäckström (1996) regional Cenozoic zonation. A majority of taxa are agglutinated foraminifera, commonly described from Paleogene bathyal strata in the North Sea.

40|$|An {{effective}} geophone-to-ground {{couple is}} often difficult to achieve in loose sediment. Unconsolidated sediment can significantly attenuate the high-frequency component of seismic data. Consequently, the resolution and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of seismic data are adversely affected. In order to minimize these effects, two approaches for enhancing seismic reflection data on the basis of ancillary measurements are demonstrated. A coupling match filter was derived by using single trace seismic data from a Seismic Wave Detect System (SWDS) and common receivers under equivalent conditions. The filter was applied to convert a common shot gather to a SWDS shot gather. The high-frequency loss components in stacked data were corrected by an attenuation compensatory inverse filter constructed from <b>uphole</b> seismic data. The results show that the resolution of seismic data from the coupling match filter is nearly equivalent to that of the SWDS data. In addition, the resolution and S/N ratio were enhanced by the compensatory attenuation inverse filter. These filters can be applied separately or in combination to improve the data quality and compensate high frequency loss in the seismic data without significantly affecting low frequency content...|$|E
30|$|High {{data rate}} pulsars in MPT {{telemetry}} not only create signals that propagate <b>uphole,</b> but also reverse direction, down-going signals that reflect at the drillbit which combine to create constructively or destructively interfering signals. Strong signal reflections are detected {{at the surface}} signal detectors caused by mud pumps, pulsation dampeners, drill string joints and diameter changes, dispersion and filtering of certain frequencies within mud channel (Brackel 2016; Brooks 2015). The ultimate signal that travels up the drillpipe depends on mud velocity, {{the position of the}} pulsar in the drill collar, operating frequency and the bottomhole assembly details forming the host waveguide. The superposition of the main wave from the transmitter and the multiple reflected waves generate either destructive interference or constructive interference pulse signals (Shi et al. 2004). Destructive interference signal can severely limit data rate and transmission distance while the constructive interference signal, if properly applied, can enhance LWD signal strength without the power penalties incurred by mechanical methods. As a matter of fact, signal reflections occur at any impedance mismatch positions in drillstring, reducing its impacts (Cheng et al. 2014 a, b) proposed novel multiple-echo suppression model using two receivers based on the transient pulse responses in uplink and downlink channels.|$|E
40|$|Long-hole winze (LHW) {{blasting}} is {{a critical}} stage of production in underground sublevel open stoping; however, its influence on potential excavation damage is often overlooked. In addition, recent developments in <b>uphole</b> LHW practices are implementing longer firing lengths, sometimes exceeding 15 – 20 m on a single blast. This {{has the potential to}} increase the likelihood of blast-related damage. This paper introduces an empirical approach to determine long-hole winze firing heights to minimise near-field rock mass damage. The degree of damage is estimated from the amplitude of peak particle velocities induced by the LHW blasts. Modelling was conducted to evaluate the relationship between peak particle velocity (PPV) as a function of LHW firing heights and distance to a point of interest. A hypothesis was established and further verified with direct measurements from a comprehensive near-field vibration monitoring programme conducted at a large sublevel open stoping operation in Australia. An empirical model to estimate PPV as a function of a non-dimensional factor was established. The model is defined by the ratio of the distance to a point of interest and the LHW firing height. This model may be used to determine the recommended advance and firing phases of a LHW to minimise potential damage to open stope boundaries...|$|E

Several generations of supplemental support, including cable bolts, cribbing, and Heintzmann jacks and beams failed to halt roof falls that threatened workers safety and the life of the mine. Polyurethane (PUR) was injected into 27 intersections in the roof and the results were monitored by borehole video camera. The mine had averaged 2 - 3 falls in the beltway per year and, since the roof injection, no roof falls have occurred. Pre- and post injection monitoring of test holes showed that stability can be achieved without filling all of the existing void spaces. Video logging showed that the project goal of building a beam from 2 - 6 ft into the roof was successful. Pre-injection monitoring of roof fractures <b>uphole</b> can delineate the zones to target for reinforcement, and avoid pumping PUR into large voids to little effect. Multiple-injection zones can be identified, and the entire intersection drill hole array can be optimized based on knowledge of the fractured zones. In addition, pre-monitoring can prevent excessive hydrofracturing in solid zones. Polyurethane injection is a proven method of rock stabilization in even the weakest, most broken ground. Optimization of the injection design by pre-injection video diagnostics can greatly contribute to the successful and efficient roof stabilization...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{hydrocarbon}} exploration {{in the northern}} sector of the Western Desert in Egypt has revealed relatively rich hydrocarbon accumulations, mainly of gas, and demonstrate promising future prospects. In order to improve our understanding of this area {{and to provide a}} biostratigraphical framework for the hitherto poorly dated Lower Cretaceous successions, a palynological analysis was carried out on 57 ditch cutting samples from the Abu Tunis 1 x borehole. Palynostratigraphic investigation on these samples has enabled the identification of three new palynostratigraphically defined age divisions with three corresponding palynozones defined by first <b>uphole</b> occurrences of gymnosperm and angiosperm pollen and dinoflagellate cysts. Spore and pollen grains recovered from the Abu Tunis 1 x borehole show the characteristics of the pre-Albian Dicheiropollis/Afropollis Phytogeographical Province. Discrepancies in the reported range of Dicheiropollis etruscus, when compared with earlier (Berriasian) appearances in West Africa and later (late Hauterivian) appearances in East Africa, may be attributed to palaeoecological factors. Dicheiropollis etruscus is accepted as having a cheirolepidiacean conifer affinity and is regarded as having been produced by a thermophilous plant. Here, we suggest that Dicheiropollis etruscus was adapted to arid conditions. Dicheiropollis etruscus thus first appeared in hot, dry palaeo-subtropical African regions, but as Western Gondwana broke up and the African Plate moved northeast during/after the Late Jurassic, the region that is now present-day Egypt, Libya and Sudan had moved by the late Hauterivian into a subtropical position; the ensuing increased aridity thus allowed Dicheiropollis etruscus to migrate into these areas...|$|E
40|$|Two main {{alternating}} facies {{were observed}} at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1165, drilled in 3357 m water depth into the Wild Drift (Cooperation Sea, Antarctica) : a dark gray, laminated, terrigenous one (interpreted as muddy contourites) and a greenish, homogeneous, biogenic and coarse fraction-bearing one (interpreted as hemipelagic deposits with ice rafted debris [IRD]). These two cyclically alternating facies reflect orbitally driven changes (Milankovitch periodicities) recorded in spectral reflectance, bulk density, and magnetic susceptibility data and opal content changes. Superimposed on these short-term variations, significant <b>uphole</b> changes in average sedimentation rates, total clay content, IRD amount, and mineral composition were interpreted {{to represent the}} long-term lower to upper Miocene transition from a temperate climate to a cold-climate glaciation. The analysis of the short-term variations (interpreted to reflect ice sheet expansions controlled by 41 -k. y. insolation changes) requires a quite closely spaced sampled record like that provided by the archive multisensor track. Among those, cycles are best described by spectral reflectance data and, in particular, by a parameter calculated as {{the ratio of the}} reflectivity in the green color band and the average reflectivity (gray). In this data report a numerical evaluation of spectral reflectance data was performed and substantiated by correlation with core photos to provide an objective description of the color variations within Site 1165 sediments. The resulting color description provides a reference to categorize the available samples in terms of facies and, hence, a framework for further analyses. Moreover, a link between visually described features and numerical series suitable for spectral analyses is provided...|$|E
40|$|The current {{economic}} situation has severely affected the US road infrastructure and funding has become inadequate for either maintenance or future growth. The inverted base pavement structure is a promising alternative to achieve high quality roads at considerably lower cost than conventional pavements. The {{proximity of the}} unbound granular base layer to the tire load makes {{the response of the}} granular base critical to the performance of the pavement structure. Therefore extensive material characterization is conducted on the granular materials that make the base. In particular, a true triaxial chamber is developed to study the mechanical response and the stress-dependent stiffness of granular bases compacted at different water contents. A novel method is developed to assess the as-built stress-dependent anisotropic stiffness of granular bases in-situ using both crosshole and <b>uphole</b> test configurations. The two inverted base pavements built in Georgia at the Morgan County quarry haul road and the Lagrange south Loop are tested as part of this study. A nonlinear orthotropic constitutive model is selected to capture the deformational behavior of compacted granular bases. The response of the pavement is analyzed by implementing this constitutive behavior in a three-dimensional finite-element model. Different pavement structures are simulated. It is shown that thin asphalt concrete layers resting directly on granular bases deform as membranes. Finally, numerical simulations are extended to compare inverted base pavements to conventional pavements used in practice. Results highlight the inadequacy of ASSHTO’s structural layer coefficient for the analysis of inverted base pavement structures as well as the potential economic advantages of inverted base pavements.
