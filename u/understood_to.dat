AngloMockBa was supported and sponsored by TIME, Swissotel Krasnye Holmy, bmi, BBC Russian Service, Audi and The Moscow Times.|$|E

5|$|Certain astronomical objects {{known as}} spiral nebulae such as M31 {{would later be}} {{recognized}} as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to these objects began to be discovered, {{and they would be}} deemed island universes. However, the word Universe was later <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> mean the entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the objects instead became known as galaxies.|$|E

5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While {{it is often difficult}} to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement near the top of the list is usually <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|Hoskuld died around 965, leaving Olaf a full mark of gold, causing {{tension between}} Olaf and Hoskuld's {{legitimate}} sons, Bard and Thorleik. As an illegitimate son, Olaf {{was entitled to}} one mark of his father's wealth; this was, however, customarily <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> be a mark of silver and not gold. Olaf eased the tension by paying one-third of the communal funeral feast for Hoskuld.|$|E

5|$|Some B-class bracteates showing three godly {{figures have}} been {{interpreted}} as depicting Baldr's death, {{the best known}} of these is the Fakse bracteate. Two of the figures are <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm.|$|E
5|$|The Mayan {{language}} {{family has}} no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> {{be due to}} diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into Mayan and not to common ancestry. Mesoamerica has been proven to be an area of substantial linguistic diffusion.|$|E

As the Constitution was unclear on the powers of the ministers, the discretion to make crucial decisions and formulate policies was <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> reside in the Governor and the Official Members.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus {{is the same}} as that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath. The Venus symbol also {{represents}} femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> stand for the mirror of the goddess.|$|E

5|$|While the {{religious}} hierarchy mirrored the Empire's administrative divisions, the clergy were more ubiquitous than the emperor's servants. The issue of caesaropapism, while {{usually associated with}} the Byzantine Empire, is now <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> be an oversimplification of actual conditions in the Empire. By the fifth century, the Patriarch of Constantinople was recognized as first among equals of the four eastern Patriarchs and as of equal status with the Pope in Rome.|$|E
5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> {{have been of}} the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly}} referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E
5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> be {{engaging}} in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest fires were <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E
