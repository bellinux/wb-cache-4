40|$|There remains no {{successful}} {{compilation of}} a <b>universal</b> <b>bibliography</b> for systematic biology. Commercial services like Mendeley or Zotero are achieving some traction. However, they are monolithic systems {{under the control}} of single entities, their biodiversity data scattered without easy data aggregation or interchange – why should competitors offer this functionality? The ViBRANT ([URL] project aims to compile a Bibliography of Life, building on the project’s available infrastructure, gathering data from across biodiversity sciences. Evaluating existing platforms, both commercial and scientific, we found none met the needs for a sustainable, <b>universal</b> <b>bibliography,</b> for the following reasons: (1) Too narrowly focused to achieve critical mass in data volume or in user community. (2) Monolithic systems with single points of failure and low perceived sustainability. (3) Too focused on data analysis and research, at the expense of building a reliable base system, hence appearing to be prototypes rather than stable platforms, reducing perceived reliability and sustainability. (4) Integration of data curation with data input, which makes contributing references tedious, thereby alienating potential users. Thus, we built RefBank, following a radically different approach, applying proven principles from other forms of data management. (1) RefBank is an open, coordinator-free network of independent nodes that replicate the data among themselves, eliminating any single point of failure, achieving reliability and sustainability through redundancy. (2) No single entity governs the data; everyone can set up a node to link into the network; the web application can be downloaded from most existing nodes. Replication is pull-based, so no node can actively push erroneous data into the network. (3) Contributing is easy: everyone can upload their bibliographies, be they in BibTeX, EndNote, plain text or many other common formats, without any curation, and without prior registration; ReCAPTCHA protects the upload forms. (4) RefBank uses graph theory to embrace near duplicate references exploiting their inherent redundancy to enable automated reconciliation and curation through data mining techniques. (5) RefBank’s web interface supports manual curation, though manual curation is not required for the system to work; users can correct errors later as they find them when using the reference collection. (6) RefBank provides multiple data export formats, e. g. BibTeX and RIS, and can output references in a variety of common styles, e. g. Chicago or Harvard. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of the water quality {{was done in the}} central valleys of Oaxaca state, finding very high concentrations of calcium, magnesium and carbonate in the waters from of deep wells that are located in the periphery of the river Atoyac, unlike the water that comes from the high parts of Etla valley, where there are maximum hardnesses of 140 ppm, so for the distribution of both effluent to the city of Oaxaca and neighboring municipalities, suggesting a further dilution of the water treatment plant in "Fortin" in the city of Oaxaca, that after determining the Langelier index and other, with software found in the <b>universal</b> <b>bibliography.</b> The results indicate that water from the river Atoyac, have corrosive properties. In laboratory doing tests, the best dilution was 60 to 40 % by volume, of water from Etla Valley and the periphery of the river respectively. Langelier index was converted to a negative, indicating saturation with respect to calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and will tend to dissolve, avoiding the deterioration of the sanitary units...|$|E

Associated encoding rule standards are used to encode data types described in ASN. 1 into transmittable bit sequences. ASN. 1 provides a method for referencing externally defined data types using the ISO/ITU data type registration system. ASN. 1 is employed in the ISO MHEG and Internet SNMP standards.

It is natural, under normal circumstances that librarians should be inclined to suppose that greater orderliness {{in the production of}} bibliographic services would meet the demands of readers especially researchers. This calls for a pattern of effective recording and arrangement which result from systematic listing of the records of human communication. Researches on bibliographic control are essentially descriptive. They involve compilation of a defined set of materials (books, manuscripts, maps, audio-visual materials, serial, etc) so that they may be described, analyzed, classified or codified. Individuals, institutions, nations, and international bodies have made several attempts and great efforts to list all that is written {{on the face of the}} earth. Associations, nations and international organizations have held conferences to explore means of effective bibliographic control. According to Linder (1959 : 105) “from about the middle of the 19 th century to the time of the world war 1, there was a strong resurgences of interest in <b>universal</b> <b>bibliography</b> the universal catalogue or international bibliography”. After the world war 2 (1939 - 1945), Nigeria has made some concerted efforts towards this direction which will be discussed here...|$|E
