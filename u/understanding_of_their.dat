5|$|Reed's father, Charles Reed, was a {{successful}} London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing {{as a vehicle for}} moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre.|$|E
5|$|The Afrasiab {{paintings}} of the 6th to 7th centuries in Samarkand, Uzbekistan offer a rare surviving example of Sogdian art. The paintings, showing scenes of daily life and {{events such as the}} arrival of foreign ambassadors, are located within the ruins of aristocratic homes. It is unclear if any of these palatial residences served as the official palace of the rulers of Samarkand. The oldest surviving Sogdian monumental wall murals date to the 5th century and are located at Panjakent, Tajikistan. In addition to revealing aspects of their social and political lives, Sogdian art has also been instrumental in aiding historians' <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> religious beliefs. For instance, it is clear that Buddhist Sogdians incorporated some of their own Persian deities into their version of the Buddhist Pantheon. At Zhetysu, Sogdian gilded bronze plaques on a Buddhist temple show a pairing of a male and female deity with outstretched hands holding a miniature camel, a common non-Buddhist image similarly found in the {{paintings of}} Samarkand and Panjakent.|$|E

South Dakota's 2008 average public school teacher salary of $36,674, compared to a national average of $52,308, was the lowest in the nation. In 2007 South Dakota passed legislation modeled after Montana's Indian Education for All Act (1999), mandating education about Native American tribal history, culture, and heritage in all the schools, from pre-school through college, in an effort to increase knowledge and appreciation about Indian culture among all residents of the state, as well as to reinforce Indian students' <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own cultures' contributions.|$|E

This qualitative study explored patients' <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> heart attack in order to contribute to the design of effective secondary prevention services. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 patients with myocardial infarction (MI). These data indicate that information received from health professionals encourages patients to view heart attack as an acute event rather than a symptom of a chronic condition and that this understanding provides patients with low motivation for long-term lifestyle change. Patients may benefit from understanding a heart attack as an acute symptom of an underlying disease process which long-term medication and behavioural change can help to check. In order to achieve this, health professionals need to examine patients' <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heart attack and recovery and to provide information about lifestyle which engages with these understandings...|$|R

40|$|Step-fathering is {{becoming}} increasingly common in contemporary western societies, yet it has received little research attention from either social policy or sociological perspectives. In this article, we draw on our empirical studies of step-families in Britain and Sweden to argue that social context is important in shaping step-fathers' <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> position. Policy and legislation in these countries emphasise the importance of ascribed, biological parenthood, marginalising step-parents. There are, however, notable class differences in both our British and Swedish samples concerning whether step-fathers see their relationship to their step-children as the same as biological fathering, supplementary to it, or as disengaged from fathering. The analysis also reveals that policies simultaneously emphasise achieved contemporary involved fathering alongside promoting ascribed biological fatherhood. Such policies contain a contradiction for step- fathers' <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> everyday relationships with their step-children.

40|$|Early {{childhood}} teachers {{spend their}} professional lives in social interactions with children, families and colleagues. Social interactions shape how people understand themselves {{and each other}} through discourses. Teachers in Aotearoa New Zealand negotiate their subjectivities, or self-understandings, within initial teacher education (ITE), professional expectations, education and society. They are shaped by historical and contemporary discourses of early childhood teaching professionalism as they gain status as qualified and registered teachers. Early childhood teachers’ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> personal professional identities influence self-understandings of everyone they encounter professionally, especially young children. This poststructural qualitative collective case study investigates five newly-qualified early childhood teachers’ negotiations <b>of</b> <b>their</b> personal professional identities. My research study is based in postmodern <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> identities as multiple, complex and dynamic, and subjectivities as self-understandings formed within discourses. In contrast, institutionally-directed reflective writing in early childhood ITE can reflect modernist perspectives that assume essentialist, knowable identities. Tensions exist between my postmodern theoretical framework and my data collection strategy of facilitated self-study, an approach that is usually based on the modernist assumption {{that there is a}} self to investigate and know. My participants explored their subjectivities through focus group discussions, individual interviews, and reflective writing, including institutionally-directed reflective writing. Three dominant discourses of early childhood education emerged from data analysis that drew on Foucault’s theoretical ideas: the authority discourse, the relational professionalism discourse and the identity work discourse. Positioned in these discourses, all participants regarded themselves as qualified and knowledgeable, skilled at professional relationships and as reflective practitioners. They actively negotiated tensions between professional expectations and <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> multiple, complex and changing identities. I concluded that these participants negotiated <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> personal professional identities within three dominant discourses through discursive practices of discipline and governmentality, seeking pleasurable subject positions, and agentic negotiation of tensions and contradictions between available subjectivities...|$|R

To explore the extent. to which understandings are common the research worked with diverse' populations. Three groups of different age ranges (school age, professional adults and retired people) and cultural contexts (Mexico, Spain, and the UK) were interviewed. The data set was analysed according to three perspectives: participants' <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> how <b>their</b> practices have changed; critical <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> practices including the contexts in which they take place; and <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own identity as "literate” individuals. The research approach was qualitative drawing on semi-structured interviews and iterative- analysis of the data. 'While some of the findings confirm tendencies already observed in the literature, others, such as a sense of non-alignment with cultures of transparency, the lack of perception of the self as creator of artefacts, or tensions between convenience and critical positions) provoke reflection and contribute to a fuller <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the nature of literacy in a digital world. The key implications of the report's findings for educational' policy and pedagogical practice include the idea that literacy cannot be viewed as a static set of skills. the fact that the evidence presented here. suggests, that there is no clear demarcation between “digital literacy" and "literacy" and the idea that pedagogical practice should take into account the degree of integration of technologies into learners lives.
