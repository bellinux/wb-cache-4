2500|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel greatly affects its machinability. High-carbon steels are {{difficult}} to machine because they are strong and because they may contain carbides that abrade the cutting tool. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum, low-carbon steels are troublesome because they are too soft. Low-carbon steels are [...] "gummy" [...] and stick to the cutting tool, resulting in a built <b>up</b> <b>edge</b> that shortens tool life. Therefore, steel has the best machinability with medium amounts of carbon, about 0.20%.|$|E

50|$|Free {{machining}} steels are {{carbon steels}} that have sulfur, lead, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, or phosphorus added. Sulfur forms the compound manganese sulfide, which {{is soft and}} acts as a chip-breaking discontinuity. It also acts as a dry lubricant to prevent a built <b>up</b> <b>edge</b> on the cutting tool. Lead works {{in a similar way}} to sulfur. Bismuth achieves a free machining steel by melting into a thin film of liquid for a fraction of a microsecond to lubricate the cut. Other advantages to bismuth include: more uniformly distributed because of its similar density to iron; more environmentally friendly, as compared to lead; still weldable.|$|E
