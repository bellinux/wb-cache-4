It was the first episode Jean wrote after returning to The Simpsons writing staff. For three years, Jean had worked with Mike Reiss on the fantasy sitcom Teen Angel, a job which he despised. [...] "Every other day [...] I said 'I wish I was back at The Simpsons," [...] Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. The idea for the episode came from {{a segment of the}} television news magazine 60 Minutes. The segment was about found artists, who, Jean said, [...] "take basically garbage and assemble it and turn it into artwork that would sell {{for tens of thousands of}} dollars." [...] Jean thought that this profession would fit Homer. In the episode, [...] "Start here tomorrow 7/17/95" [...] is written in blue paint on the Simpsons' garage door. The date refers to Scully and Julie Thacker's anniversary, which was on July17,1995. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a hardware store. The segment was inspired by Jean's father, who owned a hardware store that Al Jean <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> as a child. Later in the setpiece, Homer tries to construct a barbecue that he bought from the hardware store. The scene was also conceived by Jean, and is executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully's favorite setpiece.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} an {{idea that}} the gifts of the Spirit can be imparted {{from one person to}} another person based on Romans 1 : 11 and 1 Timothy 4 : 14. The author’s thesis is that such a theology is unbiblical because it does not recog-nize the distinction between the gifts of the Spirit and spiritual gifts, and claims that the gifts of the Spirit can be imparted from one person to another. Also, the doctrine and practice of impartation violates the Reformation’s teaching about the priesthood of all believers because believers are encouraged to rely on people and not on God in order to receive something from God. In this way, particularly gifted individuals in the church are no longer intercessors or ves-sels which God <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the lives of other people, but they are elevated to the position of mediators which actually reflects the Roman Catholic doc-trine about saints and priests as mediators between God and people.

This exercise is called Hoshin. A Hoshin is a continuous improvement process in which all the people involved in the production line take part: operators, line engineers, security department, quality department, excellence system of the company or continuous improvement department et cetera. The Hoshin exercise consists of four parts: - Direct observation of the initial method that the operators are <b>using</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the production line and detection of failures and different types of variability. - Removal of the wastes by implementing improvements. - Establishment of a new standardized work method. - Tracking of the new method after implementing the different improvements. What is intended to achieve with this exercise is a reduction of variability, an improvement of security, quality, flows and ergonomics and a reorganization of the line to make it more adaptable to customer’s demand, improving this way the line’s productivity.

2500|$|Continuous mining {{utilizes}} a Continuous Miner Machine {{with a large}} rotating {{steel drum}} equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a “room and pillar” (also known as “bord and pillar”) systemwhere the mine is divided {{into a series of}} 20-to-30-foot (5–10 m) “rooms” or work areas cut into the coalbedit can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. Conveyors transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut [...] (or a bit more with MSHA permission) (12 meters or roughly 40ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again.

Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the [...] "continuous" [...] label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the learning evaluation process in school, holding to {{the context of}} the discipline of Physics in high school. By analyzing the conceptions of learning assessment in schools, through bibliographic research, this study presents the meanings that the assessment act results in social life and how those are used within the evaluation proposal in schools, explaining different ways of designing and carrying out the evaluation of students. In this way of thinking, looking to the discipline of Physics in high school realities, field research was realized with ten educators from public schools, when they were asked about the proposal for the evaluation that each teacher <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> their discipline in high school classes. As a result, the analysis {{made it clear that the}} concept of evaluation of learning that prevails in Physics classes in high school still is based in a summative perspective, having the grades and quantitative aspects of the main assumptions of the assessment act as the prevalent verification on the evaluation of learning. Thus, the learning assessment inside the context still refers to the idea that evaluation is a finite act that ends when a grade is given to the student, completely disengaged from the learning process. ...|$|R

I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
