Assume the random walk is stopped after j(n) steps. We prove that, under certain restrictions, the random variables (πn(Yj(n) n)) n⩾ 2 on D ⊂ C admit a central limit theorem. This result has an interpretation related to cut-off phenomena of Diaconis for random walks on hypercubes. The proof depends on a limit relation between the spherical functions of <b>U(n)</b> <b>U(n</b> − 1) (i. e., certain Jacobi polynomials in two dimensions) and Laguerre polynomials. This limit relation and a connection between Laguerre polynomials and the moments of bivariate normal distributions then assure that the moments of the distributions under consideration tend to the moments of a bivariate normal distribution. The moment convergence criterion will complete the proof...|$|E
