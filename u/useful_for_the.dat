5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{treatment of a}} number of bacterial infections.

It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1668 when Angulo y Sandoval's predecessor, Juan de Urtarte, wrote a {{memorandum}} to the King of Spain {{stating that the}} San Antonio de la Eminencia castle was unfit for defense. Several years later (and without proper authorization), Angulo y Sandoval began construction of a fortress {{that would be more}} <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defense of the city than the two existing fortifications. The castle underwent several renovations to repair damage caused by severe earthquakes. A 1684 quake severely damaged the castle and another in 1929 left the structure in ruins. The castle was declared a cultural and municipal asset in May 2005.|$|E

However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> industrial production of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Holland Arms' {{functionality}} {{as a staff}} {{station was}} only <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Red Wharf Bay branch, but a signalman was still required for all Amlwch services.

This was of particular advantage in early mornings and evenings, when the only services were on the Amlwch line.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> treatment of seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E

5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study of the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters {{to be used for}} the HDF depended on the 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E
5|$|Portable organs (the portative and the {{positive}} organ) were invented in the Middle Ages.

Its portability made the portative <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> accompaniment of both sacred and secular music in a variety of settings.|$|E
5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as vitamin B6, {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E
5|$|The first Brahmousin cattle were {{produced}} from a multiple embryo transfer from a French-imported Limousin dam. The resulting progeny were then crossed with Brahman cattle {{to achieve an}} F1 hybrid.

The American Brahmousin Council allows animals that are not purebred to be recorded as percentage animals as long as they are at least one-quarter Limousin and one-quarter Brahman. In order to be recorded as a purebred Brahmousin, the animal must then be sired by a registered purebred or fullblood Limousin bull, registered Brahman bull or a registered purebred Brahmousin bull.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} or durability of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manufacture of artefacts such as tools, machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, locks, furniture, ships, planes, coinage and jewellery. They are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not heavy metals. Gold, silver, and platinum are used in jewellery as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost jewellery and children's toys may be made, to a significant degree, of heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, or lead.|$|E
