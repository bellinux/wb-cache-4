5|$|Though Khrushchev's {{strategy}} {{failed to}} achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal {{of the western world}} to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed the Helsinki Agreement with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The islands were ceded by Spain to the United States as {{a result}} of the latter's victory in the Spanish–American War. A {{compensation}} of US$20million was paid to Spain according to the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris. As it became increasingly clear the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> recognize the nascent First Philippine Republic, the Philippine–American War broke out, the First Republic was defeated, and the archipelago was administered under an Insular Government. The war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians, mostly from a cholera epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{original}} agreement, the USAF paid {{the cost of}} maintenance for the missiles for five years. After this costs would fall on the United Kingdom, which {{would have to take}} over their logistic support. With ICBMs becoming available, the Americans did not foresee the Thor missiles making a substantial contribution to the western nuclear deterrent after 1965. On 1 May 1962, the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, informed the Minister of Defence, Harold Watkinson, that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> provide support for Thor after 31 October 1964. Watkinson then informed him that the system would be phased out. An Air Council meeting on 31 May 1962 decided that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. A public announcement was made on 1 August 1962. McNamara's decision on 7 November 1962 to cancel Skybolt—approved by President John F. Kennedy on 23 November—left the RAF without a successor to Thor. The British government negotiated the Nassau Agreement to buy Polaris. The future of the British nuclear deterrent now lay with the Royal Navy. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Philip Pullman remarked at the British Humanist Association {{annual conference}} {{that due to}} the first film's disappointing sales in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> there <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be any sequels made.|$|R

50|$|Resolution 733 urged {{all parties}} to {{guarantee}} the safety of all humanitarian personnel in Somalia and urged all Member States {{to contribute to the}} aid effort. The resolution did not include proposals for a peacekeeping force as some Member States were reluctant on financial grounds, and also others, such as the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>stated</b> they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> intervene at this stage as there was no invitation from the main host parties.|$|R
5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns {{about the possibility of a}} catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E

50|$|An {{earlier version}} of the No Budget, No Pay Act (unrelated to the debt ceiling) was {{originally}} introduced in early 2012 by Jim Cooper, a Democratic congressman from Tennessee. It stipulated that congressmen in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Congress <b>would</b> <b>not</b> get paid unless they passed a budget by October 1, 2012.|$|R
25|$|Filipinos {{initially}} {{saw their}} relationship with the United States as that of two nations joined in a common struggle against Spain. However, the United States later distanced itself from the interests of the Filipino insurgents. Emilio Aguinaldo was unhappy that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> commit to paper a statement of support for Philippine independence. Relations deteriorated and tensions heightened as {{it became clear that the}} Americans were in the islands to stay.|$|E
25|$|McKinley's {{election}} {{victory in}} 1900 was demoralizing for the insurgents, and convinced many Filipinos that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> depart precipitously. This, {{coupled with a}} series of devastating losses on the battlefield against American forces equipped with superior technology and training, convinced Aguinaldo that he needed to change his approach. Beginning on September 14, 1899, Aguinaldo accepted the advice of General Gregorio del Pilar and authorized the use of guerilla warfare tactics in subsequent military operations in Bulacan.|$|E

The {{most memorable}} was the 1957 event at Lindrick where Britain scored a decisive 7½4½ victory {{to break the}} United States' stranglehold on the trophy they had held since 1933. Having regained the Ryder Cup in 1959, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{relinquish}} it again until 1985, by which time the British team had been expanded to include the rest of Europe.|$|E

25|$|The Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) {{system was}} first {{introduced}} by President George H.W. Bush in 1991. This system was created to adjust and repurpose former President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The GPALS system was introduced {{at a time when}} the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States was becoming less hostile. One of the core ideas behind the GPALS system was that the Soviet Union would not always be assumed as the aggressor and the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> always be assumed as the target.|$|E
25|$|He enlisted {{into the}} National Guard {{while still in}} high school and then in 1940 joined the United States Army Air Corps. When he thought that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{participate}} in World War II he deserted and went to Canada with a friend where they joined the military and were sent to London. The U.S. did enter the war {{and by the time he}} made it to Europe they were in the fight so he transferred to the U.S. Army. While serving with the Army in World War II, he received a Silver Star for driving a burning ammunition truck away from a group of soldiers, before it exploded.|$|E
25|$|The coup d'état was {{designed}} by a military revolutionary council including ARVN generals led by General Dương Văn Minh. Lucien Conein, a CIA operative, had become a liaison between the US Embassy and the generals, who were led by Trần Văn Đôn. They met {{each other for the}} first time on 2 October 1963 at Tân Sơn Nhất airport. Three days later, Conein met with General Dương Văn Minh to discuss the coup and the stance of the US towards it. Conein then delivered the White House's message of American non-intervention, which was reiterated by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. the US ambassador, who gave secret assurances to the generals that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> interfere.|$|E

25|$|At a White House Meeting on April 1, 1964 Secretary of State Dean Rusk {{claimed that}} the Ambassador to Brazil, Lincoln Gordon was not advising that the United States should support Brazil at the time. Despite the proclamation, {{the two men had}} {{previously}} agreed to provide Brazil support. Instead this declaration was intended to signal that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> overtly support Brazil. This was {{due to the fact that}} Rusk was concerned that if the United States intervened in Brazil, that would provide Goulart with a reason to become opposed to the United States. However the rebel residents of Sao Paulo - referred to as the Paulistas - had asked the United States for aid, but had not requested specific items or funds.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 1963, Diệm and Nhu were {{assassinated in}} a coup d'état led by General Dương Văn Minh (Armed Forces Council) with the {{understanding}} that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> intervene. At the time of the assassinations, Madame Nhu was in Beverly Hills, California, traveling with her 18-year-old daughter, Ngô Đình Lệ Thủy. Her other children were in Vietnam at the family retreat in Đà Lạt and she feared that they would meet the same fate as their father. The children were not harmed by the generals and were flown out of the country into exile in Rome, where they were placed in the custody of their uncle, Archbishop Thục. Madame Nhu later flew to Rome to join them.|$|E
25|$|Most {{observers}} expected Chiang's {{government to}} eventually {{fall to the}} imminent invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, and the US was initially reluctant in offering full support for Chiang in their final stand. US President Harry S. Truman announced on 5 January 1950 that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> engage in any dispute involving the Taiwan Strait, {{and that he would}} not intervene {{in the event of an}} attack by the PRC. The situation quickly changed after the onset of the Korean War in June 1950. This led to changing political climate in the US, and President Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet to sail to the Taiwan Strait as part of the containment policy against potential Communist advance.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, {{defeating}} the Republic of China's military forces and establishing Manchukuo, a puppet state. The Hoover administration deplored the invasion, but {{also sought to}} avoid antagonizing the Japanese, fearing that taking too strong a stand would weaken the moderate forces in the Japanese government. In response to the Japanese invasion, Hoover and Secretary of State Henry Stimson outlined the Stimson Doctrine, which held that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> recognize territories gained by force. The Hoover administration based this declaration on the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, in which several nations (including Japan and the United States) renounced war and promised to peacefully solve disputes. In the aftermath of invasion of Manchuria, Stimson {{and other members of}} the Cabinet came to believe that war with Japan might be inevitable, though Hoover continued to push for disarmament among the world powers.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, the {{bilateral}} statement {{proposed by the}} British became a unilateral declaration by the United States. While Monroe thought that Spain was unlikely to re-establish its colonial empire on its own, he feared that France or the Holy Alliance might seek to establish control over the former Spanish possessions. On December 2, 1823, in his annual message to Congress, Monroe articulated {{what became known as}} the Monroe Doctrine. He first reiterated the traditional U.S. policy of neutrality with regard to European wars and conflicts. He then declared that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> accept the recolonization of any country by its former European master, though he also avowed non-interference with existing European colonies in the Americas. Finally, he stated that European countries should no longer consider the Western Hemisphere open to new colonization, a jab aimed primarily at Russia, which was attempting to expand its colony on the northern Pacific Coast.|$|E
25|$|A naval battle {{erupted in}} January 1962 when four Indonesian torpedo boats were intercepted by Dutch ships and planes {{off the coast}} of Vlakke Hoek. One Indonesian boat was sunk, killing the Naval Deputy Chief-of-Staff Commodore Jos Sudarso. Meanwhile, the Kennedy Administration worried of a {{continuing}} Indonesian shift towards communism should the Dutch hold on to West Irian/West Papua. In February 1962 US Attorney General Robert Kennedy travelled to the Netherlands and informed the government that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> support the Netherlands in an armed conflict with Indonesia. With Soviet armaments and advisors, Sukarno planned a large-scale air- and seaborne invasion of the Dutch military headquarters of Biak for August 1962, called Operasi Djajawidjaja. It was to be led by Major-General Suharto, the future President of Indonesia. Before these plans could be realised, Indonesia and Netherlands signed the New York Agreement in August 1962. The two countries agreed to implement the Bunker Plan (formulated by American diplomat Ellsworth Bunker), whereby the Dutch agreed to hand over West Irian/West Papua to UNTEA on 1 October 1962. UNTEA transferred the territory to Indonesian authority in May 1963.|$|E
