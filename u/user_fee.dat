The new agency's plans to expand usage at the airport to erase its deficit, awoke a long-simmering disagreement between community groups and Toronto politicians wishing to close the airport and the business community which supported the expansion of its usage. The TPA welcomed a new regional airline Porter Airlines and started construction of a bridge to the airport in 2003. The bridge to the airport became a mayoral election issue and the City of Toronto forced its cancellation. Despite the opposition, the TPA bought new passenger ferries and built new facilities for passengers. For its part, Porter built a new passenger terminal. Increases in flights and a new passenger <b>user</b> <b>fee</b> imposed by the TPA led to the airport becoming self-sufficient by 2010. In 2012, the TPA began a project to link the airport to Toronto with a pedestrian tunnel, funded by the passenger <b>user</b> <b>fee,</b> which is intended to facilitate a further increase in flights. In 2013, Porter proposed to expand the airport to fly jets from the airport, but this was cancelled in 2015.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>User</b> <b>fees</b> have {{generally}} {{fallen out of}} favor across Africa, {{and they have been}} associated with reductions in access to healthcare. We examined the effects of the introduction and removal of <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> on outpatient attendances and new diagnoses of HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis in Neno District, Malawi where <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> were re-instated at three of 13 health centres in 2013 and subsequently removed at one of these in 2015.

Secondly, we estimated a linear model of the effect of <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> on the outcome of interest that controlled for unobserved health centre effects, monthly effects, and a linear time trend. Results The introduction of <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> was associated with a change in total attendances of − 68  % [95  % CI: − 89  %, − 12  %], similar reductions were observed for new malaria and HIV diagnoses. The removal of <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> was associated with an increase in total attendances of 352  % [213  %, 554  %] with similar increases for malaria diagnoses. The results were not sensitive to control group or model specification.

In {{response}} to the subsidy cut {{and a decline in}} annual traffic, the Harbour Commission board faced with what it saw as only two options: expand or close the airport, chose to expand the airport. In November 1989, the Harbor Commission voted to build a temporary passenger terminal and allow access to four more airlines at the airport: Air Ontario, Simo Air, Intair and Canadian Partner. The Commission planned to increase flights by 120 per day and increase the number of passengers by 500,000. It would also impose a $1.50 per <b>user</b> <b>fee</b> on the carriers to fund the improvements and cover the operating deficit. Toronto City Council voted to approve the expansion, but wanted a 90-flight per day limit. Air Ontario's president William Deluce announced it would start 14 flights a day between the island, Montreal and Ottawa. While the expansion had the approval of the harbour commission and city council, it awoke opposition to the airport from the Toronto Island Residents Association, who felt that there would be too many flights, leading to noise and air pollution and it would contravene the 1983 operating agreement.|$|E

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} for {{the award}} {{of the degree}} of Masters in Business Administration Health Care Management (MBA-HCM) Objectives: The study sought to document the experiences of providers and beneficiaries regarding access to essential medicines following introduction of <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> in the pediatric unit of a public hospital. Methodology: The study is qualitative. Data was collected using purposive sampling for facility managers and convenient sampling for caretakers. Only caretakers who consented were interviewed. Data were collected using in-depth interview guides as the main tool. A pilot study was conducted to assess the reliability of the study tool. The data was analysed guided by predetermined themes. Results: The introduction of the <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> for pediatric medicines under a devolved governance system was to supplement the allocations given by the national government. The <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> seemed to have increased revenue for buying more drugs and non-pharmaceutical items and to subsidize prices for medications that were previously not available due to little resources. The management indicated that there was increased availability of drugs due to the higher allocation of resources and that more drugs had been procured to meet patient needs. Immediately after introduction of <b>user</b> <b>fees,</b> there was a drop in utilization, but with time there was an increase in uptake due to increased availability of drugs. There is need for the management of hospital to ensure that there are enough health workers in the hospital {{to meet the needs of}} increasing number of patients utilizing pediatric services after introduction of <b>user</b> <b>fees.</b> Conclusion:Although the <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> seemed to have improved access to pediatric services, there is always need for caution as <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> are known to be an important barrier to use of health services especially by low-income groups. Importantly, implementation of <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> should go hand-in-hand with improved services...|$|R

The main argument against <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> is based on the possible regressive impact on utilisation of health services. This debate can be meaningfully analysed in terms of the welfare implications of <b>user</b> <b>fees,</b> using a framework of utility maximisation and estimating demand functions for health care. The study uses the 1994 – 95 NCAERHDI data on rural India to explore the possible effects of an increase in <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> on demand for health care. A system of equations using both nested and non-nested multinomial logit framework was estimated, and arc price elasticities were calculated. The estimates revealed very low values of these elasticities in the government sector as well as for private qualified providers. Also, the elasticities were income-sensitive, indicating that the poor are more price-sensitive; and that there may be some scope to levy <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> in the government as well as private sector facilities.
