5|$|Beginning {{with the}} First Aliyah in 1881, Jews began immigrating {{to the area}} from Eastern Europe in larger numbers, {{particularly}} from Poland and Russia. These Zionist pioneers were motivated both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles they had grown <b>up</b> <b>with,</b> <b>and</b> adapt by using local produce, especially vegetables such as zucchini, peppers, eggplant, artichoke and chickpeas. The first Hebrew cookbook, written by Erna Meyer, and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO), exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking. The bread, olives, cheese and raw vegetables they adopted {{became the basis for}} the kibbutz breakfast, which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels, and in various forms in most Israeli homes today.|$|E
5|$|Franciscan Andrés de Avendaño left Mérida on 13 December 1695, {{and arrived}} in Nojpetén around 14 January 1696; he {{followed}} the new road {{as far as possible}} then continued towards Nojpetén with local Maya guides. He was accompanied by friars Antonio Pérez de San Román, Joseph de Jesús María and Diego de Echevarría, and by lay brother Lucas de San Francisco; some of these he collected on his journey south along the Camino Real. On 5 January they caught <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> passed the main contingent of the army at B'atkab', continuing to Chuntuki. From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past the source of the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins, which was recorded as Tanxulukmul by Avendaño. From Tanxulukmul they followed the small Acté River to a Chak'an Itza town called Saklemakal. They arrived at the western end of Lake Petén Itzá to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza.|$|E

25|$|The {{diversion}} of heavier bombers to the Balkans {{meant that the}} crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly.

Wang's engineers came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> (<b>and</b> later patented) a rather devious instruction-prefetch monitor that managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty.|$|E

Succès was armed with six guns and had a crew of 48 men under the command of Francois Matthieu Blondin. She was six days out of Boulogne and the interrupted capture was her first prize.

25|$|The second main event, {{and last}} match {{of the evening}} was a Domo De La Muerte cage match where the last man in the ring {{would be forced to}} have his hair shaved off.

La Legión Extranjera came to the ring next, scheduled to compete were AAA Mega Champion El Mesías, Abismo Negro and El Zorro. Before the match began El Mesías announced that he was injured and that La Legión had brought someone in to replace him in the match and then introduced the returning Electroshock as his replacement. El Zorro was the first to escape the cage, followed by Cibernético less than a minute later. Following Cibernético's escape El Zorro climbed back inside the cage to give his side a three on two advantage against Intocable and Chessman. With the numbers to their advantage La Legión were able to be so dominant that both Electroshock and Abismo Negro were able to escape pretty close together. Intocable escaped next as Zorro was fighting with Chessman. After 18 minutes of action El Zorro managed to climb up the cage and out, leaving Chessman the last man in the ring. After the match Chessman had his hair shaved off {{in the middle of the}} ring.|$|E
25|$|Jews {{have long}} {{considered}} The Land of Israel {{to be their}} homeland, even while living in the diaspora. According to the Hebrew Bible the connection to the Land of Israel began in the covenant of the pieces when the region, which it called the land of Canaan, was promised to Abraham by God. Abraham settled in the region, where his son Isaac and grandson Jacob grew <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> their families. Later on, Jacob and his sons went to Egypt. Decades later their descendants were led out of Egypt by Moses and Aaron, given the Tablets of Stone, returned {{to the land of}} Canaan and conquered it under the leadership of Joshua. After the period of the judges, in which the Israelites did not have an organized leadership, the Kingdom of Israel was established, which constructed the first temple. This kingdom was soon split into two—the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel. After the destruction of these kingdoms and the destruction of the first Temple, the Israelites were exiled to Babylon. After about 70 years parts of the Israelites were permitted to return to the region and soon thereafter they built the Second Temple. Later on they established the Hasmonean Kingdom. The region was conquered by the Roman Empire in 63 BC. During the 2nd century CE a series of rebellions against the Roman Empire ended up with the destruction of the second temple and a general expulsion of Jews from their homeland.|$|E
