60|$|It was {{not easy}} to recover this shock and make the visit unrestrained, even though Fanny had not been, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the least trifle in the way. In such further {{communication}} as passed among them before the sisters took their departure, Little Dorrit fancied it was revealed to her that Mr Gowan treated his wife, even in his very fondness, too much like a beautiful child. He seemed so unsuspicious of the depths of feeling which she knew must lie below that surface, that she doubted if there could be any such depths in himself. She wondered whether his want of earnestness might be the natural result of his want of such qualities, and whether it was with people as with ships, that, in too shallow and rocky waters, their anchors had no hold, and they drifted anywhere.|$|E

He knew that it was Miss Shirley, and he inferred that she had been in the castle directing the farm--hands building it, and now, being caught by the premature arrival of the contesting forces, had fled before them and left her subordinates to finish the work. He felt, with a throe of helpless sympathy, that she was undertaking too much. It was hazardous enough to attempt the practice of her novel profession <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> but to keep herself in abeyance so far as not to be known at all in it, and, at the same time, to give way to her interest in it to the extent of coming out, with her infirmly established health, into that wintry weather, and superintending the preparations for the first folly she had planned, was a risk altogether too great for her.|$|E

UConn's Bria Hartley had her best game of the year, following early season injuries and a slow return, but scored 19 points in the first half, and ended up with 21 points. The final score in favor of the Huskies was 97-25, the fewest points allowed by Connecticut so far this season.|$|E
50|$|Overall product {{improvement}} {{in the areas of}} survivability, RAM, and armament. This includes increased armor, redesigned (safer) internal storage arrangement for ammunition and equipment, engine and suspension upgrades, and {{product improvement}} of the M284 cannon and M182A1 mount. The greatest difference is the integration of an inertial navigation system, sensors detecting the weapons' lay, automation, and an encrypted digital communication system, which utilizes computer controlled frequency hopping to avoid enemy electronic warfare and allow the howitzer to send grid location and altitude to the battery fire direction center (FDC). The battery FDCs in turn coordinate fires through a battalion or higher FDC. This allows the Paladin to halt from the move and fire within 30 seconds with an accuracy equivalent to the previous models when properly emplaced, laid, and safed—a process that required several minutes <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Tactically, this improves the system's survivability by allowing the battery to operate dispersed by pairs across the countryside and allowing the howitzer to quickly displace between salvos, or if attacked by indirect fire, aircraft, or ground forces.|$|E
50|$|The {{storage heater}} can only heat {{with the energy}} stored the night before. Thus if the system was {{switched}} off or if the charge control was set too low, {{there may not be}} sufficient energy to heat the rooms, and this can only be corrected for the next day. This is a problem for example when the weather turns cold unexpectedly, or when returning from a vacation late at night, or users simply not thinking to change the settings because they are at a comfortable temperature. Some heaters alleviate this problem by also allowing heating during the day, but this is typically expensive (because the electricity is charged at full rate). Even <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> {{it can be difficult to}} accurately judge how to set the thermostats as setting them too low overnight can cause the heater to be having no perceived effect while setting them at maximum will increase the cost of running them. Similarly in systems where every heater must be set individually, incorrectly setting one room's heater can make the whole house feel too cold.|$|E

Second, even when the repellent has been shown to work, animals in dire need of food will [...] "hold their nose" [...] and eat anyway because the alternative is essentially death by starvation. Repellents are most successful (referring to products actually demonstrated by peer-reviewed research to be effective) when animals have access to alternative food sources in a different location.|$|R
