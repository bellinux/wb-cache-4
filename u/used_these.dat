5|$|Although some Japanese {{soldiers}} were taken prisoner, most fought {{until they were}} killed or committed suicide. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of Iwo Jima were killed. Of the 117,000 Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April–June 1945, 94% were killed. American military leaders <b>used</b> <b>these</b> figures to estimate high casualties among American soldiers in the planned invasion of Japan.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} models for {{simulation}} of Boolean circuits by Networks of Evolutionary Processors with Splicing Rules and Permitting/Forbidding Context. We first show how to simulate basic 2 -input logical gates namely AND, OR and XOR gate <b>using</b> <b>these</b> models. We then show how to simulate multiple input AND and OR gate <b>using</b> <b>these</b> models. Since, combination of AND, OR and XOR gate is universal, we can thus simulate any Boolean circuits <b>using</b> <b>these</b> models...|$|R

When the two met in Washington, D.C. several months later, Bonneville opted to sell his maps and rough notes to Irving for $1,000.

5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were commonly <b>used.</b> <b>These</b> were good at releasing the {{part from the}} dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on the mold cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants.|$|E
5|$|In the Springtime of the Peoples {{during the}} Revolutions of 1848, revolutionaries {{took to the}} streets, many flying the tricolour. Liberals took power and, after {{prolonged}} deliberation, a national assembly was formulated. This Frankfurt Parliament declared the black-red-gold as the official colours of Germany and passed a law stating its civil ensign was the black-red-yellow tricolour. Also, a naval war ensign <b>used</b> <b>these</b> colours.|$|E

5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to the Moon {{was due to the}} {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making <b>used</b> <b>these</b> molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E

Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E
