This paper proposes a distributed flow rate control algorithm to optimize multimedia data transmission of the networked agent system with the coexisting various coding rates. In this proposed algorithm, transmission path and upload bandwidth of different coding rate data between source node, fixed and mobile nodes are appropriately arranged and controlled.

30|$|We {{proposed}} a new channel hopping scheme to mitigate jamming {{attacks in the}} wireless LAN environment. The proposed scheme does not require an exchange of secret keys between the AP and <b>user</b> <b>node</b> prior to a jamming attack. This {{makes it harder for}} the attacker to guess the next channel number under our proposed scheme. The next channel is determined using the previous channel number and a combination of transmission power and received signal strength between the AP and <b>user</b> <b>node.</b> Since the next channel number generation scheme is designed to exploit the path loss symmetry between the AP and a <b>user</b> <b>node,</b> they are likely to switch to the same next channel as long as they stayed on the same channel previously. In case of an attack, even though the attacker finds the current busy channel number, it cannot easily predict the next channel because the path loss information between the AP and <b>user</b> <b>node</b> is not available. The effect of the proposed channel selection scheme on throughput was investigated analytically, and the experiment results show that meaningful throughput can be achieved with the proposed scheme {{in the presence of a}} jammer, compared to nearly zero throughput of the random channel selection scheme.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Bidirectional relaying, where a relay helps two <b>user</b> <b>nodes</b> to {{exchange}} messages {{has been an}} active area of recent research. In the compute-and-forward strategy for bidirectional relaying, the relay computes {{a function of the}} two messages using the naturally-occurring sum of symbols simultaneously transmitted by <b>user</b> <b>nodes</b> in a Gaussian Multiple Access Channel (MAC), and the computed function value is forwarded to the <b>user</b> <b>nodes</b> in an ensuing broadcast phase. In this work, we consider the Gaussian MAC in bidirectional relaying with the messages taking values in a finite Abelian group and the relay computing the sum within the group under an additional secrecy constraint for protection against a honest but curious relay. The secrecy constraint is that, while the relay should decode the group sum, the individual message of each user should be perfectly secure from the relay. We exploit the symbol addition that occurs in a Gaussian MAC to design explicit modulations at the <b>user</b> <b>nodes</b> that achieve independence between the received symbols at the relay and each of the two individual transmitted messages under an average transmit power constraint. We provide a lattice coding strategy for reliable computation of the group sum at the relay with perfect secrecy, and study rate versus average power trade-offs in the large-dimension regime. Our results for secure compute-and-forward are significant because we achieve perfect security with finite average transmit power, and this has been done using a novel approach involving Fourier-analytic tools.

A popular strategy involves a modified Gaussian MAC, where the relay decodes the XOR of the two messages using the naturally-occurring sum of symbols simultaneously transmitted by <b>user</b> <b>nodes.</b> In this work, we consider the Gaussian MAC in bidirectional relaying with an additional secrecy constraint for protection against a honest but curious relay. The constraint is that, while the relay should decode the XOR, it should be fully ignorant of the individual messages of the users. We exploit the symbol addition that occurs in a Gaussian MAC to design explicit strategies that achieve perfect independence between the received symbols and individual transmitted messages. Our results actually hold for a more general scenario where the messages at the two <b>user</b> <b>nodes</b> come from a finite Abelian group G, and the relay must decode the sum within G of the two messages.

Ensuring cooperation between network nodes may be a tough task due to the misbehavior of network nodes. Nodes may diverge from the protocol to save their own data and resources. Then, nodes may also diverge from the protocol and be unwilling to cooperate due to a selfish behavior. Selfish nodes may belong to individual <b>users</b> (<b>nodes)</b> that are not interested to share their own resources to forward messages from other <b>users</b> (<b>nodes).</b> In both conditions, this selfish behavior severely affects the overall network performance [7].|$|R

With multi-antenna setting on the <b>user</b> <b>nodes,</b> some of the usual signal processing tasks are shifted from the relay <b>nodes</b> to the <b>user</b> <b>nodes</b> with the proposed transceiver beamforming designs. The transmit beamforming vectors, distributed relay coefficients and the receive beamforming vectors are obtained by iteratively solving three sub-problems, each having a closed-form solution. The tasks of maximizing desired signal power, and reducing inter-pair interference (IPI) and noise are thus allocated to different iteration steps. By this arrangement, the transmit and receive beamformers of each user are responsible for improving its own performance and the distributed relay nodes with simple amplify-and-forward protocol aim at creating a comfortable communication environment for all user pairs. With respect to the channel uncertainty, two relay strategies are proposed considering two different requirements from the communication network: sum relay output power and individual relay output power.
