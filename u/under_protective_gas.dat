40|$|AbstractThe {{difficulty}} in fabricating the large size or complex shape limits {{the application of}} ZrB 2 –SiC composites. Joining them by fusion welding without or with preheating, controlled cooling <b>under</b> <b>protective</b> <b>gas</b> shield leads to thermal shock failure or porosity at the weld interface. In the present work, a filler material of (ZrB 2 –SiC–B 4 C–YAG) composite with oxidation resistance and thermal shock resistance was produced {{in the form of}} welding wire. Using the filler, gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) was performed without employing preheating, post controlled cooling and extraneous protective gas shield to join hot pressed ZrB 2 –SiC (ZS), and pressureless sintered ZrB 2 –SiC–B 4 C–YAG (ZSBY) composites to themselves. The fusion welding resulted in cracking and non-uniform joining without any filler material. The weld interfaces of the composites were very clean and coherent. The Vickers micro-hardness across the weld interface was found to increase due to the increase in the volume % of both SiC and B 4 C in the filler material. The shear strength of the weld was about 50 % of the flextural strength of the parent composite...|$|E
40|$|The copper {{containing}} ferritic steels used in {{pressurized water}} reactors (PWR) and boiling water reactors (BWR) are {{know to be}} prone to hardening and embrittlement by thermal ageing. Preliminary investigations concluded that the changes in mechanical properties are caused by copper-precipitation. Small (2 - 3 mm diameter) and coherent copper precipitates cause an increase of hardness and brittleness. For a better understanding of these phenomena, 10 Fe-Cu model alloys with Cu content between 0. 65 and 2. 1 wt. % were manufactured and investigated. The samples were prepared from pure (99. 8) Fe-rods and pure (99. 9) Cu-chips. Fe und proportional Cu were molten together in an electric arc furnace <b>under</b> <b>protective</b> <b>gas</b> (Ar, 700 mbar) in rods casting mould. After melting, these rods were annealed at 1000 °C for 4 hours, quenched in water and cold-rolled (= 20 %). In order to get Fe-Cu-alloys containing small and coherent copper precipitates, the specimens were solution treated at 1000 °C for 2 hours, quenched in water and thermally aged at 550 °C. These 9 samples were characterized by Vickers hardness (HV 10) and electromagnetic methods, and their dependence on the Cu content was investigated. It was observed that the Vickers hardness increases with rising Cu content. Hysteresis measurements showed that the values of coercivity increase with growing Cu content. The coercivity and the Vickers hardness exhibit a similar behaviour with respect to Cu content. Eddy current measurements show that secondary induced voltage is dependent on the Cu content. Using a measurement system for Barkhausen noise and field upper harmonics analysis, the hardness was determined non-destructively. The Vickers hardness and the non-destructively determined hardness correlate well and increase with rising Cu content. Barkhausen noise measurements show that the mean Barkhausen noise amplitude and the width of the Barkhausen noise profile curve at the 25 % and 50 % of the maximum amplitude decrease with Cu content...|$|E

40|$|Comet nucleus sample return {{mission and}} other return {{missions}} from planets and satellites need equipment for handling {{and analysis of}} icy samples at low temperatures <b>under</b> vacuum or <b>protective</b> <b>gas.</b> Two methods are reported which were developed for analysis of small icy samples and which are modified for larger samples in cometary matter simulation experiments (KOSI). A conventional optical cryostat system was modified to allow for transport of samples at 5 K, ion beam irradiation, and measurement in an off-line optical spectrophotometer. The new system consists of a removable window plug containing nozzles for condensation of water and volatiles onto a cold finger. This plug can be removed in a vacuum system, changed against another plug (e. g., with other windows (IR, VIS, VUV) or other nozzles). While open, the samples can be treated under vacuum with cooling by manipulators (cut, removal, sample taking, irradiation with light, photons, or ions). After bringing the plug back, the samples can be moved to another site of analysis. For handling the 30 cm diameter mineral-ice samples from the KOSI experiments an 80 x 80 x 80 cm glove box made out of plexiglass was used. The samples were kept in a liquid nitrogen bath, which was filled from the outside. A stream a dry N 2 and evaporating gas from the bath purified the glove box from impurity gases and, in particular, H 2 O, which otherwise would condense onto the samples...|$|R

40|$|In an {{inertial}} {{fusion energy}} (IFE) power plant, each fusion micro-explosion (~ 10 Hz) causes thermal and structural loads on the IFE reactor wall and driver optics. The loading {{on the wall}} must remain sufficiently low to ensure that economic and safety constraints are met. One proposed method for decreasing {{the intensity of the}} wall loading is to fill the reaction chamber with a gas, such as Xe, at low density. The gas will absorb much of the radiation and ion energy from the fusion event, and then slowly release it to the chamber wall. Unfortunately the <b>protective</b> <b>gas</b> introduces major heat loads on the direct drive target. The thermal loading of a target, during injection, largely determines the viability of that target upon reaching chamber center. Thus, the density of the gas must be carefully selected to ensure that a target will survive injection.

40|$|The {{ability of}} some {{hydrides}} to reversibly absorb hydrogen {{under the right}} conditions makes them potential candidates for hydrogen storage, while the change in electrical or optical properties during the metal-insulator transition {{can be used to}} realize devices of technological interests such as two-dimensional hydrogen diffusion indicators and smart windows. This thesis focuses primarily on the investigation of metal hydrides based on magnesium and palladium, in the form of both nanopowders and thin films. In general, samples prepared in the form of nanopowders were intended for hydrogen storage applications, while samples prepared in the form of thin film were intended for switchable mirror applications. Nanopowder samples were synthesized by ball milling, while the thin films were prepared by physical vapor deposition techniques such as pulsed laser deposition and thermal evaporation. The desorption capacity, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Ti- and Ni/Ti-catalyzed Mg hydrides were investigated using Sieverts-type apparatus and differential scanning calorimetry. Based on analysis of the van’t Hoff equation and the Kissinger equation, the addition of Ti and Ni as catalysts has been found to {{play a key role in}} improving the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of magnesium hydride by decreasing the desorption temperature and the activation energy. A combination of Ti and Ni is a more effective catalyst than either Ti or Ni alone, suggesting the existence of a synergetic effect. We propose and demonstrate a simple but effective real-time optical method to determine the Tdes and kinetics of freshly fabricated magnesium nanowires inside a transparent quartz tube, while it is still <b>under</b> the <b>protective</b> <b>gas</b> environment. The proposed characterization technique based on optical reflection requires only milligrams of sample and helps to eliminate the common problem of oxidation associated with removal and transport of the freshly fabricated nanostructures into an inert protective environment. This optical technique could be applied to any hydrogen storage material in powder form which shows a significant difference in its optical absorption between the hydride and the non-hydride phase. A three-color, 8 -bit, 240 × 320 pixel imager was used to acquire the optical signals, and the image processing was peformed in MATLAB®. Magnesium films of various thicknesses were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and capped with a palladium protective layer. The change in the kinetics as a function of film thickness was measured. Raman spectroscopy on the 11 nm magnesium hydride film reveals a small but detectable peak arising from the Eg phonon mode. The Raman frequencies of bulk magnesium hydride predicted by CASTEP calculations are included for comparison. We propose and demonstrate a multi-stacked structure intended for low-nanometer ultrathin films of various metal hydrides, which would enable them to simultaneously achieve an enhanced optical contrast equivalent to that of thicker films, yet be able to retain much of the rapid switching kinetics characteristic of low-nanometer ultrathin films. Such improvement in the performance will help to further extend the scope of applications, particularly in the area of dynamic switchable mirrors, where switching speed and high switching contrast are crucial. Future work will also be based on resonant photodesorption of hydrogen, as well as surface plasmon nanophotonics, both of which are aimed at improving the efficiency of hydrogen desorption of promising hydrides such as MgH 2 or LiBH 4...|$|R
