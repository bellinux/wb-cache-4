5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was <b>understated</b> deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E
5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} <b>understated</b> mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology. Lindow further states that it may be easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.|$|E

5|$|The {{book has}} been reprinted many times, in at least 16 English {{versions}} and in Spanish, Chinese and German editions. While some critics consider Newby's Love and War in the Apennines a better book, A Short Walk was the book that made him well-known, and critics {{agree that it is}} both <b>understated</b> and very funny in an old-school British way.|$|E
5|$|A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush is a 1958 book by the English travel writer Eric Newby. It is an autobiographical {{account of}} his adventures in the Hindu Kush, around the Nuristan {{mountains}} of Afghanistan, ostensibly {{to make the first}} mountaineering ascent of Mir Samir. It {{has been described as a}} comic masterpiece, intensely English, and <b>understated.</b> Publications including The Guardian and The Telegraph list it among the greatest travel books of all time. It has sold over 500,000 copies in paperback.|$|E
5|$|By Vegas standards, the 75-seat {{restaurant}} is small, and the decor is <b>understated,</b> keeping {{the focus on}} the food. No flowers are allowed nor are the staff permitted to wear perfumes to eliminate competition with the aromas of the cuisine. The {{restaurant is}} open Wednesday through Sunday and closed on Monday and Tuesday. It has been rated with two Michelin stars, ranked {{as one of the best}} 101 Hotel Restaurants, been voted Restaurant of the year, and in 2015 was ranked by Gayot in its Top 40 Restaurants.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899– July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, {{short story}} writer, and journalist. His {{economical}} and <b>understated</b> style {{had a strong}} influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941 the 6th Division and ICorps {{headquarters}} {{took part}} in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion. The corps' commander, Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey, and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky, but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately <b>understated</b> the chance of defeat. The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in the region and the defence of the country was compromised by inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{publicity}} from Sanger's trial generated immense {{enthusiasm for}} the cause, {{and by the end}} of 1917 there were over 30 birth control organizations in the United States.Engelman, p. 92. Sanger was always astute about public relations, and she seized on the publicity of the trial to advance her causes.Kennedy pp. 84, 181.Engelman, pp. 92–93. In her memoirs, Sanger often <b>understated</b> or entirely omitted the contributions of fellow activists. After her trial, she emerged as the movement's most visible leader. Other leaders, such as William J. Robinson, Mary Dennett, and Blanche Ames Ames, could not match Sanger's charisma, charm and fervor.|$|E

5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet <b>understated</b> its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E
5|$|Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor {{known for}} his natural, authentic, and <b>understated</b> acting style and screen performances. His career spanned thirty-five years, from 1925 to 1960, and {{included}} leading roles in eighty-four feature films. He was a major movie star {{from the end of}} the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and authentic on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero.|$|E
5|$|In his post-baseball career, Day {{worked as}} a {{bartender}} in Newark before returning to his hometown in Baltimore in 1970, where he held a position {{as a security guard}} until 1979. Before Day's death in 1995, there were numerous efforts to celebrate his career and induct Day into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, a long-time dream of his. One such effort was made by Mayor Kurt Schmoke who declared January 31, 1992, Leon Day's Day in Baltimore. Governor William Donald Schaefer made a similar proclamation for Annapolis later that same year on May 10. Day's discreet demeanor and humble personality often <b>understated</b> his several accomplishments, most likely leading to him being overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame's voting committee. After falling short one vote of being inducted in 1993, Day was elected to the Hall of Fame on March 7, 1995. Six days later, Day died of heart failure while in hospice at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore; he was 78 years old.|$|E

5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same <b>understated</b> introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
5|$|The latest {{database}} of translations of the Elegy, amongst which the above version figures, records over 260 in some forty languages. As {{well as the}} principal European languages {{and some of the}} minor such as Welsh, Breton and Icelandic, they include several in Asian languages as well. Through the medium of these, Romanticism was brought to the host literatures in Europe. In Asia they provided an alternative to tradition-bound native approaches and were identified as an avenue to modernism. Study of the translations, and especially those produced soon after the poem was written, has highlighted some of the difficulties that the text presents. These include ambiguities of word order and the fact that certain languages do not allow the <b>understated</b> way in which Gray indicates that the poem is a personalised statement in the final line of the first stanza, “And leaves the world to darkness and to me”.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of its economy was sugar, grown on cane plantations worked by slaves. The {{sale of the}} crop in Britain enjoyed preferential terms. There were 2,571 declared slaves working on 68 plantations in Essequibo, and 1,648 slaves in Demerara in 1762. These numbers {{were known to be}} much <b>understated,</b> as the slave headcount was the basis of taxation. By 1769, there were 3,986 declared slaves for Essequibo's 92 plantations and 5,967 for Demerara's 206 plantations. The slave labour was in short supply and expensive due to the trading monopoly of the DWIC, and smuggling from Barbados was rife. Dutch colonists ensured white dominance over their growing slave population through the collaboration of indigenous natives, who strongly resisted white domination but could also be relied upon to take up arms against any Spanish incursions. When slaves rose up in Berbice in 1763, natives blocked the border to prevent the disruption from spreading into Demerara.|$|E

5|$|The {{requisite}} Papal dispensation {{was obtained}} dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks {{has suggested that}} the terms of the dispensation deliberately <b>understated</b> the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. First degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richard's case, there would have been first degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{was known}} for his gentlemanly nature and his {{adherence}} to the spirit of the game. Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline, Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen. On one occasion, Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of the crease to inspect the crease, without intending to run. A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal, but Woodfull called Fingleton back. He led his team in an <b>understated</b> way, preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil the task at hand. However, he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly <b>understated,</b> built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
3000|$|... 15 Linear {{interpolation}} implicitly {{assumes that}} the AGI and capital gains amounts are uniformly distributed within an AGI bracket. However, we infer from the overall shapes of the AGI and capital gains distributions that AGI is concentrated {{at the lower end}} and capital gains at the upper end of each bracket. Therefore, linear interpolation overstates AGI and <b>understates</b> capital gains in the top 5 percent of returns, and therefore <b>understates</b> the capital-gains share of AGI {{in that part of the}} income distribution. Unfortunately, the published IRS data are in broad income brackets, which do not permit a more refined interpolation.|$|R
