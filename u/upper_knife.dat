60|$|For a {{few moments}} it shook its horrible head, while Otter watched gasping, for the reek of the brute's breath almost {{overpowered}} him. Twice it opened its great jaws and spat, and twice it strove to close them. Oh! what if it should rid itself of the knife, or drive it through the soft flesh of the throat? Then he was lost indeed! But this it might not do, for the lower blade caught upon the jawbone, and at each effort it drove the sharp point of the <b>upper</b> <b>knife</b> deeper towards its brain. Moreover, so good was the steel, and so firm were the hide bindings of the handles, shrunken as they were with the wet, that nothing broke or gave.|$|E
50|$|The {{shear cut}} {{principle}} works with two knives - upper and bottom knife. The bottom knife is fixed and the <b>upper</b> <b>knife</b> works against the fixed one. Example of the shear cut principle is the {{cut of the}} paper web in the web offset machine and this is realized by a circular blade. To cut simple brochures (booklets) is used by a trimmer which works in two steps.|$|E
40|$|The Materials Technology Section was {{requested}} {{to develop a}} novel concept, namely that of an expanding ring, to restore the <b>upper</b> <b>knife</b> edge in the DWPF melter pour spout. The expanding ring is a unit that, when deployed in the DPWF pour spout, will self-expand against the inner diameter of the 3 -inch section of the pour spout providing a seal against glass leakage and a new knife edge that will mate with a Type 3 A insert. This report provides {{a summary of the}} final design features of the expanding ring and an overview of its development...|$|E
5000|$|The Pitt-Rivers knife {{bought in}} the mid 19th century by Reverend G. Chester from an antique dealer who {{reported}} finding it in Sheikh Hamada, near Sohag in <b>Upper</b> Egypt. The <b>knife</b> {{dates back to the}} late predynastic period, from ca. 3300 BC to 3100 BC, and is now on display at the British Museum’s Early Egypt gallery, room 64, under the catalog number EA 68512. The blade of the knife is virtually identical in style to that of the Gebel el-Arak knife, although slightly larger. The iconography of the handle {{is similar to that of}} the ritual knife, comprising six rows of wild animals carved in raised relief. The animals include elephants walking on snakes, storks, a heron, lions followed by a dog, short and long-horned cattle, perhaps jackals, an ibis, a deer, hartebeests, oryxes and a barbary sheep. Similar motifs are found on pottery and clay seals from funerary contexts of the predynastic and early dynastic periods, most notably in Abydos.|$|R
40|$|A unique {{laboratory}} device, the Laboratory Shear, {{has been}} designed and built to simulate and examine the shear angle cutting process, which is the predominant method used in many cutting operations. The device is capable of force and velocity measurements of the shear angle cutting process with the abilities to vary cutting speed, knife preload, and blade geometry. The dimensions of the device are such that mobility to and from conditioning rooms in the laboratory environment are not limited. Assembly and disassembly ease as well as automatic versus manual operation options were incorporated for greater experimental flexibility. The device {{has the ability to}} evaluate products at a shear velocity of 200 inches per second, which equates to nearly 1000 feet per minute on a conventional slitter with 10 shear angle. The force measurement capability is 10 pounds, which is sufficient to handle the majority of Kodak films. Knife preload can be adjusted to provide preloads from 2 lbs to 12 lbs, in increments of 2 lbs. Debug of the Lab Shear Device was conducted and included knife sharpness measurement as well as calibration of the load cell and velocity transducer. The <b>upper</b> (moving) <b>knife</b> was found to have a cutting tip radius of approximately 0. 0002 inch and the lower (stationary) knife was found to have a cutting tip radius of approximately 0. 0001 inch. Both knives could be considered as 2 ̆ 2 medium dull 2 ̆ 2 based on the Kodak standard for slitting knife sharpness (X 3 ̆c 0. 0001 inch = sharp, X 3 ̆e 0. 0005 inch = dull). Edges for both knives appeared smooth and defect free as viewed with SEM. Load cell and velocity transducer calibration resulted in less than 10...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho avaliar algumas alternativas para redução da sujidade nas toras de eucalipto sem casca, advindos do campo, para indústria de celulose, sem perda de produtividade nas atividades de colheita com o Harvester. Foram aplicados cinco tratamentos: alteração no ângulo dos crivos dos rolos do cabeçote; aplicação de estrias no dorso do cabeçote; redução do raio das facas inferiores do cabeçote; aplicação de chapa metálica no dorso {{exterior}} das facas superiores do cabeçote (defletor) e processamento da madeira na frente do Harvester, ou seja, longe da pilha (alteração de processo). Todos os tratamentos reduziram a sujidade, exceto a redução do raio das facas inferiores. O mais eficiente foi a alteração no processo. Porém, neste tratamento houve uma perda de 6, 8 % na produtividade. Quando analisada, a aplicação das estrias no dorso do cabeçote foi considerada a mais eficiente, pois reduziu a sujidade (- 21 %) e aumentou a produtividade (+ 3, 8 %). Quando analisado financeiramente a colheita e o transporte, seria mais viável transportar a sujidade do que trabalhar com menor produtividade na colheita. The aim of {{the study}} was to evaluate some alternatives for reducing dirt on eucalyptus logs without bark, coming from the field to the pulp industry, without loss of productivity in harvesting activities with the Harvester. Five treatments were applied: change in angle of the screens scrolls head; application of stretch marks on the back of the head; reduction of the radius of the lower head knives; applying the sheet metal back on the outside of the <b>upper</b> <b>knife</b> cylinder head (deflector), and processing the wood in front of the harvester, ie away from the stack (modification process). All treatments reduced the soil except the reduction of the radius of the lower knives. The most effective was the change in the process. However, in this treatment, a loss of 6. 8 % yield. When analyzed, the application of stretch marks on the back of the head was considered the most efficient because it reduced the dirt (- 21 %) and increased productivity (+ 3. 8 %). When analyzed financially harvesting and transportation, would be more feasible to transport the dirt than working with lower productivity in the harvest...|$|E
