In this paper, firstly, the emergency supply chain management in disasters is presented, and the risk of disasters and <b>urgent</b> <b>relief</b> decision-making are analyzed, then the support mechanism of emergency logistics including infrastructure support, unified command and network coordination, law guarantee, contingency plan and emergency transportation channel is analyzed. Secondly, the evaluating indicators are specified by introducing the salvable degree concept, the salvable degrees of the affected areas which lie on the impact degrees of relief demands in the corresponding affected areas are analyzed and evaluated by the extension technique, and then a two-objective optimization model with the <b>urgent</b> <b>relief</b> demand time-varying fill rate maximization and the <b>urgent</b> <b>relief</b> distribution time-varying window minimization is developed in order to distribute <b>urgent</b> <b>relief</b> to the identified affected area sets. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates our conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Quick {{response}} to the <b>urgent</b> <b>relief</b> needs right after natural disasters through efficient emergency logistics distribution {{is vital to the}} alleviation of disaster impact in the affected areas, which remains challenging in the field of logistics and related study areas. This paper presents a hybrid fuzzy clustering-optimization approach to the operation of emergency logistics co-distribution responding to the <b>urgent</b> <b>relief</b> demands in the crucial rescue period. Based on a proposed three-layer emergency logistics co-distribution conceptual framework, the proposed methodology involves two recursive mechanisms: (1) disaster-affected area grouping, and (2) relief co-distribution. Numerical studies with a real large-scale earthquake disaster occurring in Taiwan are conducted, and the corresponding results indicate the applicability of the proposed method and its potential advantages. We hope that this study can not only make the proposed emergency logistics system available with more benefits to the development of emergency logistics systems for the urgent needs of disaster areas around the world but also stimulate more excellent researches concerning emergency logistics management.

50|$|Formed in 1977, the Design Institute for Emergency <b>Relief</b> <b>Systems</b> was a {{consortium}} of 29 companies {{under the auspices of}} the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) that developed methods for the design of emergency <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> to handle runaway reactions. Its purpose was to develop the technology and methods needed for sizing pressure <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> for chemical reactors, particularly those in which exothermic reactions are carried out. Such reactions include many classes of industrially important processes including polymerizations, nitrations, diazotizations, sulphonations, epoxidations, aminations, esterifications, neutralizations and many others. Pressure <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> can be difficult to design, not least because what is expelled can be gas/vapour, liquid, or a mixture of the two - just as with a can of carbonated drink when it is suddenly opened. For chemical reactions, it requires extensive knowledge of both chemical reaction hazards and fluid flow.|$|R

30|$|Considering the {{hydrological}} {{boundary conditions}} the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> capacity {{was set to}} approx. 9  m 3 /s. This value includes safety margins and refers to the plant’s design storage level of 15  m which was defined in accordance to local geological characteristics (see “Determination of the hydraulic head”). As it later became apparent (rainy season 2011 / 2012), however, peak discharge values distinctly above 10  m 3 /s occurred as well as ongoing high discharge values exceeding the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> capacity for days. In total this lead to extreme storage levels, which are especially critical in terms of seepage in spatial proximity to the barrage (see “Initial operational phase”). Fortunately they did not cause any damage to the plant or the surrounding geology. Although fragmentary discharge data of the past decades do not allow a statistical classification of this event, investigations of KIT showed the necessity of extending the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> discharge capacity. Even though {{it is assumed that}} the observed event will only occur sporadically in the future, the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> discharge capacity was extended to approx. 11.5  m 3 /s (also referring to the plant’s design storage level of 15 m).|$|R

40|$|During {{the early}} modern period the poor <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> of the Dutch Republic were the most {{elaborate}} and generous forms of poor relief found anywhere in the world. Poor relief in the Dutch Republic was provided by a myriad of different organizations including churches, civic governments, guilds, private institutions of poor relief, and semi-public administrative boards. Although civic governments {{played an important role}} in the provision of poor relief, it remained a limited role and civic governments preferred to delegate responsibility over poor relief to existing institutions. Provincial governments, aside from Friesland, and the national government of the Dutch Republic played even less of a role in the provision of poor relief. The Dutch Republic resisted most attempts at centralized control over poor relief, even as other cities and eventually countries in Europe reformed their own poor <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> to come under state control. According to the influential theorist, Abram de Swaan, this lack of centralization should have resulted in a complete collapse of Dutch poor <b>relief</b> <b>systems.</b> However, as later scholars have argued, Dutch poor <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> thrived and survived without coming under direct state control until the 20 th century. In light of the failure of De Swaan’s model, alternative models of poor relief in the Dutch Republic have been proposed, but a universally accepted theory has not yet emerged, partially as a result of several insufficiently studied themes in poor relief in the Dutch Republic. One of these themes is the experience of poor relief in rural areas. In an attempt to contribute to the field, this thesis will conduct a case study on poor relief in the village of Berkel en Rodenrijs during the crisis period at the end of the 18 th century that eventually resulted in the collapse of the Dutch Republic. Despite extreme pressure, and contrary to De Swaan’s predictions, the poor <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> of Berkel en Rodenrijs seems to have survived the chaos...|$|R
