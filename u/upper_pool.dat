2500|$|The {{existing}} ponds {{above and}} below the minor road from Pumsaint to Caeo, were probably part of a cascade for washing ore, the upper tank having yielded large quantities of Roman pottery from ca 78 to at least 300 AD (Lewis, 1977; Burnham 2004). The <b>upper</b> <b>pool</b> is known as Melin-y-Milwyr, or the soldiers' mill, an intriguing name that implies that watermills may have been used here during the Roman period. Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} sequence of washing tables for the crushed gold ore. A large-scale mill complex is known from Barbegal in southern France, where no less than 16 mills (in two lines of 8 each) were built into the side of a hill and supplied with water from a single aqueduct. There were two lines of parallel overshot mills, the outflow from one feeding the next below. The mill supplied flour to the region. Moreover, Roman engineers used sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels to dewater mines, and the deep workings at Dolaucothi produced a fragment of such a wheel during the 1930s when deep mining operations were resumed. Sequences of such wheels increased the lift, and one extensive sequence of 16 wheels was found in old Roman mine workings on the Rio Tinto river in the 1920s. The wheels were arranged in pairs and could lift water about [...] from the bottom of the mine there.|$|E
60|$|The narrow chasms {{produced}} several fine insects quite new to me, and one new bird, {{the curious}} Phlaegenas tristigmata, a large ground pigeon with yellow breast and crown, and purple neck. This rugged path is the highway from Maros to the Bugis country beyond the mountains. During {{the rainy season}} it is quite impassable, the river filling its bed and rushing between perpendicular cliffs many hundred feet high. Even {{at the time of}} my visit it was most precipitous and fatiguing, yet women and children came over it daily, and men carrying heavy loads of palm sugar (of very little value). It was along the path between the lower and the upper falls, and about the margin of the <b>upper</b> <b>pool,</b> that I found most insects. The large semi-transparent butterfly, Idea tondana, flew lazily along by dozens, and it was here that I at length obtained an insect which I had hoped but hardly expected to meet with--the magnificent Papilio androcles, {{one of the largest and}} rarest known swallow-tailed butterflies. During my four days' stay at the falls, I was so fortunate as to obtain six good specimens. As this beautiful creature flies, the long white tails flicker like streamers, and when settled on the beach it carries them raised upwards, as if to preserve them from injury. It is scarce even here, as I did not see more than a dozen specimens in all, and had to follow many of them up and down the river's bank repeatedly before I succeeded in their capture. When the sun shone hottest, about noon, the moist beach of the pool below the upper fall presented a beautiful sight, being dotted with groups of gay butterflies--orange, yellow, white, blue, and green--which on being disturbed rose into the air by hundreds, forming clouds of variegated colours.|$|E

This site was further up the valley than that of the preceding Newcomen engine, which had been sited at what is now the large Wesleyan chapel on the main road. The older engine had supplied the Lower Furnace Pool. The New Pool was constructed long before, around 1698, but only acted as an additional reservoir to the <b>Upper</b> Furnace <b>Pool</b> and did not supply any waterwheels or equipment directly.

40|$|Abstract: The {{dissolved}} oxygen {{resources of the}} Upper Illinois Waterway are de-pressed because {{of a combination of}} oxygen demand sources including carbonaceous and nitrogenous BOD, benthic biological extraction, and sediments. Because of these demands, maintenance of 6. 0 mg/l DO in the stream system is difficult, and achieve-ment of a minimum DO requirement of 5. 0 mg/ 1 requires the nitrogenous and carbona-ceous demand be substantially reduced. Water quality data obtained from field sur-veys are summarized together with hydraulic and hydrologic data to determine waste-water treatment needs. Collection of the waterway algal types reveals that diatoms are the dominant group comprising about 85 percent of the total densities. However, algal concentrations do not impair use of the waterway for recreation. Fecal coliform bac-teria densities decrease with downstream movement at a rate of 0. 77 per day in the <b>upper</b> <b>pools</b> and 0. 42 per day in the lower pools.

Larger juveniles and adults of C. galerita continue to use the same type of pools, which are temporarily abandoned by the males during the breeding season when they use emersed holes and crevices as nests. The much faster growing L. pholis and G. cobitis leave the pools in their first autumn, when they are c. 7 cm long. Whereas G. cobitis > 7 cm move to channels and large <b>upper</b> <b>pools,</b> with a smooth substratum, sand and boulders, L. pholis begin to use emersed crevices where they spend low tide often in large groups. When L. pholis or C. galerita were added or removed selectively from pools, their numbers returned to pre-experimental levels after 2 weeks, suggesting that, although intraspecific competition may be strong, interspecific competition was unlikely to explain these results fully...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{phenology}} of emergences can {{be useful}} in determining seasonal chironomid life cycle patterns, which are often influenced by ice cover and temperature in cold climates. Lake Superior is the largest lake in North America and with a mean surface temperature of 3. 9 °C influences regional climate. Coastal pools at Isle Royale, a wilderness archipelago {{in the northern part of}} the lake, occur in dense patches on low-gradient volcanic bedrock between the lakeshore and forest, creating variable microhabitats for Chironomidae. Four sites were sampled monthly from April to October, 2010. Surface-floating pupal exuviae were collected from a series of pools in two zones: a lower zone near the lake influenced by wave splash, and an upper zone near the forest and influenced by upland runoff. We used Jaccard’s and Whittaker’s diversity indexes to test community similarity across months. Temperature loggers in pools collected hourly readings for most of the study. Assemblage emergences were stable in <b>upper</b> <b>pools,</b> with significant similarity across late spring and summer months. Assemblages were seasonally variable in lower pools, with significant dissimilarity across spring, summer, and fall months. Few species in either zone were unique to spring or fall months. However, many summer species in the splash zone had a narrow emergence period occurring during calm weather following distinct increases in mean water temperature. Regardless of input of cold lake water to the lower zone, pools from both zones generally had corresponding temperature trends...|$|R

50|$|The Pool of London {{is divided}} into two parts, the Lower Pool and <b>Upper</b> <b>Pool.</b> The Lower Pool {{traditionally}} runs from the Cherry Garden Pier in Rotherhithe to Tower Bridge. The <b>Upper</b> <b>Pool</b> consists of the section between Tower Bridge and London Bridge. In the 18th and 19th centuries the river was lined with nearly continuous walls of wharves running for miles along both banks, and hundreds of ships moored in the river or alongside the quays. The lack of capacity in the Pool of London prompted landowners to build London's Docklands with enclosed docks with better security and facilities. The abrupt collapse of commercial traffic in the Thames due to the introduction of shipping containers and coastal deep-water ports in the 1960s emptied the Pool and led to all of the wharves being closed down. The Lower Pool area was extensively redeveloped in the 1980s and 1990s to create new residential and commercial neighbourhoods, often using converted warehouses. In the <b>Upper</b> <b>Pool</b> this provided scope for office development in the City of London and Southwark.|$|E

40|$|Yellow perch, walleye, and sauger were {{examined}} {{to determine the}} presence of target pathogens and to describe parasite communities. The scale of this investigation is within the Upper Mississippi River Drainage. Data were compiled from five collection sites, three lakes and two pools from the Mississippi River, {{in the state of}} Wisconsin. At least 21 fish from each site were sampled. No viral or bacterial pathogens were detected. Yellow perch had significantly greater mean parasite taxa (0 = 3. 95) than walleye (0 = 2. 77) and sauger (0 = 2. 35). Walleye from Lake Owen had significantly greater mean parasite taxa (0 = 4. 00) than walleye from <b>Upper</b> Mississippi River <b>Pools</b> 8 and 9 (mean = 1. 98). However the mean parasite taxa of walleye (0 = 1. 98) was not significantly different than mean parasite taxa of sauger (0 = 2. 35) from <b>Upper</b> Mississippi River <b>Pools</b> 8 and 9. Yellow perch and walleye also had significantly greater mean total parasite count (0 = 34. 2 yellow perch and 0 = 30. 9 walleye) than sauger (0 = 11. 1).

40|$|The {{so-called}} 'covering behaviour' of echinoids {{is known}} to vary with habitat according to the types of covering items available, but {{the full extent of}} the role played by habitat characteristics in this behaviour is not known. Moreover, whether or not different species inhabiting similar environmental conditions and habitats also show similar patterns of this particular behaviour has yet to be investigated. In this study, two prominent west coast echinoid species, Paracentrotus lividus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, were examined with respect to covering behaviour and spatial organisation. Populations of both species are found in exposed intertidal zones, occupying boreholes within tidepools. Important similarities were found in the spatial organisation of both species' populations, with lowest densities in <b>upper</b> shore <b>pools.</b> However, the size distributions of the two populations differed significantly; P. lividus within <b>upper</b> shore <b>pools</b> were significantly larger than those in mid or lower shore pools, whereas S. purpuratus on the lower shore were significantly larger than those at other shore heights. We found significant between-species variability in covering item use, although the number of covering items available at both sites was not significantly different. For example, greater densities of covering items were used by P. lividus than by S. purpuratus. We also found that the percent of echinoid surface area covered varied significantly in space for both species. These data emphasise the complex and multifaceted nature of covering behaviour, but most importantly, they also strongly suggest that habitat characteristics can only partly explain the extent of this behavioural variability amongst echinoid species...|$|R
