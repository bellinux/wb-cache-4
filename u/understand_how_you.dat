500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. [...] "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players." ...|$|E
500|$|Recalling the songwriting style {{she used}} {{when she had}} collaborated with RedOne, Porcelain Black said she would enter the studio with an idea she {{had come up with}} on her own at the piano and play it for RedOne. At other times, RedOne would play a beat he had {{constructed}} for her, and she would listen to it and see what vibes emerged from hearing it. Usually, Porcelain Black creates a song title, then forges the song around that. She finds the most difficult songwriting process to be starting with melody, because making the syllables of her lyrics match the melody produces an effect that sounds forced and contrived. When working with RedOne, Porcelain Black said they would construct the melodies together, but all of the song lyrics were written exclusively by her; RedOne did not contribute to her music lyrically while they were working together on her first attempt at a debut album. Lyrically, Porcelain Black writes all of her own songs. On the topic, she has said: [...] "I write all my own stuff. I don't understand artists that don’t write their own songs. I'm thankful for artists like Britney, but I don’t <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can’t write your own music. It's such a personal way of expressing yourself." ...|$|E

"Look here," [...] said Harold March, abruptly, [...] "you've been {{no end of}} {{a friend}} to me, and I never {{was so proud of}} a {{friendship}} before; but there's something I must get off my chest. The more I found out, the less I <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> could stand it. And I tell you I'm going to stand it no longer." ...|$|R
