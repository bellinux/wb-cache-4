Thor also used <b>updraft</b> <b>carburetors</b> on their engines. In 1916 they offered a 3-speed transmission on their cycle. Another option was an acetylene lamps for light.|$|R
50|$|Older engines used <b>updraft</b> <b>{{carburetor}}s,</b> {{where the}} air enters from below the carburetor and exits through the top. This {{had the advantage of}} never flooding the engine, as any liquid fuel droplets would fall out of the carburetor instead of into the intake manifold; it also lent itself to use of an oil bath air cleaner, where a pool of oil below a mesh element below the carburetor is sucked up into the mesh and the air is drawn through the oil-covered mesh; this was an effective system in a time when paper air filters did not exist.|$|R

Some of the main changes were forged, rather than cast cylinders, allowing an increased compression ratio (from 6.65:1 to 6.75:1), a redesigned crankshaft, a single piece, rather than split crankcase center section, and a two section nose casing, incorporating hydraulically operated torque-monitoring equipment and an automatic, vacuum operated spark-advance unit.

50|$|In an <b>updraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> the {{air flows}} upward into the venturi {{according}} to Edward Abdo in Power Equipment Engine Technology. Other types are downdraft and sidedraft carburetors.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, {{downdraft}} carburetors were the most popular type for automotive use in the United States. In Europe, the sidedraft carburetors replaced downdraft as free space in the engine bay decreased {{and the use of}} the SU-type carburetor (and similar units from other manufacturers) increased. Some small propeller-driven aircraft engines still use the <b>updraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> design.|$|E

50|$|Only the 1933 Essex-Terraplanes {{were made}} with an {{optional}} eight-cylinder engine. The Hudson had the identical basic engine, but with earlier style <b>updraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> carried over, and a displacement of 254 CID L due to a larger cylinder bore than the Essex-Terraplane Eight. The Terraplane Eight engines featured more efficient downdraft carburetion. Both engines had the same crankshaft and stroke.|$|E
50|$|In March 1941, the Army/Navy Standardization Committee {{decided to}} {{standardize}} use of updraft carburetors across all U.S. military branches. The XP-61, designed with downdraft carburetors, faced an estimated minimum two-month redesign {{of the engine}} nacelle to bring the design into compliance. The committee later reversed the <b>updraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> standardization decision (the XP-61 program's predicament likely having little influence), preventing a potential setback in the XP-61's development.|$|E

5000|$|The {{engines and}} {{nacelles}} were outboard {{of the wing}} root and a short [...] "shoulder" [...] section of the wing that possessed a 4° dihedral, and were followed by {{the remainder of the}} wing which had a dihedral of 2°. The leading edge of the wing was straight and perpendicular to the aircraft's centerline. The trailing edge was straight and parallel to the leading edge in the shoulder, and tapered forward 15° outboard of the nacelle. Leading edge <b>updraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> intakes were present on the wing shoulder and the root of the outer wing, with a few inches of separation from the engine nacelle itself. They were very similar in appearance to those on the F4U Corsair—thin horizontal rectangles with the ends rounded out to nearly a half-circle, with multiple vertical vanes inside to direct the airstream properly.|$|E
5000|$|In 1921 Zeder, Skelton, Breer, {{and several}} {{associates}} left Studebaker {{to start an}} independent Newark automobile design-and-engineering firm, [...] "ZSB Engineering." [...] The luxury-oriented Daniels Motor Company hired ZSB to design their 1922 V-8, but the high-end car listed for $7,450 (in 1922 dollars), a prohibitive price for that day. Later in 1922, ZSB turned their eyes toward the mass market, hired by Billy Durant on a motor design for the Flint automobile. The ZSB-designed six-cylinder engine with an <b>updraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> was later used on the Locomobile, a luxury automobile built by Durant Motors. Skelton and ZSB {{in the same year}} [...] "shopped out" [...] a conceptual car design, tentatively called the [...] "Zeder." [...] ZSB failed to obtain financing to complete the design work as an independent firm, but news of their work reached the ears of an aggressive carmaking executive, Maxwell's Walter Chrysler. This contact proved to be decisive to Skelton's career.|$|E
