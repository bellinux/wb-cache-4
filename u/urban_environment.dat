40|$|A {{large and}} growing {{proportion}} {{of the world is}} impacted directly by human activities; among the most extreme of these is the spread of <b>urban</b> <b>environments.</b> Environmental change associated with urbanization represents a potentially potent source of selection. While <b>urban</b> <b>environments</b> generally have lowered biodiversity, some clades seem to thrive in urban settings. For example, many members of the bird family Turdidae, known as the ‘truethrushes’ and the blackbird Turdus merula (Fig. 1) in particular, are familiar urban species. Indeed, the colonization of <b>urban</b> <b>environments</b> by blackbirds has become a textbook case study for our understanding of the many ways a wild species can deal with urbanization. In this issue, Mueller et al. (Molecular Ecology, 00, 2013, 00) add to that story by beginning to address the genetic nature of behavioural adaptation of blackbirds colonizing urban areas. They do this by testing for divergence between paired urban and rural samples at a suite of candidate genes with hypothesized effects on behaviours thought to be important for the colonization of <b>urban</b> <b>environments.</b> They find evidence for consistent patterns of divergence at an exonic microsatellite associated with the SERT gene. SERT has a number of hypothesized behavioural effects, including harm avoidance, which may be associated with tolerating the hustle and bustle of <b>urban</b> <b>environments.</b> This is among the first evidence that behavioural differences between <b>urban</b> and rural <b>environments</b> have a genetic basis and this work suggests that <b>urban</b> <b>environments</b> can in some cases exert homogeneous selection pressures...|$|R

5|$|Despite most {{games in}} the series taking place in {{different}} continuities, they do share certain elements. One of its defining traits is it being set in a contemporary <b>urban</b> <b>environment,</b> specifically modern-day Tokyo. Post-apocalyptic elements are a recurring feature in settings and narratives. This choice was originally made to set the game apart from other fantasy-based gaming franchises of the time, as modern day Tokyo was rarely seen in games as opposed to versions {{of it from the}} past. The Persona series takes place exclusively within this setting, spanning a single continuity and mostly focusing on the exploits of a group of young people.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 1974, when Colbert was {{ten years}} old, his father and two closest male {{siblings}} (by age), Peter and Paul, died in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 while it was attempting to land in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were en route to enroll the two boys at Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. Lorna Colbert relocated the family downtown to the more <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> of East Bay Street in Charleston.

5|$|Set in 1964 (three {{decades before}} {{the events of}} the {{original}} Metal Gear), the story centers on FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss. While previous games were set in a primarily <b>urban</b> <b>environment,</b> Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor. The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cut scenes and radio conversations.|$|E
5|$|The Arabization of the Ayyubid ruling {{families}} differed starkly {{from the}} ranks of their armies, which lacked cultural cohesion, with Turks and Kurds dominating the cavalry and nomadic Turcomans and Arabs filling the ranks of the infantry. These groups typically settled in the pastoral areas outside of the cities, the centers of cultural life, and as such they were relatively isolated from the Arabic-dominant <b>urban</b> <b>environment.</b> This isolation allowed them to preserve their traditions. It is thought that Saladin spoke Turkish to his military commanders. Like their Fatimid predecessors, the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt maintained a substantial force of mamluks (military slaves). By {{the first half of the}} 13th century mamluks were mostly drawn from Kipchak Turks and Circassians and there is strong evidence that these forces continued to speak Kipchak Turkish.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes.

It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an <b>urban</b> <b>environment.</b> Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the <b>urban</b> <b>environment,</b> increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
5|$|USMC sources {{documented}} the Harrier as holding an 85 percent aircraft availability {{record in the}} Iraq War; in just under a month of combat, the aircraft flew over 2,000 sorties. When used, the LITENING II targeting pod achieved greater than 75 percent kill effectiveness on targets. In a single sortie from USS Bonhomme Richard, a wave of Harriers inflicted heavy damage on a Republican Guard tank battalion in advance of a major ground assault on Al Kut. Harriers regularly operated in close support roles for friendly tanks, one of the aircraft generally carrying a LITENING pod. Despite the Harrier's high marks, the limited {{amount of time that}} each aircraft could remain on station, around 15–20 minutes, led to some calls from within the USMC for the procurement of AC-130 gunships, which could loiter for six hours and had a heavier close air support capability than the AV-8B. AV-8Bs were later used in combination with artillery to provide constant fire support for ground forces during heavy fighting in 2004 around the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah. The <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> there required extreme precision for airstrikes.|$|E
5|$|Urban foxes {{can cause}} {{problems}} for local residents. Foxes {{have been known}} to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing. In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method. However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return.|$|E
