5|$|Because of {{the history}} of the various railways, Paddington is served by four London <b>Underground</b> <b>lines</b> through two {{separate}} stations: the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines have a combined sub-surface and deep-level station on Praed Street to the south of the main line station, and the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines have a sub-surface station with access from Paddington Basin to the north. Circle line services run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, the Argentine {{government}} was {{dissatisfied with the}} lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this point) had made in expanding the rest of the network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constitución and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other <b>Underground</b> <b>lines.</b> Line C's first section, Constitución railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agustín P. Justo, then President of Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding was a {{major problem}} at many {{stations}} where interchanges were made with other <b>Underground</b> <b>lines</b> and efforts were made {{in a number of}} places to improve passenger movements. In 1914, work was carried out to provide larger ticket halls and install escalators at Oxford Circus, Embankment and Baker Street. In 1923, further work at Oxford Circus provided a combined Bakerloo and CLR ticket hall and added more escalators serving the CLR platforms. In 1926, Trafalgar Square and Waterloo received escalators, the latter in conjunction with expansion of the station as part of the CCE's extension to Kennington. Between 1925 and 1928, Piccadilly Circus station saw the greatest reconstruction. A large circular ticket hall was excavated below the road junction with multiple subway connections from points around the Circus and two flights of escalators down to the Bakerloo and Piccadilly platforms were installed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{development}} and improvement of the London Underground, meant that Victoria could not compete as a cross-London service. GNR trains stopped running on 1 October 1907, with Midland ones following on June the next year. The GWR ceased to use the station for scheduled services on 21 March 1915, partly due to World War I {{in addition to the}} new <b>Underground</b> <b>lines.</b> Victoria was used as the main station for drafted soldiers, and those returning from action in the war. By the middle of the war, the station served twelve trains a day running between Victoria and Folkestone, with additional trains serving Dover. The station was regularly served with a voluntary buffet for departing soldiers, who served up to 4,000 men a day. Victoria itself did not suffer significant damage during the war, but a section of Grosvenor Bridge was destroyed after an anti-aircraft shell struck a gas main underneath it.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts left 700,000people {{without power}} from Miami to West Palm Beach, {{including}} the National Hurricane Center. The center briefly lost power, but during {{an hour and}} a half delay to reboot the computers, they obtained information from computers in the Mid-West and Washington, D.C. Officials from the Florida Power & Light Company were unable to repair power lines due to strong wind gusts, while Irene's flooding submerged <b>underground</b> <b>lines,</b> preventing repairs until the waters subsided. Five people, including three in one family, were killed when they walked through electrified waters due to downed power lines. The rains from Irene flooded roads and canals, stalling numerous cars. Three people drowned when they drove their vehicles into the canals. The floodwaters persisted for nearly a week in areas, displacing hundreds from their homes and isolating thousands. Property damage in southeastern Florida totalled to $262million.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{played a}} notable {{role in the}} {{response}} to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989, a major earthquake rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped {{at the edge of the}} bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock, a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their hoses to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) and began to quench the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant. Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses. At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken <b>underground</b> <b>lines</b> and from a 20% loss in stored water volume—both from earthquake damage—and from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses. At 6:16 pm Phoenix was called to assist.|$|E

25|$|The Thameslink Programme {{involves}} {{the introduction of}} 12-car trains across the enlarged Thameslink network. As extending the platforms at King's Cross Thameslink {{was thought to be}} impractical (requiring alterations to Clerkenwell No 3 tunnel and the Circle/Hammersmith & City/Metropolitan <b>Underground</b> <b>lines,</b> which would be extremely disruptive and prohibitively expensive), it was decided to build new Thameslink platforms under St Pancras.|$|E
25|$|Cemetery {{management}} abandoned utility {{lines in}} place rather than require utility companies to remove old lines. This left extensive electric, fiber optic communications, natural gas, telephone, sewer, and clean water systems buried throughout the cemetery (and sometimes above-ground). It {{was no longer}} clear which utility lines were functional and which had been abandoned, nor where the abandoned <b>underground</b> <b>lines</b> were.|$|E
25|$|The City Loop {{consists}} of four single-track <b>underground</b> <b>lines,</b> one for each group, allowing trains arriving in the city from each group to circle the central business district then head out again to a destination on the same group. Trains generally operate within {{one of the four}} groups, although there is some interworking between the Burnley and Clifton Hill groups and between the Caulfield and Northern Groups.|$|E

25|$|The Metropolitan line's {{suburban}} rail character {{opposed to}} other London <b>Underground</b> <b>lines</b> is also {{shown by the}} long distances between stops. Eight of the top 10 furthest apart stations on the Underground are on the Metropolitan line.

25|$|The planned {{transport}} legacy for {{the capital}} included new bus transit schemes, extensions to existing <b>Underground</b> <b>lines,</b> redevelopments of London Underground stations and upgrades to the trains used. There were also to be many upgrades to National Rail services with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, a new high-speed rail link, several new stations and upgrades to stations such as Kings Cross St. Pancras. Please view the Legacy Map to see the upgrades to the London Transport network in context.|$|E
25|$|Uniquely among London's <b>Underground</b> <b>lines,</b> {{virtually}} all infrastructure on the Waterloo & City line is completely underground, including all track, both stations, {{and the maintenance}} depot at Waterloo. (The Victoria line is also underground for the entire passenger route and all stations, but has a surface level, open-air depot for maintenance.) There are no track connections with any other railway line; all equipment transfers {{to and from the}} line are accomplished from the shaft and road crane at the Waterloo depot.|$|E

There are 16 stations on the route, all bar Pimlico providing interchanges with other <b>Underground</b> <b>lines</b> or National Rail services. It is used by 200million passengers each year, making it the sixth-most heavily used line on the network in absolute figures, {{but in terms of}} the average number of journeys per mile it is by far the most intensively used line.|$|E
25|$|The Brussels Metro {{dates back}} to 1976, but <b>underground</b> <b>lines</b> known as premetro have been {{serviced}} by tramways since 1968. The network consists of four conventional metro lines and three premetro lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6, with some shared sections, covering a total of 40 kilometres (24.8mi). The metro is an important means of transport, connecting with six railway stations of the National Railway Company of Belgium, and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with Flemish De Lijn and Walloon TEC bus stops.|$|E
25|$|At Neasden Junction, the Chiltern Main Line diverges to the west, {{while the}} Aylesbury line {{continues}} north {{parallel to the}} <b>underground</b> <b>lines.</b> The line then joins the Metropolitan line tracks a few yards south of Harrow-on-the-Hill station and shares this track with the London Underground's fast Metropolitan line services to Amersham from London Baker Street. This section runs parallel to the slow Met Line to Moor Park where the line to Watford diverges. The line goes under the M25 north of Rickmansworth. After Chalfont & Latimer station, the Chesham branch diverges, and the main line continues to Amersham, the terminus for Metropolitan line trains.|$|E
