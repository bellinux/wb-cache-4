Using a tobit and probit estimation we find that {{the impact of}} <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>preferences</b> on both margins is strictly linked to the sector under analysis and to the type of preferences a country benefits from. In particular, we find an anti-diversification effect along with a concentration of exports in agricultural products in the case of more stable preferential schemes, as represented by the African Caribbean and Pacific <b>trade</b> <b>preferences.</b> We also confirm that the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for least developing countries did not change the beneficiaries' export pattern, while the traditional GSP and the regime to combat drug production tend to promote diversification of exports.

We use a detailed dataset with cif unit values at HS 8 -digits level covering the period 2000 – 2007. Our findings indicate that (i) for a large number of product lines, export margins are zero; (ii) utilization rates are generally high; however, (iii) this does not translate into a positive price margins captured by Mozambican exporters compared to MFN competitors.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{benefiting from}} developed country <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>preferences</b> fear that Doha Round tariff cuts will erode {{the value of}} those preferences. That these programmes confer significant benefits, however, is not clear. Studies indicate {{that the impact of}} preference erosion would be minimal for most developing countries. But for a small subset of middle-income and least-developed countries, concern may be warranted. WTO members, should address affected countries' concerns, perhaps by tailoring WTO tariff negotiations to lessen adjustment pressures and providing development assistance. Developing countries also are anxious that lower tariffs will reduce government revenues. Dependence on tariff revenue is diminishing and trade liberalisation need not result in lower total tax revenues or even lower customs revenues. Much depends on a country's current tariff and trade regime, its tax structure and its overall economic structure. At some point, a country does need to broaden its tax base and look to other revenue sources to offset declining tariff revenues. Tax reform, therefore, complements trade reform. A third area of developing country concern is non-tariff barriers (NTBs), which may limit market access even after tariffs are reduced. Despite prior WTO work in this area, NTBs remain a thorny issue for all WTO members. Copyright 2006 The Author Journal compilation 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|Some {{developed}} countries have used <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> sanctions against governments that have allegedly {{been engaged in}} gross {{violations of human rights}} as a tool to force such governments to comply with basic human rights standards. Even though <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> sanctions might be targeted against governments that grossly violate human rights, such measures have unintended consequences on the general population who live in the target country. In many cases, the general population suffers as a result of such sanctions rather than the public officials who are the targets. Hence, the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the desired result is questionable. Such measures have been utilized by countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) thereby raising the issue of the legality of such measures under the WTO rules. The two main issues that surround <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> sanctions are thus the legality of such measures under the WTO rules and the effectiveness of the measures to meet the desired result.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} quantitative {{estimates of}} the impact of the European trade agreements on trade flows. It applies both static and dynamic panel estimation techniques. The results are useful to policymakers because new intra-European trade agreements are being negotiated. In the absence of a further expansion of the European Union, estimates of alternative policies may help to clarify the policy debate. The paper also illustrates that the performance of individual countries under the trade agreements can be explained in terms of their macroeconomic environment. The conclusions are likely to be relevant to the western Balkan countries and Ukraine.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} history of {{bilateral}} trade negotiations between Taiwan and the U. S. The question posed at the outset is: does bilateralism enhance or jeopardize multilateralism? The U. S. -Taiwan experience seems to suggest a grossly negative answer. Bilateral negotiations for market opening {{with the threat of}} <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> sanctions (such as Section 301 action) tend to encourage <b>trade</b> <b>preferences</b> and U. S. negotiators are inclined to accept such preferential arrangements in areas where U. S. domestic interests are homogeneous and concentrated. Even in the case of tariff negotiations where any tariff concessions made by Taiwan are extended to other trading partners on an MFN basis, bilateralism does not necessarily enhance multilateral principles. The scope of tariff concessions made by Taiwan shows a strong bias in favor of the sectors in which the U. S. has a comparative advantage in Taiwan's market and the sectors in which U. S. domestic industries exhibit monopoly power. Meanwhile, U. S. commitments to GATT strengthen its position in bilateral negotiations and help persuade Taiwan, which is not a member of GATT, to make similar concessions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to scrutinize whether the rules of origin criteria in Australian <b>trade</b> <b>preference</b> scheme are guided by the desired benefits of non-tariff barrier or not. <b>Trade</b> <b>preference</b> schemes of developed countries to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are important parts of foreign trade policy of advanced nations. For LDCs, availing <b>trade</b> <b>preferences</b> is also important for the success of their exportoriented economic growth and integration to the global economy.
