40|$|The Garage Editions Print Residency at Worcester University {{provided}} an opportunity to produce a large wood cut print based on the pantin (dancing or jumping jack) paper puppets popular in 18 th Century France.

The project {{is part of an}} on going collaboration with Dr James Fisher, developing a ‘character’ based on Isabella Bird, a 19 th century explorer, writer and naturalist who travelled extensively in Colorado and the Rockies, and continues the work produced for LAF Projects in 2015. Ideas of body and proportion that are other than those associated with a European / Classical model are central to the realisation of the figure. Dolls, cartoons, and votive objects provide a more appropriate framework. That Isabella Bird has a manga personification already in existence adds to this. The creation of an animated work is a new departure for De Cordova, whose sculptures more typically focus on the idea of the ‘stilled’ object. The woodcut process was chosen for its affinity with carving, an approach to making that {{is a part of the}} artist’s fabrication history in terms of her sculpture.
