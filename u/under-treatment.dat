50|$|Because of opioid drugs' {{reputation}} for addiction and fatal overdose, most are controlled substances. In 2013, between 28 and 38 million people used opioids illicitly (0.6% to 0.8% {{of the global}} population {{between the ages of}} 15 and 65). In 2011, an estimated 4 million people in the United States used opioids recreationally or were dependent on them. Current increased rates of recreational use and addiction are attributed to over-prescription of opioid medications and inexpensive illicit heroin. Conversely, fears about over-prescribing, exaggerated side effects and addiction from opioids are similarly blamed for <b>under-treatment</b> of pain.|$|E

Studies have shown that use of the scale in management of alcohol withdrawal leads to decreased frequency of over-sedation with benzodiazepines in patients with milder alcohol withdrawal than would otherwise be detected without use of the scale, and decreased frequency of <b>under-treatment</b> in patients with greater severity of withdrawal than would otherwise be determined without the scale.|$|E
50|$|According to {{statistics}} {{released by the}} Centre of Addiction and Mental Health one in five people in Ontario experience a mental health or addiction problem. Young people ages 15 to 25 are particularly vulnerable. Major depression is found to affect 8% and anxiety disorder 12% of the population. Women are 1.5 {{times more likely to}} suffer from mood and anxiety disorders. WHO points out that there are distinct gender differences in patterns of mental health and illness. The lack of power and control over their socioeconomic status, gender based violence; low social position and responsibility for the care of others render women vulnerable to mental health risks. Since more women than men seek help regarding a mental health problem, this has led to not only gender stereotyping but also reinforcing social stigma. WHO has found that this stereotyping has led doctors to diagnose depression more often in women than in men even when they display identical symptoms. Often communication between health care providers and women is authoritarian leading to either the <b>under-treatment</b> or over-treatment of these women.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Using data on {{clinical}} practices for outpatients 5 years and older, test accuracy, and malaria prevalence, we model financial and clinical implications of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) {{under the new}} artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment policy in one high and one low malaria prevalence district in Kenya. In the high trans-mission district, RDTs as actually used would improve malaria treatment (61 % less over-treatment but 8 % more <b>under-treatment)</b> and lower costs (21 % less). Nonetheless, the majority of patients with malaria would not be correctly treated with AL. In the low transmission district, especially because the treatment policy was new and AL was not widely used, RDTs as actually used would yield a minor reduction in <b>under-treatment</b> errors (36 % less but the base is small) with 41 % higher costs. In both districts, adherence to revised clinical practices with RDTs {{has the potential to}} further decrease treatment errors with acceptable costs...|$|E

Secondary objectives targeted subgroups of primary or secondary prevention patients and those with a metabolic syndrome. Further-more, CEPHEUS also aimed at the identification of determinants for <b>under-treatment.</b> Among the patients available for evaluation in Belgium (n= 6276), 58. 5 % reached LDL-C goals as recommended by the 2003 European guidelines, 59. 8 % in primary prevention, 55. 8 % in secondary prevention, and 55. 8 % of those with a metabolic syndrome. The majority of patients (82. 5 %) was treated with statins. The univariate significant (P < 0. 10) predictors of attaining LDL-C goal were the following: (a) nonsmoker, (b) no history of PAD or CAD, (c) absence of metabolic syndrome, (d) lower CV risk category, (e) absence of patient's concerns about treatment changes, (f) no withdrawal of lipid-lowering therapy when on target, (g) optimal. treatment adherence, (h) no patient's frustrations, (i) lipid-monitoring frequency, (j) physician being a specialist and (k) physicians finding it stressful to get patients on target.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines represent the recognised standard for acute asthma management. We assessed {{the degree of}} conformity with these guidelines in an acute medical unit. Methodology Data from consecutive admissions were collected prospectively. Practice was audited in October December 2005 and October 2006 - January 2007. Between cycles an educational programme was instigated. Results Fifty-eight patients were included. Clinical parameters were well recorded in both cycles. Peak expiratory flow was consistently under-recorded (72 % at admission; 67 % in monitoring). Severity assessment was documented at 55 % and 66 % in cycle one and two respectively.

40|$|Purpose: Pain is a {{frequent}} symptom in cancer patients with substantial impact. Despite the availability of opioids and updated guidelines from reliable leading societies, <b>under-treatment</b> is still very frequent. Materials and methods: We updated a systematic review published in 2008 which showed that, according to the Pain Management Index (PMI), 43. 4 % of cancer patients were under-treated. This review included observational and experimental studies reporting negative PMI for adults with cancer and pain published from 2007 to 2013 and retrieved through Medline, Embase and Google Scholar. In order to detect any temporal trend and identify potential determinants of <b>under-treatment</b> we compared papers published before and after 2007 with univariate, multivariate and sensitivity analyses. Results: In the new set of 20 papers published from 2007 to 2013 there was a decrease in undertreatment of about 25 % (from 43. 4 to 31. 8 %). In the whole sample the proportion of under-treated patients felt from 2007 to 2013, and an association was confirmed between negative PMI, economic level and non-specific setting for cancer pain. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of results. Conclusion: Analysis of 46 papers published from 1994 to 2013 using the PMI to assess the adequacy of analgesic therapy suggests the quality of pharmacological pain management has improved. However, about one third of patients still do not receive pain medication proportional to their pain intensity. JRC. I. 2 -Public Health Policy Suppor...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{authors have}} {{demonstrated}} {{a trend toward}} the <b>under-treatment</b> of elderly and very elderly women with breast cancer.

Methods: A retrospective chart review of all patients 80 years and older with a newly diagnosed breast cancer at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, between September 1, 1989 and September 1, 2004 was performed. Data extracted from charts included patient demographics, comorbidity, treatments recommended, treatments received, complications of therapy, disease recurrence and disease related death. Treatments undertaken were analyzed {{in the context of}} accepted therapy at the time of diagnosis. Results: Two hundred twelve patients were identified. The median age was 83. 5 years (range 80 - 97). Overall survival in the entire cohort was 7. 28 years with a median follow up of 4 years for patients still alive {{at the end of the}} study period. Fifty seven percent of patients were under-treated according to institutional and national guidelines. Women who underwent hormonal therapy only demonstrated decreased disease specific survival (P Conclusions: Outcomes are compromised in very elderly women with breast cancer in whom less than complete combined modality treatment is undertaken.

40|$|Across the world, pain is under-treated in {{emergency}} departments (EDs). We canvass the literature testifying to this problem, {{the reasons why}} this problem is so important, and then {{some of the main}} hypotheses that have been advanced in explanation of the problem. We then argue for the plausibility of two new hypotheses: pain’s <b>under-treatment</b> in the ED is due partly to (1) an epistemic preference for signs over symptoms {{on the part of some}} practitioners, and (2) some ED practices that themselves worsen pain by increasing patients’ anxiety and fear. Our argument includes the following logic. Some ED practitioners depart from formal guidance in basing their acute pain assessments on observable features rather than on patient reports of pain. This is potentially due to an epistemic preference for signs over symptoms which aims to circumvent intentional and/or unintentional misrepresentation on the part of patients. However, conducting pain assessments in line with this epistemic preference contributes to the undertreatment of pain in at least three respects, which we detail. Moreover, it may do little to help the practitioner circumvent any intentional misrepresentation on the part of the patient, as we explain. Second, we examine at least four ED practices that may be contributing to the <b>under-treatment</b> of pain by increasing patient anxiety and fear, which can worsen pain. These practices include failing to provide orienting information and partially objectifying patients so as to problem-solve along lines pre-established by modern medical science. We conclude by touching on some potential solutions for ED practice. Drew Carter, Paul Sendziuk, Jaklin A. Eliott, Annette Braunack-Maye...|$|E
40|$|Case rate {{payments}} {{combined with}} utilization monitoring {{may have the}} potential {{to improve the quality of}} care by reducing over and <b>under-treatment.</b> Thus, a national managed care organization introduced case rate payments at one multi-site radiation oncology provider while maintaining only fee-for-service payments at others. This study examined whether the introduction of the payment method had an effect on radiation fractions administered when compared to clinical guidelines. The number of fractions of radiation therapy delivered to patients with bone metastases, breast, lung, prostate, and skin cancer was assessed for concordance with clinical guidelines. The proportion of guideline-based care ascertained from the payer's claims database was compared before (2011) and after (2013) the payment method introduction using relative risks (RR). After the introduction of case rates, there were no significant changes in guideline-based care in breast, lung, and skin cancer; however, patients with bone metastases and prostate cancer were significantly more likely to have received guideline-based care (RR = 2. 0 and 1. 1, respectively, p< 0. 05). For the aggregate of all cancers, the <b>under-treatment</b> rate significantly declined (p = 0. 008) from 4 % to 0 % after the introduction of case rate payments, while the over-treatment rate remained steady at 9 %, with no significant change (p = 0. 20). These findings suggest that the introduction of case rate payments did not adversely affect the rate of guideline-based care at the provider examined.
