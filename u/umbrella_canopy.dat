50|$|The Pipli Applique work {{owes its}} origin to Lord Jagannath culture during 12th century.Earlier applique <b>umbrellas</b> and <b>canopies</b> were {{prepared}} by gajapatis {{for the annual}} Jagannath's Ratha Jatra.|$|R
5000|$|An {{umbrella}} or parasol is {{a folding}} canopy supported by wooden or metal ribs, {{which is usually}} mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole. It is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight. The word [...] "umbrella" [...] typically refers to a device used for protection from rain. The word parasol usually refers to an item designed to protect from the sun. Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols are not waterproof. <b>Umbrella</b> <b>canopies</b> may be made of fabric or flexible plastic.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{teddy bear}} {{parachute}} {{may be made}} from an old <b>umbrella</b> <b>canopy</b> or other lightweight material. A simple hemispherical pattern of multiple tapered gores may be sewn from ripstop nylon kite or sail fabric. Many bears are dressed and fully equipped with parachute packs, helmets and goggles.|$|E
50|$|The {{stone pine}} is a {{coniferous}} evergreen tree that can exceed 25 m in height, but 12 - 20 m is more typical. In youth, it is a bushy globe, in mid-age an <b>umbrella</b> <b>canopy</b> on a thick trunk, and, in maturity, {{a broad and}} flat crown over 8 m in width. The bark is thick, red-brown and deeply fissured into broad vertical plates.|$|E
50|$|Umbrella hats have {{a typical}} <b>umbrella</b> <b>canopy,</b> with ribs {{supporting}} a fabric or plastic covering. This canopy {{is connected to}} a headband via four short shafts on every other rib to keep the canopy over the head. The canopy is generally collapsible, with the ribs and fabric collapsing around the headband shafts, much like a typical umbrella. Umbrella hats can come in {{a wide array of}} colors, and sizes, including national flags like the British Flag.|$|E
5000|$|A {{vigorous}} young bearded gentleman {{seems to}} be about to engage her, perhaps to offer her shelter under his umbrella. She, {{and one of the}} two girls to the right with a hoop and stick, look out at the viewer, while most of the other people go about their business. Unconventionally, the focus of the painting is not at its centre, and many of the figures are cut off by the frame as if the painting were a photograph. The composition appears natural, but the angles of the umbrellas are carefully arranged to form geometric shapes, with the main figure's [...] and the girl's hoop adding rounded elements. The colours are largely blues and greys: a pattern of <b>umbrella</b> <b>canopies</b> {{across the top of the}} painting, and the dresses and coats of the people lower down.|$|R
50|$|On {{the rare}} {{occasions}} when antharjanams left the house, they had to envelope their whole bodies in a thick cloak, and carry a leaf <b>umbrella</b> whose <b>canopy</b> reached to their waists, {{so that they could}} only see their own feet when walking. By contrast, lower caste women were required by law to bare their breasts when in the presence of higher caste men, and could be punished for not doing so. They thus habitually went with their upper bodied uncovered, and many reformist and missionary movements in early twentieth century Kerala clothed lower caste women by force to uplift them. By the 1930s, most royal households (who were below Brahmins, caste-wise) were allowing their women to wear blouses, but the practice took longer to percolate downwards to poorer families, especially as blouses were quite costly.|$|R
50|$|Degraves {{features}} numerous bars, shops, {{cafes and}} restaurants. The art deco architecture, dining <b>umbrellas</b> and café <b>canopies</b> mean {{the street is}} often described as having a Parisian or European flavour. Redevelopment of the Mutual Store in 2006 has further enhanced the lane with additional shops.Many of the taller, older buildings were also converted into loft style apartments in the 1990s, adding further life to the area. Street art and graffiti are commonplace, whilst buskers/street performers also frequent the laneway, adding to its atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{umbrella}} canopies and umbrella canopy-like mechanisms {{can be designed}} inherently balanced. Inherently balanced means that the center of mass of the moving parts remains stationary at a single point for any position of the mechanism {{simply because of the}} specific design of the mechanism where no countermasses or springs are needed. The advantages of a balanced canopy are that it can be opened and closed easily with minimal effort even if it has large dimensions and that it is inherently safe since the canvas cannot collapse or fall down. Also a shaking ground or floor does not affect an inherently balanced canopy. This is due to its dynamic force balance, allowing the canopy to be perfectly suitable as a retractable roof on for instance a truck on a bumpy road. In this study, three inherently balanced <b>umbrella</b> <b>canopy</b> designs are synthesized from principal vector linkages and their balance conditions are derived. Also a prototype was built and tested to show the feasibility of the design in practice...|$|E
5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an <b>umbrella</b> shaped <b>canopy.</b> The primaries and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is totally enclosed. The bird may take several strides in this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a canopy is not formed.|$|R
5000|$|The artistic {{imagination}} of Hindu artists of Nepal has created iconic Vishvarupa images, expressing [...] "sacred terror", as expressed by Arjuna. Vishvarupa has twenty heads arranged in tiers. They include Vishnu's animal avatars Matsya (fish), Kurma (tortoise), boar (Varaha), lion (Narasimha) {{as well as}} heads of vahanas (mounts) of Hindu deities: elephant (of Indra), eagle (Garuda of Vishnu) and bull (of Shiva). Among the human heads, Vishnu’s avatars as Parashurama, Rama, Krishna and Buddha. His two main hands hold {{the sun and the}} moon. He has ten visible legs and three concentric rings of hands accounting to 58. Other artistic representations of Vishvarupa in Nepal have varying number of heads, hands and legs and some have even attributes of Mahakala and Bhairava, such as flaying knife and skull bowl. Other attributes shown are arrows, bows, bell, vajra, sword with shield, <b>umbrella</b> and <b>canopy.</b> Another terrifying feature is a face on the belly that gorges a human being.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{foregoing}} liturgical uses, a flabellum, {{in the shape}} of a fan, later of an <b>umbrella</b> or <b>canopy,</b> was used as a mark of honour for bishops and princes. Prior to Vatican II, two fans of this kind were used at the Vatican whenever the pope was carried in state on the sedia gestatoria to or from the altar or audience-chamber. Through the influence of Count Ditalmo di Brozza, the fans formerly used at the Vatican were, in 1902, presented to Mrs. Joseph Drexel of Philadelphia, USA, by Pope Leo XIII, and in return she gave a new pair to the Vatican. The old ones are exhibited in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania. The spread is formed of great ostrich plumes tipped with peacock feathers; on the palm (base of the fan) are the arms of the Holy See, worked in heavy gold on a crimson field, the tiara being studded with rubies and emeralds. The new pair of flabella is on display in the Vatican museum.|$|R

5|$|Appliqué art, {{which is}} a stitching-based craft unlike embroidery, was pioneered by Hatta Maharana of Pipili. It is widely used in Puri, both for {{decoration}} of the deities and for sale. Maharana's family members are employed as darjis or tailors or sebaks by the Maharaja of Puri. They prepare articles for decorating the deities in the temple for various festivals and religious ceremonies. The appliqué works are brightly coloured and patterned fabric {{in the form of}} <b>canopies,</b> <b>umbrellas,</b> drapery, carry bags, flags, coverings of dummy horses and cows, and other household textiles; these are marketed in Puri. The cloth used is made in dark colours of red, black, yellow, green, blue and turquoise blue.|$|R
5000|$|Umbrellas {{continue}} to be actively developed. In the US, so many umbrella-related patents are being filed that the U.S. Patent Office employs four full-time examiners to assess them. As of 2008, the office registered 3000 active patents on umbrella-related inventions. Nonetheless, Totes, the largest American umbrella producer, has stopped accepting unsolicited proposals. Its director of umbrella development was reported as saying that while umbrellas are so ordinary that everyone thinks about them, [...] "it's difficult {{to come up with}} an umbrella idea that hasn’t already been done."While the predominate canopy shape of an <b>umbrella</b> is round, <b>canopy</b> shapes have been streamlined to improve aerodynamic response to wind. Examples include the stealth-shaped canopy of Rizotti (1996), scoop-shaped canopy of Lisciandro (2004), and teardrop-shaped canopies of Hollinger (2004).|$|R
50|$|The Pataleshwar Cave Temple (also called Panchaleshvara or Bamburde) is a rock-cut cave temple, {{carved out}} in the 8th century in the Rashtrakuta period. It is located {{in what is now}} Pune, in the state of Maharashtra, India. It was {{originally}} situated outside the town, but the city limits have expanded so that it is now located on the downtown Jangli Maharaj Road. It has been declared as a protected monument by the government. The temple, made of basalt rock, is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The sanctum - a cube-shaped room about 3-4 metres on each side - houses a linga - the symbol of Shiva and there are two smaller cells on each side. In front of the cave is a circular Nandi mandapa, its <b>umbrella</b> shaped <b>canopy</b> supported by massive square pillars. This mandapa is one of the peculiar structures of Pataleshwar. The cave is located at a lower level than the present level of the road and the cave complex. There is an exquisitely carved circular Nandi shrine in the huge courtyard of the cave. The main cave is rectangular on plan and has a pillared porch. There are three sanctums in the cave temple and the central one houses the Shivalinga. There is a circumambulation path provided in the cave where one can see the unfinished part of the cave temple. It appears that after finishing the front and the sanctum the cave was left incomplete due to some reasons, one of which could be the faults in the rock. However the walls in the main cave have some outlines drawn suggesting the sculptures depicting stories from Indian mythology, especially involving Shiva.|$|R
40|$|In many {{engineering}} applications two or {{more different}} interacting systems require the numer-ical solution of so-called multifield problems. In civil engineering the interaction of fluid and structures plays an important role, i. e. for fabric tensile structures of light and flexible materials often used for large roof systems, capacious <b>umbrellas</b> or <b>canopies.</b> Whereas powerful numerical simulation techniques have been established in structural engineering {{as well as in}} fluid mechan-ics, only relatively few approaches to simulate the interaction of fluids with civil engineering constructions have been presented. To determine the wind loads on complex structures, it is still state-of-the-art to apply semi-empirical, strongly simplifying methods or to perform expensive ex-periments in wind tunnels. In this paper an approach of a coupled fluid-structure simulation will be presented for membrane and thin shell structures. The interaction is described by the struc-tural deformation as response to wind forces, resulting in a modification of the fluid flow domain. Besides a realistic determination of the wind loads, information on the structural stability can be obtained. The so-called partitioned solution is based on an iterative frame algorithm, integrating different codes for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and for Computational Structural Dy-namics (CSD) in an explicit or an implicit time-stepping procedure. All data exchange between the two different applications is performed via a neutral geometric model provided by a coupling interface. A conservative interpolation method is used for the interpolation of the nodal loads. The time-dependent motion of the structure requires a dynamic modification of the different grids and a redefinition of the Navier-Stokes equations in an Arbitrary Langrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation. As an example for the present implementation, results of a coupled fluid-structure simulation for a textile membrane canopy will be presented...|$|R
2500|$|The umbraculum (Latin {{form for}} little <b>umbrella)</b> is a <b>canopy</b> or <b>umbrella</b> (consisting of {{alternating}} {{red and gold}} stripes, the traditional colours {{of the city of}} Rome and so, until 1808, of the papacy) whose original function was quite simply to provide shade. As it was traditionally a royal prerogative to walk beneath a canopy, Pope Alexander VI began using the umbraculum to symbolise the temporal powers of the Papacy; it was formerly carried by a man standing behind the Pope. [...] It featured in the former arms of the Papal States. The practice of walking with the umbraculum has been discontinued, although it continues to feature in ecclesiastical heraldry and remains the insigne of a basilica, usually displayed {{to the right of the}} main altar. It is sometimes carried in processions as a sign of a basilica's dignity. [...] It also currently features in the Coat of arms of the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church: because the Camerlengo administers the property of the Holy See during a sede vacante, there isn't any papal insignia when there is not a Pope in office, and the umbraculum represents the powers of Holy See, which did not cease with Pope's death, since they are entrusted to the Church itself. (see figure below).|$|R
40|$|This film shows {{most of the}} {{ceremonial}} portion of the funeral procession of Tom Kim Yung (1858 - 1903), military attache to the Chinese Legation to the United States. The funeral procession took place at 1 : 00 pm on Wednesday, September 23, 1903, and was probably the largest ever seen in Chinatown. Tom's death (note that Tom is the family name) was the tragic consequence of a police assault, leading to his subsequent suicide. Following an elaborate service at the Chinese Consulate, the funeral procession formed and proceeded through Chinatown. Then, the participants rode in carriages to the Ning Yung Chinese Cemetery at Colma, just south of San Francisco, for a final ceremony. The body was then returned to Chinatown and kept by an undertaker before being shipped home to China, as was the custom. Tom Kim Yung's suicide was {{the outcome of a}} tragic Chinatown incident. Tom was in San Francisco on special duty, having arrived from China a few months earlier, and was soon to leave for Washington, D. C. A colonel in the Chinese Army, he {{had been one of the}} imperial bodyguards. On the evening of September 13, 1903, he was returning to the Chinese Consulate on Stockton Street after dining with a merchant. Policeman John Kreamer, apparently mistaking him for a wanted man, insulted him as a degenerate. Tom resisted arrest and was punched in the face by Kreamer, falling to the ground. Another policeman, Officer Brodt, and two bypassers came to assist Kreamer, and Tom was temporarily tied to a fence by his queue, then hauled off to jail where he was held on the charge of assaulting a police officer. A local merchant had him released on bail. Tom brooded over his irreparable loss of face and the impunity of the police until September 14, when he gassed himself from the light fixtures in his room at the Consulate. He left behind a note explaining his reasons for taking his life. Accounts of the subsequent investigation reveal it to have been inadequate at best. Chew Tszchi, First Secretary of the Chinese Legation, came from Washington to attest to Tom's character, having known him in Peking. Tom's diplomatic immunity was completely ignored by the authorities. In Chinatown there was some division over Tom's guilt, and anonymous leaflets distributed during the funeral suggested that Consul General Yung Bow had ordered Tom's suicide. To prevent unrest in Chinatown, Tom's body was released to the care of a Chinese undertaker before the inquest. At the inquest, seven prominent Chinatown citizens testified on Tom's behalf. Officer Kreamer refused even to attend until finally subpoenaed by the city coroner. A verdict of suicide was reached on October 9. Despite requests from the State Department that Governor Pardee and Mayor Schmitz look into the affair, no further action was taken. The whole proceeding highlights the strong anti-Chinese feeling - amounting to open racism - that prevailed at the time. The following is a scene-by-scene description of the film: [Frame: 0797] The camera looks slightly north of east across Dupont Street (Grant Avenue today), the main street of Chinatown. The Chinese transliteration of the name was Dupon Gai, meaning "slatboard capital street. " The camera was probably located on the balcony of a building between Clay and Sacramento streets. All business in Chinatown was suspended for the day. Note the traditional ponytails, or queues, worn by Chinese men, a universal custom during the Quing (Manchu) dynasty (1644 - 1911). The procession mixes a few western elements with the full pageantry of a traditional Chinese funeral. Note that white is the color of Buddhist mourning dress and mourning relatives also wear white headbands, as do official mourners. Following three mounted police officers (not shown) come two mounted mourners [1002]. The two lanterns that follow bear the family names of the deceased [1134]. Banners precede the white military band (such bands are still in use today) [1317]. Next come twelve Tom family members carrying tablets listing the rank and titles of the deceased [1546], followed by four men in tall hats who ward off malevolent spirits [1715]. Following them are fifteen Buddhist priests in white [1840], carrying staffs with the "eight auspicious signs" of Chinese Buddhism (fish, jar, lotus, mystic knot, <b>canopy,</b> <b>umbrella,</b> conch-shell, and wheel of the law). They are followed by fifteen Taoist priests with symbolic staffs [2185]. The following carriage may contain food to be sacrificed at the cemetery [2291]. Next comes a tall banner giving the whole obituary of the deceased [2510]. Then follows the chief mourner Consul General Yung Bow attended by incense bearers [2675]. A riderless horse folows [2830], carrying the spirit of the deceased attended by two mourners. A line of San Francisco police officers precedes the hearse [3074], which is drawn by six horses and attended by mourners who are reflected in its windows [3183]. The open carriage following bears a portrait of the deceased framed by a large floral wreath [3430] (today, the carriage would be a convertible). A banner and umbrella follow, the latter customarily presented to a popular official when he leaves a district. Tall banners mounted on the following wagon display poetic epitaphs [3650] (right: "A star has fallen to earth"; left: "Your name is made famous by this bitter record") flanked by the names of sons, nephews, and cousins of the deceased, who will carry on the family name and honor. Next come representatives of the Six Companies (the federation of district associations that arbitrated justice in Chinatown). Several hold raised fans [3823]. Prominent merchants follow, flanked by horsemen [3918]. After a short cut in the film, two carriages of the immediate family of the deceased are seen [4156]. Although the film ends here, written accounts document that some one hundred and twenty-three additional carriages followed in the procession. Copyright: no reg. Duration: 2 : 19 at 12 fps.
