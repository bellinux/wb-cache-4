This study proposes a novel method {{for developing a}} kind of diamond wire saws with <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>curing</b> <b>resin</b> and spraying technique. The process of wire saw manufacturing and the selection of optimal parameters are introduced. The experiments of the slicing marble are carried out using different diamond wire saws.

The incompatibility of three-dimensional printer resins in their native form and the method to improve their compatibility to many biological processes via surface modification are reported. The compatibility of the material to build microfluidic devices was evaluated in three different ways: (i) determining if the <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>cured</b> <b>resin</b> inhibits the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), i. e. testing devices for PCR compatibility; (ii) observing agglutination complex formed {{on the surface of}} the UV <b>cured</b> <b>resin</b> when anti-C-reactive protein (CRP) antibodies and CRP proteins were allowed to agglutinate; and (iii) by culturing human embryonic kidney cell line cells and testing for its attachment and viability. It is shown that only a few among four in its native form could be used for fabrication of microchannels and that had the least effect on biological molecules that could be used for PCR and protein interactions and cells, whereas the others were used after treating the surface.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>cured</b> <b>resin</b> bond {{abrasive}} tools {{have been}} studied and proved to have substantial advantages over conventional abrasive tools. The properties of abrasive-mixed resin would affect the tool performance and accordingly the machining efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, the influences of exposure time duration under the UV light and diamond concentration on the properties of abrasive-mixed resin specimen were investigated. It was found that, generally, the cured depth and mechanical strength of the specimen increase with the exposure time but decrease with the abrasive concentration. A significant effect of curing time on the properties of abrasive-mixed resin was observed when the diamond concentration is 12. 5 wt. %. UV cured diamond wheels having the concentration of 12. 5 wt. % were manufactured with three curing time durations (40, 60 and 80 seconds) respectively. The effect of curing time on the wheel performance was studied. The experiment {{results show that the}} average surface roughness (RA) of the workpiece obtained by the wheel with the curing time of 80 s is the smallest while the highest RA is obtained by the wheel cured for 60 s. The change of RA {{can be explained by the}} relation between the tensile-strain relation and the exposure time of the abrasive-mixed resin and it can be concluded that the tensile strength and percentage of elongation have effects on the performance of the wheel while the latter has a dominant influence...|$|R

Also, to compare the flexural strength of high impact heat <b>cure</b> <b>resin</b> with regular heat <b>cure</b> <b>resin</b> denture bases. Edentulous casts with deep, medium and shallow palatal vault depth were selected. Three different moulds were made in silicone duplicating material. 12 modified casts in each group of palatal vault were made in dental stone.

A total of 36 specimens obtained were stored in water at room temperature and subjected to fracture in Universal testing machine.

The heat stability of <b>cured</b> UF <b>resins</b> synthesized under strongly acidic conditions was much higher than that of the other resins, which were prepared in weakly acidic and alkaline media. Solid-state 13 C CP/MAS NMR spectra showed that formaldehyde emission from <b>cured</b> UF <b>resins</b> after heating is mainly ascribable to decreased methylol groups and dimethylene ether linkages.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: The materials tested were self-adhesive dual <b>cure</b> <b>resin</b> modified cement and Glass Ionomer (GIC). Twenty Teflon moulds {{were divided into two}} groups of tens. The first group was injected and packed with the modified resin cement, the second group was packed with GIC. To test the solubility, each mould was weighed before and after being placed in an analytical reagent for 30 days.

Four mm sections of stainless steel bands were cemented to the exposed buccal surfaces of teeth under a constant load of 500 g.

40|$|Context: Relining {{with heat}} <b>cure</b> denture base <b>resin</b> is {{time-consuming}} {{and the patient}} has to remain without dentures within this period. Recently, some autopolymerizing resins marketed as hard chairside reline systems with low exothermic heat allow the dentists to reline prosthesis directly in the mouth. However, {{the decision to use}} these materials must be based on physical properties such as dimensional accuracy that directly influences the accuracy of fit of the denture base. Aim: The aim was to compare the linear dimensional changes of two hard chairside reline resins with two laboratory heat <b>cure</b> <b>resins</b> at 3 times intervals after processing. Settings and Design: A stainless steel split mold (International Organization for Standardization 1567) was used for sample fabrication. Five measurements of the reference dimensions (AB and CD) were measured directly from the mold and the samples with a profile projector, and mean difference were calculated. Subjects and Methods: Forty samples were fabricated by incorporating the split mold into first pour of denture flasks and packing each of the chairside reline resins ("Kooliner" and "Ufi Gel Hard") and laboratory heat <b>cure</b> <b>resins</b> ("Dental Products of India Heat Cure" and "Trevalon"). The mean difference in dimensional change at 3 times intervals (0 h, 4 days and 2 months) were calculated and subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA, RMANOVA and post hoc Tukey′s tests. Results: All resins showed different levels of significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) after processing (T 0) ranging from − 0. 128 to − 0. 310 mm. After 4 days (T 1), there was significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) ranging from − 0. 168 to − 0. 296 mm. After 2 months (T 2), there was again significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) ranging from − 0. 018 to − 0. 216 mm. Chairside reline resins showed less dimensional shrinkage at each time interval than the laboratory heat <b>cure</b> <b>resins.</b> Conclusions: Hard chairside resins are dimensionally accurate than the laboratory heat <b>cure</b> <b>resins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Curing {{reaction}} of bisphenol-A based benzoxazine with cyanate ester resin and {{the properties of}} the <b>cured</b> thermosetting <b>resin</b> were investigated. The cure behavior of benzoxazine with cyanate ester resin was monitored by model reaction using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). As a result of the model reaction, the ring opening {{reaction of}} benzoxazine ring and thermal self-cyclotrimerization of cyanate ester group occurred, and then the phenolic hydoroxyl group generated by the ring opening reaction of benzoxazine ring co-reacted with cyanate ester group. The properties of the <b>cured</b> thermosetting <b>resin</b> were estimated by mechanical properties, electrical resistivity, water resistance and heat resistance. The <b>cured</b> thermosetting <b>resin</b> from benzoxazine and cyanate ester resin showed good heat resistance, high electrical resistivity and high water resistance, compared with the <b>cured</b> thermosetting <b>resin</b> from benzoxazine and epoxy resin...|$|R
