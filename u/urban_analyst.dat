In this study the author examines the ability of each of four approaches to generate industry groups (clusters) from a regional, survey-based input - output table. Specifically, the author deals with industry groups as generated by two graph-theoretic methods and by two multivariate techniques. The degree of similarity among the groups so generated is analyzed using measures of association. The composition of the groups depends on cutoff points. Nonetheless, {{the results suggest that}} one of the graph-theoretic methods and one of the multivariate techniques produce similar clusters. Further consideration indicates that these methods reveal more of the strongest interindustry linkages than their alternatives. ...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>urban</b> <b>analysts</b> believe {{suburban}} sprawl {{has become an}} important issue be-cause it helps generate two types of problems: growth-related difficulties like rising traffic congestion, and high concentrations of poor minority households in core-area neighborhoods. However, a careful regression analysis of measures of both sprawl and urban decline shows no statistically significant relation between these two conditions. The basic nature of the American urban development process would cause core-area poverty concentrations even if sprawl were replaced by more compact growth forms. But sprawl does aggravate growth-related problems. Those problems could be attacked through either alternative overall growth strategiesÐsuch as high-density, tightly bounded growthÐor specific anti-sprawl tactics, such as regional tax-base sharing and regional coordination of land uses. But no feasible policies are likely either to alleviate traffic congestion much or cause most American regions to abandon sprawl...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{convergence}} of more socially progressive transport policy, and an intentional focus on the gender aspects of development, has lead to an increasing awareness {{of the ways in}} which transport systems and interventions fail to adequately address the needs of travelling women. Yet addressing women's specific travel needs appears to be crucial in achieving poverty reduction and social development goals. Research on gender and transport in developing countries has to date mostly focused on rural areas, at least partly because there is a paucity of analytical tools and methods for studying gender aspects of urban travel.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} among <b>urban</b> <b>analysts</b> that inner-city neighborhoods suffer {{from a lack of}} social capital. Because these areas do not have a strong social infrastructure in place to support successful revitalization efforts, urban policy recommendations now call for developing social capital in the worst-off parts of our cities. However, this consensus has been reached without any empirical analysis of the effect of social capital on urban neighborhoods. Moreover, there have been few, if any, efforts to show how to measure social capital at a neighborhood level. This article proposes a social capital model of neighborhood change that measures social capital as a function of two constitutive elements: sociocultural milieu and institutional infrastructure. In addition, we present a theoretical model to show how social capital affects neighborhood stability and an empirical analysis that provides evidence of the positive effect social capital has on neighborhood stability...|$|R

40|$|Most {{scholarship}} {{by economic}} geographers and regional scientists assumes that urban {{economic growth is}} driven by change in the export base, i. e. locally-produced goods and services that are exported. In this paper, we argue that the consumption base of urban regions, i. e. goods and services that are locally produced and locally consumed, {{can also be a}} source of regional job growth and stability. Our argument critiques both the logic of the export base model, echoing some long-standing caveats, and the conventions used to operationalize it, particularly the short cut in which high concentrations of jobs in certain industries are used to proxy for export activity. We propose that <b>urban</b> <b>analysts</b> use a related measure, the coefficient of localization across metro areas, as a way of detecting distinctiveness in economic activities among metros and without assuming that highly distinctive ones reflect export rather than local orientation. We argue that the local consumption base can be a source of growth for several reasons. First, changes in regional tastes and preferences and thus in consumer spending in favor of goods and services that are locally produced can produce job growth without any expansion in the export base. This phenomenon is much broader than economists...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{historical}} {{changes in}} economic {{structure and the}} spatial distribution of jobs and commuting patterns {{during a period of}} consolidating suburban decentralisation in US cities. The analysis of selected US metropolitan areas is based on data drawn from the 1980 and 1990 PUMS (public use microdata samples). First, the paper compares changes in employment composition between regions and between two geographical sub-divisions in each of the metropolitan areas: the suburb and the central city. A diversity index is then measured for suburbs and central cities and an intertemporal comparison is made. Finally, changes in travel characteristics are discussed and analysed by industrial sector and geographical sub-division. The analysis shows a strong growth of suburban cities compared with central cities in each region, increased urbanisation economies in suburban cities and the dominance of suburb-to-suburb commuting. The historical pattern gives <b>urban</b> <b>analysts</b> and planners in Europe and elsewhere much to think about: in particular, the self-reinforcing nature of suburban agglomeration economies, the influence of growing suburban employment centres on commute patterns, the growth of centre-to-suburb commutes and the dominance of suburb-to-suburb commutes; and the ability of cities to reshape themselves as individual firms and households adopt strategies that lower the costs of transacting labour, services and all manner of commodities. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Despite Birmingham's {{claim to}} {{constitute}} `England's second city', it has arguably been overlooked in much recent academic research - {{perhaps because of}} a tendency to regard Manchester as the paradigmatic English example of the emerging post‐industrial city‐region. Contributors to CITY have gone some way to redressing this imbalance - with Frank Webster's paper in vol 5 no 1 and Kevin Ward's paper in vol 7 no 2 underlining the wider {{issues raised by the}} adoption of `urban entrepreneurialism' in Birmingham. This paper, by Libby Porter and Austin Barber, takes forward such concerns through a case study of the ongoing regeneration of an individual district of the city: Birmingham Eastside. Using the stories of two pubs, whose fortunes are permanently re‐shaped by state‐led development initiatives, the paper develops a critical reflection on academic and policy debates relating to gentrification and the restructuring of central districts of large cities. In particular, the authors highlight how current thinking about the regeneration of inner city districts marginalizes the socio‐cultural meaning of place and the human networks that animate city places. They argue that this constrains planning possibilities and imaginations for the area's future. The paper's concluding call for <b>urban</b> <b>analysts</b> and planners alike to go beyond the economic when examining the processes and effects of urban change resonates with much work previously published in CITY.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{preliminary}} analysis of pre-school services, a field which, {{with a few}} exceptions (Holmes, Williams and Brown, 1972; Freeman, 1977) has been ignored by geographers and indeed other <b>urban</b> <b>analysts</b> concermd with service allocations in cities. There are numerous possible explanations for this state of affairs, not the least inportant being the fact that study of the under-fives has been dominated by psychologists concerned with the intellectual, emotional and social development of young children. Furthermore, as this paper reveals, numerous elements need to be integrated to analyse this problem froma spatial perspective - accessibility indices within cities, the social structure of neighbourhoods, the operation of the local political syston and the development of social policy at the national and international level. Various authors have examined these issues in isolation but few have brought the necessary synthesis for a spatial view of pre-school services. It must also be remembered that there are in any case relatively few 'official' pre-school facilities so that inevitably the major items of expenditure in the fields, of housing, transportation, social services and the like have received the lions share of attention. However, the major reason must be the fact that these services primarily affect the lives of women and in common with all such issues have been neglected by geographers. Despite a number of recent pleas for a redress of this imbalance (eg. Monck & Hanson, 1982) there has so far been relatively little empirical research (eg. Tivers, 1977). One final difficulty is that the complex almost chaotic nature of pre-school services makes the collection of ccnprehensive data extremely difficult.

40|$|Accelerated {{urbanization}} in Africa {{has produced}} cities whose formal physical, {{political and social}} infrastructures are largely unable to absorb, apprehend or utilize the needs, aspirations and resourcefulness of those who live within them. As a result, the efforts to secure livelihood depend upon largely informalised processes and {{a wide range of}} provisional and ephemeral institutions which cultivate specific orientations toward, knowledge of, and practices for dealing with urban life. Soon, the majority of Africans will live in peri-urban and informal settlements, often at the physical and social margins of the city. Yet, marginalization from security of tenure, formal livelihood, and, frequently, participation in viable urban political institutions converges with new modalities of urban social production which frequently confound clear readings of the motivations and effects of various forms of collective action undertaken in the public sphere. At the same time, African cities are sites for multifaceted development and governance interventions which make largely uninspired efforts to engage such practices and institutions. Even the efforts of civil society organizations operating under the umbrella of their promotion of ‘active citizenship’ tend to impose an ineffectual normative. What I attempt to do here is discuss a range of orientations to the city and an ambivalence about the city which seems to pervade how residents in many African cities use it and what they do within it. This is an ambivalence largely about whether the city belongs to them, where the African city can best be made, and to what extent the city is a place for the reinvention of social solidarity or a circumvention of solidarity. While <b>urban</b> <b>analysts</b> have tended to focus on how such African cities are marginal within urban systems, the primary focus in this article is to begin, in a very provisional way, to identify strategic operations and sensibilities being put together to help African urban residents ‘navigate’ disparate positionalities within both local and global networks of power. These efforts at navigation give rise to particular notions of citizenship and collective responsibility whose ‘containment’ within clearly demarcated urban identities, municipal domains, and practices of urban politics becomes increasingly problematic...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{participatory}} budgeting has been often {{regarded as an}} example of an alternative urban policy experience, detached from the entrepreneurial mainstream. Despite its increasing popularity amongst <b>urban</b> policy <b>analysts,</b> activists and practitioners, however, few works have effectively assessed the actual “alternative” character of policy practices carrying the {{participatory budgeting}} label in different urban contexts. This paper engages in such a critical assessment. We first build an analytical framework theoretically informed by Lefebvre’s conceptualisation of the “right to the city” as well as by elements put forward in the critical literature on citizens’ participation in urban policy-making. We then apply this framework to examine participatory budgeting practices in two different urban contexts, namely Cordoba in Southern Spain and Sopot in Northern Poland. Our findings suggest that the capacity of participatory budgeting to constitute an alternative to urban entrepreneurialism is conditioned by a number of intricate aspects. Although the model travels intensively around the globe as a benchmark for “alternative” policy, the actual practices of participatory budgeting may follow aims and produce results that are in fact to a large extent in tune with urban entrepreneurialism.

40|$|A {{framework}} for generating social networks is first presented and then illustrated {{by means of}} the attitudes towards urban systems analysis elicited from a group of experts in this field. The framework is based upon the notion of constructing networks from relations on two different sets of elements, and from this approach emerges the idea of primal and dual social networks. Such networks have close parallels in the structural analysis of social relations known as Q -analysis developed by Atkin (1974), and thus it is suggested that this analysis be used to implement the formal theory in empirical terms. The data set used was collected at a meeting of <b>urban</b> systems <b>analysts</b> held in Oxford in 1980, and this consists of the attitudes of a set of sixteen analysts towards the importance of various factors and fields affecting the development of this area. From the data, it is possible to derive a variety of networks: primal networks relating actors to one another, and duals relating factors and fields. Q -analysis is used to examine the resulting structures and this reveals that the well-known hypothesis of strong consensus in such expert groups is borne out. There is little structural differentiation between actors, but considerable differentiation among factors and fields. In conclusion, certain directions for future research are established. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: This article {{describes}} a new methodological framework {{to account for}} urban material flows and stocks, using material flow accounting (MFA) as the underlying method. The proposed model, <b>urban</b> metabolism <b>analyst</b> (UMAn), bridges seven major gaps in previous urban metabolism studies: lack of a unified methodology; lack of material flows data at the urban level; limited categorizations of material types; limited results about material flows as they are related to economic activities; limited understanding of the origin and destination of flows; lack of understanding about the dynamics of added stock; and {{lack of knowledge about}} the magnitude of the flow of materials that are imported and then, to a great extent, exported. To explore and validate the UMAn model, a case study of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area was used. An annual time series of material flows from 2003 to 2009 is disaggregated by the model into 28 material types, 55 economic activity categories, and 18 municipalities. Additionally, an annual projection of the obsolescence of materials for 2010 - 2050 was performed. The results of the case study validate the proposed methodology, which broadens the contribution of existing urban MFA studies and presents pioneering information in the field of urban metabolism. In particular, the model associates material flows with economic activities and their spatial location within the urban area...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an urban land-use-demand {{forecast}} model using a metropolitan input – output model and gravity-type spatial interaction models. The feasibility of the proposed model is tested with actual data from the Seoul metropolitan area by estimating the effects of urban-growth-control policy on urban economy, employment, population, and land-use demand. Three main features are highlighted: (1) the proposed model can estimate and project urban land-use demand on a firm theoretical foundation because land-use demand is determined by the interindustrial and interspatial relations of production, income formation, and consumption through metropolitan input – output multipliers; (2) the proposed model has practical advantages over other urban land-use models in terms of operational cost because it is relatively easy to operate within the input – output framework and it has fewer requirements of data and parameter calibration; and (3) the proposed model has the capability to incorporate changes in attractiveness, accessibility, land availability, and other policy variables in projecting and estimating urban land-use demand, which is an important feature for policy evaluation. The simulation results prove the feasibility of the proposed model as an urban-policy evaluation tool, which provides significant implications to <b>urban</b> policy <b>analysts.</b> The simulation results indicate that a growth-control policy decreases output and employment for the overall urban economy. The model results also show that a city with a growth-control policy is negatively impacted with regards to output, employment, population, and residential and nonresidential land-use demand, whereas the surrounding cities receive positive spillover effects due to the land-use regulation. ...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{household}} {{data can}} have considerable advantages over much more widely used cross-sectional data for capturing dynamic demographic relationships. Because {{the collection of}} longitudinal data may be difficult and expensive, analysts need to assess {{the magnitude of the}} particular problems associated with longitudinal but not with cross-sectional data. One problem that has concerned many analysts is that sample attrition may make the interpretation of estimates problematic. Such attrition may be particularly severe in areas where there is considerable migration between rural and <b>urban</b> areas. Many <b>analysts</b> share the intuition that attrition is likely to be selective on characteristics such as schooling and thus that high attrition is likely to bias estimates. This paper considers the extent and implications of attrition for three longitudinal household surveys from Bolivia, Kenya, and South Africa that report very high per-year attrition rates between survey rounds. Our estimates indicate that: (a) the means for a number of critical outcome and family background variables differ significantly between those who are lost to follow-up and those who are re-interviewed; (b) a number of family background variables are significant predictors of attrition; but (c) nevertheless, the coefficient estimates for standard family background variables in regressions and probit equations {{for the majority of the}} outcome variables in all three data sets are not affected significantly by attrition. Therefore, attrition apparently is not a general problem for obtaining consistent estimates of the coefficients of interest for most of these outcomes. These results, which are very similar to those for developed countries, suggest that multivariate estimates of behavioral relations may not be biased due to attrition and thus support the collection of longitudinal data. attrition, developing countries, longitudinal surveys, panel data...|$|R

40|$|While {{few will}} {{disagree}} that sound forecasts are an essential prerequisite to rational transportation planning and analysis, {{the making of}} these forecasts has become a complex problem with the broadening of the scope and variety of transportation decisions. Until recently, the forecasting methods available addressed the issues which were important {{a couple of decades}} ago. These methods attempted to predict the amount and in some cases character of travel to be used in designing major highways, transit facilities, seaport facilities, and airports. However, today's issues to be addressed in transportation are much broader and more complex. For example, in the modern process of transportation planning, the decision-maker is concerned with the broad range of social, economic and environmental effects, equity issues, wider range of options including not building major facilities, resource constraints such as energy, and increased public participation in the planning process in general. The complexity of the problem has necessitated the planner's developing improved methods of forecasting the demand for transportation at all levels and by all modes. While significant contributions have been made recently to the development of improved methods in forecasting, we are still a long way from possessing tools which provide our decision-makers with more effective, that is, more useful, accurate and timely information. The purpose of this report is to present a very brief overview of the current and emerging air transportation forecasting methods with the aim of identifying areas which need further research. Throughout the report, the object is to indicate future directions for research into transportation forecasting methods which are more responsive to today's issues. For example, it is clear from reviewing the literature that tremendous improvements in travel forecasting methods can be achieved through deeper understanding of the traveler's behavior, under a range of conditions, development of models which are more policy-responsive and development of improved data bases. Peculiarities of the airline industry and aviation in general cause many standard techniques of economic and managerial analyses to break down. Air travel demand is unique in that even the sophisticated techniques developed by <b>urban</b> transportation <b>analysts</b> are often not directly applicable to modelling the demand for air transportation. Econometricians usually do not have specific training in air transportation. Airline managers, on the other hand, quite often do not have the technical background necessary to fully understand many highly detailed and complex models. In order to develop sophisticated yet user-oriented models, an analyst must have background in several areas. It is hoped that the material presented in this report will help bridge the gap between managerial and technical personnel and provide some new directions for air travel demand modelling. Generally speaking, there are two broad categories of forecasting methods. The quantitative group is composed of techniques which rely on the existence of historical data, and which assume that the historical trend will be expected to continue in the future. This group is further divided into two classes, time-series methods and causal methods. The quantitative techniques are by far the most widely used and contain such popular methodologies as moving averages, classical decomposition analysis, spectral analysis, adaptive filtering and Box-Jenkins methods under the category of time-series analysis. The causal methods contain such favorites as modelling classical consumer behavior through regression models and more recent applications in transportation demand analysis of Bayesian analysis, Markov chains, input-output analysis, simulation methods and control theory models. The second group of forecasting methods is qualitative in nature. The techniques in this group are used when none or very little historical data exists, or when the underlying trend of the historical data is expected to change. Qualitative techniques have in general been applied to project future technological developments and their impacts are described in literature as "technological forecasting methods. " The group is further divided into two classes, exploratory and normative methods. The exploratory methods start with today's knowledge and its orientation and trends and seek to predict what will happen in the future and when. On the other hand, normative methods seek first to assess the organization's goals and objectives and then work backwards to identify new developments which will most likely lead to the achievement of these goals. Familiar examples of exploratory methods are the envelope, logistic or S-curve, the Delphi technique and morphological analysis. Examples of methods used to perform normative forecasting are relevance trees and cross impact analysis. Although this classification scheme is consistent with the way that many forecasters might differentiate models, {{it is by no means}} unique. Other and perhaps better classification schemes exist. For the purposes of this report we will not attempt to define a particular classification but present five broad areas which show the greatest potential for improving our capabilities of modelling the demand for air transportation. These areas are: technological forecasting, time-series models, control theory models, econometric models and simulation models. Each of the general techniques are reviewed, and specific examples are presented where relevant. Excessive mathematical detail was avoided in order to make this work easily understandable by managers and others who might not have a rigorous analytical background. Since a number of models discussed in the report require extensive computer modelling, we have included a few computer programs in the appendices to make the report more user-oriented.
