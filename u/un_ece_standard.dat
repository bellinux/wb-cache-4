30|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} Since 1990, the <b>UN</b> <b>ECE</b> Heavy Metals in Mosses Surveys provide data {{inventories}} of the atmospheric heavy metal bioaccumulation across national boundaries in Europe. The results prove how air pollution control in Germany and in all of Europe affected the bioaccumulation of metals in those ecosystems that are not directly influenced by nearby emission sources. This article focuses on the assessment of spatiotemporal patterns of the metal bioaccumulation in Germany since 1990. Furthermore, the spatial variance of the metal bioaccumulation is analysed with regard to sampling site-specific and regional land characteristics. Special focus hereby relies on the correlation of the metal concentration in mosses and in depositions. Hence, the moss surveys contribute to §[*] 12 of the German Federal Nature Conservation Act {{as well as to}} the “Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution” (CLRTAP).|$|R

This eventually became the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, which began to promulgate what would eventually become the <b>UN's</b> <b>ECE</b> Regulations on vehicle design, construction, and safety performance. Although most of the world's countries accept or require ECE-compliant vehicles—either as official signatories to ECE regulations or by national regulations effectively identical to ECE—the United States, virtually alone in the world, has declined to join the forum or accept ECE regulations, and blocks the importation of vehicles built to international ECE Regulations rather than the U.S. safety regulations.|$|R

Therefore the important questions are how to provide correct geospatial positioning values and how to support the gathering of useful data in extreme field situations by implementing a mobile GIS prototype. The whole project discussed in this thesis was initiated by the “Institute of Distributed and Multimedia Systems” (Faculty of Computer Sciences) through the “Austrian GRID” initiative in a close collaboration with the Umweltbundesamt, the “Federal Environment Agency of Austria”. An environmental observation area in the national park “Northern Calcareous Alps” in Upper Austria, called „Zöbelboden“ was chosen to test the accuracy of GPS signals and according positioning data in forested or mountainous areas {{as well as to}} study the advantages and benefits of using mobile devices in outdoor situations and free nature. This area, a part of the <b>UN</b> <b>ECE’s</b> Integrated Monitoring Programme, is used for long-term environmental data in selected observation areas. Exactly this project is a multi-disciplinary International Cooperative Programme (ICP) on Integrated Monitoring (IM) of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems, which covers regions of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (<b>UN</b> <b>ECE).</b> In this master thesis a prototype will be introduced which allows capturing the desired ecological data digitally using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). An easy-to-use application based on ESRI’s ArcPad Application Developer has been developed for use on Windows Mobile PocketPCs which integrates the Umweltbundesamt’s own ESRI data layers. Thus, the mobile device is prepared for data integration into a data GRID infrastructure of the Umweltbundesamt. This new prototype is a GPS-assisted client, which enables location-awareness and further allows mobile users to augment the collected data with comments, digital photos, digital audio, or even small movies of artifacts, like trees and other plants.
