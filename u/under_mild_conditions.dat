25|$|Silyl ethers are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds which contain a silicon atom covalently bonded to an alkoxy group. The general structure is R1R2R3Si−O−R4 where R4 is an alkyl group or an aryl group. Silyl ethers are usually used as protecting groups for alcohols in organic synthesis. Since R1R2R3 can be combinations of differing groups which can be varied {{in order to provide}} a number of silyl ethers, this group of chemical compounds provides a wide spectrum of selectivity for protecting group chemistry. Common silyl ethers are: trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS/TBDMS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). They are particularly useful because they can be installed and removed very selectively <b>under</b> <b>mild</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
500|$|Most {{functions}} {{that occur in}} practice have derivatives at all points or at almost every point. [...] Early {{in the history of}} calculus, many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points. [...] <b>Under</b> <b>mild</b> <b>conditions,</b> for example if the function is a monotone function or a Lipschitz function, this is true. [...] However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. [...] This example is now known as the Weierstrass function. [...] In 1931, Stefan Banach proved that the set of {{functions that}} have a derivative at some point is a meager set in the space of all continuous functions. Informally, this means that hardly any continuous functions have a derivative at even one point.|$|E
