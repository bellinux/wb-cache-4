5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an <b>ultradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E
50|$|Empirically, it is a <b>ultradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> of {{approximately}} 90 minutes (80-120 minutes) that {{is characterized by}} different level of excitement and rest.

50|$|In chronobiology, an <b>ultradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> is a {{recurrent}} period or cycle repeated throughout a 24-hour day. In contrast, circadian rhythms complete one cycle daily, while infradian rhythms {{such as the}} human menstrual cycle have periods longer than a day. The Oxford English Dictionary's definition of Ultradian specifies that it refers to cycles with a period shorter than a day but longer than an hour.|$|E
5000|$|Other <b>ultradian</b> <b>rhythms</b> include blood circulation, blinking, pulse, {{hormonal}} secretions such as growth hormone, heart rate, thermoregulation, micturition, bowel activity, nostril dilation, appetite, and arousal. <b>Ultradian</b> <b>rhythms</b> {{of appetite}} require antiphasic release of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), stimulating and inhibiting appetite <b>ultradian</b> <b>rhythms.</b> [...] Recently, <b>ultradian</b> <b>rhythms</b> of arousal lasting approximately 4 hours {{were attributed to}} the dopaminergic system in mammals.

We designed a novel, non-spectral-analysis method of separating ultradian from circadian components and applied it to a published gene expression dataset with an ultradian sampling resolution. <b>Ultradian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in mouse hepatocytes in vivo have been published, and we validated our approach using this control by confirming 175 of 323 ultradian genes identified in a prior study and found 862 additional ultradian genes. For the first time, we now report ultradian expression of > 900 genes in vitro Sixty genes exhibited ultradian transcriptional rhythmicity, both in vivo and in vitro, including 5 genes involved in the cell cycle. Within these 60 genes, we identified significant enrichment of specific DNA motifs in the 1000 bp proximal promotor, some of which associate with known transcriptional factors.

Merril. was recorded {{with a picture}} analysis method using a video camera and a computer. The periods are in the minute range and depend strongly on temperature. The phosphatidyl inositol signal chain might {{be involved in the}} <b>ultradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> of the lateral leaflet movement of Desmodium motorium: Myoinositol shortens the period length and reduces the known period lengthening effect of lithium ions. Neomycin, which inhibits the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -biphosphate to inositol- 4 -phosphate and diacylglycerin, lengthens the period of the rhythm at low concentrations (0 · 2 mM). Higher concentrations shorten the period, perhaps by activating G protein. Mastoparan, which activates G protein, shortens period likewise. The G protein agonists fluorid ion and ethanol are toxic for the lateral leaflets and could therefore not be used to test the involvement of G protein. The intracellular Ca 2 + antagonist 3, 4, 5 -trinietlioxybeiizoic acid 8 -(diethylamino) octylester lengthens the period of the rhythm. This indicates, that release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores is important for the lateral leaflet movement rhythm...|$|E
