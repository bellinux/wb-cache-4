5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian {{research}} unit of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices. concluded that the major driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets <b>under</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E

40|$|These three {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} examine the effects of verbal reinforcement combinations on one of sensory-motor learnings, that is, maze learning, in the 2 nd grade normal children. In the experiment 1, two alternative maze with 9 choice units as Maze A was used, and in the experiment 2, three alternative maze with 9 choice units as Maze B was used. Ss learned one of the mazes <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> closed eyes or <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> open eyes. In the experiment 3, two alternative maze with 7 choice units as Maze C was used and Ss learned the maze <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> closed eyes. In each choice points Ss were asked to choose one of two or three alternatives which they thought correct and to make their finger run along the chosen way of the maze. One of two or three alternatives was set as correct value. After each chose Ss were reinforced according to the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> combinations of verbal reinforcement, that is, RW, RN and NW. We defined the criterion of learning as the state of all correct responses in a trial with 9 or 7 choice points. After the acquisition, 10 trials were continued without any reinforcement, that is, extinction. The results were as follows : 1. In the experiment 1. it was observed that the learning was easier <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> open eyes than <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> closed eyes. The difference between rates of error responses <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> open eyes and those <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> closed eyes increased with trials. There was a tendency that RW and NW were more effective than RN on learning. The rates of rerror responses in extinction suggested that N was scarecely effective in all groups except NW group <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> closed eyes. 2. In the experiment 2, there was a tendency that learning <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> open eyes was easier than <b>under</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> closed eyes.

5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} exceptions to this general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation <b>under</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability <b>under</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> thermal loading.|$|E
5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, <b>under</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions.

This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
