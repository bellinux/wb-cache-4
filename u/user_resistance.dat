40|$|<b>User</b> <b>resistance</b> is an {{important}} issue in the implementation of an Enterprise System (ES). However, despite the prevalence of user adoption literature, <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> literature is scarce. Although some studies have conceptualized <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> as the opposite of user adoption, a mandatory, role-transforming system such as an ES clearly shows that users may use a system while resisting it. Although this area is highly relevant, it is theoretically underdeveloped. This study examines <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> at the individual level of analysis to determine the underlying reasons for <b>user</b> <b>resistance,</b> the types of resistant behaviors, and the management strategies to minimize resistance. It also seeks to understand the types of users that exist during an implementation and in particular, the groups of resisters. This dissertation identifies four categories of reasons for <b>user</b> <b>resistance,</b> which comprise a total of twelve reasons for <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> Resistant behaviors are also identified and classified. Three categories of management strategies are also identified, comprising a total of eight management strategies that are useful in minimizing <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> Groups of ES users are also described and examined...|$|E

Cross-sectional data was collected from 357 managers involved in the maritime industry in Malaysia using a set of self-reporting questionnaire. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results indicate that task-technology fit is a predictor of Intranet usage, however does not predict perceived <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> This study also suggests that Intranet usage does not predict perceived <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> Perceived <b>user</b> <b>resistance,</b> however is a predictor of <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> Both <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> and Intranet usage are predictors of managers’ performance.

This study {{investigated}} the relationships between <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> to new information systems and other factors, the chief {{of which was the}} differences in cognitive problem-solving styles between systems developers (analysts) and users. In addition, associations were tested between <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> and the following: system accuracy, system reliability, the analyst's attitude, the analyst-user relationship, analyst-user dissonance, the user's age and the user's length of service with his current employer. All data was collected at confidential interviews with the key users and key analysts of 34 post-implementation systems service were recorded at these interviews. Ages and lengths of <b>User</b> <b>resistance</b> was determined from the number of complaints made by users regarding the systems and their manner of implementation.

40|$|<b>User</b> <b>resistance</b> to Information Systems (IS) {{implementation}} {{has been}} identified as a salient reason for the failure of new IS and hence needs to be understood and managed. While previous research has explored the reasons for <b>user</b> <b>resistance,</b> there are gaps in our understanding of how users evaluate change related to a new IS and decide to resist it. Particularly, missing in the explanation of user decision making is the concept of status quo bias i. e., <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> can be due to the bias or preference to stay with the current situation. Motivated thus, this study develops a model to explain <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> prior to a new IS implementation by integrating the technology acceptance and resistance literatures with the status quo bias perspective. The results of testing the model {{in the context of a}} new enterprise system implementation indicate the central role of switching costs in increasing <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> Further, switching costs also mediate the relationship between other antecedents (colleague opinion and self-efficacy for change) and <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> Additionally, perceived value and organizational support for change are found to reduce <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> This research advances the theoretical understanding of user acceptance and resistance prior to a new IS implementation and offers organizations suggestions for managing such resistance...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} success {{factors for}} the {{implementation}} of „Lean ‟ concepts is the successful introduction of Information Systems (IS).

Drawing from prior research on IS and Lean resistance the preliminary findings suggest that Lean IS implementation is not very different from other IS implementations, confirming prior research in this area. However, it also contributes new findings. First, the results showed that information transparency may {{play an important role in}} two ways, both as a trigger for <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> and as a strategy to overcome <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> It therefore balances negative and positive effects of <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> Second, we found that the order of implementation may have a more significant impact on implementation success than suggested in prior literature...|$|E

This research offers several salient findings. First, it shows that user experience positively moderates the relationship between uncertainty costs (one type of switching cost) and <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> It also negatively moderates the association between perceived value and <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> Second, the research test results demonstrate that users with a high degree of prior experience with the voice user interface of other smart devices exhibit low <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> to change to the voice user interface in an IVI system. Third, we show that three types of switching costs (transition costs, in particular) may directly influence users to resist a change to the voice user interface. Fourth, our test results empirically demonstrate that both switching costs and perceived value affect <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> to change in the context of an IVI system, which differs from the traditional IS research setting (i. e. enterprise systems).

40|$|When an {{enterprise}} system is implemented employees often respond with <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> behavior.

40|$|Abstract—Linear {{discriminant}} analysis (LDA) {{has been widely}} adopted to classify event-related potential (ERP) in brain–computer interface (BCI). Good classification performance of the ERPbased BCI usually requires sufficient data recordings for effective training of the LDA classifier, and hence a long system calibration time which however may depress the system practicability and cause the <b>users</b> <b>resistance</b> to the BCI system. In this study, we introduce a spatial-temporal {{discriminant analysis}} (STDA) to ERP classification. As a multiway extension of the LDA, the STDA method tries to maximize the discriminant information between target and nontarget classes through finding two projection matrices from spatial and temporal dimensions collaboratively, which reduces effectively the feature dimensionality in the discriminant analysis, and hence decreases significantly the number of required training samples. The proposed STDA method was validated with dataset II of the BCI Competition III and dataset recorded from our own experiments, and compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms for ERP classification. Online experiments were additionally implemented for the validation. The superior classification performance in using few training samples shows that the STDA is effective to reduce the system calibration time and improve the classification accuracy, thereby enhancing the practicability of ERP-based BCI.

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for address-ing issues {{that are related to}} organizational changes that are induced by the introduction of an Information System within an organization. Specifically, we focus on the effects of a Workflow Technology because its introduction affects typical work practices, its use is mandatory, and Workflow Technology often makes it necessary to accomplish work activities in a more rigid way. Similar to other Information Systems, the con-sequence is that changes brought about because of Workflow Technology can trigger the phenomenon of <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> The Information Systems literature reports different strategies to limit the degree of <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> toward Information Systems. Some of these strategies are based on the direct involvement of the designers of the technology, while others involve the managers of the organizations in which the technology is used. In this paper, we propose the Workflow Evaluation Software, a tool that actively involves the end users to reduce the effects of <b>user</b> <b>resistance.</b> In fact, this tool allows to simulate the use of Workflow Technology at an early stage of its implementation by focusing on the coordination aspects of <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> that are related to how people coordinate their activities. Based on the data collected, the tool implements the Activity Circle, which is a social visualization mechanism that distributes the information related to the coordination aspects of <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> among the users. We claim that the sharing of this information gives voices to the users and could represent {{one of the most promising}} strategies for reducing frustration and anger about any organizational change...|$|E

However, {{one of the}} factors frequently cited as the major reason for the failure of ERP system in post implementation is “User Resistance”. ERP implementation doesn’t finish after Go-Live, instead the real test of system starts when user begins using the system. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> factors in ERP post implementation stage and the influence between the factors associated with the research model, then to provide recommendations and guideline to avoid <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> in ERP post implementation. To achieve this objectives quantitative method were conducted with 95 ERP end users. Correlation analysis is used to investigate the influence between user resistances as well as mean, std. deviation and rank.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is driven by}} the assumption made in several <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> studies that employees are generally resistant to change. It investigates the extent to which employees' resistance to IT-induced change is caused by individuals' predisposition to resist change. We develop a model of <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> that assumes the influence of dispositional resistance to change on perceptual resistance to change, perceived ease of use, and usefulness, which in turn influence <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> behavior. Using an empirical study of 106 HR employees forced to use a new human resources information system, the analysis reveals that 17. 0 to 22. 1 {{percent of the variance in}} perceived ease of use, usefulness, and perceptual resistance to change can be explained by the dispositional inclination to change initiatives. The four dimensions of dispositional resistance to change - routine seeking, emotional reaction, short-term focus and cognitive rigidity - have an even stronger effect than other common individual variables, such as age, gender, or working experiences. We conclude that dispositional resistance to change is an example of an individual difference that is instrumental in explaining a large proportion of the variance in beliefs about and <b>user</b> <b>resistance</b> to mandatory IS in organizations, which has implications for theory, practice, and future research...|$|E

40|$|Under the {{paradigm}} shift toward smart tourism, the exhibition industry is making efforts to introduce innovative technologies {{that can provide}} more diverse and valuable experiences to attendees. However, various new information technologies have failed in a market in practice due to the <b>user’s</b> <b>resistance</b> against it. Since innovative technology, such as booth recommender systems (BRS), is changing, creating uncertainty among consumers, consumer’s resistance to innovative technology {{can be considered a}} normal reaction. Therefore, it is important for a company to understand the psychological aspect of the consumer’s resistance and make measures to overcome the resistance. Accordingly, based on the model of Kim and Kankanhalli (2009), by applying the perceived value, the technology acceptance model, and the status quo bias theory, this study focused on the importance of self-efficacy and technical support in the context of using BRS. To do this purpose, a total of 455 survey data that was collected from “Korea franchise exhibition” attendees were used to analyze the proposed model. Structural equation modeling was applied for data analysis. The result shows that perceived value was affected by relative advantage and switching cost, also switching cost reduced the perceived value. However, self-efficacy reduced the switching cost, thereby decreasing the resistance of exhibition attendees. In addition, technical support increased the relative advantage switching cost and the perceived value. Exhibition attendee’s resistance was significantly negatively affected by perceived value, and positively affected by switching cost. The results will provide balanced viewpoints between the relative advantage and switching cost for exhibition marketers, helping to strengthen the competitiveness in terms of sustainable tourism of exhibition...|$|R

In this paper we present a phase-II clinical validation of a robotic exoskeleton in treating subacute post-stroke patients. Methods: Seventeen post-stroke patients participated in 10 daily rehabilitation sessions using the NEUROExos Elbow Module exoskeleton, each one lasting 45 min: the exercises consisted of isokinetic passive mobilization of the elbow, with torque threshold to detect excessive <b>user's</b> <b>resistance</b> to the movement. We investigated the safety by reporting possible adverse events, such as mechanical, electrical or software failures of the device or injuries or pain experienced by the patient. As regards the efficacy, the Modified Ashworth Scale, was identified as primary outcome measure and the NEEM metrics describing elbow joint resistance to passive extension (i. e., maximum extension torque and zero-torque angle) as secondary outcomes. Results: During the entire duration of the treatments no failures or adverse events for the patients were reported. No statistically significant differences were found in the Modified Ashworth Scale scores, between pre-treatment and post-treatment and between post-treatment and follow-up sessions, indicating the absence of spasticity increase throughout (14 days) and after (3 - 4 months follow-up) the treatment. Exoskeleton metrics confirmed the absence of significant difference in between pre- and post-treatment data, whereas intra-session data highlighted significant differences in the secondary outcomes, toward a decrease of the subject's joint resistance. Conclusions: The results show that our robotic exoskeleton can be safely used for prolonged sessions in post-stroke and suggest that intensive early rehabilitation treatment may prevent the occurrence of spasticity at a later stage. Moreover, the NEEM metrics were found to be reliable compared to the Modified Ashworth Scale and sensitive to revealing intra-session changes of elbow resistance to passive extension, in agreement with clinical evidences...|$|R
