5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>has</b> the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>has</b> increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E

5|$|The <b>US</b> <b>has</b> {{not had a}} {{diplomatic}} mission in Somalia since {{the closure of the}} embassy in 1991. Nonetheless, the US never officially severed diplomatic relations with Somalia. The US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya serves as a base for the US diplomatic mission to Somalia, which is currently led by the US Special Representative on Somalia James McAnulty.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 study {{released}} by the U.S. Department of Energy noted that the capacity factor of new wind installations was increasing as the technology improves, and projected further improvements for future capacity factors. In 2010, the department estimated the capacity factor of new wind turbines in 2010 to be 45%. The annual average capacity factor for wind generation in the <b>US</b> <b>has</b> varied between 29.8% and 34.0% during the period 2010–2015.|$|E
5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the <b>US</b> <b>has</b> dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E

6000|$|It {{all came}} back as they talked,--that buoyant {{world of the}} reaper and the binder, when {{harvesting}} {{was a kind of}} Homeric game in which, with rake and scythe, these lusty young sons of the East contended for supremacy in the field.

5000|$|The police faced {{severe and}} broad {{criticism}} for their reaction, with an American Civil Liberties Union spokesperson {{saying that it}} was [...] "nothing less than an orchestrated police riot." [...] Several primary witnesses reported unnecessarily violent actions and police abuses, including firing on reporters and people obeying police commands. Police responded that their response was [...] "outstanding" [...] and [...] "clearly disciplined." [...] De la Rocha said of the incident, [...] "I don't care what fucking television stations said, that the violence was caused by the people at the concert; those motherfuckers unloaded on this crowd. And I think it's ridiculous considering, you know, none of <b>us</b> <b>had</b> rubber bullets, none of <b>us</b> <b>had</b> M16s, none of <b>us</b> <b>had</b> billy clubs, none of <b>us</b> <b>had</b> face shields." ...|$|R
5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the <b>US</b> <b>has</b> improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E
5|$|Kagame's {{relations}} with the US and UK have come under strain in the early 2010s, following allegations that Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebel movement in Eastern Congo. The UK suspended its budgetary aid programme in 2012, freezing a £21million donation. The <b>US</b> <b>has</b> also frozen some of its military aid programme for Rwanda, although it stopped short of suspending aid altogether.|$|E

60|$|The commonest race memory {{we have is}} the falling-through-space dream. This other-personality is very vague. About {{the only}} memory it has is that of falling. But many of <b>us</b> <b>have</b> sharper, more {{distinct}} other-personalities. Many of <b>us</b> <b>have</b> the flying dream, the pursuing-monster dream, color dreams, suffocation dreams, and the reptile and vermin dreams. In short, while this other-personality is vestigial in all of us, in some of us it is almost obliterated, while in others of us it is more pronounced. Some of <b>us</b> <b>have</b> stronger and completer race memories than others.|$|R
5|$|Radon is a colorless and odorless gas {{generated}} by the breakdown of radioactive radium, {{which in turn is}} the decay product of uranium, found in the Earth's crust. The radiation decay products ionize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon is the second-most common cause of lung cancer in the USA, causing about 21,000 deaths each year. The risk increases 8–16% for every 100 Bq/m³ increase in the radon concentration. Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. About one in 15 homes in the <b>US</b> <b>has</b> radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).|$|E
5|$|Red maple's rapid growth, ease of transplanting, {{attractive}} form, {{and value}} for wildlife (in the eastern <b>US)</b> <b>has</b> made {{it one of}} the most extensively planted trees. In parts of the Pacific Northwest, it is one of the most common introduced trees. Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. The tree was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. There it is frequently found in many parks and gardens, as well as occasionally in churchyards.|$|E
5|$|Studies in Europe and North America {{have shown}} {{dramatic}} declines in bee colonies. The <b>U.S.</b> <b>has</b> lost 59% of its bee colonies since 1947, and Europe has lost over 25% since 1985. Determining {{the causes of}} bee colony collapse {{is crucial to the}} global economy, as bee pollination assists with 9.5% of the global agricultural production worth billions of dollars.|$|E

5|$|The <b>U.S.</b> <b>has</b> {{modified}} its stance {{since the}} 1970s, when the State Department and the CIA issued reports exploring {{the potential of}} food embargoes. Congressional Bill H.R. 5426, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, removed agricultural export sanctions applied to Libya, Sudan, and North Korea (agricultural trade with Cuba remained under some restrictions) and gave Congress veto power over unilateral presidential actions in this regard.|$|E
5|$|The covert war in Laos {{continues}} to fascinate those with {{any knowledge of}} it. It {{was one of the}} quintessential Cold War insurgency/counterinsurgency, low-intensity conflicts and offers many lessons in the conduct of irregular covert operations supported by modern military technology. It also remains one of only a few military operations of the Vietnam War about which both major belligerent parties (the U.S. and North Vietnam) are still reluctant to discuss openly their participation. For the North Vietnamese, this is understandable. Hanoi has no more incentive to discuss its operations today than it had in the 1960s or 1970s. Although the <b>U.S.</b> <b>has</b> been more open about its participation, the covert war remains a touchy subject.|$|E
5|$|The {{first novel}} of the series, The Quest Begins, was first {{featured}} on the HarperCollin's FirstLook Program in November 2007.

The Quest Begins was released in the US on May 27, 2008. The book was also released as a paperback on February 10, 2009 and an e-book on October 6, 2009. The <b>US</b> <b>has</b> published the fifth book and published the sixth on February 8, 2011.|$|E

Many Armenians think that the <b>US</b> <b>has</b> the ability to force Turkey to recognize the past and pay Armenians and Armenia their reparations, that includes (for some) the return of the so-called Wilsonian Armenia to the Republic of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|About 82% of Americans live {{in urban}} areas (including suburbs); {{about half of those}} reside in cities with populations over 50,000. The <b>US</b> <b>has</b> {{numerous}} clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston). There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million. Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South. The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by {{more than a million people}} between 2000 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the <b>US</b> <b>has</b> a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E
