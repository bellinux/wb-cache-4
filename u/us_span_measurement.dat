40|$|The Earth's {{rotation}} is not constant but exhibits minute {{changes on}} all observable time scales ranging from subdaily to secular. This rich spectrum of observed Earth rotation changes reflects the rich variety of astronomical and geophysical phenomena that are causing the Earth's rotation to change, including, {{but not limited}} to, ocean and solid body tides, atmospheric wind and pressure changes, oceanic current and sea level height changes, post-glacial rebound, and torques acting at the core-mantle boundary. In particular, the decadal-scale variations of the Earth's rotation {{are thought to be}} largely caused by interactions between the Earth's outer core and mantle. Comparing the inferred Earth rotation variations caused by the various core-mantle interactions to observed variations requires Earth rotation observations spanning decades, if not centuries. During the past century many different techniques have been used to observe the Earth's rotation. By combining the individual Earth rotation series determined by each of these techniques, a series of the Earth's rotation can be obtained that is based upon independent <b>measurements</b> <b>spanning</b> the greatest possible time interval.

To quantify nonlinear behavior all kinds of measures did arise like spectral regrowth, ACPR, IP 3. Unfortunately a solid theoretical foundation complemented with a practical approach is missing. As a result the system level engineer still copes with nonlinearities differently than the process engineer who is responsible for the basic building block.
