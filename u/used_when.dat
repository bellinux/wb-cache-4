The present invention further relates to such <b>uses</b> <b>when</b> the implants are made of specified alloys or metals, e. g. magnesium and its alloys. The present invention further relates to such <b>uses</b> <b>when</b> the implant is surface modified.

5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It is also <b>used</b> <b>when</b> {{it is not}} possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is <b>used</b> <b>when</b> {{it is essential}} every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is <b>used</b> <b>when</b> it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is <b>used</b> <b>when</b> {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E

5|$|Early {{attestations}} of {{the name}} in Basque include Errama-itçéla, Erroumancel, later errumanzel and erremaitzela. The initial E- is the Basque prosthetic vowel, added because no Basque word may begin with an R-, and the final -a is the absolutive case suffix, <b>used</b> <b>when</b> citing a name. If this etymology is correct, it is a rare case of a native Romani name for themselves (an endonym) being borrowed by another language.|$|E

5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is <b>used</b> <b>when</b> the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be <b>used</b> <b>when</b> other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
