40|$|The goal {{of nuclear}} {{astrophysics}} is to measure cross sections of nuclear physics reactions {{of interest in}} astrophysics. At stars temperatures, these cross <b>sections</b> are very <b>low</b> due to {{the suppression of the}} Coulomb barrier. Cosmic ray induced background can seriously limit the determination of reaction cross sections at energies relevant to astrophysical processes and experimental setups should be arranged in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Placing experiments in underground sites, however, reduces this background opening the way towards <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> cross <b>section</b> determination. LUNA (Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) was pioneer in this sense. Two accelerators were mounted at the INFN National Laboratories of Gran Sasso (LNGS) allowing to study nuclear reactions close to stellar energies. A summary of the relevant technology used, including accelerators, target production and characterisation, and background treatment is given.

40|$|Abstract The {{texture and}} {{microstructure}} in Cu/Nb added <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> carbon steels through the different thickness layer were studied after hot rolling. It {{was found that}} the two <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> carbon steels all show the inhomogeneity of hot rolling texture and the Cu-added <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> carbon steel was far more inhomogeneous than Nb-added one. In the center layer, the strong α fibre, γ fibre textures and the shear textures including { 001 }, { 111 } were founded. Near the surface, the α fibre texture and the orientation texture caused by a typical plane-strain deformation condition of bcc metals were observed.

40|$|A high {{resolution}} <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> frequency phase generated carrier(PGC) demodulation technique for interferometric fiber sensors is proposed. The differential cross multiplication(DCM) algorithm and the Arctangent algorithm of PGC technique are analyzed theoretically and simulated by computer for <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> frequency demodulation. And {{the results show}} that an unnecessary random direct current(DC) drift is induced in the recovered signal of DCM-PGC, but it doesn't exit in that of Arctangent-PGC. To demonstrate the conclusion, an optical fiber interferometer-based <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> frequency sensing system is set up, and the comparable experiments of DCM-PGC and Arctangent-PGC are carried out. The experimental results show that only Arctangent-PGC can be used for <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> frequency demodulation, for it avoids the problem of DC drift as DCM-PGC. At last the <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> frequency demodulation system is achieved by Arctangent-PGC, and the testing results show that the system has the lowest frequency of 0. 01 Hz, a minimum detectable phase shift of 4 × 10 - 4 rad/√Hz, a dynamic range of 110 dB@ 1 Hz and a linearity of 99. 99 %...|$|R

40|$|With the {{worldwide}} trend to reduce emission from diesel engines, <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> sulfur diesel {{has been introduced}} with the sulfur concentration of less than 10 ppm. Unfortunately, the desulfurization process inevitably reduces the lubricity of diesel fuel significantly. Alternatively, biodiesel, with almost zero sulfur content, {{has been added to}} enhance lubricity in an <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> sulfur diesel. This work has evaluated the effectiveness of the biodiesel amount, sourced from palm and jatropha oil, and origin in <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> sulfur diesel locally available in the market. Wear scar from a high-frequency reciprocating rig is benchmarked to the standard value (460 m) of diesel fuel lubricity. It was found that very small amount (less than 1 %) of biodiesel from either source significantly improves the lubricity in <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> sulfur diesel, and the biodiesel from jatropha oil is a superior lubricity enhancer...|$|R
