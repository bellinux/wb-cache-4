40|$|We {{quantify}} the potential impacts of global food production on freshwater availability (water scarcity footprint; WSF) {{by applying the}} water <b>unavailability</b> <b>factor</b> (fwua) as a characterization factor and a global water resource model based on life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Each water source, including rainfall, surface water, and groundwater, has a distinct fwua that is estimated based on the renewability rate of each geographical water cycle. The aggregated consumptive water use level for food production (water footprint inventory; WI) {{was found to be}} 4344 km 3 /year, and the calculated global total WSF was 18, 031 km 3 H 2 Oeq/year, when considering the difference in water sources. According to the fwua concept, which is based on the land area required to obtain a unit volume of water from each source, the calculated annual impact can also be represented as 98. 5 × 106 km 2. This value implies that current agricultural activities requires a land area that is over six times larger than global total cropland. We also present the net import of the WI and WSF, highlighting the importance of quantitative assessments for utilizing global water resources to achieve sustainable water use globally...|$|E
40|$|Applying (4) and (6) in (3) we obtain (2 Γ aeE) * 2 E Γ 2 (2 aeE + 1) *E + 4 aeE = 0. Solving this {{equation}} for *E when aeE = 1 gives the maximum achievable, by the even outputs, throughput: flE;max = 3 Γ p 5 ss 0 : 764. It now remains {{to obtain the}} throughput of the odd output ports. Because not all the input ports (their odd queues) are available for the second contention round {{it is clear that}} the throughput of the odd output ports can be potentially limited due to that <b>unavailability</b> <b>factor.</b> Let ffi be the fraction of the N input ports that are available for the second arbitration round, then ffiN is the expected number of odd queues that are allowed to switch a HOL cell to an odd destination port. In [4] we show that the maximum throughput of the odd outputs is given by *O = 1 + 2 ffi Γ p 4 ffi 2 + 1 where ffi is expressed as ffi = 1 Γ *E 2 ae E. We finally have that the throughput of the Odd-Even switch is approximated by flmax = *O + *E 2 ss 0 : 70...|$|E
40|$|Water {{resources}} have uneven distributions over time, space, and source; thus, potential impacts related to water use {{should be evaluated}} by determining the differences in water resources rather than by simply summing water use. We propose a model for weighting renewable water resources and present a case study assessing water scarcity footprints as indicators of the potential impacts of water use based on a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). We assumed that {{the potential impact of}} a unit amount of water used is proportional to the land area or time required to obtain a unit of water from each water source. The water <b>unavailability</b> <b>factor</b> (fwua) was defined using a global hydrological modeling system with a global resolution of 0. 5 × 0. 5 degrees. This model can address the differences in water sources using an adjustable reference volume and temporal and spatial resolutions based on the flexible demands of users. The global virtual water flows were characterized using the fwua for each water source. Although nonrenewable and nonlocal blue water constituted only 3. 8 % of the total flow of the water footprint inventory, this increased to 29. 7 % of the total flow of the water scarcity footprint. We can estimate the potential impacts of water use that can be instinctively understood using fwua...|$|E
5000|$|Why was {{evidence}} not {{given by the}} source itself? Reasons could include {{the death of the}} witness, a missing witness, poor health of the witness, or other <b>unavailability.</b> This <b>factor</b> is less vague than the others.|$|R

Only 4% of adults indicated fear of arrest and prosecution or <b>unavailability</b> as <b>factors</b> preventing use." ...|$|R
40|$|Cluster-based servers can {{substantially}} increase performance when nodes cooperate to globally manage resources. However, in {{this paper}} we show that cooperation results in a substantial availability loss, in the absence of high-availability mechanisms. Specifically, we show that a sophisticated cluster-based Web server, which gains a factor of 3 in performance through cooperation, increases service <b>unavailability</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 10 over a non-cooperative version. We then show how to augment this Web server with software components embodying a small set of high-availability techniques to regain the lost availability. Among other interesting observations, we show that the application of multiple highavailability techniques, each implemented independently in its own subsystem, can lead to inconsistent recovery actions. We also show that a novel technique called Fault Model Enforcement can be used to resolve such inconsistencies. Augmenting the server with these techniques led to a final expected availability of close to 99. 99 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Competence {{encompasses}} knowledge, skills, abilities, and traits. It is {{gained in}} the healthcare professions through pre-service education, in-service training, and work experience. Competence is {{a major determinant of}} provider performance as represented by conformance with various clinical, non-clinical, and interpersonal standards. Measuring competence is essential for determining the ability and readiness of health workers to provide quality services. Although competence is a precursor to doing the job right, measuring performance periodically is also crucial to determine whether providers are using their competence on the job. A provider can have the knowledge and skill, but use it poorly because of individual factors (abilities, traits, goals, values, inertia, etc.) or external <b>factors</b> (<b>unavailability</b> of drugs, equipment, organizational support, etc.). This paper provides a framework for understanding the key factors that affect provider competence. Different methods for measuring competence are discussed, as are criteria for selecting measurement methods. Also, evidence from various research studies on measuring the effectiveness of different assessment techniques is presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} to frontier analysis and its application to developing areas in Morocco. It focuses on both nonparametric and parametric frontier methods and mainly proposes inference methods for efficiency under weak conditions. In a stochastic frontier analysis, a possible dependence between the two error terms is considered for both cross-sectional and panel data. In order to validate our models, several tests are performed and analyses of the sensitivity to outliers are established. Confidence intervals are constructed using the smoothed bootstrap for the nonparametric approach and two extended parametric percentile bootstrap algorithms for the parametric one. Both are illustrated using simulated and real data. For panel data, a variety of alternative deterministic time effect models are proposed, allowing e. g. for periodicity and disappearing inefficiency over time. Efficiency scores generally suggest the inefficiency of the handled sectors, but results should be interpreted carefully given the <b>unavailability</b> of certain <b>factors.</b> (SC - Sciences) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
