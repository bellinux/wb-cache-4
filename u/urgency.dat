40|$|The {{needs of}} {{companies}} are evolving and {{becoming more and more}} demanding each year, which result in more complex stakeholder relations. The complexity of the projects increases as well. For instance, stakeholders do not always have the same sense of <b>urgencies</b> and their expectations from the same project might differ. Such variety in demand urges project managers to opt for a new; more broaden management approach that includes more human type of issues as well as hard skills. One area this situation is observed in contemporary projects is software development projects with complex stakeholder environment, where the project managers have responsibility to deliver high quality end delivery {{at the same time to}} meet the demands of stakeholders with different sense of <b>urgencies.</b> This study aims for answering the research question “How can software projects having unclear requirement definitions and stakeholders with different sense of <b>urgencies</b> can be managed successfully?” The research is proposing a structured set of methodologies with a guideline to professionals and the researchers to manage software development projects having unclear requirement definition and stakeholders with different sense of <b>urgencies.</b> Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and ManagementMulti Actor SystemsTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R

Stakeholders do not always have {{the same sense of}} <b>urgencies</b> and their expectations from the same project might differ. Although current literature suggests successful methodologies for software development projects, it remains inadequate when different sense of <b>urgencies</b> take place among the stakeholders.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Hypertensive <b>urgencies</b> {{are defined}} as severe {{elevations}} in blood pressure without evidence of acute or progressive target-organ damage. The need for treatment is considered urgent but allows for slow control using oral or sublingual drugs. If the increase in blood pressure is not associated with risk to life or acute target-organ damage, blood pressure control must be implemented slowly over 24 hours. For hypertensive <b>urgencies,</b> {{it is not known}} which class of antihypertensive drug provides the best results and there is controversy regarding when to use antihypertensive drugs and which ones to use in these situations. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral drugs for hypertensive <b>urgencies.</b> METHODS: This systematic review of the literature was developed at the Brazilian Cochrane Center, and in the Discipline of Emergency Medicine and Evidence-Based Medicine at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina (Unifesp-EPM), in accordance with the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: Sixteen randomized clinical trials including 769 participants were selected. They showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had a superior effect in treating hypertensive <b>urgencies,</b> evaluated among 223 participants. The commonest adverse event for calcium channel blockers were headache (35 / 206), flushing (17 / 172) and palpitations (14 / 189). For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the principal side effect was bad taste (25 / 38). CONCLUSIONS: There is important evidence in favor of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for treating hypertensive <b>urgencies,</b> compared with calcium channel blockers, considering the better effectiveness and the lower frequency of adverse effects (like headache and flushing) ...|$|R
30|$|Due to often late-stage {{diagnosis}} with widespread {{metastatic disease}} and aggressive nature, oncological <b>urgencies</b> and emergencies are relatively frequent in the lung cancer patient. Whereas plain radiography often remains the first-line imaging modality that may point to possible abnormalities, multidetector CT with multiplanar imaging is the imaging modality {{of choice for}} <b>urgencies</b> and emergencies in the chest. In the central nervous system, this role is for MRI. Radiologists have a central and {{crucial role in the}} early recognition of these entities, as well as communication with thoracic oncologists, allowing appropriate management and minimising the risk of associated morbidity and mortality.|$|R

30|$|Lung {{cancer is}} very common, {{accounting}} for 17 % and 9 % of all cancers {{in men and}} women, respectively [1]. Furthermore, lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer, representing 19 % of all cancer-related deaths. The disease course in lung cancer is generally characterised by high morbidity and complications, {{some of which are}} acute and potentially life-threatening. An oncological emergency can be defined as an acute, potentially life-threatening condition in a cancer patient, either as a direct or indirect effect of the underlying malignancy or secondary to its treatment, requiring rapid intervention to avoid death or severe morbidity. <b>Urgencies</b> and emergencies differ in the severity of the consequences of a delay in treatment. Oncological emergencies can occur {{at any time during the}} course of a malignancy and can be the initial manifestation in some patients [2]. The causes of oncological <b>urgencies</b> and emergencies are myriad. While metabolic, infectious and haematological emergencies are primarily diagnosed by the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, thoracic, neurological and musculoskeletal emergencies often require imaging studies. The aim of this pictorial review is to identify and discuss these <b>urgencies</b> and emergencies in which radiologists play an important role and can have a significant impact on patient management and prognosis. The contribution of imaging in <b>urgencies</b> and emergencies goes beyond making the initial diagnosis, as imaging can also play a role in the planning of treatment and follow-up after treatment.|$|R

5|$|Before the {{students}} in Nashville {{had a chance to}} formalize their plans, events elsewhere brought renewed <b>urgency</b> to the effort. During the first week of February 1960, a small sit-in demonstration in Greensboro, North Carolina, grew into a significant protest with over eighty students participating by the third day. Although similar demonstrations had occurred previously in other cities, this was the first to attract substantial media attention and public notice. When Lawson's group met the subsequent Friday night, about 500 new volunteers showed up to join the cause. Although Lawson and other adult organizers argued for delay, the student leaders insisted that the time had come for action.|$|E

On the Joystiq blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative <b>urgency</b> and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending. Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character. Eurogamer Bramwell also criticized the game's lack of character development.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941, when the Armored Force expanded, an urgent need for {{self-propelled}} artillery arose.

Although this design had originally been suggested in September 1941, {{it had not been}} taken up. However, the <b>urgency</b> of the requirement resulted in the approval by the Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T19.|$|E

30|$|Lung cancer {{patients}} often experience potentially life-threatening medical <b>urgencies</b> and emergencies, {{which may be}} a direct or indirect result of the underlying malignancy. This pictorial review addresses the most common thoracic, neurological and musculoskeletal medical emergencies in lung {{cancer patients}}, including superior vena cava syndrome, pulmonary embolism, spontaneous pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, massive haemoptysis, central airway obstruction, oesophagorespiratory fistula, malignant spinal cord compression, carcinomatous meningitis, cerebral herniation and pathological fracture. Emphasis is placed on imaging findings, the role of different imaging techniques and a brief discussion of epidemiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic options. Since early diagnosis is important for adequate patient management and prognosis, radiologists have {{a crucial role in}} recognising and communicating these <b>urgencies</b> and emergencies.|$|R
