Born in Russia, Midney is a classically trained composer who started out writing film scores; turning to disco, however, he discovered his true calling, and working under a number of guises including Caress, Beautiful Bend, the USA/European Connection, Masquerade, Double Discovery, Companion and Festival, he produced an enormously prolific body of work from his New York City studio ERAS recording.|$|R

40|$|Tracking data on migratory {{movements}} of European ducks are relatively scarce and available information mainly belong to largest species. In 2013 we started a project aimed at collecting {{data on the}} ecology of migration of some species of dabbling ducks wintering in Italy by means of satellite tracking (AnaSat Project). Up to now we tagged 25 female <b>European</b> <b>teals</b> Anas crecca, the smallest duck in Europe {{and one of the}} most abundant. Teals were caught in three different sites in Central and Northern Italy and then equipped with solar powered PTTs. Most tracked birds left their wintering areas by the end of February-beginning of March and then followed eastward routes, While some females ended their migration in central Europe, several teals flew thousands of kilometers, sometimes reaching the arctic circle in Russia, thus confirming previous evidences collected by means of ringing recoveries and stable isotopes analyses. At the very beginning of migration, these long-distance migrating individuals used staging areas mainly located in south-eastern Europe. On the whole, this is the first analysis at individual level regarding the timing of migration and routes of teals and thus represent an important contribution for the management of the species at European scal...|$|R

Totally throughout the period, specific antibodies to the viruses were detected by neutralization test in wild birds (7. 3 %, WN; 8. 0 %, Geta; 0. 7 % Batai; 2. 8 %, Alpine hare (Lepus timidus); by hemagglutination-inhibition test in cattle (11. 4 % WN; 5. 9 %, JE; j 3. 0 %, TBE; 11. 6 %, Geta), horses (6. 1, 6. 8, 0, and 25. 3 %, respectively), and pigs (5. 4, 1. 5, 0, and 5. 9 %, respectively) by enzyme immunoassay (IgG) in human beings (0. 8, 0. 5, 6. 8, and 3. 2 %, respectively. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to reveal RNA of the NP segment of influenza A virus in 57. 9 and 65 % of the cloacal swabs from wild and domestic birds, respectively; and the HA-segment of subtype HH was not detected in 2005. HA/H 5 RNA was recorded in 5. 5 and 6. 7 % of the swabs from wild and domestic birds, respectively; 6 % of the specimens from domestic birds were M-segment positive in 2006. RNA of influenza A virus NA/H 7 and RNA was not detected throughout the years. In 2004, the cloacal swabs 8 isolated influenza A strains: two H 3 N 8 and two H 4 N 8 strains from <b>European</b> <b>teals</b> (Anas crecca), two (H 3 N 8 and H 6 N 2) strains from Baikal teals (A. formosa), one (H 10 N 4) strain from shovelers (A. clypeata), and one (H 4 N 8) from garganeys (A. querquedula). In 2004, one ND virus strain was isolated from the cloacal swabs from <b>European</b> <b>teals</b> (A. crecca). RT-PCR revealed RNA of this virus in some 8 more cloacal swabs from black ducks (A. poecilorhyncha) (3 positive specimens), pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) (n = 2), garganeys (A. querquedula) (n = 1), gadwalls (A. strepera) (n = 1), and geese (Anser anser domesticus) (n = 1). Sequencing of the 374 -member fragment of the ND virus F gene, which included a proteolytic cleavage site, could assign two samples to the weakly pathogenetic variants of genotype 1, one sample to highly pathogenic variants of genotype 3 a, five to highly pathogenic ones of genotype 5 b.
