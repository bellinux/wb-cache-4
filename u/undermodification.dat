40|$|We have {{developed}} a reconstituted system which models the events associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) plus-strand transfer. These events include synthesis of plus-strand strong-stop DNA [(+) SSDNA] from a minus-strand DNA donor template covalently attached to human tRNA 3 Lys, tRNA primer removal, and annealing of (+) SSDNA to the minus-strand DNA acceptor template. Termination of (+) SSDNA synthesis at the methyl A (nucleotide 58) near the 3 ′ end of tRNA 3 Lys reconstitutes the 18 -nucleotide primer binding site (PBS). Analysis of (+) SSDNA synthesis in vitro and in HIV- 1 endogenous reactions indicated another major termination site: the pseudouridine at nucleotide 55. In certain HIV- 1 strains, complementarity between nucleotides 56 to 58 and the first three bases downstream of the PBS could allow all of the (+) SSDNA products to be productively transferred. <b>Undermodification</b> of the tRNA {{may be responsible for}} termination beyond the methyl A. In studies of tRNA removal, we find that initial cleavage of the 3 ′ rA by RNase H is not sufficient to achieve successful strand transfer. The RNA-DNA hybrid formed by the penultimate 17 bases of tRNA still annealed to (+) SSDNA must also be destabilized. This can occur by removal of additional 3 ′-terminal bases by RNase H (added either in cis or trans). Alternatively, the nucleic acid chaperone activity of nucleocapsid protein (NC) can catalyze this destabilization. NC stimulates annealing of the complementary PBS sequences in (+) SSDNA and the acceptor DNA template. Reverse transcriptase also promotes annealing but to a lesser extent than NC...|$|E
40|$|Previous work in yeast has {{suggested}} that modification of tRNAs, in particular uridine bases in the anticodon wobble position (U 34), is linked to TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling. Hence, U 34 modification mutants {{were found to be}} hypersensitive to TOR inhibition by rapamycin. To study whether this involves inappropriate TOR signaling, we examined interaction between mutations in TOR pathway genes (tip 41 ∆, sap 190 ∆, ppm 1 ∆, rrd 1 ∆) and U 34 modification defects (elp 3 ∆, kti 12 ∆, urm 1 ∆, ncs 2 ∆) and found the rapamycin hypersensitivity in the latter is epistatic to drug resistance of the former. Epistasis, however, is abolished in tandem with a gln 3 ∆ deletion, which inactivates transcription factor Gln 3 required for TOR-sensitive activation of NCR (nitrogen catabolite repression) genes. In line with nuclear import of Gln 3 being under control of TOR and dephosphorylation by the Sit 4 phosphatase, we identify novel TOR-sensitive sit 4 mutations that confer rapamycin resistance and importantly, mislocalise Gln 3 when TOR is inhibited. This is similar to gln 3 ∆ cells, which abolish the rapamycin hypersensitivity of U 34 modification mutants, and suggests TOR deregulation due to tRNA <b>undermodification</b> operates through Gln 3. In line with this, loss of U 34 modifications (elp 3 ∆, urm 1 ∆) enhances nuclear import of and NCR gene activation (MEP 2, GAP 1) by Gln 3 when TOR activity is low. Strikingly, this stimulatory effect onto Gln 3 is suppressed by overexpression of tRNAs that usually carry the U 34 modifications. Collectively, our data suggest that proper TOR signaling requires intact tRNA modifications and that loss of U 34 modifications impinges on the TOR-sensitive NCR branch via Gln 3 misregulation...|$|E
40|$|The miaA tRNA {{modification}} gene was cloned {{and located}} by insertion mutagenesis and DNA sequence analysis. The miaA gene product, tRNA delta 2 -isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP) transferase, catalyzes {{the first step}} in the biosynthesis of 2 -methylthio-N 6 -(delta 2 -isopentenyl) -adenosine (ms 2 i 6 A) adjacent to the anticodon of several tRNA species. The translation start of miaA was deduced by comparison with mod 5, which encodes a homologous enzyme in yeasts. Minicell experiments showed that Escherichia coli IPP transferase has a molecular mass of 33. 5 kilodaltons (kDa). Transcriptional fusions, plasmid and chromosomal cassette insertion mutations, and RNase T 2 mapping of in vivo miaA transcription were used to examine the relationship between miaA and mutL, which encodes a polypeptide necessary for methyl-directed mismatch repair. The combined results showed that miaA, mutL, and a gene that encodes a 47 -kDa polypeptide occur very close together, are transcribed in the same direction in the order 47 -kDa polypeptide gene-mutL-miaA, and likely form a complex operon containing a weak internal promoter. Three additional relationships were demonstrated between mutagenesis and the miaA gene or ms 2 i 6 A tRNA modification. First, miaA transcription was induced by 2 -aminopurine. Second, chromosomal miaA insertion mutations increased the spontaneous mutation frequency with a spectrum distinct from mutL mutations. Third, limitation of miaA+ bacteria for iron, which causes tRNA <b>undermodification</b> from ms 2 i 6 A to i 6 A, also increased spontaneous mutation frequency. These results support the notion that complex operons organize metabolically related genes whose primary functions appear to be completely different. In addition, the results are consistent with the idea that mechanisms exist to increase spontaneous mutation frequency when cells need to adapt to environmental stress...|$|E
40|$|A general {{method for}} the {{isolation}} of mutants of Escherichia coli that are defective in RNA modification is described. The method {{is based on the}} fact that RNA with specific <b>undermodifications</b> accumulates under nonpermissive growth conditions and that such a defect can be detected by remodification either in vivo at permissive conditions or in vitro. The method provides a means by which to study mutations affecting essential modification reactions. The usefulness of the method was demonstrated by {{the isolation of}} two rRNA and two tRNA methylation defective mutants. Both rRNA mutants accept methyl groups into their 23 S rRNA in vitro. Analyses of in vitro methylated 23 S rRNA from one of the mutants revealed the presence of several methylated nucleosides, of which 6 -methyladenosine was the most abundant (40 % of recovered radioactivity). In 23 S rRNA from the other mutant, the only product formed in vitro was 5 -methylcytidine. The tRNA mutants are characterized in the accompanying paper...|$|R
40|$|VP 22, the 301 -amino-acid phosphoprotein {{product of}} the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) UL 49 gene, is {{incorporated}} into the tegument during virus assembly. We previously showed that highly modified forms of VP 22 are restricted to infected cell nuclei (L. E. Pomeranz and J. A. Blaho, J. Virol. 73 : 6769 – 6781, 1999). VP 22 packaged into infectious virions appears undermodified, and nuclear- and virion-associated forms are easily differentiated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (J. A. Blaho, C. Mitchell, and B. Roizman, J. Biol. Chem. 269 : 17401 – 17410, 1994). As VP 22 packaging-associated <b>undermodification</b> is unique among HSV- 1 tegument proteins, we sought to determine the role of VP 22 during viral replication. We now show the following. (i) VP 22 modification occurs {{in the absence of}} other viral factors in cell lines which stably express its gene. (ii) RF 177, a recombinant HSV- 1 strain generated for this study, synthesizes only the amino-terminal 212 amino acids of VP 22 (Δ 212). (iii) Δ 212 localizes to the nucleus and incorporates into virions during RF 177 infection of Vero cells. Thus, the carboxy-terminal region is not required for nuclear localization of VP 22. (iv) RF 177 synthesizes the tegument proteins VP 13 / 14, VP 16, and VHS (virus host shutoff) and incorporates them into infectious virions as efficiently as wild-type virus. However, (v) the loss of VP 22 in RF 177 virus particles is compensated for by a redistribution of minor virion components. (vi) Mature RF 177 virions are identical to wild-type particles based on electron microscopic analyses. (vii) Single-step growth kinetics of RF 177 in Vero cells are essentially identical to those of wild-type virus. (viii) RF 177 plaque size is reduced by nearly 40 % compared to wild-type virus. Based on these results, we conclude that VP 22 is not required for tegument formation, virion assembly/maturation, or productive HSV- 1 replication, while the presence of full-length VP 22 in the tegument is needed for efficient virus spread in Vero cell monolayers...|$|E
