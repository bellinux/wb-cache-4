50|$|Politics are an {{integral}} part of the <b>Unification</b> <b>Church's</b> concerns and activities, although the church itself largely remains aloof from politics. The degree of involvement of the movement, as well as some of its specific stances, have also been part of the reason for the movement's controversial status over the years. The belief in the establishment of a literal Kingdom of God on earth and church founder Sun Myung Moon's teaching that religion alone is not enough to bring this about provides a motivation for political involvement.|$|R

40|$|The {{future of}} the three {{mainstream}} Afrikaans Churches. The union of the three mainstream Afrikaans Churches encompasses inter alia a mutual origin, a mutual socio-historical contextualism, a mutual language experience and mutual Articles of Faith. These bonds form the foundation for greater cooperation and may even lead to future <b>church</b> <b>unification.</b> The Conventus of Reformed Churches is an exciting initiative that has developed {{over the last two}} decades. This organisation unites some 15 churches with a reformed background. Do the three Afrikaans mainstream <b>churches</b> take <b>church</b> <b>unification</b> seriously? Historically the Nederduitsche Hervormde Kerk van Afrika (NHKA) in particular was cautious about <b>church</b> <b>unification.</b> The Interdenominational <b>Church</b> Council (TKR) presents a basis for cooperation, but the question arises as to the structure that would be supported by the three churches. Mainly after 1994 the Afrikaner started redefining its own identity. The tendency is that the three churches will decrease in size as the three are all losing members. The three Afrikaans mainstream churches definitely need one another, and in future this interdependency probably will increase. That is why it is important to focus on common ground and not on differences. Bearing the <b>church</b> <b>unification</b> of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PCN) in mind, together we can look forward to a bright future in the 21 st century. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|A social-psychological {{perspective}} on the attitude of members in the Mangaung area towards <b>church</b> <b>unification</b> within the Dutch Reformed family of churches: a cross-cultural investigation Until recently, only one investigation had been conducted into church members’ attitudes towards <b>church</b> <b>unification.</b> This was done from a theological instead of a social-psychological point of view. The term “attitude” may {{be defined as the}} expression of inner feelings that reflect whether the person concerned has a favourable or unfavourable predisposition towards a certain object. <b>Church</b> <b>unification</b> entails the process of uniting separate church denominations within the Dutch Reformed Church family. The aims of this study were achieved by gathering data from respondents of six Dutch Reformed congregations (N= 104; 46, 6 %), as well as six Uniting Reformed congregations (N= 47; 21, 1 %). The remainder of the respondents came from five Dutch Reformed Church in Africa congregations (N= 72; 32, 3 %). A biographical questionnaire was used, as well as the Attitude towards <b>Church</b> <b>Unification</b> Scale. The influence of different variables such as language, gender, age, marital status and church activities on the attitudes of church members was investigated. It was concluded on the basis of statistical analysis that members of all the different denominations of the Dutch Reformed Churches had a positive attitude towards <b>church</b> <b>unification.</b> It was found that language was the variable that had the greatest influence on the attitude of church members...|$|R

After leaving the groups, 23 percent of former members stated they had attempted suicide, 63 percent had suicidal ideation, and 93 percent had experienced anxiety attacks. Snow devotes a chapter to deprogramming and advice on how individuals can avoid joining these groups from the outset.|$|E

In 1982, Cohen married Jae Sook, a South Korean woman suggested to him by church leader Sun Myung Moon. Cohen says that, {{during the first three}} years of his marriage, he underwent psychotherapy but was unable to find the help he needed, and therefore he found some healing with a boyfriend in New York City.|$|E
