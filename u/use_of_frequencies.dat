5000|$|... == Research == Hazlett’s {{research}} {{is focused on}} the public choice and public policy aspects of regulatory measures in the communications sector. His 1990 article, “The Rationality of U.S. Regulation of the Broadcast Spectrum,” presented a “revisionist” explanation as to why radio spectrum is allocated and licensed by regulators. The traditional view, given by the U.S. Supreme Court, was that policy makers were confronted by a “tragedy of the commons” and were forced by circumstances to manage wireless services. Ronald Coase critiqued the idea that government control was inevitable, but argued that policymakers were unaware of market alternatives. Hazlett showed that radio broadcasting actually developed according to common law property rules and that the move to political control was the result of pressure by incumbent radio stations and key policy makers (including Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover) to foreclose competitive entry. As a policy advocate, Hazlett argued for auctions in assigning wireless licenses prior to Congressional approval of the reform in 1993, and has advanced further liberalization in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies.</b> [...] In particular, he recommends that TV Band frequencies should be bid into more valuable uses. This idea was considered highly controversial in the broadcast industry when proposed, but it has become widely accepted: while Hazlett’s views were “so radical that the economist's suggestion was dismissed as Ivory Tower ranting,” wrote a trade journal in 2004, “no one is laughing now.” [...] By 2010, the FCC’s National Broadband Plan proposed a major shift of TV frequencies to wireless broadband. [...] Hazlett’s articles in the Financial Times, as well as Richard Thaler’s New York Times article on Hazlett’s proposal to repurpose spectrum, may have helped popularize the notion.|$|E
