500|$|In 2010, Lady Gaga was touring for {{her second}} world tour, The Monster Ball. At {{that time she}} started {{developing}} ideas for her second studio album, Born This Way. The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself which she wrote in Liverpool and Manchester, England, described by Gaga as a [...] "magical message" [...] song. She wrote it in ten minutes and compared the process to an Immaculate Conception. White Shadow, one of the producers of the track, credited Gaga for {{coming up with the}} idea and the theme behind the song. [...] "We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. It sounds like it reads, but not like you think <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> it," [...] he added.

Duncan James replied that: [...] "There's {{been a lot}} of negativity but all we ask is, please {{hold off}} <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> the song. We believe it's one of the best songs to enter Eurovision in a long time". Simon Webbe added: [...] "We believe {{this is going to be}} the best {{springboard}} for us to come back on. Who are we to actually think we can just waltz back in with a song and expect everyone to like it? At least this way we can reach 125 million people across Europe and represent our country whilst doing so. There is no other platform like it".|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, Richter and Dorliac gave {{recitals}} in Bucharest, Romania, then in 1950 {{performed in}} Prague and Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. In 1954, Richter gave recitals in Budapest, Hungary. In 1956, he again toured Czechoslovakia, then in 1957, he toured China, then again performed in Prague, Sofia, and Warsaw. In 1958, Richter recorded Prokofiev's 5th Piano concerto with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Witold Rowicki - the recording which made Richter known and desired in America. in 1959, Richter made another successful {{recording of the}} Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto with the Warsaw Philharmonic on Deutsche Grammophon label. Thus the West first became aware of Richter through recordings made in the 1950s.

2500|$|Wilson, {{commanding}} the cavalry corps of the Military Division of the Mississippi, launched a raid in late March into central Alabama with orders {{to destroy the}} remaining Confederate industry in the region, especially at Elyton (present-day Birmingham) and Selma. The only force remaining to resist Wilson was Nathan B. Forrest's cavalry force. Elyton fell to Union forces on March 29, before Forrest had time to concentrate his troops. A detachment led by Brig. General John T. Croxton destroyed the area's factories and on April 4 burned down the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Selma was captured on April 2 following a battle, which was Forrest's final battle and defeat. After destroying Selma's factories and railroads, Wilson continued eastward towards Georgia. He had to capture the bridge across the Chattahoochee River at Columbus, Georgia, with a battle, then he continued on to Macon; here on April 21, he received word from Sherman to [...] "desist from further acts of war and devastation <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> that hostilities are renewed".|$|E

[...] "She loves just sitting at a piano and barking orders at a drummer and she has an incredible voice," [...] Ronson said, adding that they first began with the music and then proceeded with the song. The producer later said that the music recorded with Gaga was [...] "some of my favorite music I've really ever worked on. It's incredible - I love it.
