500|$|The {{stations}} burned {{a mix of}} bituminous and anthracite coal. They consumed [...] of coal {{per week}} and had a peak consumption of [...] per week during the winter. They were well positioned to use coal from the Northumberland and County Durham coal fields. All of the coal used in the stations was brought to them via rail transport from UK coal stocks. Trains delivered coal to the station using the North Blyth Branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The stations' coal handling facility was fitted with a Merry go Round (MGR) coal delivery system in 1981, after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became the British Rail standard. This system involved the trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath the train. Because of site space restrictions, a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed, so instead {{of being able to}} move continuously, trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track; the locomotive would then uncouple and recouple at the opposite end, before slowly moving over the <b>unloading</b> <b>track</b> hopper and discharging the coal and eventually leaving site. Towards the end of the station's operation, coal was more frequently brought in by road. All coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area {{to the north of the}} power stations. This had a tarmac barrier underneath it to prevent downward contamination. The coal was brought from the storage area to the station using a system of conveyor belts, which travelled over the Bedlington-Cambois Road separating the two sites, before being integrated to feed both stations as necessary.|$|E

There are several methods for decay rate estimation from passby data, which are described in this paper and compared in terms of results and sensitivity.

These facilities constructed with Lend-Lease funds contained single-story warehouses, 960 ft long and 180 ft wide, with platforms for loading and <b>unloading</b> railway <b>tracks</b> running the full length of each side and a platform for handling truck freight at one end. Nearby open storage areas were available for freight unloaded from railway cars with cranes. These 600-acre sites employed thousands of civilians and hundreds of Italian prisoners of war and included shops, roundhouses, a mess hall, fire station, dispensary, cafeteria, bachelor officers’ quarters and administration buildings. Fuels, explosives and refrigerated cargoes were handled elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{design and}} control architecture {{of a small}} mobile robot with hybrid locomotion system. It consist the combination of wheel and track type motion system resulting as a hybrid mechanism. The wheel locomotion system helps the robot to move on flat surface or path platform with high velocity, high manoeuvrability at low energy consumption. The track system is designed for rough and unstructured path, where robot need to cross irregular surface with high stability. This system works on interchangeable locomotion phenomena by means of track tensioner unit (TTU). The TTU helps the loading and <b>unloading</b> of <b>track</b> system by means of rack and pinion mechanism. This design of small hybrid mobile robot is improves robot applications and also enhance its flexibilty, verstality to work in multi type of terrains...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of fibrous materials is both complex and intriguing. Here, we explore one class of such materials, {{made of the}} disordered entanglement of a single long fiber. This architected material is of both fundamental and technological interests. From a theoretical point of view, this system {{can be seen as}} a disordered material, akin to glasses, but with very long (possibly infinite) ranged correlations transmitted along the single fiber. From an applied point of view, this material is a potential replacement for sintered materials, because with comparable porosities, entangled structures are highly ductile while sintered powders are often intrinsically brittle. We study the {{mechanics of}} single-wire materials using a combination of experiments and simulations. Experimentally, we produce cylindrical samples by entangling a single fiber made either of NiTi, polyamide or copper. Spatial homogeneity and stress relaxation are achieved by series of thermomechanical treatments that allow to first transform the wire into a coil and then entangle the coil. The samples are subjected to cycles of compressions followed by <b>unloading,</b> <b>tracking</b> the local deformations in the samples with optical cameras and x-ray microtomography. Numerically, we employed Kirchhoff's elastic rod theory to simulate the same mechanical cycles on both numerical substitutes of the experimental samples (i. e. cylindrical samples of geometry and density comparable to the experiments) and idealized samples with a cubic and periodic geometry. We will discuss our main observations on the mechanical properties of the single-wire systems. First, stress-strain curves show a prolonged regime of non-linear elasticity and a marked hysteresis between compression loading and <b>unloading.</b> Also, by <b>tracking</b> the sample shape variations, we observe surprising non-monotonous variations of the sample volume, both in the experiments and in the simulations. At the local level, we use image analysis to follow the evolution of the local orientation of the fiber and of the number and orientation of the contacts, the latter two quantities also showing non-monotonous behaviors.  In particular, we show that this material exhibits at finite strains an unexpected variation of its Poisson's function, beyond the usual bounds: Poisson's function is above ½ in compression and below zero in tension. This material is thus reversibly compress dilatant in compression and auxetic in tension. This means that the structure expands laterally in both traction and compression and so rapidly in compression that its volume increases. This unusual variation of Poisson's function arises from the interplay between the elongation of the coiled segments that constitute the entanglement and fiber rearrangements due to steric effects.  This work illustrates that a property (Poisson's function not limited to 0 or ½), rare in bulk materials, can be readily obtained in "simple" architected materials and opens the way to developing architectures with very large, negative but also positive, Poisson's functions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Collagen, a triple-helical, {{self-organizing}} protein, is {{the predominant}} structural protein in mammals. It {{is found in}} bone, ligament, tendon, cartilage, intervertebral disc, skin, blood vessel, and cornea. We have recently postulated that fibrillar collagens (and their complementary enzymes) comprise {{the basis of a}} smart structural system which appears to support the retention of molecules in fibrils which are under tensile mechanical strain. The theory suggests that the mechanisms which drive the preferential accumulation of collagen in loaded tissue operate at the molecular level and are not solely cell-driven. The concept reduces control of matrix morphology to an interaction between molecules and the most relevant, physical, and persistent signal: mechanical strain. Methodology/Principal Findings: The investigation was carried out in an environmentally-controlled microbioreactor in which reconstituted type I collagen micronetworks were gently strained between micropipettes. The strained micronetworks were exposed to active matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP- 8) and relative degradation rates for loaded and <b>unloaded</b> fibrils were <b>tracked</b> simultaneously using label-free differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging. It was found that applied tensile mechanical strain significantly increased degradation time of loaded fibrils compared to unloaded, paired controls. In many cases, strained fibrils were detectable long after unstrained fibrils were degraded. Conclusions/Significance: In this investigation we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} applied mechanical strai...|$|R
