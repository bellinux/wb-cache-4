30|$|In 1987, all the {{countries}} around the Baltic Sea agreed that by 1995, {{there should be a}} reduction of 50 % of the nutrient load reaching the Sea. This goal is still unachieved and the environmental degradation of the Baltic Sea continues (HELCOM 2011). From all the input sources, agriculture is the biggest one and accounts for almost 50 % of all the nutrients leaching to the sea. Almost half of those agricultural run-offs come from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and their share is likely to increase. The dissolution of the Soviet block in 1989 and the consequent entry into market economy had a significant effect on the economies of the Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC). The subsequent crash in farm-gate prices of most agricultural products and the reorganisation of the agricultural sector resulted in a more extensive land use where the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and chemical fertilizers was dramatically reduced (Petersen and Hoogeveen 2004). However, as their economies recover, their agricultural practices are predicted to intensify again, a fact that is noticeable in the Baltic States (HELCOM 2011).|$|E
40|$|A {{socio-economic}} {{analysis of the}} farms in four villages of the Dikodougou region (North of Cote d'Ivoire) reviews two debates about {{the evolution of the}} farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Firstly, the two opposing views in the controversy "Boserup versus Malthus" are complements rather than opposites. In a first phase, demographic pressure causes Malthusian mechanisms (proliferation of weeds, deterioration of the bio-physical environment, of global fertility and of the profitability of the traditional production system) generating favourable conditions for the adoption of ox-drawn farming. In a second phase, the alternation of the production system illustrates well the Boserupian response to a situation where the traditional system is not adapted to the new socio-economic conditions. Secondly, the economic analysis proposes to review the debate "competition versus complementarity" between cotton and food crops. The competition thesis seems only valid for not mechanised farms, where cotton competes with food crops for labour. However, {{the second phase of the}} evolution of the production systems (<b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and fertilisers, substitution of manual farming by ox-drawn farming) is possible thanks to the favourable conditions (access to pesticides, fertilisers, credit and know-how) generated by the CIDT (Compagnie Ivoirienne de Developpement des Textiles).

40|$|Traditional {{sprayers}} adopt large-area uniform pesticide application, {{resulting in}} a low effective <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> and a harmful effect to the natural environment. Variable-rate spray is the key point to precision chemical application. However, {{it is inevitable that}} the spray pressure sharply fluctuates during variable-rate spray, which will definitely influence the spray characteristics, such as spray droplet sizes, spray angles, spray droplet velocities, etc., and reduce the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> applications. Therefore, the research on how to keep the spray pressure constant during the process of variable- rate spray has practical significance to precision pesticide applications. In order to achieve the stability of spray pressure for variable- rate spray, a sprayer with constant-pressure control was set up using a closed-loop proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller of constant-pressure water-supply, which employed the techniques of single-phase alternating current (AC) chopper variablevoltage control and PID feedback regulation. Using hollow-cone nozzles, the spray volume was changed by adjusting spray pressure, frequency, and duty cycle of electromagnetic valve switching. The spray features concerning the spray angle and the spray volume distribution were studied in laboratory. The conclusions are as follows: i) for a given input spray pressure, the closed-loop controller with AC chopper and PID feedback regulation can effectively control the pressure fluctuations during the variable-rate spray through varying the frequency and the duty cycle; ii) the spray angle was slightly affected by the flow-rate change through adjusting the frequency and the duty cycle of electromagnetic valves or changing the number of open nozzles. The spray angle changes were controlled within the range of the maximum deviation 0. 87 ° from mean value and the minimum deviation 0. 03 ° from mean value; iii) when the spray pressure was set as 0. 3 Mpa, the peak radial position of the spray volume distribution basically unchanged and the spray volume and the peak values of the spray distribution gradually increased with the increasing duty cycle. When the setting pressure was increased, the spray volume increased and the peak radial position of the spray distribution gradually expanded toward outside, however the peak value of the spray distribution decreased a little...|$|R

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{in modern}} {{agriculture}} is unavoidable {{because they are}} required to control weeds. Pesticides are poisonous; hence, they are dangerous if misused. Understanding the fate <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> will be useful to use them safely. Therefore, contaminations of water and soil resources could be avoided. The fates <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in soils are influenced by their sorption, decomposition and movement. Degradation and leaching <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> are control by sorption.

30|$|The {{frequent}} {{high concentrations}} (over guideline values) <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{detected in the}} current study are probably due to the extensive utilization <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in the agricultural fields. There are three major sources for surface water contamination by pesticides: inappropriate handling <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> (e.g., washing equipment in the river), volatilization to air, and residuals from soil and water. In this perspective, the drainage of water from agricultural fields into irrigation channels poses a critical source of risk for contamination by pesticides in the broader water environment (Phong et al. 2010). Rain runoff from agricultural fields that occurred immediately after the application period <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> has been pointed to be the major source <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in water bodies (Kreuger 1998). Rainfall, and hence the associated increased runoff, would be expected to result in increased movement <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> into nearby water bodies.

40|$|The thesis {{evaluates the}} {{negative}} effect that intensive agriculture brings, particularly {{in terms of}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use on human and on the environment, and the associated economic cost. Vegetable production is an important source of farm income, but this has become increasingly reliant on the excessive use <b>of</b> chemical <b>pesticides.</b> This not only pollutes the environment but also affects farmers’ health. The thesis hypothesises that the excessive and injudicious use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in intensive farming will adversely affect human health and increased economic costs for the farmer. A study was carried out in Ansi khola and Jhikhu khola watersheds of central mid-hills of Nepal, during 2008 and 2009 to observe the effect of the use <b>of</b> chemical <b>pesticides</b> on intensive farming. The objectives were (i) to review factors affecting pesticide use in developing countries; (ii) to assess risks <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use for farmers by assessing erythrocyte acetylecholinesterase activity (AChE); (iii) to value the risk <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use for farmers and for environmental health; and (iv) {{to assess the impact of}} the associated economic costs <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use for vulnerable populations within an agrarian society. Data was collected through household surveys, group discussions, and individual interviews. The Test-mate ChE Cholinesterase Test System was used to monitor erythrocyte AChE activity before and after pesticide application seasons. Cost-of-illness, defensive expenditures, and willingness to pay (WTP) approaches were applied for valuing health and environmental costs <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use. To this, an opportunity cost of spraying time, and amount spent on purchasing chemical pesticides were added for estimating total cost <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use. The objectives have been addressed in four separate but interrelated studies. The synthesis of these studies revealed that farmers were significantly exposed to chemical <b>pesticides.</b> The use <b>of</b> chemical <b>pesticides</b> resulted in acute health symptoms, increased economic costs, and the costs <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use in proportion to household cash incomes was likely to be higher for the most vulnerable group within the society, the small farmers. Specifically, the first paper reviews “continuing issues in the limitations <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use in developing countries” and found that impact <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use in crop production is complex and inter-connected. This topic requires an interdisciplinary approach; without this, farmers in the developing world will tend to incur economic costs as a result of health and environmental degradation. The second study, “Knowledge, attitude and practices <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use and acetylcholinesterase depression among farm workers in Nepal” found low levels of care with regard to pesticide use and high level of awareness among the farmer with regard to the environmental impacts <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use. However, farmers failed to take adequate safety precautions. Current levels <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> were sufficient to cause acute health symptoms and AChE depressions. The third study, “Health and environmental costs <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use in vegetable farming in Nepal” takes account of both the health and environmental cost <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use for farmers, and revealed that exposed farmers were likely to have to carry increased economic costs as a result <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use. If provided with safe alternatives to chemical pesticides, farmers were willing to pay more than the cost <b>of</b> existing <b>pesticides</b> in order to protect their health and environment. The final study, “Distribution <b>of</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use by household economy” showed an uneven distribution of the cost <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use between households. On average, the health costs of illness associated with pesticide use was equivalent to nearly 5 % of agricultural cash income, which was likely to be higher for small-scale households (5. 7 %) than the large-scale (3. 6 %).
