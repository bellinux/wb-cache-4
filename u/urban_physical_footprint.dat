40|$|Superconducting qubits are {{sensitive}} {{to a variety of}} loss mechanisms including dielectric loss from interfaces. By changing the <b>physical</b> <b>footprint</b> of the qubit it is possible to modulate sensitivity to surface loss. Here we show a systematic study of planar superconducting transmons of differing <b>physical</b> <b>footprints</b> to optimize the qubit design for maximum coherence. We find that qubits with small footprints are limited by surface loss and that qubits with large footprints are limited by other loss mechanisms which are currently not understood.

40|$|Virtualization {{is a key}} {{technology}} underlying cloud computing platforms, where applications encapsulated within virtual machines are dynamically mapped onto a pool of physical servers. In this paper, we argue that cloud providers can significantly lower operational costs, and improve hosted application performance, by accounting for affinities and conflicts between co-placed virtual machines. We show how these affinities can be inferred using location-independent VM characterizations called virtual footprints, and then show how these virtual footprints {{can be used to}} reshape the <b>physical</b> <b>footprint</b> of a VM—its physical resource consumption—to achieve higher VM consolidation and application performance in a cloud environment. We also identify three general principles for minimizing a virtual machine’s <b>physical</b> <b>footprint,</b> and discuss challenges in applying these principles in practice...|$|R

30|$|A current popular {{solution}} to the multi-DOA estimation problem was presented in [11], which is arguably {{the starting point of}} two important robot audition projects: ManyEars [12] and HARK [13]. This solution requires an eight-microphone hardware solution but is able to detect accurately four moving speakers and up to seven static speakers if given enough time. This high eight-microphone requirement has been worked around by minimizing the <b>physical</b> <b>footprint</b> of the microphone array, the result of which is the small but effective 8 SoundsUSB audio interface [14] which is now being applied in Willow Garage’s PR 2 service robot with good preliminary results [15]. However, even with a small <b>physical</b> <b>footprint,</b> the amount of microphones makes it difficult to employ this solution in applications where space is limited, such as hearing aids or mobile phones. In addition, to carry out the multi-DOA estimation phase of the process, it required an off-site computer because of its processing and memory requirements [16], which, although it may be able to be countered with today’s technology, can be considered high for some applications.|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the urban}} heat islands {{phenomenon}} {{has long been}} recognized as a major urban environmental problem, {{it was not until}} recently that this urban phenomenon gained attention from the discipline of urban planning. To integrate the findings of the urban heat islands research into the planning practice, the relationship between land surface temperatures and <b>urban</b> <b>physical</b> and socioeconomic characteristics should be addressed at the planning relevant spatial scale, a land parcel.

40|$|Increased {{risk for}} chronic disease is closely {{associated}} with individual nutrition, tobacco use, and physical inactivity. This thesis focuses on physical activity {{as a means of}} preventing select chronic diseases. A major barrier preventing engagement in physical activity is the built environment. Populations residing in rural environment are not afforded the abundance of opportunities for physical activity prevalent in most urban networks. Of the demographic living in rural environments, individuals with disability face additional barriers to physical activity than those without disability. This leads to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases associated with sedentary lifestyles among populations with disability. Few studies address the correlation between physical activity, chronic disease, and the built environment as they relate to individuals with disability. This thesis utilized independent samples t tests to evaluate variation among physical activity levels and the prevalence of chronic disease. In the first paper, four research objectives defined the parameters for comparison: (1) physical activity for individuals with disability in rural versus <b>urban</b> environments; (2) <b>physical</b> activity in rural environments for individuals with and without disability; (3) prevalence of chronic disease for individuals with disability in rural versus urban areas; and (4) prevalence of chronic disease in rural environments for individuals with and without disability. The four research objectives of the second paper are: (1) rural and <b>urban</b> <b>physical</b> activity comparison for the highest disability classification; (2) rural and <b>urban</b> <b>physical</b> activity comparison for individuals with disability using equipment; (3) rural and <b>urban</b> <b>physical</b> activity comparison for individuals with disability resulting from physical, mental, or emotional impairments; and (4) rural and <b>urban</b> <b>physical</b> activity comparison for individuals not reporting disability. The 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) provided the data used to evaluate the correlation between these variables. The results of both studies indicate important statistical significance relating the rural built environment to lower levels of physical activity for individuals with disability. The varied statistical significance and small effect sizes, however, were contrary to the hypothesis and warrants further exploration of the complex relationship regarding the built environment, physical activity, and chronic disease...|$|R
