40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the professional risks and rewards {{of being an}} industrial energy manager. The content {{is derived from the}} author's personal experience 1 plus 80 separate interviews of industrial energy practitioners and experts conducted during 2012 - 14 for the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. The intended reader is anyone who is interested in reconciling industrial energy management tasks with their business and career performance. Energy managers ensure that their facilities receive the benefits of improved energy technologies, practices, and accountabilities. But energy issues are not why industrial leaders get {{out of bed in the}} morning. Energy management imposes new priorities on long-standing organizational structures and procedures. To propose energy management is to propose change. Changes impact the way money is budgeted and spent, alters the order of work priorities, and can potentially <b>upset</b> the <b>current</b> balance of professional power and influence held by different department heads within a facility. Change elicits perceptions of risk. Risk begets resistance. Energy management becomes change management, which entails the modification of organizational accountabilities and procedures. Change management demands initiatives that are often beyond the reckoning of mechanically inclined staff that are accustomed to hands-on engineering or maintenance tasks...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the European research project SUPRA (Simulation of Upset Recovery in Aviation) is to develop technologies that eventually contribute to a reduction of risk of Loss of control - in flight (LOC-I) accidents, today's major cause of fatal accidents in commercial aviation. To this end the project developed novel concepts to improve groundbased simulation of <b>upset</b> events. <b>Current</b> flight simulators are considered inadequate for the simulation of many upset conditions as the flight dynamics and aerodynamic models apply only to the normal flight regimes and aircraft behavior may change significantly outside this envelope. Furthermore, standard hexapodbased motion systems are unable to reproduce the high accelerations, angular rates, and sustained G-forces inherent to upset conditions. SUPRA investigates new engineering methods to extend the aerodynamic model to higher angles of attack as well as innovative motion cueing solutions, {{including the use of}} centrifuge-based simulators. These new technologies have been evaluated by test pilots for a selection of relevant upset scenarios. It was found that the SUPRA all-envelope simulation model is representative of the airplane class being simulated within and outside the normal flight envelope as well as that improved motion cueing is possible on hexapod and centrifuge devices...|$|R

These phenomena, {{also known as}} single-event <b>upset</b> (SEU) induce <b>current</b> pulses at random times and random locations in a digital circuit. In this paper we model neutron-induced soft errors using two parameters, namely, frequency and intensity. Our soft error rate (SER) estimation method propagates both frequency (expressed as probability) and intensity as the width of single event transient (SET) pulses expressed as probability density functions through the circuit. With this model {{we are able to}} accurately model electrical masking factors in logic circuits. Also, the error pulse width density information at primary outputs of the logic circuit allows evaluation of SER reduction schemes such as time or space redundancy. ...|$|R
