The new status did little to reverse the park's fortunes however; during a 1984 House of Commons debate, Member of Parliament for Stretford, Tony Lloyd, described the area's decline as [...] "spectacular and disastrous". The target had been to create 7,000new jobs over 10years, but by 1986 only 2,557 had been created, not even enough to compensate for the ongoing job losses caused by closures within the park. On 10 February 1987 the Trafford Park Development Corporation was formed to assume responsibility for a [...] <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Area</b> that included not only Trafford Park but also parts of Stretford, Salford Quays, and the former steelworks at Irlam, now known as Northbank. Of the four redevelopment schemes undertaken by the corporation one, Wharfside, included [...] of the eastern end of the park as well as part of the ship canal docks and the area around Manchester United F.C.'s Old Trafford football ground to the east of the Bridgewater Canal. The intention was to build [...] "a flagship site" [...] containing prestigious accommodation for offices, shops, and [...] "hi-tech" [...] industries, capitalising on the area's proximity to Manchester city centre and mirroring the earlier success of the redevelopment at nearby Salford Quays.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUrbanization {{is viewed}} as {{endangering}} more critical habitats of global value and is more ubiquitous than any other human activity affecting biodiversity, climate, water and nutrient cycles at multiple scales. Spatial and landscape planning can help create alternative urban patterns protecting ecosystems and thus supporting the provision of needed services they provide. While many approaches exist to make the values of nature explicit, new tools are needed to interpret the vast quantity of information in an integrated assessment to support planning. In this study, we present a new spatial decision support tool PALM (“Potential Allocation of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>areas</b> for sustainable Land Management”) aimed at supporting the allocation of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> zones. A GIS-based MCDA approach was integrated into a web-based platform that allows distributing a requested amount of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>areas</b> within a selected perimeter based on ecosystem services and locational factors. The short running time of different user-defined scenarios allows exploring consequences and tradeoffs between decisions in an interactive way, thus making it a useful tool to support discussions in participatory planning processes. The results of the application of PALM in a case study region in Switzerland show that integrating ecosystem services when distributing <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>areas</b> is particularly effective in urban peripheries, where building zones are shifted towards urban centers securing the productive soils located around cities. This shift of building zones from the urban peripheries to the urban centers when considering ecosystem services is less pronounced in rural areas, as they provide fewer ecosystem services. However, the results also show that integrating ecosystem services in spatial planning needs to be embedded in the right policy context: Ecosystem services can only be traded-off for locational factors if {{the perimeter of the}} case study ranges across municipalities. Whereas this transparent and flexible platform offers a suitable tool {{at the beginning of a}} planning process, we also discuss further development needs...|$|R

40|$|This {{graduation}} report {{studies the}} facilitating {{role of the}} municipality in the <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> <b>development</b> process in the Netherlands. Though this role is often mentioned in articles, {{it has not been}} defined due to a gap in literature and a gap in practical knowledge on the subject. This research tries to reduce that gap, by understanding the municipal roles, goals, measures and means to steer <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> <b>development</b> projects better and by conceptualising the facilitating role. This is done by answering the main research question: ‘What does the role of a facilitating municipality in the <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> <b>development</b> process in the Netherlands entail?’. An extensive literature study and a case study with five embedded cases provide valuable information to answer that question. The facilitating role is part of a framework of four municipal roles to steer <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> <b>development</b> projects: shaping plans, regulating markets, stimulating markets and facilitating the process. The facilitating role is supported by three measures: acquiring market information and knowledge, managing market rooted networks and organising the municipal project team. These measures are supported by a set of means and pre-conditions. The facilitating role is about facilitating the process of <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> <b>development</b> and does not mean ‘letting go’, ‘laissez-fair’ or facilitate only market party stakeholders. The facilitating role can be played by the municipality in all phases of the life-cycle of an urban area and regardless of the form of public-private co-operation...|$|R

40|$|Virginia is growing. Between 1990 and 2000, Virginia’s {{population}} rose by over 14 % - {{the largest}} population growth {{experienced by the}} state in a single decade (Pollard, 2007). And the state continues to grow. It {{has been estimated that}} by 2030, Virginia’s total population may exceed 9. 8 million people (Pollard, 2007). Along with population growth, land development has increased which in turn affects transportation, housing and job placement across the Commonwealth. In fact, {{in many parts of the}} state, development has outpaced population growth. According to Pollard, “If current patterns continue, Virginia will develop more land in the next 40 years than in the previous 400 years (p. 8). ” In an effort to curb sprawling development and decrease transportation expenditure, the Virginia General Assembly passed House Bill 3202 in 2007. One major outcome of this multifaceted legislation was the introduction of mandatory <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Areas</b> (UDAs). The goal of UDAs was for localities to concentrate growth and development in order to reduce the cost of transportation and increase opportunities to build multi-use developments and expand affordable housing. In 2012, the General Assembly passed House Bill 869 and Senate Bill 274 which effectively make UDAs no longer mandatory but optional for all localities in the Commonwealth. In this paper, we analyze the racial impact and explore the political history of HB 869 /SB 274 while addressing the larger issue of sprawl across the Commonwealth. Smart Growth policies are known to positively impact the environment but they also positively impact low-income and minority communities by increasing access to housing, transportation and ultimately jobs. The story behind <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Areas</b> in the Commonwealth is one of politics and regulation but issues as critical as housing, transportation and job access should be focused much more on the citizens of the Commonwealth. The friction created by the UDA policy between the localities and the state has the potential to spark a statewide conversation about land use and more importantly - the need for people-centered solutions to a growing problem...|$|R
