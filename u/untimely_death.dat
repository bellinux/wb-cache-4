5|$|Shetland's {{culture and}} landscapes have {{inspired}} {{a variety of}} musicians, writers and film-makers. The Forty Fiddlers was formed in the 1950s to promote the traditional fiddle style, which is a vibrant part of local culture today. Notable exponents of Shetland folk music include Aly Bain, Fiddlers' Bid, and the late Tom Anderson and Peerie Willie Johnson.

Here, in June 1922, he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly.

5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the <b>untimely</b> <b>death</b> of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E
5|$|His {{resting place}} {{is at the}} Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang. Today, Cho is {{regarded}} as the founding father of North Korean socialist realist poetry, or indeed poetry in general, or even North Korean literature as a whole. In the mid-1950s many Soviet Koreans, including Cho's close friends, were discredited in purges. According to Gabroussenko, Cho's <b>untimely</b> <b>death</b> in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E

5|$|One {{year after}} Arthur's death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital {{alliance}} with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur's brother Henry, who had by then become Prince of Wales. Arthur's <b>untimely</b> <b>death</b> {{paved the way}} for Henry's accession as Henry VIII in 1509. The potential for a question as to the consummation of Arthur and Catherine's marriage, was much later (and in a completely different political context) exploited by Henry and his court to cast doubt on the validity of Catherine's union with Henry, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only {{intermittent}} use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis {{at the age of}} 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his <b>untimely</b> <b>death</b> in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother Luís. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon. On the assassination of Luís' son Carlos I in 1908, the palace passed into the ownership of the state. Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the monarchy fell two years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1521, Portuguese {{explorer}} Ferdinand Magellan {{became the}} first person from Europe to reach Asia by sailing west, a voyage of which he would meet an <b>untimely</b> <b>death</b> in the island of the Philippines. Spain sent expeditions to colonize the East Indies in their competition with Portugal to seize control over the spice trade. However, all of these expeditions failed. It was not until Miguel López de Legazpi, sailing from Mexico with five ships and five hundred men, reached the Philippines in 1565 and a Spanish settlement was established. López de Legazpi was greeted by hostile Muslim tribes opposing a foreign invasion. His attempt {{to land on the}} island of Cebu resulted in the death of one of his soldiers prompting him to explore another island and seek trade with various tribes.|$|E
5|$|Time Inc was {{the title}} for the {{concluding}} two-part story-arc as to have originally been written by Robert Holmes for episodes 13 & 14 when commissioned on 4 February 1986. However, Holmes was unable {{to work on the}} script past the first part due to his <b>untimely</b> <b>death</b> on 24 May 1986. Script editor Eric Saward was tasked with completing the story, his version of the script ending with the Doctor and the Valeyard locked in battle in the time vortex and no clear victor. This was disapproved by series producer John Nathan-Turner as being too down-beat and would end the show on an inconclusive moment should the BBC decide to cancel the series. The final episode was subsequently commissioned from Pip & Jane Baker by Nathan-Turner after Saward quit as script editor following the rejection of his proposed ending.|$|E
40|$|This study, {{based on}} nine folktales {{recorded}} between 1972 and 1987 in Anambra, Enugu and Imo States of Nigeria, considers the traditional attitude towards <b>untimely</b> <b>deaths,</b> especially repeated children’s deaths as presented in oral literature. The {{article focuses on}} three of these folktales, told by the same story-teller from Umuida, in Enugu-Ezike (northern Igboland) and recorded in September-October 1986 and March 1987, which provide {{a clear picture of}} the phenomenon. Traditional Igbo society has always explained these <b>untimely</b> <b>deaths</b> as having a supernatural cause, and oral genres, especially folktales, embed this explanation in narratives centred around young characters described as ogbanje (o gba nje « traveller ») children who come and go and cannot/choose not to stay in this world...|$|R

5|$|Tom Thumb, Fielding's sixth play, {{was added}} to the ninth showing of The Author's Farce, 24 April 1730. Together, the shows lasted at the Haymarket until they were {{replaced}} by Fielding's next production, Rape upon Rape. Tom Thumb was later included with other productions, including Rape upon Rape, and later transformed into the Tragedy of Tragedies. In the print edition, Fielding added footnotes, prefaces, and prologues, which introduced the narratorial style found in Fielding's later works. The plot deals with the English hero, Tom Thumb, who is of only tiny proportions. After defeating a group of giants, Tom Thumb is handsomely rewarded by King Arthur, which later erupts in a comical love triangle between Tom, Arthur's wife Queen Dollalolla, and Princess Huncamunca. Tom is eventually swallowed by a cow and killed. Soon after, his ghost appears but meets an <b>untimely</b> <b>death.</b> This scene reportedly provoked Jonathan Swift to laughter, a rare feat. The farcical nature of Tom Thumb pokes fun at 17th and 18th-century tragedy, gender roles and gender politics.|$|E
5|$|Grant Morrison later {{chose to}} heavily reimagine Kathy Kane in 2011 for his Batman Incorporated series. It is {{established}} that Kathy Kane was born Katherine Webb, {{and that she}} had been an aspiring independent film director prior to marrying a millionaire named Nathan Kane, the son of Roderick and Elizabeth Kane and brother of Martha (Kane) Wayne, Bruce Wayne's mother. Nathan and Kathy were madly in love with one another, and it was Nathan who ended up buying Kathy her circus as a birthday present. After Nathan's <b>untimely</b> <b>death,</b> Kathy was approached by a young man known only as Agent-33, who recruited her into a covert spy organization called Spyral. As part of her first assignment, Kathy was tasked with tracking down Batman and discovering his true identity. Donning a female variation of Batman's costume in order to gain his attention, she embarked on a career as a costumed crime-fighter while attempting to get close to Batman. Her plan succeeded but the two fell in love with one another, despite Kathy legally being Wayne's aunt. As a result, she refused to reveal his identity to her superiors at Spyral. Later, Kathy was confronted by the head of Spyral, a Nazi supervillain named Dr. Dedalus (Otto Netz) who claimed to be her real father and threatened to expose her to Batman unless she continued her mission. Heartbroken, she broke off her relationship with Bruce in order to save him from Dedalus' plan. In the present, Batman and the South American vigilante El Gaucho are told by the villainess Scorpiana that El Gaucho was responsible for Kathy's murder, as he had originally been Agent-33 prior to becoming a superhero. Batman tells Gaucho that Scorpiana must be lying since Kathy had been killed by the League of Assassins, but Gaucho claims that there is some truth in her accusations, and that Batman wouldn't understand. In the follow-up one-shot Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes, students of an assassin training facility masquerading as St. Hadrian's Finishing School For Girls in England are shown wearing variations of Kathy's Batwoman costume, with the original masks replaced by skulls. Later, these women are shown to be agents of Spyral, dedicated to hunting down Talia al Ghul, whose organisation Leviathan is waging war with Batman. Kathy reappears alive in the concluding issue of Batman Incorporated, in which she shoots Talia al Ghul dead in the Batcave. Identifying herself as St Hadrian's headmistress and requesting Batman not to go looking for her, she thanks Batman for leading Talia into her trap and reports to Spyral headquarters that one more international criminal has been killed.|$|E
