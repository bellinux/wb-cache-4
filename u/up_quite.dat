25|$|The tail is customarily docked {{soon after}} birth to {{approximately}} {{two-thirds of the}} original length. In countries where docking is prohibited, the conformation judges emphasise tail carriage.

They are preferably slightly darker {{than the rest of}} the coat.|$|E
25|$|It {{takes about}} 400 years for ice to {{traverse}} {{the length of}} the glacier, meaning that the ice {{at the foot of the}} glacier is about 400 years old. The glacier routinely calves off icebergs the size of a ten-story building. Where the glacier meets the bay, most of the ice is below the waterline, and newly calved icebergs can shoot <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> dramatically, so that ships must keep their distance from the edge of the glacier in Disenchantment Bay.|$|E

25|$|Stewart was {{the second}} of seven children—he has five younger sisters—born to his mother, Sue, and his father, Norman, who came from a {{combined}} Jamaican and Irish background. Stewart grew <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> poor but he still loved to play hockey and was noted for his tenacity even before reaching his full size. He and Anthony played with the North York Jr. Canadiens, and thanks to {{a representative of the}} team, his hockey was paid for entirely. He also liked football and seriously considered playing it throughout his high school years at West Hill Collegiate Institute. Growing up, Stewart became friends with fellow Toronto native hockey player Wayne Simmonds, currently of the Philadelphia Flyers, and they return to Toronto as house-mates during the NHL off-season.|$|E
25|$|Most single-breasted suits {{have two}} or three buttons, and one or four buttons are unusual (except that dinner jackets ("black tie") often have only one button). It is rare to find a suit with more than four buttons, {{although}} zoot suits can have as many as six or more due to their longer length. There is also variation in the placement and style of buttons, since the button placement is critical to the overall impression of height conveyed by the jacket. The centre or top button will typically line <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> closely with the natural waistline. There seems to be no clear rule as to which side the overlap should lie. It usually crosses naturally with the left side to the fore but not invariably. Generally, a hidden button holds the underlap in place.|$|E
25|$|As the French were {{successfully}} moving forward, the Austrian Advance Guard, under Feldmareschalleutnant Nordmann, supported by Feldmareschalleutnant Klenau's VI Korps, in all 25,000 infantrymen, were gradually withdrawing northwards. The Austrian infantry were formed in masses, a formation that had proved very efficient in fending off cavalry, but whose compact ranks made it extremely vulnerable to artillery fire. Casualties began to mount {{at an alarming}} rate and Nordmann's infantry, initially 12,000 men strong, was particularly exposed to artillery fire during its retreat towards Grosshofen. Additionally, towards 13:00, Nordmann became extremely concerned that the numerous French cavalry, might cut him {{off from the rest of}} the army. Seeing the dangerous situation of his Advance Guard, Archduke Charles ordered Liechtenstein to the rescue of these infantrymen with five cavalry regiments. Liechtenstein moved swiftly towards the east with his squadrons, arriving in the vicinity of Glinzendorf, but then remained passive, while the French, who now had a numerous combined-arms presence there, were able to continue their advance unmolested. The first serious Austrian attempt to slow down the French onslaught came towards 15:00, when Liechtenstein and Nordmann tried to organise a joint operation, but they gave <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> early on, realising that they were opposed by a very powerful force of several infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions from Maréchal Davout's III French Corps. The Austrians pulled back, leaving Davout free to position his men between Glinzendorf and Raasdorf, thus drawing closer to the II Corps.|$|E

Following their returns to Holby City in October 2014 and April 2015 respectively, Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon) and Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) featured in one episode of Casualty each.

500|$|Variety {{magazine}} called the film [...] "well-executed and original", praising the performances, and the editing by Gerry Hambling. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "If [...] can't resist the occasional fancy or cutesy flourishes... {{that tend to}} compromise his work, he still allows his material to exist on its own level and makes it fun to watch." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote that the film was [...] "a deadly funny movie; nearly every scene is broken off with a punch line. But Parker's sense of comedy is organic; he never lets the jokes elbow the characters, or the music, out of the spotlight." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "... Parker has loosened <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> a bit here, not forcing the action {{as much as he}} did in the similar Fame and bringing a surprisingly loony touch to characters like Jimmy's Elvis-obsessed father." [...] Time magazine reviewer Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "The film offers no message, no solutions, only a great time at the movies." ...|$|E

But hopefully people will come to accept it." [...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting the other day that the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown <b>up,</b> <b>quite</b> mature and savvy. He thinks with his head and knows what he wants and doesn't have to use brute force to get it." [...] During Rebecca's vision, Thomas Smith portrayed a six-year-old Declan.|$|E

500|$|FreeSpace 2 has {{garnered}} {{high praise}} from most established reviewers. FreeSpace 2 received numerous [...] "Game of the Year" [...] awards for 1999, and {{was nominated for}} [...] "Computer Simulation Game of the Year" [...] in the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, 2000. Every review praised FreeSpace 2s graphics. From the ships to the backgrounds, the reviewers were pleased with the details Volition had paid attention to, such as the thematic differences in the ship designs between the races, the textures and clarity of the backdrops, and even the realism of the explosions, though FiringSquad pointed out explosions from torpedo strikes were lower in quality. The nebulae feature was also praised for its rendered atmosphere, which reviewers described as tense and paranoia-inducing as they keep expecting enemy ships to appear out of the gases in a deadly ambush. Even though a couple of reviewers wrote that the nebulae made them dizzy, they still liked the feature. Combatsim even claimed FreeSpace 2 was unrivaled among its space combat peers in the graphics department. The graphical standards were such that when XGP reviewed the Anniversary Edition in 2004, Wehbi found the graphics to stand <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> well to the recent games then.|$|E

Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> a bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately.

500|$|Returning {{to a job}} in {{the physics}} {{department}} at Auckland, Gascoigne worked on military optics, developing gun sights and rangefinders, although he did not remain there for long. Richard van der Riet Woolley, director of the Commonwealth Solar Observatory in Canberra (now Mount Stromlo Observatory), sought out Gascoigne because his [...] "experience in optical work [...] unique" [...] and Gascoigne was [...] "trained in a way that no one else in Australia has been qualified". When in 1941 Gascoigne was offered a research fellowship by Woolley, he moved to Canberra. The Solar Observatory staff had similar responsibilities to those Gascoigne had held in New Zealand. His first task was to design an anti-aircraft gun sight, and he was also involved in a range of other military optical projects. In 1944, the Melbourne Observatory, home to the Commonwealth Time Service, was closed. Gascoigne reestablished the Time Service at Mount Stromlo, using two Shortt-Synchronome clocks and astronomical observing equipment that he and his colleagues adapted; the Time Service remained at Mount Stromlo until 1968. The knowledge and experience Gascoigne gained during the war proved valuable. He was at the only facility in Australia where optical work could be done, from design and manufacture to assembly and testing. Gascoigne developed a wide range of skills and [...] "finished <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> practical, especially with a screwdriver." ...|$|E

2500|$|Piero Sraffa and Joan Robinson, {{whose work}} {{set off the}} Cambridge controversy, {{pointed out that there}} was an {{inherent}} measurement problem in applying this model of income distribution to capital. Capitalist income (total profit or property income) is defined as the rate of profit multiplied by the amount of capital, but the measurement of the [...] "amount of capital" [...] involves adding <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> incomparable physical objects [...] adding the number of trucks to the number of lasers, for example.

2500|$|PC Gamers Phil Savage {{praised the}} game's {{character}} interactions, noting that [...] "it's through these brief, unguarded conversations that the cyberpunk bartending sim slowly unfolds its story; {{not of a}} dystopian world, but of {{the people living in}} it." [...] Reviewing the game's prologue trailer, he added that [...] "it's an interesting concept, and well executed in what is—at this stage—a somewhat limited capacity." [...] Julian Benson of Kotaku wrote that [...] "Valhalla is a cocktail of game genres. It draws from visual novels, with each customer who visits your bar having a different story to tell. There's a healthy measure of Papers, Please, too, with you having to perform a mundane job (drink mixing) by following a complicated list of tasks. [...] And, on top of that you also get to manage and decorate your bar, so there's a dash of Animal Crossing for flavour." [...] He also quipped that [...] "year after year, nothing seems to slow the pace of successful cyberpunk bartender simulators." [...] Push Square's Nicola Hayden additionally added that [...] "gaining cult success around the more niche areas of the Internet, VA-11 HALL-A, a cyberpunk bartending simulator, has managed to stir <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> a fuss." [...] Pete Davison of MoeGamer praised the prologue's characters, dialogue, as well as cohesion between the gameplay and storytelling, finding it to be an [...] "enormously interesting prospect".|$|E

[...] He criticized the lack of Xbox Live compatibility {{or any kind of}} downloadable content, arguing [...] "the only improvements are superficial." [...] However, he also wrote [...] "Compared to competing titles, {{this is one of the}} best games available for the Xbox [...] I wholeheartedly recommend Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance for the Xbox. It's not serving up anything new, but it's still a grand adventure." [...] Christian Nutt scored the GameCube version 3.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "a wonderfully entertaining game that doesn't quite live up to the technical quality of the PS2 original or its Xbox incarnation." [...] He wrote [...] "the graphics have taken a subtle but damaging hit" [...] and criticized [...] "the game's frame rate, which is passable if slightly sluggish most of the time, but chunks <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> perceptibly when you rotate the dungeon."
