50|$|Great working {{distance}} {{and depth of}} field are important qualities {{for this type of}} microscope. Both qualities are inversely correlated with resolution: the higher the resolution (i.e. the greater the distance at which two adjacent points can be distinguished as separate), the smaller the depth of field and {{working distance}}. Some stereo microscopes can deliver a <b>useful</b> <b>magnification</b> up to 100×, comparable to a 10× objective and 10× eyepiece in a normal compound microscope, although the magnification is often much lower. This is around one tenth the useful resolution of a normal compound optical microscope.|$|E
40|$|A movable array {{composed}} of Ranger type seismometers, 60 -day film recorders and 7 -day {{magnetic tape recorders}} housed in compact trailers, has been developed. The array is useful for research requiring frequent instrument relocation such as P-delay, micro-seismicity, aftershock and signal-to-noise ratio studies. The array unit combines the functions found in conventional fixed stations {{with a high degree}} of mobility. Conveniences such as solid state amplifiers, radio and clock circuitry, internal calibration, and minimum installation time are special features. With the battery supply provided, a one week period of unattended film and tape recording is possible. With commercial power, the instruments can operate unattended for up to sixty days. <b>Useful</b> <b>magnification</b> up to several million is available, depending on the frequency band selected...|$|E
25|$|An {{electron}} microscope is a microscope {{that uses a}} beam of accelerated electrons {{as a source of}} illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, {{electron microscope}}s have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A scanning transmission electron microscope has achieved better than 50pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200nm resolution and <b>useful</b> <b>magnifications</b> below 2000x.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} of dental research is the observation of the oral tissues and the materials applied to the dentition. The changes in composition {{and structure of the}} outer surfaces and the materials deposited on these surfaces are of special interest. In the literature, a variety of replica techniques for these purposes is described (Grundy in 1971 [12]; Saxton in 1973 [25]). The use of these techniques is limited because of artifacts in the samples, and a restricted resolution power resulting from <b>useful</b> <b>magnifications</b> in the order of 800 x. An accurate and universal replica technique for the examination of specimens to be viewed under the SEM has been developed. The first impression is made by a light body silicone elastomer (President Coltene). The positive replica is made by electrodeposition of copper in an electro plating bath (Acru plat 5 electronic, Dr. Th. Wieland, D- 7530 Pforzheim). The reliability and accuracy of this replica technique was verified by a scanning electron microscopic comparison of the replicas and the actual structures of etched enamel. To illustrate the applicability of the replica technique to structures with much lower hardness, also high resolution images of dental plaque were produced. The copper surface offers a perfect, original and proper electroconductive medium that withstands the bombardment of electrons and the relatively severe conditions in the scanning electron microscope. Reproducibility was accurate as judged by the duplication in position, size, and shape of the fine detail at magnifications of 7500 x offering a resolution of 25 nm. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new image-based guidance system for microsurgery using optical coherence tomography (OCT), which presents a virtual image in its correct location inside the scanned tissue. Applications include surgery of the cornea, skin, and other surfaces below which shallow targets may advantageously be displayed for the naked eye or low-power magnification by a surgical microscope or loupes (magnifying eyewear). OCT provides real-time highresolution (3 micron) images at video rates within a two or more millimeter axial range in soft tissue, and is therefore suitable for guidance to various shallow targets such as Schlemm’s canal in the eye (for treating Glaucoma) or skin tumors. A series of prototypes of the “OCT penlight ” have produced virtual images with sufficient resolution and intensity to be <b>useful</b> under <b>magnification,</b> while the geometrical arrangement between the OCT scanner and display optics (including a half-silvered mirror) permits sufficient surgical access. The two prototypes constructed thus far have used, respectively, a miniature {{organic light emitting diode}} (OLED) display and a reflective liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) display. The OLED has the advantage of relative simplicity, satisfactory resolution (15 micron), and color capability, whereas the LCoS can produce an image with much higher intensity and superior resolution (12 micron), although it is monochromatic and more complicated optically. Intensity is a crucial limiting factor, since light flux is greatly diminished with increasing magnification, thus favoring the LCoS as the more practical system...|$|R
30|$|The {{answer to}} this {{question}} may reside in the properties of the specimen preparation itself. For a sample with a strong level of heavy metal staining, use {{of a large number of}} tilt series might not be as beneficial since the incoming signal to noise ratio can be comparatively high. More data averaging will not likely bring out the details of unstained or weakly contrasted biological features in the reconstruction, while the high-resolution features can be muddied by over-staining. In this case, implementing wSIRT on fewer tilt series may be judicious. A “multiple tilt and summed view averaging technique”—like the one presented here—may be more <b>useful</b> at lower <b>magnification.</b> For a sample with low staining level, this averaging technique would probably bring more reconstruction details than a regular tomographic process (with a single/double tilt series scheme), as our example on the clathrin-coated vesicle seems to indicate. Further investigations in this direction need to be done.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the rehabilitative approach {{in patients with}} ring scotoma. A central scotoma is characteristic for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Sometimes patients with AMD maintain a residual central vision area within the scotoma (ring scotoma). Design: Prospective, nonrandomized case series. Participants: Twenty-four patients with AMD. Methods: A formal low-vision assessment was performed for all study patients. The assessment included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity, reading speed, and microperimetry. All patients were provided a low-vision assessment to satisfy patients' needs. Devices were prescribed accordingly. Results: The BCVA found was 0. 4 logMAR (SD 0. 1). All had central and stable fixation. Residual central retinal area size and sensitivity measured 2. 4 ° (SD 0. 8) and 3. 1 dB (SD 0. 8), respectively. Twenty patients achieved better vision with optical magnification in the eye with ring scotoma. Mean reading speed achieved was 50. 2 words/min (SD 20. 9). A linear correlation was found for reading speed with both central area sensitivity (r 2 = 0. 5, p < 0. 05) and contrast sensitivity (r 2 = 0. 3, p < 0. 05). Conclusions: In patients with AMD with ring scotoma, moderate amounts of magnification seem to provide satisfactory rehabilitation outcomes. Central retinal spared area sensitivity may predict reading speed outcomes, whereas residual central area size {{is likely to be}} <b>useful</b> in determining <b>magnification...</b>|$|R
