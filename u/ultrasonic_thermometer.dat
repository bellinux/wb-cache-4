40|$|We {{are testing}} a {{high-resolution}} <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>thermometer</b> with a noise {{floor at the}} µK level to improve the accuracy of radiation dosimetry methods that rely upon water calorimetry as a primary standard. Conventional water calorimeters, based upon the original design of Domen, detect temperature changes in irradiated water with thermistors that are sealed inside a thin sheath of glass. Recovering absorbed dose to water from these measurements requires the application of correction factors {{to compensate for the}} effects of self-heating of the thermistors, of excess heat induced in nonwater materials by the radiation, and of heat transfer due to dose gradients within the phantom. The ultrasonic approach dispenses with nonwater materials inside the water phantom, thereby eliminating or reducing sources of excess heat and the corresponding dose gradients. The prototype instrument, which involves a single ultrasonic transducer and an analog pulsed phase-locked loop, has been tested in 60 Co, and initial measurements have yielded values of absorbed dose to water that are within 10 % of the nominal value, with a temperature sensitivity of 10 μK. A digital prototype of this instrument can improve temperature sensitivity by an order-of-magnitude and make practical two dimensional dose profiles in water by using tomographic reconstruction of multiple-channel ultrasonic projections...|$|E
40|$|An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>thermometer</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for high temperature measurement over a wide temperature range. It is particularly suitable for use in measuring nuclear fuel rod centerline temperatures in advanced liquid metal and high flux nuclear reactors. The thermometer {{which was designed to}} determine fuel temperature up to the fuel melting point, utilizes the temperature dependence of the ultrasonic propagation velocity (related to the elastic modulus} in a thin rod sensor as the temperature transducing mechanism. A pulse excitation technique has been used, where the mechanical resonator at the remote end of the acoustic·line is madto vibrate. Its natural frequency is proportional to the ultrasonic velocity in the material. This is measured by the electronic instrumentation and enables a frequency­ temperature or period-temperature calibration to be obtained. A completely digital automatic instrument has been designed, constructed and tested to track the resonance frequency of the temperature sensors. It operates smoothly over a frequency range of about 30 %, more than the maximum working range of most probe materials. The control uses the basic property of a resonator that the stored energy decays exponentially at the natural frequency of the resonator. The operation of the electronic system is based on a digital multichannel transmitter that is capable of operating with a predefined number of cycles in the burst. this overcomes a basic defect in the previous deslgn where the analogue time-delayed circuits failed to hold synchronization and hence automatic control could be lost. Development of a particular type of temperature probe, that is small enough to fit into a standard 2 mm reactor tube has made the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>thermometer</b> a practicable device for measuring fuel temperature. The bulkiness of previous probes has been overcome, the new design consists of a tuning fork, integral with a 1 mm line, while maintaining a frequency of no more than 100 kHz. A magnetostrictive rod, acoustically matched to the probe is used to launch and receive the acoustic oscillations. This requires a magnetic bias and the previously used bulky magnets have been replaced by a direct current coil. The probe is supported by terminating the launcher with a short heavy isolating rod which can be secured to the reactor structure. This support, the bias and launching coil and the launcher are made up into a single compact unit. On the material side an extensive study {{of a wide range of}} refractory materials identified molybdenum, iridium, rhenium and tungsten as satisfactory for a number of applications but mostly exhibiting to some degree a calibration drift with thermal cycling. When attention was directed to ceramic materials, Sapphire (single crystal alumina) was found to have numerous advantages, particularly in respect of stability of calibration which remained with ± 2 °C after many cycles to 1800 oC. Tungsten and thoriated tungsten (W - 2 % Tho 2) were also found to be quite satisfactory to 1600 oC, the specification for a Euratom application...|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{transducers}} {{capable of}} control and test measurements in the 1400 - 1800 ˚C range in the fast neutron irradiation environment of the Gas Test Loop are evaluated. Among the instruments discussed are high-temperature thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>thermometers,</b> noise thermometers, and optical temperature sensors. High-temperature capability, behavior under irradiation, technical maturity, cost, and availability are among the key factors considered in assessing {{the relative merits of}} each measurement method. In the near term, the doped molybdenum versus niobium-zirconium alloy thermocouple is deemed to be best suited to the in-pile test and control requirements. Additional characterization of this thermocouple combination is needed to ensure confidence in its performance. Use of tungsten-rhenium alloy thermocouples, with specific disadvantages noted, constitutes the recommended back-up position.

40|$|The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has {{initiated}} {{an effort to}} evaluate the viability of using ultrasonic thermometry technology as an improved sensor for detecting temperature during irradiation testing of advanced fuels proposed within the Fuel Cycle Research and Development (FCR&D) program sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy (US DOE). <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>thermometers</b> (UTs) work {{on the principle that}} the speed at which sound travels through a material (acoustic velocity) is dependent on the temperature of the material. UTs have several advantages over other types of temperature sensors. UTs can be made very small, as the sensor consists only of a small diameter rod {{which may or may not}} require a sheath. Measurements may be made up to very high temperature (near the melting point of the sensor material) and, as no electrical insulation is required, shunting effects observed in traditional high temperature thermocouple applications are avoided. Most attractive, however, is the ability to introduce multiple acoustic discontinuities into the sensor, as this enables temperature profiling with a single sensor. The current paper presents initial results from FCR&D UT development efforts. These developments include improved methods for fabricating magnetostrictive transducers and joining them to waveguides, characterization of candidate sensor materials appropriate for use in FCR&D fuels irradiations (both ceramic fuels in inert gas and sodium bonded metallic fuels), enhanced signal processing techniques, and tests to determine potential accuracy and resolution...|$|R
40|$|The Idaho National Laboratory has {{recently}} initiated a new effort {{to evaluate the}} viability of using ultrasonic thermometry technology as an improved sensor for detecting temperature during irradiation testing. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>thermometers</b> (UTs) work {{on the principle that}} the speed at which sound travels through a material (acoustic velocity) is dependant on the temperature of the material. By introducing an acoustic pulse to the sensor and measuring the time delay of echoes, temperature may be derived. UTs have several advantages over other sensor types. UTs can be made very small, as the sensor consists only of a small diameter rod {{which may or may not}} require a sheath. Measurements may be made near the melting point of the sensor material, as no electrical insulation is required; and shunting effects are avoided. Most attractive, however, is the ability to introduce acoustic discontinuities to the sensor, as this enables temperature measurements at several points along the sensor length (allowing temperature profiling with a single sensor). A typical multi-sensor UT system, with key components identified, is shown in Figure 1. As indicated in this figure, a narrow ultrasonic pulse is generated in a magnetostrictive rod by an excitation coil. The ultrasonic pulse propagates to the sensor wire, where a fraction of the pulse energy is reflected at each discontinuity (notches or diameter change). Each reflected pulse is received by the excitation coil, transformed into an electrical signal, amplified and evaluated in a start/stop counter system. The time interval between two adjacent echoes is evaluated and compared to a calibration curve to give the average temperature in the corresponding sensor segment. When a number of notches are available on the wire sensor, the various measurements give access to a temperature profile along the probe. UTs have been used successfully for several applications; however, several problems have limited the success of these sensors. For example, signal processing can be very complicated, as multiple echoes may overlap. Contact between the sensor and solid materials can cause extraneous echoes. If a sheath is required, contact bonding at high temperatures may cause extraneous echoes or attenuation of primary echoes. The most successful materials used in previous studies, tungsten and rhenium, are unattractive for nuclear applications due to material transmutation. Clearly, in order for <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>thermometers</b> to be viable for an in-pile sensor, these issues must be resolved through the use of modern signal processing and materials technologies. As part of the INL feasibility study, all of the issues associated with UT use and proposed resolution options will be identified and evaluated. Once most promising options are proven, it is planned to produce one or more prototype ultrasonic temperature sensors for evaluation. Ultimately, a full test should include a long term installation in a high temperature test assembly installed in a high neutron flux environment, such as that found in the Idaho National Laboratory’s Advanced Test Reactor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUltrasonic {{technologies}} {{offer the}} potential for high accuracy and resolution in-pile measurement {{of a range of}} parameters, including geometry changes, temperature, crack initiation and growth, gas pressure and composition, and microstructural changes. Many Department of Energy-Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) programs are exploring the use of ultrasonic technologies to provide enhanced sensors for in-pile instrumentation during irradiation testing. For example, the ability of small diameter <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>thermometers</b> (UTs) to provide a temperature profile in candidate metallic and oxide fuel would provide much needed data for validating new fuel performance models, (Rempe et al., 2011; Kazys et al., 2005). These efforts are limited by the lack of identified ultrasonic transducer materials capable of long term performance under irradiation test conditions. To address this need, the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) was awarded an Advanced Test Reactor National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF) project to evaluate the performance of promising magnetostrictive and piezoelectric transducers in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Reactor (MITR) up to a fast fluence of at least 1021 n/cm 2. The irradiation is also supported by a multi-National Laboratory collaboration funded by the Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies Advanced Sensors and Instrumentation (NEET ASI) program. The results from this irradiation, which started in February 2014, offer the potential to enable the development of novel radiation tolerant ultrasonic sensors for use in Material Testing Reactors (MTRs). As such, this test is an instrumented lead test and real-time transducer performance data is collected along with temperature and neutron and gamma flux data. Hence, results from this irradiation offer the potential {{to bridge the gap between}} proven out-of-pile ultrasonic techniques and in-pile deployment of ultrasonic sensors by acquiring the data necessary to demonstrate the performance of ultrasonic transducers. To date, very encouraging results have been attained as several transducers have continued to operate under irradiation. The irradiation is ongoing and will continue to approximately mid- 2015...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{turbulence}} measurements from the MAP-RIVIERA project are analysed. During the project {{a number of}} permanent turbulence stations were installed on {{a cross section of}} the Riviera valley. Furthermore measurements from e. g. radio sounding systems and a passive microwave profiler were carried out during intensive observation periods. As large fractions of the alps are forested, a tower with amongst others six levels of <b>ultrasonic</b> anemometer <b>thermometers</b> was installed in a mixed forest at the slope (35 °). This data set is compared to studies carried out over forests in more ideal, flat terrain. The analysis is carried out for 30 min mean data, joint probability distributions, length scales and spectral characteristics. Furthermore patterns of coherent structures are determined and dominating time scales as well as flux fractions are calculated. Thermally induced slope and valley winds are interacting on different spatial and time scales leading to complex patterns in momentum transport which differ significantly from surface layer characteristics. Directional shear causes lateral momentum transports that are in the same order as the longitudinal ones. In the canopy a sharp attenuation of turbulence is observed. Skewed distributions of velocity components indicate that intermittent turbulent transports {{play an important role in}} the energy distribution. In the absence of larger scale waves energy is removed from the mean flow above the canopy and injected into coherent eddies. Length scales of these disturbances are comparable to those in forests in flat terrain. In the canopy work is done against pressure drag and against the viscous component of canopy drag. Kinetic energy is converted into fine scale wake turbulence and heat leading to vanishing second moments. It is shown that wave like structures are a very common feature of the stable boundary layer. In the valley atmosphere temperature fluctuations are observed which are in phase through the whole measured layer indicating terrain generated waves. These temperature oscillations are not confined to the valley centre but they are also observed on stations at the slope. Having a phase shift between valley and slope oscillations it is proposed that terrain generated waves back up or even enable the mechanism of compressional warming on the valley slopes. It is shown, that due to compressional warming a cycle is initiated in which (relatively colder) air is advected slope upwards above the canopy while in the canopy (relatively warmer) air drains at low speed. When the downslope winds occur above the canopy relatively warmer air is mixed into the canopy. This effect is strongest just before the onset of a new ´upslope event´...|$|R
