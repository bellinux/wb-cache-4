2500|$|The {{reason for}} the shootings was never determined. A typed letter left behind by Ferri {{contained}} a list of complaints, but the letter was largely unintelligible. Four single spaced pages in length, the letter contained many grammatical errors, misspellings and was typed in all caps. Ferri claimed he had been poisoned by monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor enhancer in food, {{and that he had}} been [...] "raped" [...] by Pettit & Martin and other firms. The letter also contained complaints against the Food and Drug Administration, the legal profession (which he claimed gave [...] "allegiance to the monarchy"), and a list of over 30 [...] "criminals, rapists, racketeeres, lobbyists", none of whom were among his actual victims. Pettit & Martin occupied floors 33 (partial floor) and 34 through 36. The main reception floor was 35 and Ferri intended that floor as a target. His elevator stopped at the 34th floor because a secretary from that floor had pushed the <b>up</b> <b>button</b> for an elevator. As a result, Ferri began shooting on the 34th floor and worked his way down to lower floors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{address bar}} has been {{modified}} {{to present a}} breadcrumbs view, which shows the full path to the current location. Clicking any location in the path hierarchy takes the user to that level, instead of repeatedly pressing the Back button or pressing the <b>up</b> <b>button.</b> This is roughly analogous to what is possible prior to Windows Vista by pressing the small down-arrow next to [...] "Back" [...] and selecting any folder {{from a list of}} previously accessed folders. It makes the [...] "Up One Level" [...] button obsolete so that is removed. It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow {{to the right of the}} last item, or to click in the space to the right of this to copy or edit the path manually. As with many other Microsoft-made Windows Vista applications, the menu bar is hidden by default. Pressing the Alt key makes the menu bar appear. Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars. Check boxes allow the selection of multiple files. When items are grouped, clicking the group header selects all items under that group. Multiple groups of files can also be selected by clicking the group headers while holding down Ctrl.|$|E

50|$|It {{is notable}} {{that the game}} has a third {{dimension}} despite being a side-scrolling one. Most levels consist of several parallel planes that the player character can move between. Having noticed a door or a window with another room in it, a player can make him run through it into that room with the <b>up</b> <b>button.</b> In that room, {{there will be a}} platform extending from the floor. From there, pressing the down button would make the character slip back into the room he came from.|$|E
50|$|Kirby's basic {{abilities}} include running, jumping, flight, swimming, and inhaling. Flight involves inhaling air (<b>Up</b> <b>button),</b> {{followed with}} the press of the jump button which will make Kirby fly. By continuously pushing the jump button, Kirby can reach any height (unless something prevents him from reaching that height). At any time when Kirby has inhaled air, he can exhale by either landing {{on the ground or}} you can also release it yourself. When the air is released, Kirby will exhale a puff of air, which can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to develop an overall {{strategy}} and structure for the software tool manual of the Orpheus platform. The Orpheus platform contains several powerful calculation software tools that are created, developed and used within Svenska Kullagerfabriken AB (SKF). Both qualitative and quantitative research methodology was utilized in this thesis. The qualitative research data consisted of five in-depth interviews with employees whose main tasks were to write the manual and give support to the users of the software. The quantitative research data was gathered {{with the aid of}} an electronic survey. Furthermore, a cognitive walkthrough and literature studies, were performed. The main problem with the web- based user manual was difficulties in finding information, which partly depended on the weak-designed layout and the structure of the user manual. The author recommends, inter alia, tree-structured menus, logo on all pages, back button, page <b>up</b> <b>button,</b> linkable pictures and breadcrumbs that show where the user is in the structure.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{efficiently}} perform a task in a human-in-the-loop system and in multi-sensory virtual environments is {{highly dependent on}} the type of sensory feedback the operator is receiving and the amount of workload the operator is exposed to. Despite the vast amount of research on Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) and Human Machine Interactions (HMIs), little is known about what type of feedback increases the performance of a human operator and what type of sensory feedback minimizes the amount of workload the operator is exposed to. While individual differences influence human performance outcomes, the physiological processes a human being set the fundamental guidelines for assessing human performance. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the performance of participants for a combination of sensory two feedback modes (audio-visual, haptic-visual or audio-haptic) in a primary task to find the optimum feedback model for CVE and HMI applications. A concurrent secondary task is also designed to evaluate workload of each feedback mode (audio, haptic or visual) and the effect of different levels of workload on task completion time and task accuracy. For example, a car driver performs a primary task by steering the car in the correct direction. A secondary task, in the same context, would be monitoring the fuel level or checking the speed limit. In the primary task, participants are required to press a virtual button from a set of three (right button, left button or <b>up</b> <b>button).</b> The secondary task evaluates the amount of workload the participant is exposed to in three different feedback modes (haptic, audio or visual). Each participant is required to recognize a Morse code. In this study, participants perform three trials. In first trial, participants perform one task the primary task alone. In the second and third trials, participants perform the primary task and the secondary task concurrently. The primary task evaluates human performance and includes combined sensory modalities as a feedback mode (audio-visual, haptic-visual or audio-haptic). The time it takes the participant to press the virtual button (primary task response time), the number of correct button presses (primary task accuracy), the time it takes the participant to recognize the Morse code (secondary task response time) and the number of the correct codes (secondary task accuracy) are all collected. In addition, NASA Task Load Index (TLX) questionnaire is used after each trial to assess the subjective performance and subjective workload of participants. The data collected is tested for normality using Lilliefors test, filtered using Grubb’s test to eliminate outlying data and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and multiple two-sample t-tests. A Tukey HSD is also used to show the differences between experimental conditions. The results of this study indicate that the hypothesis that all combinations of feedback provide the same performance can be rejected for the primary task response time. For instance, the results show that the there is a difference in response time between the audio-haptic and the audio-visual feedback modes in the first, second and third trials. The results of this study also indicate that the hypothesis that all sensory feedback modes provide the same workload can be rejected for the secondary task accuracy. Results show that there is a difference between haptic and auditory conditions and shows that visual condition has a lower accuracy than the other feedback modes...|$|E
50|$|Current HD {{receivers}} {{support the}} 480i, 480p, 720p and 1080i resolutions. 1080p is not supported, despite {{claims to the}} contrary by Bell. To allow backward compatibility with older SDTVs and {{due to the fact}} that non-HD receivers are no longer sold, HD receivers are compatible with a composite video or S-Video connection. A separate adapter is required for legacy coaxial cable connections. All three methods only provide a 480i resolution due to technical limitations.
