5|$|Cranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking, but <b>unrelated,</b> herons, cranes {{fly with}} their necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have {{elaborate}} and noisy courting displays.|$|E
5|$|Double cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two {{different}} F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four <b>unrelated</b> grandparents).|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with <b>unrelated</b> males from distant colonies. The relatedness among workers {{is also very}} low, {{and there is a}} high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all <b>unrelated,</b> the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally <b>unrelated,</b> and it is uncommon for them to have a degree of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Respectable Athenian women {{remained}} {{separate from}} <b>unrelated</b> men and Athenian citizens considered it degrading for citizen-women to work, but women (free and unfree) are attested as {{working in a}} number of capacities. Women engaged in occupations which were an extension of household jobs, such as textile work and washing, and those <b>unrelated</b> to household tasks: cobblers, gilders, net-weavers, potters, and grooms.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Greek Τυφῶν (Tuphôn, Typhon) is not <b>unrelated</b> and has {{secondarily}} contaminated the word. The Persian and Chinese terms {{may have}} been originated by the Greek word in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The Galactic Barrier {{is later}} {{associated}} with the Q, in two <b>unrelated</b> and noncanon novels: 1994's Q-Squared by Peter David, and Greg Cox's 1998 Q Continuum novels.|$|E

5|$|A second <b>unrelated</b> Highway108 {{existed for}} {{approximately}} {{a year in}} Toronto, following The Queensway between Highway27 and the Queen Elizabeth Way. Like most provincial highways in Toronto, it was transferred to Metropolitan Toronto after its formation. The current Highway108 was designated in 1957 and has remained more-or-less unchanged since then.|$|E
5|$|A {{section of}} US41 {{is one of}} six <b>unrelated</b> Veterans Memorial Highway {{designation}}s in Michigan. The Upper Peninsula designation follows {{the western end of}} M-28, including the section of US41 between Ishpeming and Covington. This memorial was created in Public Act 10 of 2003 and dedicated on Memorial Day in 2004.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Super Paper Mario, was {{developed}} by Intelligent Systems and released for the Wii in 2007. It has a stronger emphasis on platforming than its predecessor. Super Paper Marios plot is <b>unrelated</b> {{to the story of}} The Thousand-Year Door, but it contains many easter eggs referencing characters from the previous two games.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{population}} census of 2011, there are 43 Jews in Mauritius. The current community is <b>unrelated</b> to the 1940s fugitives. The first Bar Mitzvah in Mauritius since World War II took place in 2000.|$|E
5|$|At {{least seven}} species of millipedes in the genera Apheloria and Brachoria (Xystodesmidae) form a Müllerian mimicry {{ring in the}} eastern United States, in which <b>unrelated</b> {{polymorphic}} species converge on similar colour patterns where their range overlaps.|$|E
5|$|Bajramović {{and four}} {{other members of his}} unit were convicted in an <b>unrelated</b> case of killing and abuse of Serb and Croat civilians {{committed}} in Poljana near Pakrac in 1991.

5|$|Blood film {{examination}} {{may reveal}} basophilic stippling of {{red blood cells}} (dots in red blood cells visible through a microscope), {{as well as the}} changes normally associated with iron-deficiency anemia (microcytosis and hypochromasia). However, basophilic stippling is also seen in <b>unrelated</b> conditions, such as megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 (colbalamin) and folate deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are <b>unrelated.</b> They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Early {{discoveries of}} indricotheres were made through various colonial links to Asia. The first known indricothere fossils were {{collected}} from Balochistan (in modern-day Pakistan) in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary, but these fragments were unidentifiable at the time. The first fossils now recognised as Paraceratherium were discovered by the British geologist Guy Ellcock Pilgrim in Balochistan in 1907–1908. His material consisted of an upper jaw, lower teeth, {{and the back of}} a jaw. The fossils were collected in the Chitarwata Formation of Dera Bugti, where Pilgrim had previously been exploring. In 1908, he used the fossils as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus Aceratherium; A. bugtiense. Aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon; it included several <b>unrelated</b> species of hornless rhinoceros, many of which have since been moved to other genera. Fossil incisors that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the <b>unrelated</b> genus Bugtitherium were later shown to belong to the new species.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the series}} the Dragon Quest games were {{released}} under the title Dragon Warrior in North America to avoid trademark conflict with the <b>unrelated</b> tabletop role-playing game DragonQuest. Square Enix did not register the Dragon Quest trademark {{for use in the}} United States until 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following demobilisation, Maxwell {{worked as}} a {{gardener}} in Canberra, Moree and the Maitland district. Having {{described himself as a}} reporter, Maxwell married 19-year-old tailoress Mabel Maxwell (<b>unrelated)</b> in a Catholic ceremony at Bellevue Hill, Sydney on 14 February 1921. The marriage produced a daughter, Jean, before being dissolved in 1926 upon Mabel's instigation.|$|E
5|$|Garland {{began writing}} the script in 2006, {{although}} {{the development of}} a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, <b>unrelated</b> to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal bicolors {{of white}} and red being a {{relatively}} widespread design, there are several flags that are similar but <b>unrelated</b> to the Polish one. There are two national flags with the red stripe above the white one: those of Indonesia and Monaco. In Poland, many flags based on the national design also feature the national colors.|$|E
5|$|IC in a Sunflower {{consists}} of seven short stories, a format that Mitsukazu Mihara frequently uses for her narrative. The stories are <b>unrelated</b> to each other, each featuring a different protagonist. The stories of IC in a Sunflower sometimes incorporate a twist ending.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Warren Jeffs {{was convicted}} in Texas on sexual assault charges <b>unrelated</b> to Wall's case and {{sentenced to life in}} prison plus 20 years. Since Warren Jeffs would {{therefore}} be 100 years old by the earliest time he could be released from prison, Utah decided to drop the retrial.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, Mehdi Hashemi, the leaker of the scandal, was {{executed}} in 1987, allegedly for activities <b>unrelated</b> to the scandal. Though Hashemi made a full video confession to numerous serious charges, some observers find the coincidence of his leak {{and the subsequent}} prosecution highly suspicious.|$|E
5|$|In March 1990, Conway {{became an}} {{experimental}} bone marrow donor for Mark Stevenson, a 4-year-old with Hunter syndrome. The operation – {{the first of}} its kind involving an <b>unrelated</b> donor – was a success, allowing Mark to live to 24. Conway became an active volunteer for the National Marrow Donor Program, claiming to have helped add over 500 entries to their donor registry.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, <b>unrelated</b> to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, <b>unrelated</b> to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, the 610 Office {{performs}} functions <b>unrelated</b> to {{the monitoring}} and persecution of unrecognized religions.

5|$|In {{the letter}} column of Kill or Be Killed #12 (September 2017), Brubaker {{mentioned}} {{plans for a}} semi-sequel to The Fade Out. He said that if made, the comic book would share the setting {{and some of the}} supporting characters, but the plot would be <b>unrelated.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper <b>unrelated</b> to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is <b>unrelated</b> to {{the true}} wrens. Initially fairywrens {{were thought to be}} a member of the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae or warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly {{recognised}} Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) and Pardalotidae (peep-wrens) in a large superfamily, Meliphagoidea.|$|E
5|$|Loons are aquatic {{birds that}} are {{the size of a}} large duck, to which they are <b>unrelated.</b> Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are {{extremely}} poor at walking. Three species have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
