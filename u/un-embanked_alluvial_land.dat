40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} how {{political}} crises of mid 16 thcentury became the centrifugal force for establishment of new state of Khurda within the unexplored strategic mountain range of coastal Orissa; and how the state took the territorial advantage from the pan-Indian Empires that were going through a major political crisis. However, when the state of Khurdatried to expand her hegemony from the mountain ranges to the productive alluvial tract and religious-ritual center of the old empire, it faced utmost external invasion. The state has succeeded in taking advantage of natural protections provided by the forests and hills of the geo-political region of Khurda, where its rulers had concentrated military strength in the forts and attempted to hold the fertile <b>alluvial</b> <b>land</b> of {{the area around the}} temple town of Puri, which provided politico-ritual legitimacy to the kingdom of Khurda. Nevertheless, the contention over the fertile <b>alluvial</b> <b>land</b> of Puri resulted in the loss of this precious territory to the Marathas...|$|R

Settling the floodplain has resulted in periodic problems for residents, as there are regular floods despite (and because of) elaborate constructed systems of levees and flood controls.|$|R
50|$|From its {{founding}} until 1725, Westfield was the westernmost {{settlement in the}} Massachusetts Colony, and portions of it fell within the Equivalent Lands. Town meetings were held in a church meeting house until 1839, when Town Hall was erected on Broad Street. This building also served as City Hall from 1920 to 1958.

25|$|The {{breadth of}} the {{alluvial}} region along the Mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15km) across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its own natural deposits (known as a levee), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3m/km). The <b>alluvial</b> <b>lands</b> along other streams present similar features.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} model was constructed {{to ascertain the}} extent of benefits from spatial diversification when an intensive form of use is assumed for the additional (<b>alluvial)</b> <b>land.</b> Although expected profit increased and coefficient of variation decreased, the return to additional capital was only 2. 7 per cent. Spatial diversification successfully overcomes winter-spring feed uncertainties, but appears economically doubtful under present assumptions. Some alternatives and modifications are suggested which, although untested, might improve the economics of diversification. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
