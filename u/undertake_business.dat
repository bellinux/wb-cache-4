I test its predictions in the context of e-business adoption using a large multi-industry data set. Robust conditional correlations suggest that market leaders were more likely to adopt new e-business practices only in settings that required little customer investment or where customer capabilities were well-aligned with the new technology. Otherwise, leaders ’ adoption was significantly lower than that of their lessprominent competitors. The findings highlight the strategic significance of adjustment costs in technology adoption, both within and beyond the firm boundary...|$|E

However, the focus tends to be on the ‘business of business’ while the ethical, moral and social responsibility of business practice is neglected. This study evaluates students’ responses to a new approach to teaching business ethics to an undergraduate cohort; a new,creative teaching model emphasizing a unique learning experience designed to encourage students to experience critical thinking, to analyse and synthesise ethical situations and reflect upon their learning experience. The model, with the acronym S. T. A. R - See, Talk, Act and Review - was introduced. Students were provided with conceptual tools and techniques to examine, act and reflect on ethical issues. Using a mixed methods approach, students’ responses to the course were collected and their views of the new approach examined. Results suggest that, as well as a discernible shift in their view of the place of ethics in business, students have been far more engaged in the course and developing their learning experience...|$|E

40|$|Improving the {{performance}} of private sector small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in a cost effective manner {{is a major concern}} for government. Governments have saved costs by moving information online rather than through more expensive face-to-face exchanges between advisers and clients. Building on previous work that distinguished between types of advice, this article evaluates whether these changes to delivery mechanisms affect the type of advice received. Using a multinomial logit model of 1334 cases of business advice to small firms collected in England, the study found that advice to improve capabilities was taken by smaller firms who were less likely to have limited liability or <b>undertake</b> <b>business</b> planning. SMEs sought word-of-mouth referrals before taking internal, capability-enhancing advice. This is also the case when that advice was part of a wider package of assistance involving both internal and external aspects. Only when firms took advice that used extant capabilities did they rely on the Internet. Therefore, when the Internet is privileged over face-to-face advice the changes made by each recipient of advice are likely to diminish causing less impact from advice within the economy. It implies that fewer firms will adopt the sorts of management practices that would improve their productivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of my thesis is to analyse and clarify the process of foundation, {{incorporation}} and invalidity of the business company. A business company may {{be defined as a}} private association of persons established under an agreement, whose purpose is to <b>undertake</b> <b>business.</b> Members contribute their own money to the business and divide among themselves the profits attained. Regulation of all types of business company is contained in Part II of the Commercial Code. Our Commercial Code provides six types of the business company: Unlimited liability company, limited partnership company, limited liability company, joint-stock company, European public limited company and finally European economic interest grouping. It is necessary to be careful with the translation of the concrete types of the company, because this is only approximate translation of the terms, because of the distinct legal institutions in each legal system. The thesis is composed of seven chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of the above mentioned process of foundation, incorporation and invalidity of the business company. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis. The chapter is subdivided into three subchapters. The subchapter one deals with the concept of the legal person in general. The [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Business process {{re-engineering}} (BPR) is the vogue, although somewhat discredited, {{change management}} method. If is as {{an information technology}} (IT) -based and customer-driven approach to organizational change, undertaken to enable superior performance, such as cost reduction, shorter cycle time, higher product quality and increased customer satisfaction. Although the literature on reengineering principles and prospects is large, there is little empirical research evaluating {{the success or failure}} of BPR initiatives. This is especially so in small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in which the potential for BPR benefits may differ significantly from that in their larger counterparts. SMEs are the fastest growing segment of most economies and are perceived to be more flexible and adaptable in terms of structure and speed of response than larger organizations. The literature speculates that SMEs have as good a chance of re-engineering successfully as their larger counterparts, although this is untested. Yet, with limited resources, such as IT and BPR expertise, and financial constraints, SMEs may find it difficult to re-engineer. This paper addresses the role of BPR in SMEs and develops a framework to assess ifs implementation potential. Factors that facilitate and inhibit BPR performance are identified and analysed as the basis for empirical testing. A set of propositions is developed that allows operationalization of the framework. The ultimate goal is to develop a process and fool set to assist SMEs wishing to <b>undertake</b> <b>business</b> process re-engineering...|$|E
