40|$|To {{constrain}} {{the increase in}} atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations, there are European <b>and</b> na-tional drives <b>to</b> develop {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) schemes for the permanent geological storage of CO 2 from industrial sources in deeply buried strata. Currently, offshore sites are considered preferable to geological store in strata onshore. Although the target storage reservoirs, saline aquifers or former hydro-carbon fields are often at depths of 1 km or more, knowledge of the shallow area is important. This is not only for the positioning of infrastructure, wells, pipelines, etc., but also in the monitoring of any potential leakage from the reservoir over the site’s lifetime, which may span 25 – 50 years. Baseline and repeat surveys are nec-essary <b>and</b> may need <b>to</b> cover a considerably wider area than the expected plume extent in the reservoir, de-pending on the predicted gas leakage pathways. Hence a complete geological model is required from the pro-posed reservoir at a depth that is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>includes</b> the seabed...|$|R

40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between fetal, placental and metrial gland weights and the {{cellular}} {{composition of the}} placentae and metrial glands of pregnant inbred (Agus), outbred (Agus x Wistar) and random-bred (Wistar) rats. Fetal and placental weight differences between inbred and outbred rats provided evidence of hybrid vigour. Metrial gland weight differences between inbred and outbred rats showed that the Agus mothers responded to hybrid (Agus x Wistar) fetuses by producing heavier metrial glands than if they were carrying inbred fetuses, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>included</b> Day 18 of pregnancy. Histological examination revealed some differences between the 3 groups of rats at corresponding stages of pregnancy. Granulated metrial gland (GMG) cells formed {{a larger proportion of}} cells in the metrial gland in Agus rats carrying hybrid fetuses than in Agus rats carrying inbred fetuses <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Day 14 of pregnancy, but the situation was reversed after Day 14. Degenerative changes were more apparent in the metrial glands from Agus rats carrying hybrid fetuses than in rats from the other 2 groups from Day 15 of pregnancy onwards. Clusters of lymphocytes were a prominent feature of the placental labyrinths of Agus rats (mated with Agus or Wistar males) around Day 15 of pregnancy. Examination of single cell suspensions of metrial gland showed variations in the proportion of immunoglobulin G (Fc gamma) receptor bearing cells during pregnancy and between rats in the 3 groups of corresponding stages of pregnancy. The significance of the differences occurring in the metrial gland during pregnancy and between the groups at corresponding stages of pregnancy {{may be related to the}} functional involvement of GMG cells in cytotoxic activity directed against placental trophoblast...|$|R
