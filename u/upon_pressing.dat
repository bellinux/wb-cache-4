5|$|The {{intention}} for {{the first}} few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Sega's light gun game Virtua Cop; GoldenEyes gas plant location was modelled by Karl Hilton with a predetermined path in mind. Although GoldenEye is controlled with a pad rather than a light gun, Hollis credited Virtua Cop as an influence on the developers' adoption of features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and an alternative aiming system that is activated <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller.|$|E
2500|$|Despite criticisms, experimenters {{are still}} trying to gather data that may support the case that {{conscious}} [...] "will" [...] can be predicted from brain activity. fMRI machine learning of brain activity (multivariate pattern analysis) has been used to predict the user choice of a button (left/right) up to 7 seconds before their reported will of having done so. Brain regions successfully trained for prediction included the frontopolar cortex (anterior medial prefrontal cortex) and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (medial parietal cortex). In order to ensure report timing of conscious [...] "will" [...] to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500ms apart), and <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% accuracy rate, which may be limited by experimental setup; machine learning data limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision.|$|E

60|$|For {{some days}} Mr. Britling {{could think of}} nothing but Hugh, and always with a dull pain at his heart.

60|$|Pyecroft {{lay on his}} disreputable oars till Captain Malan, full-uniformed, {{descended the}} Devolution's side. With due compliments--not acknowledged, I grieve to say--we fell in behind his sumptuous galley, and at last, <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> invitation, climbed, black as sweeps all, the lowered gangway of the Cryptic. At the top stood as fine a {{constellation}} of marine stars as ever sang together of a morning on a King's ship. Every one who could get within earshot found that his work took him aft. I counted eleven able seamen polishing the breechblock of the stern nine-point-two, four marines zealously relieving {{each other at the}} life-buoy, six call-boys, nine midshipmen of the watch, exclusive of naval cadets, and the higher ranks past all census.|$|E
6000|$|In {{other ways}} he was inexorable, taking {{the hazards of}} the game with his {{visitors}} and raking in their money with cold eyes and a steady hand. He collected all notes remorselessly--and {{it was in this}} way that he had acquired his interests in [...] "The Bottom Dollar" [...] and [...] "The Flora" [...] mines--"prospects" [...] at the time, but immensely valuable at the present. It was, indeed, this new and measurably respectable wealth which had determined him <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> his suit with Bertha. As he sat there he came to a most momentous conclusion. [...] "Why not marry the girl and live honest?" [...] he asked himself; and being moved by the memory of her sweetness and humor, he said, [...] "I will," [...] and the resolution filled his heart with a strange delight.|$|E
60|$|I {{send this}} as an {{explanation}} to you, and {{to do justice to}} the Secretary of War. I was induced, <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> application, to authorize the agents of one of the districts of Pennsylvania to recruit in one of the prison depots in Illinois; and the thing went so far before it came to the knowledge of the Secretary that, in my judgment, it could not be abandoned without greater evil than would follow its going through. I did not know at the time that you had protested against that class of thing being done; and I now say that while this particular job must be completed, no other of the sort will be authorized, without an understanding with you, if at all. The Secretary of War is wholly free of any part in this blunder.|$|E

60|$|While even Scotland {{was thus}} {{wavering}} it seemed almost madness {{for the little}} army to advance into England. The greater portion of the Highlanders had from the first objected strongly to leave their country, and upwards of a thousand had deserted and gone home on the march down from Edinburgh. They had started less than six thousand strong, and after leaving a garrison of two hundred men in Carlisle, but four thousand five hundred were available for the advance south, while Wade, with his ten thousand men, would be in their rear and two English armies of nearly equal strength be waiting to receive them. At the council {{the opinions of the}} leaders were almost unanimous against an advance, but upon Lord George Murray saying that if Prince Charles decided upon advancing the army would follow him, he determined <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> forward.|$|E
60|$|Captain Hampton {{remained}} but a night, {{spending the}} evening {{in examining the}} newly-raised settlement, and wondering at the strange band of ignorant enthusiasts who had thus cut themselves off from the world and forsaken everything in their blind belief in an impostor as ignorant but more astute than themselves. He made many inquiries as {{to the possibility of}} getting together a band to follow up the Indians who were the authors of the massacre four days before, in order to punish them and to rescue the captives they might have carried off, but among the Mormons he found nothing but a dull apathy as to anything outside their own colony, while the emigrants were all too much bent <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> forward towards the land of gold, to listen to anything that would cause delay. He had mooted the subject to the men of his own party, but they had shaken their heads.|$|E
60|$|And hence we may {{understand}} that Bodies {{are much more}} rare and porous than is commonly believed. Water is nineteen times lighter, and by consequence nineteen times rarer than Gold; and Gold is so rare as very readily and without the least opposition to transmit the magnetick Effluvia, and easily to admit Quicksilver into its Pores, and to let Water pass through it. For a concave Sphere of Gold filled with Water, and solder'd up, has, <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> the Sphere with great force, let the Water squeeze through it, and stand all over its outside in multitudes of small Drops, like Dew, without bursting or cracking the Body of the Gold, as I have been inform'd by an Eye witness. From all which we may conclude, that Gold has more Pores than solid parts, and by consequence that Water has above forty times more Pores than Parts. And he that shall find out an Hypothesis, by which Water may be so rare, and yet not be capable of compression by force, may doubtless by the same Hypothesis make Gold, and Water, and all other Bodies, as much rarer as he pleases; so that Light may find a ready passage through transparent Substances.|$|E

60|$|Your Lordships {{see here}} a regular series of gradation, which {{requires}} eleven years before any persons can {{arrive at the}} highest trusts and situations. You will therefore be astonished, when so long a probationary service was required, that effects very different from those to be expected from long probation have happened, and that in a much shorter time than those eleven years you have seen persons returning into this kingdom with affluent, with overbearing fortunes. It {{will be a great}} part of your inquiry, when we come before your Lordships to substantiate evidence against Mr. Hastings, to discover how that order came to be so completely broken down and erased that scarce a trace of it for any good purpose remains. Though I will not deny that that order, or that any order in a state, may be superseded by the ruling power, when great talents, <b>upon</b> <b>pressing</b> exigencies, are to be called forth, yet I must say the order itself was formed upon wise principles. It furnished the persons who were put in that course of probation with an opportunity (if circumstances enabled them) of acquiring experience in business of revenue, trade, and policy. It gave to those who watched them a constant inspection of their conduct through all their progress. On the expectants of office it imposed the necessity of acquiring a character in proportion to their standing, in order that all which they had gained by the good behavior of years should not be lost by the misconduct of an hour. It was a great substantial regulation. But scarce a trace of the true spirit of it remains to be discovered in Mr. Hastings's government; for Mr. Hastings established offices, nay, whole systems of offices, and especially a system of offices in 1781, which being altogether new, none of the rules of gradation applied to them; and he filled those offices in such a manner as suited best, not the constitution nor the spirit of the service, but his own particular views and purposes. The consequence has been, that persons in the most immature stages of life have been appointed to conduct affairs which required the greatest maturity of judgment, the greatest possible temper and moderation. Effects naturally consequent have followed upon it.--I shall not trouble your Lordships with any further observations on this system of gradation.|$|E
