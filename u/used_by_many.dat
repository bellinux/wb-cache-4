5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E

5|$|Nutrients are transported {{throughout}} the coelom, including the mantle lobes, by cilia.

5|$|Aves and {{a sister}} group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most {{commonly}} defined phylogenetically as all descendants {{of the most recent}} common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.|$|E
