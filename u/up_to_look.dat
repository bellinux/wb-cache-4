5|$|In 2001, Canadian sketch comedy troupe Royal Canadian Air Farce {{featured}} Riel in its send-up of the CBC {{documentary series}} Canada: A People's History. Significant parallels were drawn between Riel's actions {{and those of}} modern-day Québécois separatists, and the comedian who portrayed Riel was made <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like then-Premier Lucien Bouchard.|$|E

The restaurant has an associated laboratory where Blumenthal and his team develop new dish concepts.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935. As a {{freshman}}, {{he sat in}} the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E

5|$|When {{the time}} came to begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond and all of the associated commitment (time spent filming and publicising each movie), together with finding it difficult to do other work, which would potentially lead to typecasting. Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a replacement.|$|E
5|$|On the {{accession}} of Queen Victoria, {{he took up}} {{roles in}} the Royal Household, becoming a groom-in-waiting on 27 July 1837, and {{taking part in the}} coronation procession the following year. He still retained his army commission, and progressed steadily in rank through his retirement, becoming a major-general on 23 November 1841, lieutenant-general on 11 November 1851, and full general on 14 August 1859; on 1 September 1848, he took the colonelcy of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. In 1855, he accompanied the young Prince Alfred to Geneva to supervise his studies there. In 1858 he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into the functioning of the militia. He resigned his role as groom in waiting on 18 November 1859, because of ill-health; he was appointed an extra groom in waiting on 28 March 1860, and promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 18 May 1860.|$|E
5|$|Schuster also {{assisted}} Birkenhead in {{his attempts}} to reform {{the administration of the}} court system, particularly in his preparation of the Supreme Court (Consolidation) Act 1925. A committee was also set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into the reform of the Supreme Court, the County Courts and the Probate Services, divided into a subcommittee for each institution. Schuster served {{as a member of the}} committee, with his primary goal being to end the patronage and nepotism that filled the judicial system. Although the Supreme Court was resistant the committee did succeed in making some changes, such as introducing mandatory retirement ages for masters and clerks; they were unable, however, to end the patronage. Schuster also attempted to reform the County Courts by increasing their jurisdiction, and a Committee on County Court Procedure (known as the Swift Committee after its chairman Rigby Swift) was set up in 1920, with Schuster serving as a member. The commission concluded that HM Treasury had mismanaged the County Courts, and on 1 August 1922 the Lord Chancellor's Office instead became responsible for the courts, with Schuster becoming Accounting Officer. The committee's final report was used as the basis for the County Courts Act 1924, which did much to correct the problems with the County Courts. Schuster was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1920 New Year War Honours.|$|E

5|$|The plot {{begins on}} September 28, 1998, {{two months after}} the events of the first Resident Evil, in the Midwestern American {{mountain}} community of Raccoon City. Nearly all of its citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and Claire {{make their way to the}} Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population. There, they discover that most of the policemen have been killed already, and that Chris has left town to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two protagonists split <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for other survivors and flee the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.|$|E

25|$|Count Dracula (1970), {{directed}} by Jesus Franco starring Christopher Lee as Dracula. In {{spite of its}} star, Franco's film is {{not a part of}} the Hammer series, and was shot on a small budget. Lee is made <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like the description of the Count from Stoker's novel, and he does seem to grow younger as the story progresses, but the film otherwise takes some huge liberties with the plot. The international cast includes Herbert Lom as Van Helsing and Klaus Kinski as Renfield.|$|E
25|$|The {{merger with}} JNU was {{opposed by the}} staff and {{scholars}} of the School since it was seen to imposed on the school by the government. However, there was nothing much {{that could be done}} since the government held the financial purse strings and began to squeeze the school financially to persuade it to fall in line.Even prior to this action, the School had been {{in the middle of a}} controversy in Parliament with a parliamentary committee set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into various allegations, in response to an intensive campaign run by various vested interests.|$|E

25|$|Houser {{is said to}} {{have entered}} Louisiana around July 2 or 3 and spent his time {{exploring}} the state along Interstate 10, apparently searching for a location to attack. During the week of July 13, Houser visited a food bank in Lake Charles twice and requested aid from them. He had been at the Grand 16 theater at least once before, and had also visited several other movie theaters in the state. According to witnesses at one theater, Houser was dressed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a woman and was behaving erratically. Houser also appeared to have made some getaway plans.|$|E
25|$|In June 1982, a Cabinet {{committee}} {{had been set}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at local government finance, on which Brittan sat. At this committee the idea of central government taking powers to limit rates was first developed; however it proved very unpopular with most Ministers on the committee: Michael Heseltine and his deputy Tom King {{thought it would be}} too complicated and possibly unconstitutional, and the Attorney General Sir Michael Havers had to give advice. When the committee reported to Cabinet on 17 January 1983 against rate limitation, Margaret Thatcher rejected its report and instructed Tom King (who had since been promoted to Environment Secretary) {{to come up with a}} foolproof system.|$|E
25|$|Almost immediately, a {{committee}} was set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at options for converting {{all or part}} of the canals into railways, and extending the network. Although they had already tried using a steam tug to haul a train of boats, they realised that not all of their canals were suitable for such use, and that a locomotive on a railway with good gradients offered a better solution. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal were alarmed by the announcement that many of the canals might close, on the basis that removal of one would have a serious effect on another, and sought to oppose the action.|$|E

25|$|Only a {{fortnight}} later, the band, at first subdued, {{broke out in}} a 'wild strain of brazen minstrelsy' during the final bars of the funeral march in the Eroica Symphony. After the movement was applauded {{a member of the}} audience began calling out that a complaint should be lodged, and won general approval, hear, hear, and people standing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him. On one occasion Lady Henschel and her daughter went to hear Joseph Joachim play at a Saturday 'Pop', but were so aware of the 'rhythmic gay sounds, thumping and shimmering away in a most enlivening manner', that they decided to go and hear Moore and Burgess instead.|$|E
25|$|In March 1965, Tony Benn, {{the acting}} Postmaster General, wrote to Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister, proposing that studies be {{undertaken}} aimed at converting the Post Office into a nationalised industry. A committee was set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of the proposal, and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the Government to re-establish a Steering Group on the Organisation of the Post Office. After some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions; Post, Telecommunications, Savings, Giro and National Data Processing Services, it was decided that there should be two: Post and Telecommunications. These events finally resulted in the introduction of the Post Office Act, 1969.|$|E
25|$|Richie {{is able to}} {{secretly}} abstract JR's bone marrow, while setting JR <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{as though}} he was out all night with a hooker the day he went missing. A drugged-up JR, unaware that his bone marrow has been stolen, insists to his family and Babe that he was drugged and he knows Richie did this to him. Initially Krystal is the only one to believe JR, but Babe later finds out that JR is telling the truth about Richie and apologizes to him. She sees Richie pay the hooker that was with JR the night Richie stole his bone marrow. Babe punches out the hooker. She goes on a mission to find out what other stuff Richie has done to JR or anyone else. During this mission, JR saves Babe from being raped by some guys when she goes undercover as a prostitute to clear JR's name and find out what crimes Richie did. Trina decides to tell the truth about Richie and her part in framing JR when Richie stole his bone marrow. JR promises Trina some money to get out of prostituting and go somewhere Richie is not due to fear that Richie will kill her since she told JR what Richie did. With Richie finally gone, JR and Babe come happily together again.|$|E
