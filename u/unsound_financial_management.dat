Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} was to carry out a Financial diagnosis of the SMEs financial performance by focusing on their liquidity, solvency and profitability positions using ratio analysis. Data for the study covered the period 2009 - 2011 and was obtained from the financial statements of three SMEs which were purposively sampled from the SMEs operating in Kisii Municipality. The sampled SMEs were those which had financial statements for the years under consideration. Data collected through the analysis of key ratios were analyzed using the mean, standard deviation, coeffifient of variation, Student-t test and through the use of the Altman’s Z-score model. The findings of the study showed that the liquidity position of the SMEs was on average low; their solvency was low and their financial Health was on average not good. Further,the results show that there is a significant impact of current ratio, quick ratio and Debt to Total Assets ratio on Return on Assets (ROA). The results of the study demonstrate that the liquidity position of the SMEs was well below the acceptable global norm of 2 for current ratio and 1 for quick ratio. Further, the results indicated that the financial health of the SMEs needed t...|$|E

A principal conclusion is that reform in public <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> needs to be defined against the capacity of countries to sustain it at the national level. This requires a careful definition of priorities for action and the determination of appropriate pacing and sequencing of reform.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the extent to which small to medium-sized building contractors beneficially utilise the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> function in their enterprises to improve and ensure business sustainability. <b>Financial</b> <b>management</b> focuses on the principles of decision-making, which requires action, without perfect knowledge of the outcome. To effectively execute the financial function, using the primary inputs in decision-making, <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> requires the ability to: understand and interpret financial statements and reports; make reasoned and objective decisions in controlling the operations of the enterprise; have a thorough knowledge of the internal functioning of the enterprise; and have a thorough knowledge of current and expected future economic conditions in the external environment. To do this, requires an effectively applied <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> function in the enterprises, which includes the utilisation of the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> criteria to ensure business sustainability. However, without an appreciation of what <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> is, how important <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> is, and how <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> must be applied in the enterprise, small to medium-sized building contractors will find it difficult to effectively perform the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> function and its different activities.
