5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. <b>Underground</b> <b>mining</b> of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{was done}} in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several smaller companies. The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> in the watershed stopped. Strip mining was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all mining stopped. During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E

25|$|The {{deposits}} of coal in Sulukta mainly consist of lignite or brown coal. From a petrogprahic point of view, the coal of Sulukta contains fusain and clarain. Historically, Sulukta's coal was extracted using both surface and <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> methods. Currently, it is extracted using only the <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> method, {{as there is}} no longer any surface mining equipment in the town. Private mines have replaced almost all of the large-scale, state-owned mines of the Soviet period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wireless {{networks}} {{can greatly}} facilitate the communication in <b>underground</b> <b>mines</b> and road/subway tunnels, where the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) waves are significantly different from those in terrestrial environments. According {{to the structure of}} <b>underground</b> <b>mines</b> and road tunnels, two types of channel models can be utilized, namely, tunnel and room/pillar channel models. However, there exists no theoretical model for room-and-pillar channel in <b>underground</b> <b>mines</b> to date, and current existing tunnel channel models do not provide an analytical solution for both near and far regions of the sources. In this paper, the multimode model is proposed, which provides an analytical expression for the received power and the power delay profile at any position in a tunnel. Moreover, the multimode model is extended to characterize the room-andpillar channel in the <b>underground</b> <b>mines</b> after combining it with the shadow fading model. The theoretical models are validated by experimental measurements. Based on the proposed channel models, the effects of various factors on the signal propagation are analyzed. The factors include: the operating frequency, the size of the tunnel or <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> room, the antenna position and polarization, and the electrical parameters.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Underground</b> <b>mine</b> mapping using GPS {{technology}} {{is not an}} easy task because satellite signals do not penetrate through earth strata down to the <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> works. In most cases, the use of GPS data collection for <b>underground</b> <b>mines</b> is limited to capturing the point locations such as mine entry, shaft locations and approximate mine location and then using traditional <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> surveying techniques to capture spatial data. In order to capture accurate spatial information for <b>underground</b> <b>mines,</b> we need to explore new ways of collecting spatial information where satellite GPS {{technology is}} not applicable. The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a method which relies on storing and remotely retrieving data via transmitting radiowaves using devices called RFID tags or transponders. In our daily lives, we see this technology being used by mail/package delivery system, medical devices reading vital information off of implanted medical chips in humans and animals, and cashiers at retail stores checking items for purchase. This technique has been successfully used in facilities management such as airports. The use of RFID and other wireles...|$|R

This paper presents the Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis of Direct Sequence Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) Ultra Wide Band (UWB) system for <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> environment. Discrete time channel impulse response is used to build up revised channel model for <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> which is based on the UWB channel model proposed by IEEE 802. 15. 3 a. With the revised channel model, we compare the performance of IEEE channel and mine channel by considering Mean Excess Delay, Root Mean Square (RMS) delay and Number of significant Paths with in 10 dB of peak (NP 10 dB) and observe the significant increase in the parameter. We evaluated the BER performance using RAKE receiver employing maximal ratio combining (MRC) for different data rate, repeat bit and number of RAKE figure in <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> channel. Simulation results shows that DS-PAM-UWB system can sustain in the dense multipath environment of <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> and provide acceptable BER...|$|R

40|$|<b>Underground</b> <b>mines</b> are {{a special}} type of {{environment}} which requires significant attention since they directly relate to miners‟ productivity, health and safety. With coal or ore exploitation into deep <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> environments, high {{temperature and humidity}} creates risks because of large amounts of heat generated from geothermal heat, mining machines, groundwater and mine water. There have been many assessment methods for <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> environment, such as dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature.

In order to evaluate the human body‟s thermal status in terms of both personal and environmental viewpoints, this investigation firstly discusses the new upper limits of dry-bulb temperature with the support of some simulated results of indicators from ISO 7933, and then adopts both mean skin temperature and dry-bulb temperature to establish a zone diagram. The calculation of mean skin temperature is based on the heat balance of the human body with the ambient environment. Then existent regulations on <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> environments and some typical condition parameters in <b>underground</b> <b>mines</b> are applied to circumscribe different thermal zones.
