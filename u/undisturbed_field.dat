In spite of the strong representations of the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum, written in 871 to influence the pope, though not avowing this purpose, Rome declared emphatically for Methodius, and sent a bishop, Paul of Ancons, to reinstate him and punish his enemies, after which both parties were commanded to appear in Rome with the legate.The papal will prevailed, and Methodius secured his freedom and his archiepiscopal authority over both Great Moravia and Pannonia, though the use of Slavonic for the mass was still denied to him.

The micro-relief of <b>undisturbed</b> <b>field</b> plots was characterized at z-scale 1 mm through close-range stereo-photogrammetry and geo-statistical tools. The overland flow areas produced by controlled water inflows were video-recorded and the flow velocities were measured with image processing software.

Here, we use {{a survey of the}} vegetation in 16, 000 sampled plots, over 10 years, in 25 abandoned agricultural <b>fields</b> and adjacent <b>undisturbed</b> <b>fields,</b> to test whether exotic invasive species have become less abundant with time since abandonment, whether or not natives re-invade exotic-dominated fields, and if exotics expand their ranges into undisturbed areas.

A previous review of a subset of this data suggested that natives are not re-invading and exotics are not invading undisturbed communities. Using these 10 years of direct observation, we find that natives are re-invading ex-arable fields.

40|$|The {{air dose}} rate in an {{environment}} contaminated with 134 Cs and 137 Cs depends on the amount, depth profile and horizontal distribution of these contaminants within the ground. This paper introduces and verifies a tool that models these variables and calculates ambient dose equivalent rates at 1 m above the ground. Good correlation is found between predicted dose rates and dose rates measured with survey meters in Fukushima Prefecture in areas contaminated with radiocesium from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. This finding is insensitive to the choice for modelling the activity depth distribution in the ground using activity measurements of collected soil layers, or by using exponential and hyperbolic secant fits to the measurement data. Better predictions are obtained by modelling the horizontal distribution of radioactive cesium across an area if multiple soil samples are available, as opposed to assuming a spatially homogeneous contamination distribution. Reductions seen in air dose rates above flat, <b>undisturbed</b> <b>fields</b> in Fukushima Prefecture are consistent with decrement by radioactive decay and downward migration of cesium into soil. Analysis of remediation strategies for farmland soils confirmed that topsoil removal and interchanging a topsoil layer with a subsoil layer result in similar reductions in the air dose rate.

This Study aimed to identify the influence of rock fragment contents, orientation, and position within a small and watershed on hydraulic conductivity in northern Chile. Two different measurement techniques were used, a single-ring infiltrometer with constant ponding head and a tension infiltrometer, which were applied at both an <b>undisturbed</b> <b>field</b> site (44 locations along three transects) and on the disturbed < 2 -mm soil fraction from the same locations. Variations in saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were observed when using different calculation methods, adding to the observed variability For saturated conditions, only small differences in conductivities were observed between two calculation methods, whereas unsaturated hydraulic conductivities calculated by five different methods showed more important variations. Stone fragment content correlated significantly with both saturated and unsaturated conductivities, probably due to a positive correlation between stone content and coarse lacunar pore space. Slope orientations with higher amounts of stone fragments gave higher infiltration rates, as well as transects with steeper slopes and more, but smaller, rock fragments. When evaluating differences in infiltration rates observed along three transects in the watershed, variability could be mainly attributed to stone fragment content influences...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{failure of}} a sloping ground due to static {{liquefaction}} occurs when the shear stress applied by a monotonic triggering load exceeds the undrained yield (peak) shear strength of the saturated liquefiable cohesionless soil. Current practices for determining the in-situ undrained yield strength for grounds subjected to static shear stress rely on either a suite of costly laboratory tests on <b>undisturbed</b> <b>field</b> samples or empirical correlations based on in-situ penetration tests, which fail {{to account for the}} effect of soil dilatancy in decreasing the degree of strain-softening and the brittleness of cohesionless soils with an increasing penetration resistance. In this study, the effect of soil dilatancy on the static liquefaction failure of cohesionless soils is characterized by an empirical relationship between the soil brittleness index and the undrained yield strength from a database of 813 laboratory shear tests collected from the past literature. The application of this relationship for estimating the static liquefaction-triggering strength of cohesionless soils under sloping ground conditions is validated by comparing several cases of liquefaction flow failures. Finally, a procedure is briefly demonstrated for evaluating the triggering of static liquefaction in a dyke to the north of Wachusett Dam and Duncan Dam which incorporates the dilatancy behavior of cohesionless soils in a semi-empirical procedure based on in-situ penetration tests...|$|E

Several images are multiplexed on a single frame of film using a stationary, focused object beam and an angularly swept reference beam.

Concentrations of various elements in the leachate from the column were measured during the experiment. Also, the remnants within the soil were measured {{at the end of}} the experiment. The geochemical modelling package, PHREEQC- 2, was used to simulate the experimental data. Processes included in the CCA transport modelling were advection, dispersion, non-specific adsorption (cation exchange) and specific adsorption by clay minerals and organic matter, as well as other possible chemical reactions such as precipitation/dissolution. The modelling effort highlighted the possible complexities in CCA transport and reaction experiments. For example, the uneven dosing of CCA as well as incomplete knowledge of the soil properties resulted in simulations that gave only partial, although reasonable, agreement with the experimental data. Both the experimental data and simulations show that As and Cu are strongly adsorbed and therefore, will mostly remain at the top of the soil profile, with a small proportion appearing in leachate. On the other hand, Cr is more mobile and thus it is present in the soil column leachate. Further simulations show that both the quantity of CCA added to the soil and the pH of the irrigation water will influence CCA transport. Simulations suggest that application of larger doses of CCA to the soil will result in higher leachate concentrations, especially for Cu and As. Irrigation water with a lower pH will dramatically increase leaching of Cu. These results indicate that acidic rainfall or significant accidental spillage of CCA will increase the risk of groundwater pollution. <br /...|$|E
40|$|A Hybrid {{model for}} {{prediction}} of field scintillation on transionospheric paths of propagation was developed as {{the combination of}} the complex phase method (CPM) and random screen technique. In a recent paper [1] by Gherm et al., the model was described in detail. The initially developed propagation model [2] was solely based on the CPM, or the generalized Rytov’s approximation, which is not capable of describing the case of strong scintillation so that, to overcome this restriction, the CPM was combined with the random screen technique. In the contrast with widely employed effective phase screen (e. g. WBMOD, GISM), the random screen introduced in the present method is a physical screen with log-amplitude and phase fluctuations corresponding to a real field on a plane located below the ionosphere. To generate this random screen the relationships for spatial spectra of the phase and log-amplitude correlation functions, as well as their cross-correlation function, are utilized. They are derived in the framework of the CPM.

We then present the results of the motion of red blood cells behind a moving interface in a capillary, which show that the RBCs with higher velocity than the interface speed form a concentrated slug behind the interface.

40|$|The Manix Basin Area of the Mojave Desert {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for the cultivation of alfalfa with center-pivot sprinkler irrigation systems. Since 1972, a series of these fields has been abandoned. Data were collected using the Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer instruments {{in the summer of}} 1990. Polarimetric analysis of the AIRSAR data reveal changes in the morphology of the surfaces of the abandoned fields from cultivation patterns to patterns resulting from wind erosion. Calculation of a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the AVIRIS data suggests that the abandoned fields support more vegetation than the undisturbed areas for {{the first few years of}} abandonment, but that the vegetation density on fields which have been abandoned for six or more years is lower than the <b>undisturbed</b> desert. <b>Field</b> observations confirm the remote sensing results...|$|R
40|$|The {{solar wind}} carves in the {{interstellar}} plasma a cavity bounded by a surface, called the heliopause (HP), {{that separates the}} plasma and magnetic field of solar origin from the interstellar ones. It is now generally accepted that in August 2012 Voyager 1 (V 1) crossed that boundary. Unexpectedly, the magnetic fields on both its sides, although theoretically independent of each other, {{were found to be}} similar in direction. This delayed the identification of the boundary as the heliopause and led to many alternative explanations. Here we show that the Voyager 1 observations can be readily explained and, after the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) discovery of the ribbon, could even have been predicted. Our explanation relies {{on the fact that the}} Voyager 1 and the <b>undisturbed</b> interstellar <b>field</b> directions (which we assume to be given by the IBEX ribbon center (RC)) share the same heliolatitude (~ 34. 5 degrees) and are not far separated in longitude (difference ~ 27 degrees). Our result confirms that Voyager 1 has indeed crossed the heliopause and offers the first independent confirmation that the IBEX ribbon center is in fact the direction of the <b>undisturbed</b> interstellar magnetic <b>field.</b> For Voyager 2 we predict that the difference between the inner and the outer magnetic field directions at the heliopause will be significantly larger than the one observed by Voyager 1 (~ 30 degrees, instead of ~ 20 degrees), and that the outer field direction will be close to the RC.
