5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} whether patient-centered {{instructions for}} chronic heart failure medications increase comprehension and memory for medication information in older adults diagnosed with chronic heart failure. Design and Methods: Patient-centered instructions for familiar and unfamiliar medications {{were compared with}} instructions for the same medications from a chain pharmacy (standard pharmacy instructions). Thirty-two adults (age, M 63. 8) read and answered questions about each instruction, recalled medication information (free recall), and then answered questions from memory (cued recall). Results: Patient-centered instructions were better recalled and <b>understood</b> <b>more</b> quickly than the standard instructions. Instructions for the familiar medications also were better recalled. Patient-centered instructions were <b>understood</b> <b>more</b> accurately for the unfamiliar medications, but stan-dard instructions were <b>understood</b> <b>more</b> accurately for the familiar medications. However, the recall measures showed that {{the advantage of the}} standard format for familiar medications was short lived. Im-plications: The findings suggest that the patient-centered format may improve printed medication instructions available in many pharmacies, which should help older adults to better understand how to take their medications...|$|R

If identical twins are considerably more similar than fraternal twins (which is found for most traits), this implicates that genes {{play an important role}} in these traits. By comparing many hundreds of families with twins, researchers can then <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> about the roles of genetic effects, shared environment, and unique environment in shaping behavior.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 {{revision}} of the phase descriptions, the WHO has retained {{the use of a}} six-phase approach for easy incorporation of new recommendations and approaches into existing national preparedness and response plans. The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them easier to <b>understand,</b> <b>more</b> precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1–3 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4–6 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.|$|E
25|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} {{have increased}} difficulty forming friendships. They experience a language delay {{causing them to}} have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because they <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to all the training usually given to Chemical Technologists in their respective degree (or one given via an associate degree), a Chemist is also trained to <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> details related to chemical phenomena so that the chemist can be capable of more planning on the steps to achieve a distinct goal via a chemistry-related endeavor. The higher the competency level achieved {{in the field of}} Chemistry (as assessed via a combination of education, experience and personal achievements), the higher the responsibility given to that chemist and the more complicated the task might be. Chemistry, as a field, have so many applications that different tasks/objectives can be given to workers/scientists with these different levels of education and/or experience. The specific title of each job varies from position to position, depending on factors such as the kind of industry, the routine level of the task, the current needs of a particular enterprise, the size of the enterprise or hiring firm, the philosophy and management principles of the hiring firm, the visibility of the competency and individual achievements of the one seeking employment, economic factors such as recession or economic depression, among other factors, so this makes it difficult to categorize the exact roles of these chemistry-related workers as standard for that given level of education. Because of these factors affecting exact job titles with distinct responsibilities, some chemists might begin doing technician tasks while other chemists might begin doing more complicated tasks than those of a technician, such as tasks that also involve formal applied research, management, or supervision included within the responsibilities of that same job title. The level of supervision given to that chemist also varies in a similar manner, with factors similar to those that affect the tasks demanded for a particular chemist.|$|E

Reviewer Brian Byun expressed that the choice to explore the friendship between Clark and Lex, before they become sworn enemies, which was something {{that had been used}} in the past but never to the depth of what Smallville is doing, helped keep the show from becoming [...] "Dawson's Creek with superpowers".|$|E

A special [...] "Counsel for the Estate" [...] was created when Edward was fourteen. Edward chose the members himself. In the weekly meetings with this Council, Edward was [...] "to hear the debating of things of most importance". A major point of contact with the king was the Privy Chamber, and there Edward worked closely with William Cecil and William Petre, the Principal Secretaries. The king's greatest influence was in matters of religion, where the Council followed the strongly Protestant policy that Edward favoured.|$|E
500|$|Gaara's backstory {{became one}} of Kishimoto's {{favorite}} stories from Part I; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters as he wanted readers to <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> of Gaara's mental state. The character was originally {{going to be called}} Kotarou Fuuma, but Kishimoto's editor highly refused to give him that name. As a result, he was given the name Gaara why he felt more suitable to the fact he always uses sand. By 2013, Kishimoto stated he still did not understand why such name was discarded. Nevertheless, he refrained from giving him of giving him a complete name like Gaara Yuzawa. Another early name was a younger child named [...] "Kumomaru" [...] but was avoided by Kishimoto. However, after multiple changes, he became Gaara. Due to his importance in the manga as a result of being Naruto's foil, Kishimoto added the kanji for [...] "love" [...] in his head to complement his name (part of Gaara's name can be read as [...] "love").|$|E
