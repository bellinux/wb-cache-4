A union monitors establishments in an industry to learn about their productivity and decides which ones to organize and when. An establishment becomes unionized if the <b>union</b> <b>targets</b> it for organizing and wins the union certification election. The model predicts two main selection effects: unions secure elections in larger and more productive establishments early in their life-cycles, and among the establishments that experience an election, unions {{are more likely to}} win in smaller and less productive ones. These predictions find support in union certification election data for 1977 - 2007 matched with data on establishment characteristics.

In this paper we apply different metrics proposed under the TARGET NoE in order to compare two models, the nonlinear discrete convolution (NDC) model, based on a table-based black-box approach, and the EEHEMT 1 model, based on the classic equivalent circuit approach. The goal is to provide a set of practical criteria for carrying on reliable model comparisons...|$|E
40|$|From the {{classical}} gold standard {{up to the}} current ERM 2 arrangement of the European <b>Union,</b> <b>target</b> zones have been a widely used exchange regime in contemporary history.

It is shown that the monetary authority may gain efficiency by reducing volatility of both the exchange rate and the interest rate at the same time. Furthermore, the model is consistent with some known stylised facts in the empirical literature that previous models were not able to produce, namely, the positive relation between the exchange rate and the interest rate differential, the degree of non-linearity of the function linking the exchange rate to fundamentals and the shape of the exchange rate stochastic distribution.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been argued that intra-eurosystem claims and liabilities {{in the form of}} TARGET 2 balances would raise fundamental issues within the European monetary union. This article provides a framework for the economic analysis of TARGET 2 balances and discusses the key arguments behind this recent debate. The analysis is conducted within a system of financial accounts in which TARGET 2 balances can arise either due to current account transactions or cross-border capital flows. It is argued that the recent volatility of TARGET 2 balances reflects capital flow movements, while the previously prevailing current account positions did not find a strong reflection in TARGET 2 balances. Some recent statements regarding TARGET 2 appear to be due to a failure to distinguish between the monetary base (a central bank liability concept) and the liquidity deficit of the banking system vis-à-vis the central bank (a central bank asset concept). Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of TARGET 2 for the stability of the euro area and points out that the proposal to limit the size of TARGET 2 liabilities essentially contradicts the idea of a monetary <b>union.</b> <b>TARGET</b> 2, central bank balance sheet, liquidity deficit, financial crisis...|$|E

40|$|The Netherlands {{have tried}} very hard to {{increase}} their renewable energy sources (RES) shares to fulfill the European <b>Union</b> <b>target</b> in 2050. However, RES performance did not show the expected result as the performance declined in 2009 producing even wider gap compare to the target. The Dutch government’s tried to incorporate all interested stakeholders by forming the Dutch energy transition task force. Nevertheless, the task force’s result is also not showing a desirable trend. Key reasons behind the Dutch low RES performance are the lack of shared understanding and positive attitude toward RES development among interested actors. This research uses a role-playing game to increase shared understanding and positive attitude within the actors. The game set players in a competing role as the government, an energy company and the end user. Players were given the ability to make decisions on their respective area. A pilot study was then conducted to measure the effectiveness of the game. The pilot study showed the game increased actor’s individual understanding and shared understanding. Moreover, it also showed that the game increases actor’s positive attitude toward RES development in the Netherlands...|$|E

A rationale is presented to relate this requirement to the European <b>Union</b> <b>target</b> to be the world's leading knowledge economy by 2020 and a quartile descriptive partitioning of the workforce in terms of IT skills and knowledge, and their use, is presented. Consideration {{is given to the}} need to provide articulated and universally accepted skills and qualification frameworks that offer seamless progression through all levels from novice to professional. The key organisations working in this sector, most of which have been established in the last 2 - 4 years, are also described.

Fundamental to this argument is the requirement to develop the existing workforce, the majority of whom have already completed formal education, and to provide the tools, frameworks and protocols to achieve this. Finally, the value of successfully undertaking such a development is quantified in economic terms, and a set of actions, some already underway, to achieve the professionalisation of the IT industry are described...|$|E
40|$|Monetary policy {{operates}} {{through the}} money market. This is the market where banks trade overnight deposits {{at the central}} bank. In this paper, we call such a market the market for daily funds. Up {{to the end of}} 1998, the geographical region, which now corresponds to the euro area, was characterized by segmented money markets, reflecting different currencies, legal systems, operational frameworks, standard practices and much else. Hence, in the preparations for the start of operations of the single monetary policy, one of the priorities was to ensure smooth and integrated functioning of the interbank market for daily funds in the euro area. Proper functioning was clearly required for the effectiveness of the single monetary policy. In this context, it is important to refer to the payments infrastructure.
