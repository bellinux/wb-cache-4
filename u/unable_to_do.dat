5|$|MU5 was {{designed}} to be about 20 times faster than Atlas, and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand-written machine code, something that contemporary computers were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> efficiently. A major factor in the MU5's much-improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of associative memory, which greatly speeded up access to its main store.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{that the}} plains Indians {{would have no}} {{experience}} on water, the townspeople fled prudently from the Comanche raiders {{to the safety of}} the water.

While safe in the water, the refugees witnessed the destruction and looting of their town, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a thing except curse them.|$|E
5|$|The North Complex is a {{collection}} of several landforms, including craters, that were thought to have been formed by volcanic activity.

5|$|Allemand {{requested}} that Cotes come aboard Carmagnole, but Cotes responded {{that he was}} <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so as his ship's boats had all been destroyed. Allemand sent a boat from his own ship to Thames and brought Cotes to Carmagnole as a prisoner of war; Cotes used the delay to destroy his ship's documents.

5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders {{the ship to}} outrun the strange craft. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft.

According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{increased}} power in the leaders' offices, MPs {{are less likely to}} speak out against their leader or their political party, fearing that they will be demoted, kicked from caucus, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> fully <b>do</b> their jobs, or will not be considered for cabinet positions or promotions.|$|R

5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E

5|$|Titan was {{examined}} by both Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 1s trajectory {{was designed to}} provide an optimized Titan flyby, during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere, and obtain a precise measurement of Titan's mass. Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface, though in 2004 intensive digital processing of images taken through Voyager 1s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as Xanadu and Shangri-la, which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope. Voyager 2, {{which would have been}} diverted to perform the Titan flyby if Voyager 1 had been <b>unable</b> <b>to,</b> <b>did</b> not pass near Titan and continued on to Uranus and Neptune.|$|R
5|$|In mid-November 1942, Junyō was tasked {{to provide}} air {{cover for the}} convoy {{bringing}} reinforcements for the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal during the three-day-long Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The ship's fighters were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; seven transports were sunk and the remaining four transports were damaged. In December 1942 – January 1943, the carrier covered several convoys that brought reinforcements to Wewak, New Guinea and her air group was based there for several days to protect the forces there before returning to Truk on 20 January. The ship then covered the evacuation of forces from Guadalcanal through early February.|$|E

The album's cover features Estefan in a black-and-white photo at a Havana nightclub before the Cuban Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Plans to link it westwards to the Oakham Canal, northwards to the South Forty-Foot Drain and southwards to the River Nene in 1809 came to nothing, and {{it closed}} in 1863, {{soon after the}} arrival of the Midland Railway in the area. Although Stamford Corporation {{attempted}} to sell it after closure, its ownership was disputed, and they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Its course and some of its structures can still be traced in the landscape. These include warehouses at the terminus in Stamford, and a weir which regulated water levels on the River Gwash, which it crossed on the level.|$|E

Within reach of my hand lay the creature who had carried me, huddled and motionless; and to left and to right of me, and one a little nearer the base of the cliff, five of those sorrel horses that had been chief of our pursuers. One only of them was alive, and he, also, broken and <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> rise--unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> else than watch with fierce, untamed, glazing eyes (a bloody froth at his muzzle,) every movement and sign of life I made.|$|R
5|$|Racing veteran Jarno Trulli (Trulli GP) {{started in}} the first group, as {{qualifying}} began at 12:00, and posted a strong time of 1:21.547 early in the session, being the first to lap the course in under 1:22. Also in the group was Nelson Piquet, Jr.– second in the championship– who ultimately managed only 13th place on the grid. As qualifying progressed, championship leader Lucas di Grassi and Monaco winner Sébastien Buemi came close to beating Trulli's time, but proved <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, handing Trulli a surprising pole position, his first in Formula E.|$|E
