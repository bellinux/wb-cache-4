60|$|One of the {{attending}} harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable {{hole in the}} lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging, slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long <b>upper</b> <b>strip,</b> called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.|$|E

The cutting algorithm continues to run until the control flow reaches the waste items. In a situation where there are no strips and the stack is empty, a new raw stock will be used. The above algorithm has been implemented using the C++ language.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} experiences {{presented here}} have been realised since 1994 owing to the ‘Conseil Général’ of the North district on the upper beaches of the Flemish dunes owned by the ‘Conservatoire du Littoral’ situated on the Bray-Dunes and Zuydcoote municipalities (France). This experience aims at {{the restoration of the}} habitats on the sea frontline of the border dune. The matter is the space that starts from the annual halo-nitrophilic strip on the upper beach, goes on with the embryo dune and finishes with the quick white dune dominated by the European beachgrass (marram). The requirements of beach cleanness, especially regarding seaside tourism, have led to the destruction of these patrimonial important habitats by the regular and complete mechanical raking of the strand. The first step consisted in limiting this mechanical raking to the rights of sea-side resorts. At the same time, the <b>upper</b> <b>strip</b> of the beach along dunes is managed softly by a selective manual picking up of the biggest trashes. This change of cleaning process rapidly produced the emergence of noticeable habitats that didn’t exist before. It concerns water marks mingled with sand and embryonic dunes with sand couch grass. To a reduced extent, these methods of management lead to a reinforcement of the white dune with marram and sand ryegrass and the white dune which is warmer with marram and sea spurge. Some of these habitats are listed as part of the Guideline ‘Habitat’ and are listed as vulnerable or endangered after the red book of the littoral terrestrial phytocoenoses according to the definitions proposed by the International Union for Nature Preservation. Moreover, the obstacles kept on the <b>upper</b> <b>strip</b> of the beach afford the start of a process of sand accumulation and build the embryonic dune. According to the sedimentary context, this type of operation assists the fertilisation of the upper beach and reduces the retreat phenomenon of the coastline. The cost of operations is much reduced, money is even saved with the reduction of the number of interventions. It was only difficult to convince our partners about modifying their cleaning habits. This successful experience over a 1. 5 km distance of beach, facing preserved dune massifs, shows the large potentialities of spontaneous restoration of these natural environments. The extreme simplicity of this method and its very small cost, except employment, allow us to envisage and adapt it all along the European coastline...|$|E

40|$|This {{abstract}} {{is concerned}} with the probability that a mission to a site within the South Pole-Aitken basin (SPA) would yield a meaningful sample of typical SPA floor material. The probability seems favorable, barring a highly atypical landing site, because the chemical composition of the SPA interior, as determined remotely from orbit, is {{different from that of the}} surrounding lunar surface. How representative would the sample be? To what extent have lateral transport or later events compromised the original chemical and mineralogical composition of the floor material? Where or in what kind of deposit should the mission land to provide the best example? We address these questions from the point of view of modeling of impact ejecta deposits. SPA is the largest lunar impact basin. Shallow for its diameter, it has a subdued gravity signature, a lower albedo, and a more Th- and Ferich interior than the surrounding highlands (the Feldspathic Highlands Terrane, FHT). Its floor may represent noritic or perhaps (but less abundant) gabbroic lower crust of the FHT, the <b>upper</b> crust <b>stripped</b> away by the basin-forming impact, possibly an oblique one...|$|R

The tissues were mounted under the tension 0. 5 g in an organ bath containing Ringer solution, maintained at 25 degrees C and gassed with 100 % O 2. The responses were recorded on a kymograph via an isotonic lever. Antimegaloblastic agents, including hydroxocobalamin (1, 10, and 100 microM), cyanocobalamin (1, 10, 25, and 100 microM), and folic acid (1, 10, 50, 100, and 200 microM), significantly attenuated the relaxation response to UV light. Folinic acid (1, 10, 25, and 100 microM), however, enhanced the relaxation. Pyrogallol (50 microM), hydroquinone (50 microM), and diethyldithiocarbamic acid (8 mM) were found ineffective for attenuation, though FeSO 4 (200, 400, and 500 microM) and hemoglobin (50 microM), respectively, exerted significant inhibition. L-arginine methylester (500 microM) did not impair UV-induced relaxation.

A sandwich structure of two identical metal sheets of thickness {{on the order of}} 25 µm, bonded together by a dissimilar third layer of thickness 10 µm was examined. The primary disbond was expected to be in the region of the interface between the top two metal layers. Frequency domain analysis using a Wiener-filtered FFT was used to extract a signature related to the properties of the <b>upper</b> metal <b>strip</b> as an acoustic resonator, which is strongly dependent on the boundary conditions on its back surface. The frequency range of 200 to 300 MHz was determined to be the appropriate range at which to perform the inspections. The sandwich structure was modelled for varying degrees of bondedness, and frequency domain measurements were made on a number of samples using a 300 MHz acoustic transducer and electronic setup. Experimental results have indicated strong correlation between the depth and width of nulls in the Wiener-filtered spectrum and the state of bondedness.

The waveguide Ω^ε is a union of a thin straight strip of the width ε and a family of small protuberances with the so-called "room-and-passage" geometry. The protuberances are attached periodically, with a period ε, along the <b>strip</b> <b>upper</b> boundary. For ε→ 0 we prove a (kind of) resolvent convergence of -Δ_Ω^ε to a certain ordinary differential operator. Also we demonstrate Hausdorff convergence of the spectrum. In particular, we conclude that if the sizes of "passages" are appropriately scaled the first spectral gap of -Δ_Ω^ε is determined exclusively by geometric properties of the protuberances. The proofs are carried out using methods of homogenization theory. Comment: 24 Pages, 1 Figur...|$|R

40|$|A {{multiband}} circular polarizer {{based on}} fission transmission of {{linearly polarized wave}} for x-band application is proposed, which is constructed of 2 × 2 metallic strips array. The linear-to-circular polarization conversion is obtained by decomposing the linearly incident x-polarized wave into two orthogonal vector components of equal amplitude and 90 ° phase difference between them. The innovative approach of “fission transmission of linear-to-circular polarized wave” is firstly introduced to obtain giant circular dichroism based on decomposition of orthogonal vector components through the structure. It means that the incident linearly polarized wave is converted into two orthogonal components through lower printed metallic strips layer and two transmitted waves impinge on the <b>upper</b> printed <b>strips</b> layer to convert into four orthogonal vector components {{at the end of}} structure. This projection and transmission sequence of orthogonal components sustain the chain transmission of electromagnetic wave and can achieve giant circular dichroism. Theoretical analysis and microwave experiments are presented to validate the performance of the structure. The measured results are in good agreement with simulation results. In addition, the proposed circular polarizer exhibits the optimal performance with respect to the normal incidence. The right handed circularly polarized wave is emitted ranging from 10. 08 [*]GHz to 10. 53 [*]GHz and 10. 78 [*]GHz to 11. 12 [*]GHz, while the left handed circular polarized wave is excited at 10. 54 [*]GHz– 10. 70 [*]GHz and 11. 13 [*]GHz– 11. 14 [*]GHz, respectively...|$|R
