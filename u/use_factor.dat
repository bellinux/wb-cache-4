LucasArts, pleased with earlier collaborations with the company, decided to <b>use</b> <b>Factor</b> 5's engine for its new game. The game's focus would be space combat; this direction {{was inspired by a}} level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth. Rogue Squadron and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated, [...] "That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said, 'Why don't you do a whole game like that?' So we did." [...] Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films. This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, LucasFilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films.|$|E

2500|$|According to Hans Eysenck: [...] "The main {{dimension}} in the MBTI is called E-I, or extraversion-introversion; this {{is mostly a}} sociability scale, correlating quite well with the MMPI social introversion scale (negatively) and the Eysenck Extraversion scale (positively). Unfortunately, the scale also has a loading on neuroticism, which correlates with the introverted end. Thus introversion correlates roughly (i.e. averaging values for males and females) -.44 with dominance, -.24 with aggression, +.37 with abasement, +.46 with counselling readiness, -.52 with self-confidence, -.36 with personal adjustment, and -.45 with empathy. The failure of the scale to disentangle Introversion and Neuroticism (there is no scale for neurotic and other psychopathological attributes in the MBTI) is its worst feature, only equalled by the failure to <b>use</b> <b>factor</b> analysis {{in order to test}} the arrangement of items in the scale." ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrological {{and land}} use changes can affect species in human altered landscapes. Typically the impacts of {{hydrological}} {{and land use}} changes are examined separately, with hydrological determinants used to explain the distribution of species in water dependent and aquatic habitats and land <b>use</b> <b>factors</b> <b>used</b> to examine terrestrial species. However, given the connectedness of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, stressors originating in one domain may be important in the other. To explore the importance of integrating both hydrological and land <b>use</b> <b>factors,</b> we tested the relative contribution of hydrological <b>factors</b> and land <b>use</b> context as determinants of the dominant riparian tree species, Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn. throughout wetlands of the Condamine catchment, southern Queensland, Australia. The occurrence of E. camaldulensis was modelled against hydrological and land <b>use</b> <b>factors</b> <b>using</b> generalized linear models (GLMs) and validated using internal bootstrapping procedures. Validated models which included both hydrological (distance from weir, wetland–river connectivity and groundwater depth) and land <b>use</b> <b>factors</b> (agricultural land cover and grazing intensity) performed better than those developed <b>using</b> only hydrological <b>factors.</b> The study results highlight the importance of an integrated perspective which considers both hydrological and land <b>use</b> <b>factors</b> {{in order to understand}} occurrence patterns of riparian and floodplain tree species in a range of settings. This approach could be especially important when assessing changes to hydrology and land use which may be triggered by climatic changes. ...|$|R
