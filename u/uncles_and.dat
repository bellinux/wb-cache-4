5|$|Each person {{belongs to}} both the mother's and the father's families, the only {{bilateral}} family line in Indonesia. Children, therefore, inherit household affiliation from both mother and father, including land and even family debts. Children's names are given {{on the basis of}} kinship, and are usually chosen after dead relatives. Names of aunts, <b>uncles</b> <b>and</b> cousins are commonly referred to in the names of mothers, fathers and siblings.|$|E

5|$|Olivia often {{visited her}} many Johnson {{relatives}} in the country, and became particularly fond of her cousin Lionel Johnson—the {{only one of many}} <b>uncles</b> <b>and</b> cousins not to join the military—who {{went on to become a}} poet and friend to W. B. Yeats. It is likely that Olivia received little formal education; she may have been educated by tutors, and appears to have become well-read as a young woman.|$|E

5|$|The Manoj–Babli {{honour killing}} {{case was the}} honour killing of Indian newlyweds Manoj Banwala and Babli in June 2007 and the {{successive}} court case which historically convicted defendants for an honour killing. The individuals involved in the murder included relatives of Babli (grandfather Gangaraj {{who is said to}} have been a Khap leader, brother, maternal and paternal <b>uncles</b> <b>and</b> two cousins). Relatives of Manoj, especially his mother, defended the relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} family consists of grandparents, aunts, <b>uncles,</b> <b>and</b> cousins. In some circumstances, the {{extended family}} comes to live either with or {{in place of a}} member of the nuclear family. An example includes elderly parents who move in with their children due to old age. This places large demands on the caregivers, particularly the female relatives who choose to perform these duties for their extended family.|$|E
5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal <b>uncles</b> <b>and</b> any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters {{of the father and}} any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal <b>uncles,</b> <b>and</b> following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of the father. After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of the father and then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father. It appears that if there were two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E

5|$|Despite the coup's {{failure and}} his death, Abdallah {{had been able}} to {{consolidate}} his control over Mosul, becoming the virtual founder of a Hamdanid-ruled emirate there. During his long absences in Baghdad in his final years, Abdallah relegated authority over Mosul to his eldest son, al-Hasan, the future Nasir al-Dawla. After Abdallah's death, Hasan's position in Mosul was challenged by his <b>uncles,</b> <b>and</b> it was not until 935 {{that he was able to}} secure confirmation by Baghdad of his control over Mosul and the entire Jazira up to the Byzantine frontier.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros and his {{brothers}} disappear from the sources until 792, when the return of Irene to power (after having been ousted in a military revolt in 790), coupled with the disastrous defeat of Constantine VI at Marcellae against the Bulgars, caused widespread discontent among the troops. Some of the imperial guard regiments, the tagmata, proclaimed Nikephoros as emperor, but Constantine reacted swiftly: he arrested his <b>uncles,</b> <b>and</b> while Nikephoros was blinded, the others had their tongues slit. They were then imprisoned at a monastery in Therapia.|$|E
5|$|Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols {{was raised}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his <b>uncles</b> <b>and</b> aunts. He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a {{softball}} pitcher, {{but he was also}} an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.|$|E

5|$|Historian Tracy Adams {{describes}} Isabeau as {{a talented}} diplomat who navigated court politics with ease, grace and charisma. Charles had been crowned in 1387, aged 20, attaining sole {{control of the}} monarchy. His first acts included the dismissal of his <b>uncles</b> <b>and</b> the reinstatement of the so-called Marmousets—a group of councilors to his father, Charles V—and he gave Orléans more responsibility. Some years later, after Charles' first attack of illness, tensions mounted between Orléans and the royal uncles—Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; John, Duke of Berry; and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. Forced to assume {{a greater role in}} maintaining peace amidst the growing power struggle, which was to persist for many years, Isabeau succeeded in her role as peacekeeper among the various court factions.|$|E
5|$|Foliot was {{probably}} the son of Robert Foliot—steward to David, Earl of Huntingdon, heir to the Scottish throne—and Robert's wife Agnes, sister of Robert de Chesney, Bishop of Lincoln. Whatever his parentage, Gilbert was certainly Robert de Chesney's nephew; another of his uncles, Reginald, was a monk of Gloucester Abbey and Abbot of Evesham Abbey. Other ecclesiastics in his family included Robert Foliot, a later Bishop of Hereford perhaps from an Oxford branch of the family, and two earlier Bishops of London, Richard de Beaumis the elder and Richard de Beaumis the younger, Gilbert also referred to Richard of Ilchester, later Bishop of Winchester, as a kinsman, but the exact relationship is unknown. William de Chesney, a partisan of Stephen's and a leading Oxfordshire layman, was another of Foliot's <b>uncles,</b> <b>and</b> Miles of Gloucester, Earl of Hereford, was a cousin. In about 1145 Foliot intervened to secure {{the release of a}} knight to whom he was related, Roger Foliot, but their precise relationship is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal <b>uncles</b> <b>and</b> two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E

25|$|The Marshallese {{society is}} matrilineal and land is {{passed down from}} {{generation}} to generation through the mother. Land ownership ties families together into clans. Grandparents, parents, grandchildren, aunts, <b>uncles,</b> <b>and</b> cousins form extended, close-knit family groups. Gatherings tend to become big events. One of the most significant family events is the first birthday of a child (kemem), which relatives and friends celebrate with feasts and song.|$|E

25|$|Since 2005, and, {{especially}} {{again in}} 2009, {{it was suggested}} by some Portuguese and British media that José Sócrates allegedly waived environmental restrictions, following intervention {{by one of his}} <b>uncles</b> <b>and</b> a cousin, to grant the British company Freeport a licence to build the Alcochete mall, a gigantic emporium near the Tagus river, developed in part on protected land outside Lisbon in 2002, when he was Minister for Environment of the PM António Guterres cabinet.|$|E
