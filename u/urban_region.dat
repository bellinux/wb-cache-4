40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the engineering of creative <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> through knowledge-based <b>urban</b> development. In recent years city administrators realised the importance of engineering and orchestrating knowledge city formation through visioning and planning for economic, socio-cultural and physical development. For that purpose a new development paradigm of ‘‘knowledge-based urban development’’ is formed, and quickly finds implementation ground in many parts of the globe. [...] - Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the literature and examines global best practice experiences in order to determine how cities are engineering their creative <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> so as to establish a base for knowledge city formation. [...] - Findings: The paper sheds light on the different development approaches for creative <b>urban</b> <b>regions,</b> and concludes with recommendations for urban administrations planning for knowledge-based development of creative <b>urban</b> <b>regions.</b> [...] - Originality/value: The paper provides invaluable insights and discussion on the vital role of planning for knowledge-based urban development of creative <b>urban</b> <b>regions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- To really {{fulfill the}} ambitious goals for a {{sustainable}} public transit, innovations should aim on innovating value-configuration spaces through re-inventing the way value is created between service providers and customers. Solving the upcoming traffic challenges in <b>urban</b> <b>regions,</b> research can either focus on advancing single provision of public transit services, {{or it could}} use the perspective of value-configuration spaces. Value-configuration spaces consist of value creation and value networks. We applied the perspective of value-configuration spaces to multiple <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> in industrialized and newly-industrializing countries. Our findings replicate theoretical contributions of elements for conceptualizing value networks and value co-creation. Theoretical extensions refer to the value-configuration spaces for public transit services in <b>urban</b> <b>regions,</b> which seem to evolve through five distinct stages: (1) establishment of reliability of single transportation modes, (2) integration of different transit modes, (3) regional integration, (4) service extension, and (5) individual mobility.

25|$|Secondary Highway 541, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 541, was a provincially maintained secondary highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The highway connected Highway17 in Sudbury with the community of Skead on the southern shores of Lake Wanapitei, passing through the community of Garson en route. Within the <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> of Sudbury, the highway served to access Sudbury Airport. The designation was applied in 1956, along with many of the secondary highways in Ontario. The province transferred responsibility for the route shortly after the creation of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury in 1973. Highway541 is now known as Sudbury Municipal Road86, following Falconbridge Highway and Skead Road.|$|E
25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities {{is not just about}} cars and too much driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E

40|$|Land use {{and land}} cover change (LULCC) {{dynamics}} {{have been particularly}} strong in the Mediterranean region, due to its historical development and to agro-pedoclimatic conditions favorable to human settlement. This area has undergone in the 1950 s and the 1980 s intense urbanization processes that has followed different trajectories. Urban expansion commonly occurs {{at the expense of}} agricultural land, leading to the fragmentation of natural areas and conflicts over access to land resources. These dynamics mainly concern the fringe between urban and agricultural land, e. g. the peri-urban areas usually included within functional <b>urban</b> <b>regions.</b> Here, to identify common features of LULCC in Western Mediterranean <b>urban</b> <b>regions,</b> we investigated two main features: direct changes due to urbanization and indirect changes affecting non-artificial land uses. We compared LULCC dynamics in 6 case studies from the north and south of the Western Mediterranean region: the <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> of Montpellier and Avignon (France), Pisa (Italy), Madrid (Spain), Meknes (Morocco), and Constantine (Algeria), using a 30 -year multitemporal spatial analysis (1980 - 2010). Two series of Landsat TM images were acquired for each case study and land cover data were analyzed both for dynamics and for land patterns, using landscape and class metrics. We found no significant north-south differences in LULCC dynamics between the investigated Western Mediterranean <b>urban</b> <b>regions.</b> Differences are more pronounced between small-medium cities and large metropolitan areas in type of urban diffusion, which is more sprawled in small-medium cities and more compact in large metropolitan areas. Rather, differences occur in LULCC not directly affected by urbanization, since in Northern Mediterranean <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> afforestation and abandonment of agricultural areas are prevalent and closer to the urban areas, whereas transformation of natural areas into agricultural ones occurs mainly in Southern Mediterranean <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> at a similar distance from urban areas than it happens for afforested or abandoned areas.
