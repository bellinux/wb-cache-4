Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times called the video heart-pounding, and compared its momentum with the music video of [...] "Thriller, [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] and [...] "Shadows of the Night". However, Eric Wilson from the same newspaper commented that the video did not yield a breakout Madonna look compared to her videos from the 1980s. Singer Miley Cyrus created her {{own version of the}} video and posted it on her YouTube channel. Madonna responded to it in her own video and said, [...] "All you {{people out there who are}} making videos to my new single, '4 Minutes,' keep <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work,</b> nice job."

6000|$|At Tanjore, the Bishop was {{received}} in the most friendly manner by Serfojee, who came down from his throne to welcome him, and caused Mrs. Middleton to be conducted to visit the ladies of his zenana. He conducted the Bishop into his library, which contained books in various European languages; also on medicine and anatomy, this being his favourite study, to assist him {{in which he had}} an ivory skeleton. He returned the visit in great state, with six elephants, two of enormous size, going before him, and accompanied by his troops, with a wild, horrid dissonance of cannon and native music. Two thousand persons escorted the Rajah to the Bishop's tent, where he conversed very sensibly on various subjects, especially English history, or as he called it, [...] "the Generations of English Kings." [...] He was keeping <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>works</b> he had established, under the encouragement of the British resident, Colonel Blackburne, and in this district the native Christians numbered about 500, who were under the direction of Schwartz's companion, Pohle.|$|R

40|$|This paper begins from a {{definition}} of the modern polity as characterized by the mutual embedding of politics and media. It sketches {{the consequences of this}} state of affairs for 20 th century notions of citizenship, arguing that unprecedented knowledge {{goes hand in hand with}} more or less complete inefficacy on the part of most citizens. This is the more marked since the ownership of media, defended by those at an advantage as a matter of freedom from partisanship and favour, is now more concentrated than ever before. This bodes ill for citizens whose only foreseeable recourse is to keep <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> but slight <b>work</b> of criticism and intellectual independence. ...|$|R
2500|$|In the South, {{frontier}} {{areas that}} lacked transportation, {{such as the}} Appalachian Mountain region, remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts, although they had a larger upper-class of slaveowners. North Carolina was representative. However frontier areas of 1700 that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture. Rich men came in, bought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> land, and <b>worked</b> it with slaves. The area was no longer [...] "frontier". It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper-class white landowning gentry, a small middle-class, a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers, and a growing slave population {{at the bottom of}} the social pyramid. Unlike the North, where small towns and even cities were common, the South was overwhelmingly rural.|$|R
60|$|E. Exactly so. Sympathy faded {{out between}} them, though she, poor dear, never betrayed it, if she {{realised}} it, which I doubt. And as Cissy took after her father, {{this may have}} weakened her allegiance to her mother. At any rate, {{as soon as she}} was thought to have outgrown her mother's teaching, those greater things, mother's influence and culture, were not thought of, and she went to school and had her companions and interests apart; while Mary, <b>good</b> soul, filled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> vacancy with <b>good</b> <b>works,</b> and if once you get into the swing of that sort of thing in town, there's no end to the demands upon your time. I don't think she ever let them bore her husband. He was out all day, and didn't want her; but I am afraid they do bore her daughter, and absorb attention and time, so as to hinder full companionship, till Cissy has grown up an extraneous creature, not formed by her. Mary thinks, in her humility, dear old thing, that it is a much superior creature; but I don't like it as well as the old sort.|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} we aspire {{to discuss how}} the {{organization}} of work has developed through modernity up to late modernity. Through these two historic periods we build a foundation that makes us able to criticize the organization of work and discover elements from the two analytical periods, which can constitute {{a starting point for}} a notion of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work.</b> This notion appears through analysis with help from the concept of recognition, which makes it possible to construct a notion of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work.</b> This idea is however not uncomplicated, as the elements of the notion of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> have <b>the</b> ability to become ideological; which is one of our most fundamental critiques of the late modern organization of work. As a precaution for this problem, we try, {{at the end of this}} report, to run a comparison of the notion of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> with two alternative societal models...|$|R
