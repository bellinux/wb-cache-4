40|$|Abstract—In seismic survey, the {{information}} regarding the velocity of compression wave (Vp) as well as shear wave (Vs) are very useful especially during the seismic interpretation. Previous studies showed that both Vp and Vs determined by above methods are totally different with {{respect to each other}} but offered good approximation. In this study, both Vp and Vs of consolidated granite rock were studied by using <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>testing</b> method and seismic refraction method. In <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>testing,</b> two different condition of rock are used which is dry and wet.

50|$|Ultrasound {{inspection}} of welded joints {{has been an}} alternative to radiography for non-destructive testing since the 1960s. Ultrasonic inspection eliminates the use of ionizing radiation, with safety and cost benefits. Ultrasound can also provide additional information such as the depth of flaws in a welded joint. Ultrasonic inspection has progressed from manual methods to computerized systems that automate much of the process. An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>test</b> of a joint can identify the existence of flaws, measure their size, and identify their location. Not all welded materials are equally amenable to ultrasonic inspection; some materials have a large grain size that produces {{a high level of}} background noise in measurements.|$|E

Extracts {{from the first}} two paragraphs of this seminal patent for a nondestructive testing method succinctly describe the basics of ultrasonic testing. [...] "My invention pertains to a device for detecting the presence of inhomogeneities of density or elasticity in materials. For instance if a casting has a hole or a crack within it, my device allows {{the presence of the}} flaw to be detected and its position located, even though the flaw lies entirely within the casting and no portion of it extends out to the surface." [...] Additionally, [...] "The general principle of my device consists of sending high frequency vibrations into the part to be inspected, and the determination of the time intervals of arrival of the direct and reflected vibrations at one or more stations {{on the surface of the}} part." [...] Medical echocardiography is an offshoot of this technology.|$|E

Ultrasonic technology was studied to evaluate the corrosion depth quantitatively. Three acidic environments with the pH level of 3. 5, 2. 5, and 1. 5 were simulated by the mixture of sulfate and nitric acid solutions in the laboratory. 354 prism specimens with the dimension of 150 [*]mm × 150 [*]mm × 300 [*]mm were prepared. The prepared specimens were first immersed in the acidic mixture for certain periods, followed by physical, mechanical, computerized tomography (CT) and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>test.</b> Damage depths of the concrete specimen under different corrosion states were obtained from both CT and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>test.</b> Based on the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>test,</b> a bilinear regression model is proposed to estimate the corrosion depth.
