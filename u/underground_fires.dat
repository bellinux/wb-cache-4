50|$|Draining the Hula {{turned out}} to be a mixed blessing. Water {{polluted}} with chemical fertilizers began flowing into Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), lowering the quality of its water. The soil, stripped of natural foliage, was blown away by strong winds in the valley, and the peat of the drained swamp ignited spontaneously, causing <b>underground</b> <b>fires</b> that were difficult to extinguish. Eventually part of the valley was transformed back into a wetland habitat.|$|E
50|$|Production at Wheal Jane {{had already}} {{restarted}} in 1980 reaching 1499 tonnes of tin in 1981 and 1863 tonnes in 1984.

The {{length of the}} Decline is 655 meters, and reached over towards Cornwall County Council’s waste dump at United Downs. The Decline suffered from ingress of Methane gas from the dump, which gave rise to safety concerns over possible <b>underground</b> <b>fires</b> or explosion.|$|E

He discovered that heat is evolved when iron filings and sulphur are rubbed together to a paste with water, and the artificial volcan de Lemery was produced by burying underground a considerable quantity of this mixture, which he regarded as a potent agent in the causation of volcanic action.|$|E

In 1888 he was promoted to managing director. During his time as director, he made changes to improve the working situations in the mines, such as allowing employees to work in teams, and changing the division of labor. Later, more mines were added to his duties.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} ammonium chloride was in 554 A.D. in China. [...] At that time, ammonium chloride came from two sources: (1) the vents of underground coal fires in Central Asia, specifically, in the Tian Shan mountains (which extend from Xinjiang province of northwestern China through Kyrgyzstan) {{as well as}} in the Alay (or Alai) mountains of southwestern Kyrgyzstan, and (2) the fumaroles of the volcano [...] Mount Taftan in southeastern Iran. [...] (Indeed, the word for ammonium chloride in several Asian languages derives from the Iranian phrase anosh adur (immortal fire), a reference to the <b>underground</b> <b>fires.)</b> Ammonium chloride was then transported along the Silk Road eastwards to China and westwards to the Muslim lands and Europe.|$|E

50|$|Jharia {{is famous}} for a coal field fire that has burned {{underground}} for a century. The first fire was detected in 1916. According to records, it was the Khas Jharia mines of Seth Khora Ramji Chawda (1860-1923), who was a pioneer of Indian coalmines, whose mines {{were one of the}} firsts to collapse in underground fire in 1930. Two of his collieries, Khas Jharia and Golden Jharia, which worked on maximum 260-foot-deep shafts, collapsed due to now infamous <b>underground</b> <b>fires,</b> in which their house and bungalow also collapsed on 8 November 1930, causing 18 feet subsidence and widespread destruction. The fire never stopped despite sincere efforts by mines department and railway authorities and in 1933 flaming crevasses lead to exodus of many residents. The 1934 Nepal-Bihar earthquake led to further spread of fire and by 1938 the authorities had declared that there is raging fire beneath the town with 42 collieries out of 133 on fire.|$|E
5000|$|In 1905, 94,819 {{persons were}} employed, of whom 59,978 worked inside the actual pits or excavations, and 34,841 outside. Compared with 1900, {{there was a}} total {{increase}} of 924 {{in the number of}} persons employed. Fatal accidents resulted in 1900 in 127 deaths; compared with 1899 there was an increase of To in the number of deaths, and, as Professor Le Neve Foster pointed out, this exceeded the average death-rate of underground workers at mines under the Coal Mines Acts during the previous ten years, in spite of the quarrier [...] " [...] having nothing to fear from explosions of gas, <b>underground</b> <b>fires</b> or inundations." [...] He attributed the difference to a lax observance of precautions which might in time be remedied by stringent administration of the law. In 1905 there were 97 fatal accidents resulting in 99 deaths. In 1900 there were 92 prosecutions against owners or agents, with 67 convictions, and 13 prosecutions of workers, with 12 convictions, and in 1905 there were 45 prosecutions of owners or agents with 43 convictions and 9 prosecutions of workmen with 5 convictions.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{coal mine}} was called Gauf’s Mine after the Manager Mr J.L. Gauf. Others were the Good Hope, Ferndale and many more. There now arose a {{pressing}} {{need for a}} more sophisticated coal distribution system than using teams of ox wagons. The mine owners strongly advocated a railway line between Johannesburg and Boksburg, but this was opposed by the waggoneers. President Kruger managed to persuade the Volksraad to approve {{the building of a}} [...] "tram" [...] line, ostensibly to transport passengers only! The Rand Tram (so named as to appease the transport riders) opened in 1890, between Johannesburg’s Park station and Boksburg station. The line was subsequently extended to Brakpan and Springs, where large deposits of superior quality coal had been discovered. Also, deposits of high grade fireclay were discovered in Boksburg, which gave impetus to development of a fireclay manufacturing industry. All this helped the importance of the gold mining industry. Coal mining came to an end in 1895 after <b>underground</b> <b>fires</b> broke out, rendering the entire mining area unsafe.|$|E
