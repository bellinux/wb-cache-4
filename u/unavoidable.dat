5|$|A {{significant}} proportion of food waste is produced by the domestic household, which, in 2007, created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste. Potatoes, bread slices and apples are respectively the most wasted foods by quantity, while salads are thrown away in the greatest proportion. A majority of wasted food is avoidable, with the rest being divided almost equally by foods which are <b>unavoidable</b> (e.g. tea bags) and <b>unavoidable</b> due to preference (e.g. bread crusts) or cooking type (e.g. potato skins).|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the food}} thrown away {{could have been avoided}} (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of the total amount of food waste) and with better {{management}} could have been eaten or used. <b>Unavoidable</b> foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being <b>unavoidable</b> through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) are unaware of the amount of food they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be throwing away 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{biologists}} still often {{write about}} evolution as if organisms had goals, and some philosophers of biology such as Francisco Ayala and biologists such as J. B. S. Haldane consider that teleological language is <b>unavoidable</b> in evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|Note: While {{the general}} plot of Human Revolution follows a {{distinct}} path, many elements {{are subject to}} the player's decisions. The game also offers several subplots which the player may or may not encounter, depending on their actions within the game. This synopsis concentrates on the main, <b>unavoidable</b> plot thread of the game.|$|E
5|$|Note: While {{the general}} plot of Invisible War follows a {{distinct}} path, many {{elements such as}} faction alliances and character interactions {{are subject to the}} player's decisions. The game also offers several subplots and explanations which the player may or may not encounter, depending on their actions within the game. This synopsis concentrates on the main, <b>unavoidable</b> plot thread of the game.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November Allenby {{ordered the}} relief of the three {{divisions}} of the EEF's XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps. In order to move such large formations a pause was <b>unavoidable</b> and so the attack was discontinued, but von Falkenhayn and his Ottoman Army took notice of the temporary cessation of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|When {{the truce}} expired in 552, Thurisind and Audoin again {{took to the}} field, {{and this time the}} clash was <b>unavoidable.</b> Audoin had reached an {{agreement}} with Justinian by which the Byzantines promised to send him military support in exchange for the 5,500 Lombards sent to help the Byzantine general Narses in the Emperor's war in Italy.|$|E
5|$|In this maimed Condition the Business of Course went lamely on; {{for a very}} {{middling}} Company of Players {{could be}} expected to bring but thin losing Audiences, especially while Party prevailed, and those very Plays were acted much better in the Haymarket. The <b>unavoidable</b> and melancholy Consequence of this Proceeding was, that there was a Ballance every Saturday Morning in the Office against the Manager, of Fifty or Sixty Pounds; and his Pride, as well as his Honour, were too nearly concerned not to prudence the Deficiency every Week with the utmost Exactness.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was <b>unavoidable,</b> due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was <b>unavoidable</b> that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated {{failure to do so}} with a gun. The New York Times found the <b>unavoidable</b> combat in {{the last part of the}} game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it {{is tempting to}} conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and <b>unavoidable</b> once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of a}} wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on {{the newly}} reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared <b>unavoidable.</b> This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|E
5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the {{stewards}} as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that his team had accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted {{that he was at}} fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals were late reacting to Kobayashi's accident and felt his own accident was <b>unavoidable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the crash occurred due to the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff due to {{the speed of the}} aircraft, and that a runway overrun was <b>unavoidable</b> at the 707's speed. The disabled DC-9, a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not, was a contributing factor in the crash. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards of safe clearance from runway edges for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also take into account the exhaust fumes of jet engines. The board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regard to abort procedures.|$|E
5|$|The moral {{defense of}} the attacks on Japanese cities rests on an {{argument}} that they saved lives by shortening the war. The USSBS concluded {{that the effects of}} strategic bombing and blockade would have forced Japan to surrender by the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been used and the Soviet Union had remained neutral. Historian E. Bartlett Kerr supported this assessment, and argued that the firebombing of Japan's major cities was the key factor motivating Hirohito's decision to end the war. American historian Barrett Tillman has also written that area attacks were <b>unavoidable</b> because, owing to the limitations of their bombsight and the high winds common over Japan, the B-29s were incapable of bombing individual targets without also causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|During {{a period}} of ill health, Susan hits Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon) with her car after passing out. Susan is unaware that she has struck Bridget and she leaves the scene. When she realises that she is responsible, Susan confesses and it causes a bitter feud between the Kennedys and the Parkers. However, during Susan's trial, Bridget remembers falling {{into the path of}} the car and that the {{collision}} was <b>unavoidable.</b> Soon afterwards, following a series of incorrect diagnoses, Susan is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Susan is shocked and scared, and Karl and Libby try to help her. Susan collapses at Toadie and Steph's wedding rehearsal and she goes to a multiple sclerosis retreat for professional help. Susan takes sick leave from the school and becomes a journalist for the Erinsborough News. After Libby is told she cannot have any more children, she and Dan decide to try surrogacy. Susan offers to be their surrogate, despite Karl's objections. Paul Robinson finds out about the surrogacy and writes a newspaper article about it, without knowing the identity of the family involved. When he finds out that Susan is the surrogate, he makes it public. The family face abuse and the hospital board decide to end the programme.|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless <b>unavoidable,</b> since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 1979, China retaliated against Vietnam's {{invasion}} of Kampuchea by attacking along the Sino-Vietnam border, and within ten days {{had reached the}} provincial capitals. Fighting bogged down due to the maze of tunnels the Chinese encountered; nevertheless, the Chinese army captured Cao Bằng on 2 March and Lạng Sơn on 4 March, reportedly advancing towards Hanoi at a high speed, though not on good terms with its supply lines. However, the following day, China {{announced that it would}} not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting fierce and unexpectedly harsh resistance by well trained and equipped Vietnamese forces, supplied with American technology left behind from the Vietnam War. Confident that the threat of invasion had been a success, the Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces. Although China failed to decisively win the 27-day conflict, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a strong resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it <b>unavoidable</b> for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription, and requiring Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} a {{shielding}} gas depends on several factors, most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice, {{but because of the}} reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter is <b>unavoidable</b> and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in short circuit GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, electrode type and diameter) are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller electrode diameters.|$|E
5|$|The {{implosion}} project {{remained a}} backup until April 1944, when experiments by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the B Reactor at the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared <b>unavoidable.</b> This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.|$|E
25|$|As long as some {{member of}} the <b>unavoidable</b> set is not reducible, the {{discharging}} procedure is modified to eliminate it (while introducing other configurations). Appel and Haken's final discharging procedure was extremely complex and, together {{with a description of}} the resulting <b>unavoidable</b> configuration set, filled a 400-page volume, but the configurations it generated could be checked mechanically to be reducible. Verifying the volume describing the <b>unavoidable</b> configuration set itself was done by peer review {{over a period of several}} years.|$|E
