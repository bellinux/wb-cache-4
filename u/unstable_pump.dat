40|$|An {{analytical}} dispersion relation {{is derived}} which shows that, in toroidal plasmas, zonal flows can be spontaneously excited via modulations in the radial envelope of a single-n coherent drift wave, with n the toroidal mode number. Predicted instability features are verified by 3 D global gyrokinetic simulations of the ion-temperature-gradient mode.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is not only to develop a simple method to improve pump {{performance}} but also to suppress the occurrence of cavitation in the centrifugal pump by use of J-Groove. J-Groove is a shallow groove installed on the casing wall in the meridional direction. The application of J-Groove to a centrifugal pump with a new type impeller of "semi-closed impeller" has proved its effectiveness as a useful countermeasure of the <b>unstable</b> <b>pump</b> performance and cavitation.

40|$|The {{objective}} in this Master's Thesis was {{to verify the}} stability criteria for a centrifugal pump. Operation of an <b>unstable</b> <b>pump</b> may lead to either exponential or oscillatory unstable behavior of both pressure and volume flow {{of the water in}} the conduit system. This is of course unwanted, and fulfilling the stability criteria is desirable. The idea is to test an <b>unstable</b> <b>pump,</b> which was done at the Technical University Berlin (TU) in Germany. Most of the test set-up was already installed, but a new pump and a pressure accumulator was inserted. Unfortunately the experiment was not able to verify the stability criteria systematically, because the set-up was a closed loop without reservoirs; and because the different parameters affecting the stability were difficult to change. The experiment was educational even though the stability criteria were not verified. Different tasks were executed at TU, like installing the pressure accumulator and a pressure sensor, and measuring the pump characteristic. The work with the Master's Thesis also improved the candidate's understanding of the stability criteria and the dynamic behavior of the water in general. A simulation program was made in Matlab, and the aim of the program was to simulate the oscillations of the water in the conduit system. Most of the parameters put into Matlab were measured at TU, except the volume of the air inside the pressure accumulator. This volume affects the frequency of the oscillations a lot, but a good estimation of the volume of the air, made the simulations quite similar to the measured results. In addition to simulating the existing set-up, the simulation program made it easy to vary the parameters affecting the stability criteria. The simulation program was tested this way, and the stability criteria seem to be correct. </p...|$|E

A model for two coupled oscillators describing nonlinear resonance curves is developed. Stability of the static solutions is analyzed. It is shown that thermal nonlinearity is responsible for driving the eigenfrequencies of the two resonators apart, making the normal modes of the system <b>unstable</b> as the <b>pump</b> power grows.

Generally speaking, it is believed that the centrifugal relativistic effects may induce plasma waves, which under certain conditions might be <b>unstable</b> efficiently <b>pumping</b> energy from the background flow. On the second stage energy of wave-modes can be transformed into energy of plasma particles, leading to consequent acceleration.|$|R

A laser efficiency of 20 % is obtained with an output power of about 8 W for 40 W pumping power. A passively mode-locked fiber laser is then built up.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} Schroedinger equation with linear {{growth and}} damping is truncated to three waves. The resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations describes the excitation of linearly damped waves by the oscillating two-stream instability {{driven by a}} linearly <b>unstable</b> <b>pump</b> wave. This system represents a simple model for the nonlinear saturation of a linearly unstable wave. The model is examined analytically and numerically {{as a function of}} the dimensionless parameters of the system. It is found that the model can exhibit a wealth of characteristic dynamical behavior including stationary equilibria, Hopf bifurcations to periodic orbits, period doubling bifurcations, chaotic solutions characteristic of a strange attractor, tangent bifurcations from chaotic to periodic solutions, transient chaos, and hysteresis. Many of these features are shown to be explainable on the basis of one-dimensional maps. In the case of chaotic solutions, evidence for the presence of a strange attractor is provided by demonstrating Cantor set-like structure (i. e., scale invariance) in the surface of section...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{preliminary}} study of new developed pumps for circulatory {{support on the}} hydrodynamic circulation model {{is an important step}} in the process of their designing. Hydrodynamic circulation models that can closely imitate cardio – vascular system are important to defi ne the range of effective functioning of the pumps under normal and heart disease conditions which is of great importance for defi ning the mode of these pumps in real clinical conditions. The aim of study is to create a new hydrodynamic circulation model of the systemic circulation to study the processes of interaction of heart left ventricle and continuous – fl ow pumps. Materials  and methods. The main components of the mock circulation model (arterial and venous blocks) are designed as closed reservoirs with an air bag providing the necessary elasticity value of these reservoirs. The heart left ventricle was simulated with an artifi cial heart ventricle with a pneumatic drive Sinus-IS which allows to change its options in a wide range. As a test pump we used the fi rst native implantable axial pump VISH – 1. In the course of research we made the registration and recording of the basic hemodynamic parameters (pressure, fl ow) with a multichannel module Pumpax for the measurement of pressure parameters. Results. The designed circulation model allows to adequately reproduce the main hemodynamic parameters of the circulatory system in normal (arterial pressure – 110 / 77 mmHg, left atrium pressure – 7 mmHg and cardiac output – 4. 2 l/min) and heart failure conditions (arterial pressure – 79 / 53 mmHg, left atrium pressure – 15 mmHg and cardiac output – 3. 1 l/min). On the circulation model the interaction of heart left ventricle and continuous-fl ow pump in heart failure simulation was studied. The dynamics of the main circulation fi gures is shown under conditions of changing of the pump rotor speed. Meanwhile, the conditions of the closing of aortic valve are identifi ed which is important for the clinical use of this pump. Using a special separately fl exible camera on the pump inlet we modeled phenomena of negative pressure leading to <b>unstable</b> <b>pump</b> operation and reduction of pump fl ow. Conclusion. Characteristics of the developed hydrodynamic circulation model allow us to reproduce parameters of systemic circulation in a wide range and to use it in designing of new pumps for circulatory support. </p...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that under certain {{conditions}} a collection of dielectric Rayleigh particles suspended in a viscous medium and enclosed in a bidirectional ring cavity pumped by a strong laser field can produce a new modulational instability transverse to the wave-propagation direction. The source of the instability is collective Rayleigh scattering i. e., the spontaneous formation of periodic longitudinal particle-density modulations and a backscattered optical field. Using a linear stability analysis a dispersion relation is derived which determines the region of parameter space in which modulational instability of the backscattered field and the particle distribution occurs. In the linear regime the pump is modulationally stable. A numerical analysis is carried out to observe {{the dynamics of the}} interaction in the nonlinear regime. In the nonlinear regime the pump field also becomes modulationally <b>unstable</b> and strong <b>pump</b> depletion occurs...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of dispersive optical bistability {{in a system of}} cold atoms enclosed in a bidirectional ring cavity. This analysis is carried out using a system of equations which extend the so-called Maxwell-Bloch model to self-consistently include atomic centre-of-mass motion. When the atomic sample is sufficiently cold and dense, the atomic centre-of-mass motion causes the low pump transmission state to become <b>unstable</b> when the <b>pump</b> is blue-shifted with respect to the atomic resonance. This recoil-induced instability results in the exponential growth of the radiation field counterpropagating to the pump and an atomic density grating. The density grating strongly influences the dispersive properties of the atomic sample and causes the pump transmission to jump from the low transmission state to the high transmission state. It is expected that these effects should be observable in a cold (T K), dense (n similar to 10 (11) cm(- 3)) sample of Rb, enclosed in a high quality ring cavity (R approximate to 99 %).

40|$|Considered as a {{fundamental}} step {{for the development of}} the atomic laser and quantum computing, as well as the theoretical explanation of super fluidity, the Bose- Einstein condensate (BEC) has emerged as one of the most important topics in modern physics. This project is devoted to the analysis of a condensate based on exciton-polaritons. This BEC is characterized by a high critical temperature of condensation (about 20 K) and non-equilibrium dynamics. A mathematical model called complex Gross- Pitaevskii equation (cGPE) is used to describe its behavior. The steady state solutions of the cGPE are studied and a numerical method based on a collocation method is proposed in order to find these solutions. Once the steady state solutions are found, a linear stability analysis is performed, demonstrating that the steady state solutions become <b>unstable</b> as the <b>pumping</b> spot radius increases. Finally, the manifestations of these instabilities are analyzed by direct simulation of the cGPE, using a second order time-splitting spectral method. As a result, it is possible to see the formation of quantum vortices, which increase in number as the pumping spot radius increases...|$|R
5000|$|The first ion pump {{was invented}} by Varian Associates, now Agilent. The {{original}} activity of Varian, co-founded in 1948 by Russell Varian, {{the inventor of the}} Klystron, and his brother Sigurd, was in the field of microwave electron tubes. Robert Jepsen joined the company in 1951 and soon became director of the Klystron research group. His investigation about electronic vacuum pumping led in 1957 to the realization of the first sputter ion pump (SIP), later named VacIon pump, of which he was co-inventor.The pump was developed as an appendage pump for maintaining Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) in microwave power tubes after processing, but soon after honeycomb-shaped anodes and commercial VacIon pumps with speeds of thousands of liters per second were produced. Lewis Hall and John Helmer were members of the research team, involved in the choice of the most suitable cathode material and in the optimization of the ion pump design. Sherm Rutherford joined Varian in February 1959 in the Central Research Department (which, soon after, spun off the Vacuum Division). His activity, working for Robert Jepsen, was to study the behavior of the sputter ion pump (in terms of pumping speed and discharge intensity I/P) over a wide range of parameters, such as magnetic field, voltage, anode cell diameter, anode cell length and pressure. Renn Zaphiropoulos joined the Vacuum Division in 1959 and was engaged in scaling up the ion pump from the original appendage pump to a full range of large pumps up to 5000 l/s [...] His group worked on high voltage feedthroughs, magnets, control units, systems, flanges, valves, sorption pumps and Titanium Sublimation Pumps (TSP). In 1960 the “slotted” titanium cathode, named “Super VacIon Pump”, was introduced on the basis of observations about noble gas <b>pumping</b> mechanism and <b>unstable</b> Argon <b>pumping</b> phenomena. In the same years triode pumps were invented by W.M. Brubaker (Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation) and Varian, now Agilent, began to sell them in the late ‘60s under the name “Noble Ion Pumps”, then changed the name to “Triode Ion Pumps” in the early ‘70s.|$|R
50|$|Supercontinuum {{generation}} is generally <b>unstable</b> when <b>pumped</b> by long pulses. The occurrence of optical rogue waves are an extreme manifestation of this instability and arise {{due to a}} sensitivity to a particular component of input noise. This sensitivity can be exploited to stabilize and increase the generation efficiency of the spectral broadening process by actively seeding the instability with a controlled signal instead of allowing it to begin from noise. The seeding can be accomplished with an extraordinarily weak, tailored optical seed pulse, which stabilizes supercontinuum radiation by actively controlling or stimulating modulation instability. Whereas noise-induced (i.e., spontaneously generated) supercontinuum radiation usually has significant intensity noise and little to no pulse-to-pulse coherence, controlled stimulation results in a supercontinuum pulse train with greatly improved phase and amplitude stability. Additionally, the stimulus {{can also be used}} to actuate the broadband output, i.e., to switch the supercontinuum on and off by applying or blocking the seed. The seed may be derived from the pump pulse by broadening a portion of it slightly and then carving out a stable portion of the broadened tail. The relative delay between the pump and seed pulses is then adjusted accordingly, and the two pulses are combined in the nonlinear fiber. Alternatively, the extremely stable stimulated supercontinuum can be generated by deriving both pump and seed radiation from a parametric process, e.g., the two-color output (signal and idler) of an optical parametric oscillator. Added input modulations have also been studied for changing the frequency of rare events and optical feedback can be employed to speed up the spectral broadening process. Stimulated supercontinuum radiation can also be generated using an independent continuous-wave seed, which avoids the need to control the timing but the seed must instead must have higher average power. A continuous-wave-seeded supercontinuum source has been employed in time stretch microscopy, yielding improved images compared with those obtained using unseeded sources. Stimulated supercontinuum generation can be slowed or frustrated by applying a second seed pulse with the proper frequency and timing to the mix. Thus, applying one seed pulse can accelerate the spectral broadening process, and the application of a second seed pulse can once again delay spectral broadening. This frustration effect occurs because the two seeds effectively compete for gain within the pump envelope, and it is a controlled version of the rare narrowband events known to occur stochastically in certain supercontinuum pulse trains (see above).|$|R
40|$|The {{absolute}} and convective instabilities of circularly polarized Alfven waves propagating along an ambient magnetic field are studied. The approximation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics is used. The analysis {{is restricted to}} the decay instability that occurs when the sound speed is smaller than the Alfven speed. In addition, {{it is assumed that}} the amplitude a of an <b>unstable</b> Alfven wave (<b>pump</b> wave) is small. This assumption allows us to study the problem analytically using expansions in power series with respect to a. It is shown that there are quantities, U-l 0, such that the pump wave is absolutely unstable in a reference frame moving with velocity U with respect to the rest plasma if U-l U-r, then the pump wave is convectively unstable. The expressions for U-l and U-r are found. The signaling problem is studied in a reference frame where the pump wave is convectively unstable. It is shown that spatially amplifying waves exist only when the signaling frequency is in two narrow symmetric frequency bands with the widths of the order of a. The implication of the obtained results on the interpretation of observational data obtained in space missions is discussed. It is shown that circularly polarized Alfven waves propagating in the solar wind are convectively unstable in a reference frame of any spacecraft moving with the velocity not exceeding a few tens of km/s in the solar reference frame. The spatial amplification scale of these waves is very large, of the order of 1 / 6 a. u. In view of these results it is not surprising at all that evidence of the decay instability of Alfven waves in the solar wind is sparse...|$|R
