5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or <b>USB</b> <b>key</b> are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that may take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E

He returns to the safe house, where Knight informs him that the Panacea is not a cure but a vaccine. The Prepper expresses profound disappointment in the player as he returns to Buckingham Palace. Knight has left his bunker for the queen's quarters to access data on a <b>USB</b> <b>key.</b> The player makes {{his way through the}} palace, discovering that Knight has been killed and turned into a zombie.

500|$|<b>USB</b> <b>Key</b> Mode: The user must {{insert a}} USB device that {{contains}} a startup key into the computer {{to be able to}} boot [...] the protected OS. Note that this mode requires that the BIOS on the [...] protected machine supports the reading of USB devices in the pre-OS [...] environment. [...] The key may also be provided by a CCID for reading a cryptographic smartcard. [...] Using CCID provides additional benefits beyond just storing the key file on an external USB thumb drive, because the CCID protocol hides the private key using a cryptographic processor embedded in the smartcard; this prevents the key from being stolen by simply being read off the media on which it is stored.|$|E
40|$|We want to {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} victim and situation on stealing. We intend to test this by using the lost-letter technique from Merritt and Fowler (1948). The theory of the lost-letter technique is based on altruism: people can steal the letter, or behave altruistically and deliver it. In this study, we use <b>USB</b> <b>keys</b> instead of letters. In line with the results of Farrington and Knight (1979), we expect that <b>USB</b> <b>keys</b> that appear to be owned by a female {{are more likely to be}} returned than <b>USB</b> <b>keys</b> that are owned by males; <b>USB</b> <b>keys</b> indicating important content will be returned more than <b>USB</b> <b>keys</b> indicating less important content; subjects walking towards a service desk are more likely to return <b>USB</b> <b>keys</b> than subjects who are walking away from a service desk. Methodology We replicate the study of Farrington and Knight (1979) in a university environment. One hundred <b>USB</b> <b>keys</b> will be dropped near service desks of several university buildings,. The units of analysis are individuals: the passers-by (subjects) that can ignore them or pick them up. The actions of the subjects will be observed and recorded by master students...|$|R
