5|$|Damage {{and efforts}} to control the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash trees or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport of ash trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once is costly, so slowing down {{the rate at which}} trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their <b>urban</b> <b>forest</b> as ash.|$|E
5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee.

This paper deals {{with the results of}} a study concerning forest planning technique which was applied in these <b>urban</b> <b>forests</b> between 2001, 2003. Since the planning objectives are different from the state forest enterprise, inventory aims and intensity are varying in the <b>urban</b> <b>forests</b> compare to the state forest management planning units.

40|$|Urban {{areas are}} {{continuously}} expanding today, extending {{their influence on}} an increasingly large proportion of woods and trees located in or nearby urban and urbanizing areas, the socalled <b>urban</b> <b>forests.</b> Although these forests {{have the potential for}} significantly improving the quality the urban environment and the well-being of the urban population, data to quantify the extent and characteristics of <b>urban</b> <b>forests</b> are still lacking or fragmentary on a large scale. In this regard, an expansion of the domain of multipurpose forest inventories like National Forest Inventories (NFIs) towards <b>urban</b> <b>forests</b> would be required. To this end, it would be convenient to exploit the same sampling scheme applied in NFIs to assess the basic features of <b>urban</b> <b>forests.</b> This paper considers approximately unbiased estimators of abundance and coverage of <b>urban</b> <b>forests,</b> together with estimators of the corresponding variances, which can be achieved from the first phase of most largescale forest inventories.

In this study, we relate ecological characteristics of <b>urban</b> and peri-urban <b>forests</b> to forest bird species richness and we assess whether their effect changed over time due to the urban sprawl within the urban region of Milan, Italy. We analyse two periods (1998 – 2002 and 2010 – 2014) using weighted generalized linear models that considered <b>urban</b> and peri-urban <b>forests</b> collectively and <b>urban</b> and peri-urban <b>forests</b> separately.
