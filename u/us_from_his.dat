25|$|After {{returning}} to the <b>US</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exupéry was pressed {{to work on a}} children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exupéry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help. The author wrote and illustrated The Little Prince at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.|$|E
25|$|Cruceta was {{expected}} {{to compete for the}} vacant spots in the Tigers bullpen during spring training , left by Joel Zumaya and Fernando Rodney after they suffered shoulder injuries. Cruceta's chances of making the Tigers bullpen was dealt a blow when his visa was withheld, allegedly due to his suspension in 2007. After two months of waiting, Cruceta was granted his visa on April 9, allowing for him to come to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> native Dominican Republic. After returning to the United States, Cruceta was brought up to the Tigers on April 30, 2008, when Jason Grilli was traded to the Colorado Rockies. Cruceta made 13 appearances for the Tigers, going 0–3 with an ERA of 5.40. On June 3, Cruceta was designated for assignment; after clearing waivers, he joined the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. He became a free agent {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|Ewing, from Jamaica {{by way of}} the Boston area, {{was drafted}} by the New York Knicks in 1985, with whom he spent fifteen of his {{seventeen}} seasons in the NBA. An eleven-time All Star, Ewing {{was one of the best}} shooting centers in NBA history, possessing a nearly unstoppable baseline jump-shot, as well as a formidable shot blocker and rebounder. Ewing never won an NBA championship, but his Knicks represented the most formidable opponents of the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls dynasty in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Ewing's successor as the starting center at Georgetown, Dikembe Mutombo, who played most of his NBA career with the Denver Nuggets and Atlanta Hawks, was less adept offensively, but proved an even more dominant defender. Mutombo, who had not played basketball before arriving in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> native Zaire on a USAID scholarship, was among the greatest shot blockers in NBA history, leading the NBA in blocked-shots five consecutive years, in the course of a career in which he ranked second in the history of the league in blocked shots, behind only Hakeem Olajuwon. He was also the recipient of four NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards, tied for the record with Ben Wallace.|$|E
500|$|Upon Eraserhead release, Variety {{offered a}} {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "a sickening bad-taste exercise". The review expressed incredulity over the film's long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable. Comparing Eraserhead to Lynch's next film The Elephant Man, Tom Buckley of The New York Times felt {{that while the}} latter was a well-made film with an accomplished cast, the former was not. Buckley called Eraserhead [...] "murkily pretentious", and felt that the film's horror aspects stemmed solely from {{the appearance of the}} deformed child rather than from its script or performances. Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of The Atlantic felt that Eraserhead demonstrated that Lynch was [...] "one of the most unalloyed surrealists ever to work in the movies". Rose described the film as being intensely personal, finding that unlike previous surrealist films, such as Luis Buñuel's 1929 work Un Chien Andalou or 1930's L'Age d'Or, Lynch's imagery [...] "isn't reaching out to <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> films; we're sinking into them". In a 1993 review for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington described Eraserhead as unique, feeling that the film's [...] "intensity" [...] and [...] "nightmare clarity" [...] were a result of Lynch's attention to detail in its creation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production. In the 1995 essay Bad Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum felt that Eraserhead represented Lynch's best work. Rosenbaum felt that the director's artistic talent declined as his popularity grew, and contrasted the film with Wild at Heart—Lynch's most recent feature film at that time—saying [...] "even the most cursory comparison of Eraserhead with Wild at Heart reveals an artistic decline so precipitous {{that it is hard to}} imagine the same person making both films".|$|E
