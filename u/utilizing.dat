40|$|Tests for {{utilization}} of d-octopine and nopaline in defined media containing a carbon and nitrogen source {{were made on}} 60 strains of Agrobacterium representing four species and on a representative of each of five species of Rhizobium.

Of the remaining virulent strains, 27 <b>utilized</b> octopine and 14 <b>utilized</b> nopaline. Each of six strains of A. rhizogenes tested <b>utilized</b> only octopine but at a slower rate relative to growth than most A. tumefaciens.
