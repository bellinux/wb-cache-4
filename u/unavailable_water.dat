50|$|A flooded {{field will}} drain the {{gravitational}} {{water under the}} influence of gravity until water's adhesive and cohesive forces resist further drainage at which point it is said to have reached field capacity. At that point, plants must apply suction to draw water from a soil. The water that plants may draw from the soil is called the available water. Once the available water is used up the remaining moisture is called <b>unavailable</b> <b>water</b> as the plant cannot produce sufficient suction to draw that water in. A plant must produce suction that increases from zero for a flooded field to 1/3 bar at field dry condition (one bar is a little less than one atmosphere pressure). At 15 bar suction, wilting percent, seeds will not germinate, plants begin to wilt and then die. Water moves in soil {{under the influence of}} gravity, osmosis and capillarity. When water enters the soil, it displaces air from some of the pores, since air content of a soil is inversely related to its water content.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} description {{applies to}} a loam soil and agricultural crops. When a field is flooded, {{it is said}} to be saturated and all available air space is occupied by water. The suction required to draw water into a plant root is zero. As the field drains under the influence of gravity (drained water is called gravitational water or drain-able water), the suction a plant must produce to use such water increases to 1/3 bar. At that point, the soil is said to have reached field capacity, and plants that use the water must produce increasingly higher suction, finally up to 15 bar. At 15 bar suction, the soil water amount is called wilting percent. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration; the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts. The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000 bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000 bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called <b>unavailable</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Evaluation of meta-sedimentary bedrock as {{a source}} of stored water {{available}} to plants in a mediterranean climate is presented based on: root length distribution (RLD), root morphology, rock water holding capacity and seasonal pattern of water depletion. Studies were performed in southwestern Oregon under young stands of whiteleaf manzanita, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and Pacific madrone. RLD analysis shows that more then one quarter of the total root length of ericaceous plants is located in the rock layer. Stepwise procedures identified the best fitting multiple-regression model for relating RLD to depth, bulk density of rock and the space penetrable by roots (SPR). Linear expressions of SPR and depth were found to be significant explanatory variables. Roots of manzanita and madrone occupy rock fissures as small as 100 urn. The root stele remains cylindrical in shape without visible mechanical stress, the cortex became flat, creating "wing-like" structures {{on each side of the}} stele. Fine particles that fill the space between root cortex and rock matrices create a continuous conduit for water flow.

Through combining the institutional approach and entitlements concept, this study attempts to offer a theoretical framework for the examination of the dynamics water governance and responses of peri-urban areas' residents and government to socio-economic and ecological transformations of the areas for securing drinking water. The key research findings indicate that, firstly, water accessibility of peri-urban inhabitants is deeply embedded into and influenced by socio-economic and ecological transformations of the areas. As a peri-urban commune continues to be absorbed into the urban fabric of a large city, its inhabitants experience a transition in their entitlements to drinking water that is determined by the availability and quality of water resources, providers, social relations shaped in their community, and the local government's accountability. Local residents' entitlements to water are shifting from free of charge to one that is primarily determined by a monetary basis. Secondly, because of the shift in water entitlements, vulnerable groups are most severely affected and would become unable to secure water without the government's support. Finally, community-managed water supply system arrangement could be an adaptive strategy, but this cannot be vital without the local government's support...|$|E

40|$|To ensure {{security}} for underwater installations or to protect certain underwater areas {{it is of}} utmost importance to obtain data about {{the structure of the}} environment. This should be done in a cost-efficient manner in an automatic way, e. g., by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Using only the on-board navigation sensors of an AUV for localization, noise is adding up until at a point the navigation data and the resulting maps are completely corrupted. Therefore, it is necessary to aid the vehicle navigation by additional measurements to constrain the navigational error during long-lasting missions. For surface vessels this is achieved by global navigational satellite systems (GNSS).

Hence {{there is a need for}} increasing the current data rate capabilities both in shallow and deep underwater. Existing solutions (acoustic, mechanical or laser) suffer from different specific limitations: reduced data rate, insufficient positioning accuracy, high cost, etc. In this work supported by the French Europôle Mer organization, a high data rate underwater wireless radio system is being developed. We have chosen to modify some parts of the standard Wi-Fi architectures to keep costs low while obtaining performance that is currently <b>unavailable</b> under <b>water.</b> However, it is very well known that radio waves are strongly attenuated when they propagate in water. For this reason only wireless short range applications are expected to benefit from such innovations.

The most important parameters are the frequency, the salinity and temperature which varie with the geographic location, and sea weather variations. The attenuation computed in the band around 2. 4 GHz differed, depending on the specific EM model that was used. A new underwater radio antenna is now under development. We have considered further specific constraints: easy integration into both remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles, insensitivity to variations of sea water electrical characteristics, resistance to very high hydrostatic pressures compatible with oceanic trench exploration, bio-pollution resistance, and low sensitivity to relative positioning of the transmitter and receiver. Polarization properties have been carefully chosen to improve the latter while simplifying the design.

The importance of wetlands within the Perth Metropolitan area is widely documented with only 20 % of the pre-European settlement wetlands remaining. (Godfrey, 1988; Davis, 1988) By comparison wetlands in the Yellagonga Regional Park are relatively natural in their state.

The three-year study focussed on providing knowledge of pesticide movement and concentrations from intensive agricultural production into aquatic ecosystems and evaluating {{the degree of}} contaminant deposition and persistence in oxbow lake sediments. Penetration of insecticides into shallow groundwater did not represent a hazard. Herbicides and insecticides were found in surface water {{as a result of}} rainfall-related runoff from farm fields. A common herbicide, atrazine, had the largest number of detections (28 % of lake water samples). Sediment cores taken for pesticide analysis were also viewed by age in each lake. Residual organochlorines dominated the pesticide sediment profile. DDT and its metabolites were the only compounds that permeated sediments at all sites. Sediments deposited in the 1960 s and 1970 s which contained higher concentrations of DDT have been effectively sealed by more recent material so that the sink of contaminant is <b>unavailable</b> to the <b>water</b> column. Controlled release of pyrethroid insecticides in a forested wetland showed that the wetland was totally effective in neutralizing the pyrethroids before they reached lake surface water. The lakes are designated for fish and wildlife use, but pesticides seldom exceeded more stringent drinking water standards.

First, do price and income support policies promote a multifunctional agriculture in an effective manner? Second, would policies targeted more directly at multifunctional attributes be more efficient than price and income support policies? The answer to the first question is no, at least for policies targeted at outputs (price supports, export subsidies, etc.). Public goods are not directly linked to production, but rather to land use and agricultural structures. Evidence in response to the second question is sketchier with respect to policies targeted at land. Key Words: agricultural policy, environment, jointness, landscape amenities, multifunctionality, trade, transaction costs The primary function of agriculture is to supply food, fiber, and industrial products. However, agri-culture can also be a source of several public goods and externalities. Rural and urban populations often value agricultural land as open space and as a source of countryside amenities. Agricultural land is frequently a habitat for wildlife species. The agricultural sector can contribute to the economic viability of many rural areas and to food security. On the other hand, conversion of forest and wet-lands to agricultural production can damage eco-systems. Agricultural nutrients, pesticides, patho-gens, salts, and eroded soils are leading causes of water quality problems in many countries.

From July 1977 to the present, precipitation ranged from 5 to 7 inches; runoff was 7 times lower on the topsoiled watershed. Because of its structureless nature, the non-topsoiled watershed tended to crust and seal the surface. In general, the sediment yield was lower on topsoiled spoils; however, increased sediment yields were observed during intense storms, possibly reflecting the fact that the topsoil was not anchored to the underlying spoils. The non-topsoiled watershed was found to have a higher soil moisture at wilting point (13. 8 %) and high soluble salts (3, 000 - 5, 000 ppm), making <b>water</b> <b>unavailable</b> at higher suctions. The range of available water was higher on the non-topsoiled watershed. Tests indicated that most soil moisture water storage results from winter frontal storms of long duration. A vegetation survey indicated a more successful rate of seedling establishment (8. 1 plants/m) on the topsoiled watershed, but with a high subsequent die off rate due to drought conditions. Mechanical treatment of and chemical amendments to spoils and topsoils are discussed.

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. The World Bank (1994) {{concluded}} {{that there is a}} close relationship between infrastructure and economic growth. This also reflects on the water sector because, despite water sector importance, water services infrastructure {{is probably one of the}} most difficult to finance, while its deficiency or absence instils a particular burden on society. According to Baietti and Raymond (2005), more than 1. 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water, and approximately 2. 4 billion are without adequate sanitation. Yet these estimates underestimate the gravity of the situation in relation to access gap and quality of services provided. Most consumers face situations where water services are intermittent and when available the water is not safe for consumption, while sanitation facilities are overloaded, unused or in despair. This research was conducted in the North West Province with municipalities that have the status of water services authorities. This included a combination of district and local municipalities. The North West Province has 11 water service authorities of which nine are local municipalities and two are district municipalities. The competing demands and needs for governments to provide infrastructure for other sectors such as roads and energy further aggravate the stance of finance unavailability for the water sector. The purpose of the study was to highlight the challenges that municipalities face in financing water services infrastructure. The result of the study will provide knowledge and innovative ideas that will allow South Africa‘s municipalities to address challenges of service delivery. At municipal level water services are provided through a variety of approaches, although most involve centralised systems with large supply, distribution and treatment facilities. The social benefits that water services provide are well known, particularly those that relate to public health including reduced morbidity and mortality from waterborne diseases. The challenge is that funding to meet these development objectives is either scarce or entirely <b>unavailable.</b> The <b>Water</b> Services Act 108 of (DWAF, 1997) requires water services authorities and water service providers to put significant efforts into cost recovery for sustainable provision of water services. This aspect has significant challenges which results from widespread poverty and a culture of non-payment from communities inherent as a remnant of protest against apartheid. The scope of the water sector is complex, owing to its diversity, interactions and synergies with other industrial, commercial and financial sectors, and its international nature. Under the current South African constitutional and legislative framework, municipalities will remain to be a major player in the development, financing and delivering of water services infrastructure for sustainable growth and development. Water Services Authorities (WSAs) have responsibilities including protection and management of water resources, provision of adequate and sustainable water services, operation and maintenance of water services infrastructure, monitoring and management of municipal water quality to regulatory requirements and reporting to the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) with regards to the aforementioned. Water service delivery failures at the municipal level are a widespread and fundamental problem in South Africa. At the same time, under the current decentralisation policies, the responsibility for delivering such services is increasingly being delegated to lower levels of government/municipalities that are often ill equipped for the challenge in terms of financial and human resources capacity. Cardone and Fonseca (2006) indicated public administration and financial management capacity at central and sub-sovereign levels of government as limited, and affecting the timely transfer of funding as well as the capacity of municipalities to absorb those funds. Various strategies are needed to enable municipalities to secure and finance their water services infrastructure. These include understanding what bankers are looking for, understanding where donors are going, greater involvement of the private sector, matching service levels to affordability, improving revenues and influencing the regulatory regime...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} part of a two part study of the {{vulnerability}} of Timor-Leste’s ground water resources, and those who use them, to predicted climate change. In th{{is part of}} the study by Charles Darwin University (CDU) we focus on potential impact and adaptive capacity to address the vulnerability of Districts to water availability, and provide recommendations for water management. The second part of the study, by Geosciences Australia and presented separately, investigates the biophysical vulnerability of Timor Leste (of the aquifers) to climate change. This report uses a mixed methods approach including:• Review of current climate change predictions• Review of information about aquifer characteristics, provided by the GA study• Assessment of exposure of aquifers to pressure by groundwater users, by reviewing population distribution and growth• Evaluation of adaptive capacity of groundwater users, using census data on indicators of wealth, and field interviews about use and management of water resources. Using these methods we identify priority areas for action in water management and current and potential adaptation options. These options link readily to the National Adaptation Programmes of Action for Timor-Leste (NAPA), and we have also ranked them broadly in terms of predicted cost of implementation. Timor-Leste is a small island developing state, located {{in the eastern part of}} the lesser Sunda Islands archipelago. Topography is rugged, with the central mountains of the island reaching altitudes of almost 3000 m. The climate is monsoonal, and annual rainfall varies with elevation and aspect, from less than 1000 mm in some coastal areas to over 2500 mm in the wettest high altitude areas. Timor-Leste has a complex geology and much of the bedrock is sedimentary calcareous rock with shallow soils of low water holding capacity, high alkalinity and low nutrient content. According to the national census, in 2010 Timor-Leste had a population of 1. 07 million. Population growth is high (2. 4 %), fertility rate is high (5. 7 births for each fertile aged woman) and the population is relatively young (41 % under 14 years, 54 % between 15 - 66 years, and about 5 % over 65 years). Already, water insecurity is widespread in Timor-Leste and is a major limitation of food security and livelihoods. Low-input agriculture is the main economic activity in Timor-Leste, with over 86 % of households involved in subsistence farming. The main staple crops are rice, maize and cassava, with the limited rice production on the coastal plains fed by gravity irrigation and maize widely grown on the uplands. Geoscience Australia has classified aquifer types in Timor-Leste according to geology and “prospectivity”, i. e. potential flow rates or yields. The major aquifer types in Timor-Leste are:• Sedimentary aquifers with intergranular porosity, which have potential to hold large amounts of groundwater. Alluvial sedimentary aquifers have potential to be high yielding aquifers, with higher yield associated with greater porosity where sediments are more well-sorted (e. g. Dili). • Limestone karstic aquifers with fissured porosity are associated with many springs fed by groundwater and are sensitive to rainfall. In limestone areas, groundwater recharge, storage and yield are affected by the age of the system which determines whether fissures and channels have formed (e. g. in and around Baucau). • Fractured rock aquifers with localised porosity are low yielding and usually only sufficient for household use and animal watering. There is little or no porosity and groundwater is stored in existing fractures, with new channels not becoming larger with time (e. g. Lequidoe in Aileu District). A substantial proportion (about 33 %) of the population live on high yielding sedimentary aquifers, particularly on the coast, such as in Dili District, however, most of the population (44 %) live on localised aquifers in the highlands (approximately equally on high yielding karst and low yielding localised fractured rock aquifers aquifers). Uncertainty in climate change projections for Timor-Leste is relatively high because Timor-Leste is a similar in size to the grid cells of the models used for projections, has variable topography and little climatic data with which to test the validity of the models that underpin the projections. The most recent climate projections for Timor-Leste have been published by the Pacific Climate Change Science Program (www. pacificclimatechangescience. org). These projections include:• warming of average air and sea temperatures (by 0. 4 - 1. 0 oC by 2030 under a high emissions scenario);• decrease in dry season and increase in wet season rainfall;• extreme rainfall events to occur more frequently;• decrease in frequency and increase in high intensity cyclones;• sea level rise will continue (by 6 - 15 cm by 2030 under a high emissions scenario) • ocean acidification will continue. Impacts of climate change are discussed within the following framework:Exposure of groundwater resources to climate change were derived from prospectivity of aquifers as determined by Geoscience Australia. Sensitivity of groundwater resources was mapped by overlaying relative aquifer yield and modelled annual rainfall. Areas along the central northern coast and in Oecussi are expected to be particularly sensitive. Sensitivity was also considered in terms of population pressures, both density and rate of change. Potential impacts of climate change were a function of expected exposure to climate change and sensitivity to those changes. High potential impact was identified in several areas on low yielding, localised aquifers: Liquica District, with low rainfall west of Dili; the Districts of Ainaro, Aileu, Bobonaro, and Ermera, with high and rapidly growing populations; Oecussi District, with high population growth and low rainfall. The major towns of Dili and Baucau can also be considered sites of high potential impacts because of high population densities and high population growth rates. This is despite having relatively high yielding aquifers: high yielding sedimentary aquifer in the case of Dili and high yielding fissured aquifer in the case of Baucau. In addition, the surrounding hills are underlain by low yielding fractured rock aquifers. Vulnerability to climate change is a product of potential impacts and adaptive capacity. High adaptive capacity can minimise the vulnerability of a community or nation in the face of high potential impacts. Adaptive capacity is influenced by many factors, including poverty, education, health and social capital. We derived some possible indicators of adaptive capacity using data from the national census and Demographic and Health Survey, and from field surveys at sites representing the main aquifer types. This investigation indicated higher vulnerability due to potentially low adaptive capacity in some Districts. Dili is wealthy compared with other Districts and this may represent relatively high capacity for adaptation. Other factors, such as implementation of some health programs and evidence of community management bodies, suggest high adaptive capacity in other Districts. Current adaptation strategies in some sites included cooperative management of water resources, moving temporarily when <b>water</b> sources became <b>unavailable,</b> carrying <b>water,</b> and collecting rainwater. In summary, the following adaptation options are recommended: 1. Documentation and monitoring of ground water resources – to improve understanding of water availability; 2. Integrated water harvesting and storage, and irrigation maintenance – to build local resilience and adaptive capacity; 3. Agricultural diversification - to build resilience and adaptive capacity; 4. Improving governance (policy and regulation) – to reduce waste and over use, to secure availability and access, and to increase adaptive capacity. The people of Timor-Leste face substantial challenges in coping with the variability of the current climate, and further challenges regarding the expected changes to climate and water availability. Options for adaptations to climate change should be considered in the context of food security and sustainable agriculture and natural resource management practices at community, landscape and national scales. The need for this broader framework is stipulated in the National Adaptation Programmes of Action for Timor-Leste (NAPA) ...|$|R
