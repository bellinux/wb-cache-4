5|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} {{for more than}} a century to <b>understand</b> <b>who</b> is portrayed in this painting. Earlier proposals that the subject was John III Sobieski (who would have been eight years old in 1637) or Stephen Bathory (who died in 1586) have been discredited. According to Otakar Odložilík, while the man in the painting is clearly wearing Polish garb, it is neither certain who he is, nor whether he is a Pole. Odložilík's research on this issue suggested that the painting may be that of Andrzej Rej, a Polish noble and diplomat of that era who passed through Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where Rembrandt was working, at the time the painting was created. Nonetheless, without any documents from that era clearly acknowledging that fact, as Odložilík noted, it may never be known for certain who the subject really is.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} LGBT-inclusive {{curriculum}} is {{introduced by the}} National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics {{that must be addressed}} in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to <b>understand</b> <b>who</b> they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.|$|E

25|$|If {{the goal}} of shorter-term therapy is for {{patients}} {{to understand that they}} are not the way they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to <b>understand</b> <b>who</b> and what they are as human beings, what they truly are like and what they truly contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.|$|E
25|$|There {{are both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages of the matrix structure; some of the disadvantages are an increase in the complexity of the chain of command. This occurs because of the differentiation between functional managers and project managers, which can be confusing for employees to <b>understand</b> <b>who</b> is next in the chain of command. An additional disadvantage of the matrix structure is higher manager to worker ratio that results in conflicting loyalties of employees. However the matrix structure also has significant advantages that make it valuable for companies to use. The matrix structure improves upon the “silo” critique of functional management in that it diminishes the vertical structure of functional and creates a more horizontal structure which allows the spread of information across task boundaries to happen much quicker. Moreover, matrix structure allows for specialization that can increase depth of knowledge & allows individuals to be chosen according to project needs. This correlation between individuals and project needs is what produces the concept of maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses.|$|E

Adrienne —who though dead still appears and speaks to her— has told Madame X that Marie is [...] "like me". He thinks she is mad. Julien becomes frustrated at Marie {{spending so much time}} alone in the attic. When she finally shows him the room, she says she does not know what it is for. She leaves before Julien wakes and checks into another hotel. He rings Marie's old boss who suggests talking to Marie's friend Delphine; Delphine says that Marie's relationship with Simon drove Marie mad and ended their friendship.|$|E
500|$|Gaga further {{elaborated}} on {{the inspiration}} behind the song as walking towards the light force {{in her life}} and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto {{the source of the}} light. [...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to go back to New York, confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for her, something she could not escape.

Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the song's message to be confusing and did not <b>understand</b> <b>who</b> exactly Aguilera is supposed to be rising up against on the song, writing [...] "She hollers 'And we're gonna rise up.../ For every time you wronged me/ Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me.'

500|$|Duerr {{provides}} additional ethnographic examples {{showing how}} societal rules were reversed at special {{times of the}} year. In shamanic terms, societies which espouse an [...] "archaic mentality" [...] <b>understand</b> <b>who</b> they are by understanding who they are not; according to Duerr, modern societies fail to understand this concept. [...] Datura, a plant that contains toxic hallucinogens is discussed. [...] The plant was introduced to Europe in the early modern period. [...] Among the Huichol people of central Mexico, shamans have told anthropologists that Datura is used by malevolent witches. Duerr makes note of the anthropologists who have undertaken shamanic experiences with the people they are studying, such as Barbara Myerhoff and Carlos Castenada, but argues that such ethnographers have failed to truly understand what shamans mean when they describe their experiences as [...] "flying". In Duerr's view, shamans learn to evaporate their [...] "ego boundaries", thereby experiencing themselves in a different way; it is this feeling that {{can be described as}} shamanic flying. Duerr ties these shamanic practices into the werewolves of early modern Europe, arguing that these werewolves did not physically transform into wolves, but that they embraced their [...] "wolf nature" [...] by crossing over the boundary from [...] "civilisation" [...] to [...] "wilderness".|$|E
