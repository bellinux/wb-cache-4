5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> subject to annual freeze and thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} cnidarians, (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), ctenophores' bodies {{consist of a}} {{relatively}} thick, jelly-like mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia, layers of cells bound by inter-cell connections and by a fibrous basement membrane that they secrete. The epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one, {{and some of the}} cells in the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> have several cilia per cell.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E

Results show, for as-grown samples, {{not only a}} continuous enlargement of island size in <b>upper</b> <b>layers</b> but also a continuous increase of Ge concentration within islands in <b>upper</b> <b>layers.</b> As {{a result of the}} increasing island size and Ge concentration within the islands, the island density in <b>upper</b> <b>layers</b> decreases.

5|$|The cap {{flesh is}} {{composed}} of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and hairy <b>upper</b> <b>layer,</b> and a thick, soft, white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem is similarly divided, with a thin, dark and hairy cortical layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner ochre-colored flesh. A drop of potassium hydroxide applied {{to the surface of}} the mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, prosperous patrician {{families}} of merchants, bankers, or industrial investors, many of German origin, still conducted large-scale business operations in Europe or lent money to Polish noble interests, including the royal court. Some regions were highly urbanized {{in comparison to}} {{most of the rest of}} Europe. In Greater Poland and Lesser Poland at the end of the 16th century, for example, 30% of the population lived in cities. 256 towns were founded, most in Red Ruthenia. The townspeople's <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> was ethnically multinational and tended to be well-educated. Numerous sons of burghers studied at the Academy of Kraków and at foreign universities; members of their group are among the finest contributors to the culture of the Polish Renaissance. Unable to form their own nationwide political class, many blended into the nobility in spite of the legal obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The flat {{appearance}} of mature abyssal plains {{results from the}} blanketing of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited from turbidity currents that have been channeled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water. The remainder of the sediment comprises chiefly dust (clay particles) blown out to sea from land, {{and the remains of}} small marine plants and animals which sink from the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> of the ocean, known as pelagic sediments. The total sediment deposition rate in remote areas is estimated at two to three centimeters per thousand years. Sediment-covered abyssal plains are less common in the Pacific Ocean than in other major ocean basins because sediments from turbidity currents are trapped in oceanic trenches that border the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The shark {{spends most}} of its time in the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> of the oceanto a depth of and prefers off-shore, deep-ocean areas. According to {{longline}} capture data, increasing distance from land correlates to a greater population of sharks. Occasionally, it is found close to land, in waters as shallow as , mainly around midocean islands such as Hawaii, or {{in areas where the}} continental shelf is narrow with access to nearby deep water. It is typically solitary, though gatherings have been observed where food is plentiful. Unlike many animals, it does not have a diurnal cycle, and is active both day and night. Its swimming style is slow, with widely spread pectoral fins. Despite its habitual isolation from members of its own species, pilot fish, dolphinfish, and remora may accompany it. In 1988, Jeremy Stafford-Deitsch reported seeing an individual accompanied by a shortfin pilot whale.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. The spores are {{typically}} 7.5–9 by 7.5–9µm, spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, and thin-walled. Under a microscope, the spores appear hyaline (translucent), and are amyloid—meaning they will turn bluish-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia are 30.5–57 by 8–16µm, four-spored, and not clamped at the base. The margin {{cells of the}} gills are plentiful, spherical, club-shaped or swollen spherically at the tip, hyaline, and measure 13–58 by 8–33µm. The cap cuticle consists of a 130–220µm wide, strongly gelatinised suprapellis (<b>upper</b> <b>layer)</b> and a dense, non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap are made of abundant spherical, elliptic and club-shaped cells that are 21–119 by 14.5–115µm, intermixed with hyphae 4–9µm wide and pale umber in colour, and either arranged irregularly, or with a vertical orientation.|$|E
5|$|The uptake of {{nutrient}} {{and water}} by the cluster roots peaks through winter and spring, but ceases when the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> of soil dries out in summer. The cluster roots are then allowed to die, but the laterals are protected from desiccation by a continuous {{supply of water}} from the sinker root. The water supplied to the laterals by the sinker root is continually lost to the soil; thus this plant facilitates the movement of ground water from the water table into surface soil, a process known as hydraulic redistribution. Cluster roots have been estimated as comprising about 30% of total root biomass in this species; the seasonal production of so much biomass, only for it to be lost {{at the end of the}} growing season, represents a substantial investment by the plant, but one that is critical in the competition for nutrients.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{graphene}} during Cu-catalyzed {{chemical vapor deposition}} was studied using 12 CH 4 and 13 CH 4 precursor gasses. We suggest that the growth begins by {{the formation of a}} multilayer cluster. This seed increases its size but the growth speed of a particular layer depends on its proximity to the copper surface. The layer closest to the substrate grows fastest and thus further limits the growth rate of the <b>upper</b> <b>layers.</b> Nevertheless, the growth of the <b>upper</b> <b>layers</b> continues until the copper surface is completely blocked. It is shown that the <b>upper</b> <b>layers</b> can be removed by modification of the conditions of the growth by hydrogen etching. Comment: 17 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea {{from the}} Jordan River was reduced {{as a result}} of {{large-scale}} irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, stratification has begun to redevelop.|$|E
