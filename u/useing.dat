As such, the college appealed directly to the Crown officers, and on 1 May, it met with a committee of judges at Ellesmere's house. The committee was had Ellesmere, Popham, Thomas Fleming, two judges from the Court of Common Pleas and two from the Court of King's Bench. The judges all agreed that [...] "for not well doeing <b>useing</b> or practicing the facultie or arte of physike or for disobedience or contempte donne and committed against anye ordynaunce made by the colledge... they may committ the offenders without bayle or mayneprise". That success spurred the college to move against Bonham yet again, now by suing him in the King's Bench for £60 for maintaining an illicit practice. In a counterattack, Bonham brought a suit in the Common Pleas, requesting £100 damages, and alleging that they had trespassed against his person and wrongfully imprisoned him [...] "against the law and custom of this kingdom of England".|$|E

40|$|Aims Genetically {{influenced}} {{aspects of}} adolescent behaviour {{can play a}} role in alcohol <b>use</b> and peer affiliation. We explored the correlations between friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and adolescent own <b>use</b> with a genetically sensitive design. Design Genetic and environmental factors were estimated on adolescent reports of their friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and their own <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. The correlations between the genetic and environmental factors that influence friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> were also estimated. Participants A total of 862 twin pairs aged 11 – 17 years sampled from the UK population-based Cardiff Study of All Wales and North-west of England Twins (CaStANET). Measurements Data on adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> and the alcohol <b>use</b> of their three best friends were obtained <b>using</b> self-report questionnaires. Findings A significant genetic influence was found on adolescent friends' alcohol <b>use</b> (about 30 %). Significant correlations of 0. 60 and 0. 70 were found between the genetic influences on friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and adolescents' own <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. Common environmental influences were almost completely correlated for friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and adolescents' own alcohol <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> (0. 91 and 0. 94).

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the associations between licit drug <b>use</b> and marijuana <b>use</b> in adolescence and young adulthood. Very few studies, however, have examined cigarettes and alcohol as separate variables to assess whether {{there is a difference between}} these licit drugs and their relationships with marijuana <b>use,</b> and none have focused exclusively on these relationships <b>using</b> a nationally representative sample. The present study investigated the relationships between alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana <b>use</b> in adolescence and young adulthood <b>using</b> data from the 2002 and 2003 National Surveys on Drug <b>Use</b> and Health. This current study investigated: (1) whether the correlations between alcohol <b>use</b> and marijuana <b>use</b> differ from those between cigarette <b>use</b> and marijuana <b>use,</b> (2) whether each licit drug is a significant, independent predictor of marijuana <b>use</b> after controlling for a comparable measure of the other licit drug, and (3) whether these relationships differ depending on how 2 ̆ 2 <b>use</b> 2 ̆ 2 is operationally defined. This is the first known study that has assessed multiple levels and definitions of <b>use</b> of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana to determine if the licit drugs differ in their associations and predictive values of marijuana <b>use</b> <b>using</b> a nationally representative sample. Overall, cigarette <b>use</b> was a stronger predictor of marijuana <b>use</b> than was alcohol <b>use,</b> particularly when assessing more frequent and higher rates of use; however, it was found that the differences in predictive values of alcohol and cigarette <b>use</b> on marijuana <b>use</b> differed as a function of how <b>use</b> was defined. In addition, cigarette <b>use</b> was a stronger predictor of marijuana <b>use</b> than was smokeless tobacco <b>use,</b> providing evidence that the relationship between cigarettes and marijuana <b>use</b> may be due, in part, to similar modes of ingestion. The methodological and clinical implications of the findings are discussed. ...|$|R
