40|$|ATM {{continues}} to gain acceptance as a <b>unifying</b> <b>communications</b> technology for traffic of both digital and analog origins. The main characteristic of an ATM network is its discrete time (slotted) operation and fixed-length packets. In this paper we analyze {{the performance of}} a fileserver operating in an ATM network to serve files to a group of workstations upon requests of the latters. We assume that the file requests arrive into the file-server as short messages of one packet each. The files themselves are assumed to have a geometrically dis¬tributed number of packets. The requests arriving into the fileserver are buffered in a queue and are treat¬ed on a first come first serve (FCFS) basis. A request is dismissed from the queue only when its associat¬ed file has been fully transmitted to the requesting station. We analyze three metrics for the fileserver: occupancy, unfinished work, and waiting time. For each of these metrics, we obtain the probability generating function (PGF), the entire distribution, and the expec¬tation. في هذا البحث نقوم بتحليل أداء خادم ملفات في شبكة صرف آلي بافتراض أن طلبات الملفات تصل في صورة رسائل قصيرة مكونة من حزمة واحدة لكل رسالة، وأن الملفات مكونة من عدة حزم موزعة هندسيا، وأن الطلبات تنتظم في طابور حيك تعامل تبعا لترتيب الوصول، ويتم إخلاء طلب من الطابور عند الانتهاء من نقل الملف المطلوب إلى المحطة الطالبة. ‏نتقوم بتحليل ثلاثة مقاييس لخادم الملفات هي الإشغال، والعمل غير المكتمل، وزمن الانتظار، ونحصل لكل من هذه المقاييس على دالة توليد الاحتمال، والتوزيع التام، والتوقع...|$|R

50|$|Jelling is {{a village}} within Vejle {{municipality}} {{famous for the}} Jelling stones - a large stone ship and two large burial mounds. In the North Mound, built between 958 and 959 CE (possibly for King Gorm of Denmark), an empty burial chamber was found. The South Mound was built around 970 and contains no burial. Beneath the two mounds is a large stone ship from {{around the end of}} the 9th century. Between the two mounds stands two rune stones, the Jelling stones. Near the stones, Gorm's son King Harald “Bluetooth” I, the man who brought Christianity to Denmark, built a wooden church (965). Beneath it, he re-interred the remains of his father (965-966). The Jelling stones and Jelling Church have been an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994. Bluetooth communications was named after Harald Bluetooth as he was known for his unification of previously warring tribes from Denmark (including Scania, present-day Sweden, where the Bluetooth technology was invented), and Norway.

30|$|The {{research}} on legged robots {{attracted much attention}} both from the academia and industry. Legged robots are multi-input multi-output with multiple end-effector systems. Therefore, the mechanical design and control framework are challenging issues. This paper reviews the development of type synthesis and behavior control on legged robots; introduces the hexapod robots developed in our research group based on the proposed type synthesis method. The control framework for legged robots includes data driven layer, robot behavior layer and robot execution layer. Each layer consists several components which are explained in details. Finally, various experiments were conducted on several hexapod robots. The summarization of the type synthesis and behavior control design constructed in this paper would provide a <b>unified</b> platform for <b>communications</b> and references for future advancement for legged robots.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Data {{distribution}} and access are major issues in space sciences as they influence {{the degree of}} data exploitation. The project “Space-Data Routers ” (SDR) has the aim of allowing space agencies, academic institutes and research centres to share space data generated by single or multiple missions, in an efficient, secure and automated manner. The approach of SDR relies on space internetworking – and in particular on Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN), which marks the new era in space <b>communications,</b> <b>unifies</b> space and earth communication infrastructures and delivers a set of tools and protocols for space-data exploitation. The project includes the definition of limitations im-posed by typical space mission scenarios in which the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) is currently involved, including space exploration, planetary ex-ploration and Earth observation missions. In this paper, we present the mission scenarios and the associated major SDR expected impact from the proposed space-data router enhancements...|$|R
40|$|The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) {{is cited}} as the latest means for making {{manufacturing}} more flexible, cost effective, and responsive to changes in customer demands.

50|$|The current {{invocation}} of the Selsius legacy is Cisco <b>Unified</b> <b>Communications</b> Manager and the IP phones which still use (among other protocols) the original protocol created by Selsius engineers to facilitate voice over IP, the Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP). Analog gateways, which used the Skinny Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP), {{have since been}} end-of-lifed by Cisco. Cisco <b>Unified</b> <b>Communications</b> Manager is the call processing component of the Cisco <b>Unified</b> <b>Communications</b> System.

40|$|Companies rely on {{corporate}} visual identity (CVI), {{a collection of}} visual elements, to <b>unify</b> their <b>communications</b> and suggest a corporate persona. Start-up companies must quickly capture the attention of their audience and create ethos if they hope to be successful. Yet {{little is known about}} how start-ups create their CVI and use it for professional communication. Although the issues behind CVI—audience, ethos, visual rhetoric, and persuasion—are all very rhetorical, the topic has not yet received much attention in rhetoric or professional communication. Most of the existing research in marketing and graphic design focuses on large, well-known organizations with visual identities created by professional designers. Using a theoretical framework based upon ethos, social construction, and visual rhetoric, this qualitative research study examines how start-up businesses develop CVI and use it to establish corporate ethos. Using document analysis and interviews with graphic designers, marketing specialists, and entrepreneurs from the Midwest, this study suggests that entrepreneurs recognize the informational and persuasive purposes of CVI but that they are not always able to implement the CVI consistently. The development and implementation of their CVIs indicated several common constraints: using personal experience and intuition rather than audience analysis, a lack of experience in design, limited technical skill and access to appropriate software, and reliance upon friends and family for assistance. The visual techniques used in their promotional documents suggest that the start-ups want to attract readers 2 ̆ 7 attention and project a sense of order in their documents. Unfortunately, some of the designs are self-defeating because they present too much information, lack focal points and whitespace, and display cautious, structured layouts rather than spontaneous, unexpected ones. These results demand a renewed emphasis on visual rhetoric in professional communication classrooms, including instruction in both theory and execution via technology. Visual elements are more than illustration: they communicate messages that can explain, reinforce, or even contradict the documents that contain them. By studying visual rhetoric in the workplace, particularly cases in the margins like start-up businesses, we can refine our understanding of its use by writers and its impact on readers...|$|R
40|$|Emergence {{of the new}} {{technological}} trends such as Open Platform <b>Communications</b> <b>Unified</b> Architecture (OPC UA), Industrial Ethernet, {{cloud computing}} and the 5 th wireless network (5 G) enabled the implementation of Cyber-physical System (CPS) with flexible, configurable, scalable and interoperable business models. This provides new opportunities for the process automation systems. On the other hand, the constant urge of industries for cost and material efficient processes demands a new automation paradigm with the latest tools and technologies which {{should be taken into}} account while teaching future automation engineers. In this thesis, the modern teaching environment for process automation is designed, implemented and described. This work explains the connections, configurations and the test of three mini plants including the Multiple Heat Exchanger, the Three-tank system and the Mixing Tank. In addition, OPC UA communication between the server and its clients has been tested.

40|$|Open Platform <b>Communications</b> <b>Unified</b> Architecture (OPC UA) is a Machine to Machine (M 2 M) {{communication}} standard, first {{released in}} 2008 as {{the evolution of}} OPC, created for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Internet of Things (IoT) programming. It was designed to create an abstract model on which any information exchange in form of structured data can be implemented. Industry and state actors use it to control factories and plants thus putting OPC UA dependent software in a critical security position. In December 2015, the German Federal Office for Information Security proved that an official reference implementation of OPC UA contained security flaws in the code that could compromise, if exploited, industrial machineries and other dependent systems. Cyber attacks in ICS may be extremely expensive because of the critical processes which they aim to stop. This thesis proposes a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based solution to monitor malicious computer attacks on OPC UA. This work develops a plug-in for the dynamic Bro NIDS to support OPC UA based protocols, therefore it creates an Application Programming Interface (API) {{that can be used}} to write Turing complete security policies in the Bro language. Furthermore, policy scripts have been implemented to detect the exploitation of flaws and standard inconsistencies found in the analysis. In addition, the parser is also able to detect malformed packets, also sources of attacks in general. The result has been tested and evaluated in efficiency, security and standard coverage terms. The aim of this project is to suggest the use of an additional tool that might be used by Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) to investigate any attack and in order to safeguard OPC UA dependent machines...|$|R
