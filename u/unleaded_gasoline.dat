5|$|The Swedish-made Koenigsegg CCXR, {{a limited}} edition and {{version of the}} CCX, is {{currently}} the fastest and most powerful flexible fuel vehicle with its twin-supercharged V8 producing 1018hp when running on biofuel, as compared to 806hp on 91 octane US <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E

5|$|The E85 blend {{is used in}} {{gasoline}} engines modified to accept such higher concentrations of ethanol, and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount of ethanol in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{octane rating}} of typical commercially {{available}} gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON {{is the standard}} for regular <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option. In the UK, ordinary regular <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> is 95 RON (commonly available), premium <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> is always 97 RON, and super unleaded is usually 97–98 RON. However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain Tesco began to sell super <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> rated at 99 RON. In the US, octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91–92 RON) for regular, through 89–90 AKI (94–95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90–94 AKI (95–99 RON) for premium (European premium).|$|E
25|$|Legislation {{requires}} {{retailers to}} label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser, and limits ethanol use to 10% of gasoline in Australia. Such gasoline is commonly called E10 by major brands, {{and it is}} cheaper than regular <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{very rare}} option was the 455 HO engine, {{essentially}} {{similar to that}} used in the Trans Am. It was rated at [...] at 4,000rpm and [...] at 3,200rpm, also in the new SAE net figures. Despite its modest 8.4:1 compression, it was as strong as many earlier engines with higher gross power ratings; yet like all other 1972-model engines, it could perform on low-octane regular leaded, low-lead or <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasolines.</b> Only 646 cars with this engine were sold.|$|R
25|$|A revised grille {{with fewer}} {{vertical}} bars and revised taillight lenses marked the 1975 Grand Prix. Changes included {{the addition of}} GM's High Energy electronic ignition and a catalytic converter that mandated the use of <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Radial tires became standard on all models.|$|E
25|$|Engine offerings again {{included}} 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s {{ranging from}} 250 to 340 gross horsepower, {{all of which}} featured lowered compression ratios beginning in 1971 to enable use of lower octane regular leaded 91 RON octane, low-lead or <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Vented power front disc brakes and variable-ratio power steering were now standard equipment on all 88 models. During the 1971 model year the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission {{was added to the}} standard equipment list.|$|E
25|$|Compared with {{conventional}} <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> ethanol is a particulate-free burning fuel source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and aldehydes. The Clean Air Act requires {{the addition of}} oxygenates to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the United States. The additive MTBE is currently being phased out due to ground water contamination, hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive. Current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient fertilizers such as ammonia.|$|E

25|$|While still {{considered}} one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air pollution problems are not as bad as they were several decades ago. One major problem that was brought under control was the lead contamination in the air with the introduction of <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and fine particles (soot) (between 2.5micrometers and 10micrometers). Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of fine particles of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the World Health Organization.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{insurance}} and fuel costs for owners coupled with looming Federal emissions and safety regulations would eventually {{put an end}} to the unrestricted, powerful engines of the 1960s. Safety, luxury and economy would become the new watch-words of this decade. Engine performance began declining in 1971 when GM issued a corporate edict mandating that all engines be capable of using lower-octane <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> which led to dramatic drops in compression ratios, along with performance and fuel economy. This, coupled with trying to build cars as plush as GM's more luxurious Buicks and Oldsmobiles, contributed to the start of a slow decline of Pontiac in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The upscale LeSabre Luxus {{designation}} {{was dropped}} {{and replaced by}} the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was {{the first year of}} the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM's Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.|$|E

25|$|Technical {{changes for}} 1975 {{included}} {{the addition of}} a catalytic converter and electronic ignition to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later emission requirements, but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and driveability which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems and mandated the use of <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.|$|E
25|$|For E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), {{the effect}} is small (~3%) when {{compared}} to conventional gasoline, and even smaller (1–2%) when compared to oxygenated and reformulated blends. For E85 (85% ethanol), the effect becomes significant. E85 produces lower mileage than gasoline, and requires more frequent refueling. Actual performance may {{vary depending on the}} vehicle. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles resulted 25.56% lower than <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b> The EPA-rated mileage of current United States flex-fuel vehicles should be considered when making price comparisons, but E85 is a high performance fuel, with an octane rating of about 94–96, and should be compared to premium.|$|E
25|$|Because ethanol {{contains}} {{close to}} 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs {{have a lower}} mileage per gallon than gasoline.
