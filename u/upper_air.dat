5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to fit a number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E
5|$|A weather ship, or Ocean Station Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E

The new office {{would be part of}} a modernization plan that relocate all operation to Lincoln and close the Peoria and Springfield offices. In 1994 the new Lincoln office was officially accepted by the federal government but did not have any operational responsibilities to begin with. The following year the <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> equipment from the National Weather Service Paducah was moved to the new Lincoln location, the only function the new office had at the time was to take observations using this equipment. In the spring of 1995 construction began {{on a new}} WSR-88D radar system in Lincoln. The first five meteorologists reported to the Lincoln location, but forecasting responsibilities remained at the Peoria and Springfield offices. By September 1995 the Lincoln office began full-time operations sand picks up the counties from the Peoria and Springfield offices as well as a few from the Saint Louis and Evansville offices. On October 1, 1995 the National Weather Service offices in Peoria and Springfield were officially closed after serving Central Illinois since the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E

40|$|Current {{understanding}} of a double vortex thunderstorm involves a pair of contra-rotating vortices {{that exists in the}} dynamic updraft. The pair is believed to be a result of a blocking effect which occurs when a cylindrical thermal updraft of a thunderstorm protrudes into the <b>upper</b> level <b>air</b> and there is a large amount of vertical wind shear between the low level and <b>upper</b> level <b>air</b> layers. A numerical tornado prediction scheme based on the double vortex thunderstorm was developed. The Energy-Shear Index (ESI) is part of the scheme and is calculated from radiosonde measurements.

The {{relationship}} among NOy, 03, N 20, ultra-fine condensation uclei (CN), and other trace {{gases in the}} upper troposphere (UT) and lower stratosphere (LS) observed during SONEX are analyzed with the goal to identify and quantify the sources of NOy in the UT. We use N 20 to separate <b>upper</b> tropospheric <b>air</b> from stratospheric influenced air and focus our analysis to the former. The distributions of NOy and 03 show remarkable similarity when they are plotted {{as a function of}} N 20. The only difference between NOy and O 3 is found in <b>upper</b> tropospheric <b>air</b> where a large number of data points have high values of both NOy and the NOy/O 3 ratio. Major sources contributing to these high NOy values are found to be emissions from lightning and surface sources transported to the UT by convection...|$|R
500|$|Polar front {{theory was}} {{developed}} by Jacob Bjerknes, derived from a dense network of observation sites in Scandinavia during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead of the low and another trailing behind the low.

500|$|The flying of {{fighter planes}} between North America, Greenland, and Iceland {{led to the}} {{deployment}} of two more weather ships in 1943 and 1944. Great Britain established {{one of their own}} [...] off their west coast. By May 1945, frigates were used across the Pacific for similar operations. Weather Bureau personnel stationed on weather ships were asked voluntarily to accept the assignment. In addition to surface weather observations, the weather ships would launch radiosondes and release pilot balloons, or PIBALs, to determine weather conditions aloft. However, after the war ended, the ships were withdrawn from service, which led to a loss of <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> weather observations over the oceans.

500|$|The use of frontal zones on weather maps {{began in}} the 1910s in Norway.

500|$|During March 11, 1997, {{a shallow}} {{tropical}} depression developed within the monsoon trough near the Fijian Dependency: Rotuma. Over {{the next two}} days the depression remained near Rotuma with no preferred movement, as it started to develop further in an area of minimal vertical wind shear and good <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> divergence. During March 13, as the system moved northwards, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 33P. During that day after having moved to the north, Hina curved to the east and later south-eastwards, before it passed about [...] to the southeast of Niulakita the southernmost island of Tuvalu during March 14. Early on March 15, after the system had passed near Niulakita, the depression developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and was named Hina by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS). After being named the system accelerated towards the south-southeast and an area of increasing vertical wind shear, as it passed near the west coast of Futuna Island. The system also crossed the 180th meridian during that day, which prompted the JTWC to pass the responsibility for warning the United States Government to the Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC).|$|E
500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of an ocean weather vessel was to take surface and <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> weather measurements, and report them via radio at the {{synoptic}} hours of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Weather ships also reported observations from merchant vessels, which were reported by radio back to {{their country of origin}} using a code based on the [...] square in the ocean within which the ship was located. The vessels were involved in search and rescue operations involving aircraft and other ships. The vessels themselves had search radar and could activate a homing beacon to guide lost aircraft towards the ships' known locations. Each ship's homing beacon used a distinctly different frequency. [...] In addition, the ships provided a platform where scientific and oceanographic research could be conducted. The role of aircraft support gradually changed after 1975, as jet aircraft began using polar routes. [...] By 1982, the ocean weather vessel role had changed too, and the ships were used to support short range weather forecasting, in numerical weather prediction computer programs which forecast weather conditions several days ahead, for climatological studies, marine forecasting, and oceanography, as well as monitoring pollution out at sea. At the same time, the transmission of the weather data using Morse code was replaced by a system using telex-over-radio.|$|E
500|$|Mythographers have {{discussed}} Orion {{at least since}} the Renaissance of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death {{at the hands of the}} moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms. The 16th-century Italian mythographer Natalis Comes interpreted the whole story of Orion as an allegory of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from χέω, [...] "pour out"), rises though the <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> (Aërope, as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: [...] "Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water." [...] Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the philosophical child, an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist Michael Maier lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury, and the 18th-century French alchemist Antoine-Joseph Pernety gave them as Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury.|$|E
