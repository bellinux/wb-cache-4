The {{systematic}} {{meta-analysis of}} randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated {{the effects of}} intraoperative <b>ulinastatin</b> on early-postoperative recovery in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods. RCTs comparing intraoperative <b>ulinastatin</b> with placebo in cardiac surgery were searched through PubMed, Cochrane databases, Medline, SinoMed, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1966 to May 20 th, 2013). The primary endpoints included hospital mortality, postoperative complication rate, length of stay in intensive care unit, and extubation time. The physiological and biochemical parameters illustrating postoperative cardiac and pulmonary function as well as inflammation response were considered as secondary endpoints. Results. Fifteen RCTs (509 patients) met the inclusion criteria. <b>Ulinastatin</b> did not affect hospital mortality, postoperative complication rate, or ICU length of stay but reduced extubation time. <b>Ulinastatin</b> also increased the oxygenation index on postoperative day 1 and reduced the plasma level of cardiac troponin-I.

In addition, the underlying mechanisms of <b>ulinastatin</b> were investigated on a rat autologous OLT (AOLT) model. In total, 60 patients undergoing an OLT were randomly selected to receive ulina-statin (U group; n= 30) or saline (C group; n= 30) during the OLT surgery. The patient demographics, AKI incidence rate, recovery indicators and renal injury indexes were measured during the perioperative period. In addition to the clinical trials, 40 rats were subjected to an AOLT and were divided into the control (C-R), sham-operation and <b>ulinastatin</b> treatment groups. Pathological renal damage, biomarkers of inflam-mation and oxidative stress were measured to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of <b>ulinastatin</b> on AKI. In the clinical trials, <b>ulinastatin</b> application was shown to attenuate the incidence of AKI following OLT (P< 0. 05) and reduce the serum levels of cystatin C and urinary β 2 microglobulin within 24 h of the OLT (P< 0. 05).

We aim to evaluate the effects of <b>Ulinastatin</b> on inflammation, oxidation, and neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 76 adult male Wistar rats for 6 min, after which cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated. After spontaneous circulation returned, the rats were split into two groups: the <b>Ulinastatin</b> 100, 000 unit/kg group or the PBS-treated control group. Blood and cerebral cortex samples were obtained and compared at 2, 4, and 8 h after return of spontaneous circulation. The protein levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&# 945;) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) were assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA levels were quantified via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Myeloperoxidase and Malondialdehyde were measured by spectrophotometry. The translocation of nuclear factor-&# 954;B p 65 was assayed by Western blot. The viable and apoptotic neurons were detected by Nissl and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: <b>Ulinastatin</b> treatment decreased plasma levels of TNF-&# 945; and IL- 6, expression of mRNA, and Myeloperoxidase and Malondialdehyde in the cerebral cortex.

To induce transient global ischemia in gerbils, the common carotid arteries were occluded using aneurysm clips for 5 min, and the clips were then removed. <b>Ulinastatin</b> was subcutaneously injected into the gerbils once a day for 7 days at doses of 50, 000 or 100, 000 U/kg. The gerbils were confronted with a step‑down avoidance task, following which tissue samples from the gerbils were examined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase‑mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, western blot analysis for B‑cell lymphoma (Bcl‑ 2) and Bcl‑ 2 ‑associated X protein (Bax), immu-nohistochemistry for caspase‑ 3 and immunofluorescence for 5 ‑bromo‑ 2 '‑deoxyuridine. The numbers of TUNEL‑positive and caspase‑ 3 ‑positive cells in the hippocampal CA 1 region increased following cerebral ischemia. The expression of Bax in the hippocampus increased, while the expression of Bcl‑ 2 in the hippocampus decreased following cerebral ischemia. These results confirmed that apoptosis in the hippocampus was enhanced following cerebral ischemia in gerbils. The levels of cell proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were also enhanced by ischemia, which is possibly an adaptive mechanism to compensate for excessive levels of apoptosis. <b>Ulinastatin</b> treatment inhibited ischemia‑induced apoptosis by suppressing apoptosis‑associated molecules, and thus amelio-rated ischemia‑induced short‑term memory impairment. The cell proliferation in the hippocampus was also suppressed following <b>ulinastatin</b> treatment.

40|$|Background/Aims: Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{a common}} complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Only a few pharmacologic agents {{have been shown to}} have potential efficacy for the prophylactic treatment of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether prophylactic gabexate and <b>ulinastatin</b> can decrease the incidence of PEP. Methods: From January 2005 to April 2010, 1, 679 patients undergoing ERCP treatment were consecutively enrolled in the study. After selective exclusion, a total of 1, 480 patients were included in the analysis. The patients were separated into 3 groups according to the prophylactic administration of gabexate (593 patients), <b>ulinastatin</b> (229 patients), or saline solution (658 patients) and analyzed retrospectively. The primary outcome measurements were the incidence of pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia. Results: PEP occurred in 21 of the 593 (3. 5 %) patients who received gabexate, 16 of the 229 (7. 0 %) patients who received <b>ulinastatin,</b> and 48 of the 658 (7. 3 %) patients who received a saline solution. The incidence of PEP was significantly different between the gabexate and <b>ulinastatin</b> or saline solution groups (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Gabexate prophylaxis is effective in preventing PEP. However, there is no difference in the beneficial effects of the prophylactic administration of <b>ulinastatin</b> and a saline solution. (Gu...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical effect of <b>ulinastatin</b> in preventing pancreatitis after {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). MethodsThe Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang Data were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on <b>ulinastatin</b> {{for the prevention of}} post-ERCP pancreatitis published from 1970 to June 2016. Two researchers selected RCTs, extracted data, and evaluated methodological quality independently, and RevMan 5. 3 software was used for the meta-analysis. The chi-square test was used for the heterogeneity analysis of RCTs included, and the funnel plots were used to evaluate publication bias. ResultsA total of six RCTs with 923 patients were included in this analysis. Compared with the placebo, <b>ulinastatin</b> had significantly better effects in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis (OR= 0. 26, 95 %CI: 0. 13 - 0. 53, P= 0. 000 2), hyperamylasemia (OR= 0. 47, 95 %CI: 0. 33 - 0. 67, P＜ 0. 001), and abdominal pain (OR= 0. 56, 95 %CI: 0. 34 - 0. 91, P= 0. 020). Compared with gabexate, <b>ulinastatin</b> had similar effects in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia, and abdominal pain (P= 0. 52, 0. 13, and 0. 79); low-dose <b>ulinastatin</b> also had similar effects as gabexate in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia (P= 0. 49 and 0  25). The funnel plots based on the effect of <b>ulinastatin</b> in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis were slightly asymmetric, which suggested the presence of publication bias. ConclusionUlinastatin (≥ 15 × 104 U) can effectively prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis, hyperlipidemia, and abdominal pain in the general population and it is recommended to start using this drug before surgery...|$|E

40|$|Pancreatitis {{remains the}} most common and {{potentially}} fatal complication following ERCP. Various pharmacological agents have been used in an attempt to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis, but most randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate their efficacy. Antiproteases, which have been clinically used to manage acute pancreatitis, would theoretically reduce pancreatic injury after ERCP because activation of proteolytic enzymes is considered {{to play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Gabexate and <b>ulinastatin</b> have recently been evaluated regarding their efficacy in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Long-term (12 hours) infusion of gabexate significantly decreased the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis; however, no prophylactic effect was observed for short-term infusion (2. 5 and 6. 5 hours). These results may be due to the short-life of gabexate (55 seconds). Since long-term infusion requires additional hospitalization, the use of gabexate in all patients at average risk of developing post-ERCP pancreatitis is an expensive strategy. <b>Ulinastatin</b> has a half-life of 35 minutes and can be given as a bolus infusion. Short-term (10 minutes) administration of <b>ulinastatin</b> showed a significant reduction in the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis in one randomized controlled trial. <b>Ulinastatin</b> is superior to gabexate in terms of cost because it does not require additional hospitalization. At present, there is no other randomized, placebo-controlled trial on <b>ulinastatin</b> under way. Large scale randomized controlled trials revealed that both the long-term infusion of gabexate and the short-term administration of <b>ulinastatin</b> may reduce pancreatic injury, but these studies involve patients at average risk of developing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Additional research is needed to confirm the preventive efficacy of these antiproteases in patients at a high risk of developing post-ERCP pancreatitis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of <b>ulinastatin</b> on {{vasoactive}} substances, oxidative stress and inflammatory response in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD. Methods: Patients with acute exacerbation of COPD who were treated in Chengdu Fifth People’s Hospital between August 2013 and July 2016 were selected as the research subjects and randomly divided into <b>ulinastatin</b> group and normal control group who received <b>ulinastatin</b> combined with conventional therapy and conventional therapy respectively. The serum contents of vasoactive substances, stress response hormones, oxidative stress products and inflammatory response mediators were detected before treatment and 7 d after treatment. Results: 7 d after treatment, serum D-D, AT-II, pro-BNP, ACTH, FC, NE, MDA, 8 -iso-PG, HSP 27, HSP 70, PCT, CRP, CCL 18 and MSP contents of both groups of patients were significantly lower than those before treatment while TT 3 and TT 4 contents {{were significantly higher than}} those before treatment; serum D-D, AT-II, pro-BNP, ACTH, FC, NE, MDA, 8 -iso-PG, HSP 27, HSP 70, PCT, CRP, CCL 18 and MSP contents of <b>ulinastatin</b> group 7 d after treatment were significantly lower than those of normal control group while TT 3 and TT 4 contents were significantly higher than those of normal control group.

40|$|Kawasaki {{disease is}} an in¯ammatory disease of unknown cause that causes panvasculitis, {{including}} coronary arteritis. Polymorphonucleocytosis {{in the early}} stage of the illness suggests the implication of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of the disease. In the acute phase of Ka-wasaki disease, mRNA expression of prostaglandin H 2 synthase (PHS) ± 2, as determined by reverse transcription±polymerase chain reaction, was markedly enhanced, and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) ±synthesizing activity was increased in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). This up-regulation of PHS- 2 was suppressed by <b>ulinastatin</b> (a neutrophil-elastase inhibitor) treatment. Lipopolysaccharide-induced enhancement of PHS- 2 mRNA was also inhibited by therapeutic doses of <b>ulinastatin</b> in vitro by use of PMNL from healthy volunteers. Thus, <b>ulinastatin</b> inhibits arachidonate PHS metabolism by inhibiting new induction of PHS- 2 at the mRNA level, which is a novel pharmacologic action of this substance. <b>Ulinastatin</b> treat-ment is possibly an additional therapeutic approach to Kawasaki disease.
