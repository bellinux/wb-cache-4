40|$|In {{the course}} of trade-policy reforms, {{countries}} must confront at least two important questions with respect to tariffs. First, what is the optimal structure of tariffs? In particular, is it optimal to tax all imports at a uniform rate? Second, should intermediate inputs be subject to import duties and if so is there a role for duty drawbacks on exports? This paper seeks to answer these important questions based on intuitive arguments, supported by literature and simple diagrams. The author argues that the introduction of tariffs on intermediate inputs complemented by duty drawbacks is welfare-improving. He further argues that if {{the objective is to}} protect the import-competing sector, <b>uniform</b> <b>tariffs</b> will minimize the distortion in production but not in consumption. If the objective is revenue, <b>uniform</b> <b>tariffs</b> will in general fail to minimize distortion in either production or consumption. The existence of smuggling, imperfect competition, and economies of scale weaken the case for <b>uniform</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The principal justification for <b>uniform</b> <b>tariffs</b> is their transparency, administrative simplicity, and relatively low level of unproductive profit-seeking activities. The author concludes that considerations of efficiency conflict with considerations of political economy. Ultimately the issue calls for more systematic empirical study.

In 1934, the U.S. Congress, in a rare delegation of authority, passed the Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934, which authorized the executive branch to negotiate bilateral tariff reduction agreements with other countries.

Between 1934 and 1945, the executive branch negotiated over 32 bilateral trade liberalization agreements with other countries.

The key point is that higher tariffs can encourage agglomeration of intermediate input suppliers and final goods producers in one country. With high tariffs on intermediate inputs, the benefits of close proximity to final goods producers may outweigh the benefits of locating according to comparative advantage, which is more likely when the share of intermediate inputs in producing final goods is high.

The new ERP permits a political economic ranking of across sectors, since higher <b>uniform</b> <b>tariff</b> equivalents imply higher losses of welfare sacrificed to interest groups.
