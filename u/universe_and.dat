5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the <b>Universe</b> <b>and</b> its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions.

5|$|Electrons {{are thought}} {{to exist in the}} Universe since early stages of the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei forms in {{nucleosynthesis}} reactions.

5|$|Adams {{considered}} {{writing a}} third radio series {{to be based}} on his novel Life, the <b>Universe</b> <b>and</b> Everything in 1993, but the project did not begin until after his death in 2001. Dirk Maggs, with whom Adams had discussed the new series, directed and co-produced the radio adaptation as well as adaptations of the remaining Hitchhiker's Guide novels So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish and Mostly Harmless. These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series, transmitted in 2004 and 2005.|$|E

40|$|We present Plastic, an {{implementation}} of LF with Coercive Subtyping, {{and focus on}} its {{implementation of}} Universes. LF is a variant of Martin-Löf''s logical framework, with explicitly typed -abstractions. We outline the system of LF with its extensions of inductive types and coercions. Plastic is the first implementation of this extended system; we discuss motivations and basic architecture and give examples of its use. LF is used to specify type theories. The theory UTT includes a hierarchy of universes that is specified in Tarski style. We outline the theory of these <b>universes</b> <b>and</b> explain how they are implemented in Plastic. Of particular interest {{is the relationship between}} <b>universes</b> <b>and</b> inductive types, and the relationship between <b>universes</b> <b>and</b> coercive subtyping. We claim that the combination of Tarski-style universes together with coercive subtyping provides an ideal formulation of universes that is both semantically clear and practical to use...|$|R

5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the <b>universe,</b> <b>and</b> it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
