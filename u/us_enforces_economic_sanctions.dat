The use of <b>economic</b> <b>sanction,</b> {{as opposed to the}} use of military power, to punish target countries have been supported by the Charter of United Nations (UN). Tsebelis (1990) modelled <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> using game theory and found that any attempt to increase the severity of the sanctions was counterintuitive, namely the policy reduced the likelihood of sender country(s) in <b>enforcing</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanction,</b> however, it did not change the probability of the target country(s) in violating international agreement/law. This paper focuses on the refinement of the sanction game proposed by Tsebelis (1990) to analyse international relations.

In contrast to Tsebelisâ€™(1990) findings, any attempt to increase the severity of <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> may reduce the probability of the target country(s) in violating international agreement/law.

There she spent 6 weeks in an Assisted Maintenance Period (AMP) before heading for the South China Sea to conduct the first live firings of the Sea Slug Mk2 area protection anti-aircraft missile. The ship had been refitted in Portsmouth to accommodate a larger war-load of missiles and this work was completed in Singapore where she took on live missiles. The trials were successful against US targets from bases in the Philippines. After this she went to Hong Kong and Kobe in Japan for Expo 70, before heading to Pearl Harbor on Hawaii and then on to Long Beach in California and Acapulco in Mexico and via the Panama Canal to Puerto Rico and on to the Mediterranean. She visited Toulon and spent time in Malta and Gibraltar before returning to the UK. Whilst in Hawaii, the Royal Navy abolished the rum issue.

40|$|The {{ethics of}} <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> {{is an issue}} that has been curiously {{neglected}} by philosophers and political theorists. Only a handful of philosophical journal articles and book chapters have ever been published on the subject; yet <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> as I will show, are significantly morally problematic and their use stands in need of moral justification. The aim of this thesis then is to consider how <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> might be morally justified. Of the few writers who have considered this issue, the majority point to the analogies between <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> and war and use the just war principles (just cause, proportionality etc.) as a framework within which to assess their moral permissibility. I argue that this is a mistake. The just war principles are derived from a set of complex and detailed arguments all planted firmly within the context of war. These arguments contain premises that, whilst they may hold true in the case of war, do not always hold true in the case of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Nevertheless, the rich just war tradition does offer a valuable starting point for theorising about <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> and in the thesis I consider how the wider just war tradition might be brought to bear on the case of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> beginning, not with the just war principles, but with the underlying arguments for those principles. In particular, I consider whether <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified {{on the grounds that they}} are a form of self- or other-defence, that they are the â€˜lesser evilâ€™ and that they are a form of punishment. I argue that certain types of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified on the grounds that they are a form of self- or other- defence and that, in extreme circumstances, certain types of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified as the â€˜lesser evilâ€™. However, I argue that <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> cannot be justified on the grounds of punishment. I also develop a â€˜clean handsâ€™ argument for <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> that is unavailable to the just war theorist; I argue that where the goods and services to be supplied would contribute to human rights violations or other wrongful acts, there is a duty to impose <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> to avoid complicity in this wrongdoing...|$|R
