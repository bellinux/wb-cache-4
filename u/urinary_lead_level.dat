40|$|Objectives: Existing {{naturally}} in the earth’s crust, Lead {{is a widely}} used heavy metal. It is an environment toxicant that may deleteriously affect nervous, hematopoietic, skeletal, renal, endocrine and reproductive systems. Lead is classified in its inorganic form as possible human carcinogen (group 2 A) by IARC. Exposure to lead in the environment {{continues to be a}} serious public health problem for all ages. Children are particularly susceptible to lead poisoning. They absorb more lead from their environment and their developing central nervous systems are vulnerable to the toxicant. During the last twenty years, important measures of public health were undertaken in several countries to decrease lead exposure. In the best of our knowledge, {{this is not the case}} in D. R. Congo. A study indicated a relatively important lead impregnation of the Kinshasa population (mean 120 μg/L). However, there have been no reported studies in the evaluation of the relationship between <b>urinary</b> <b>lead,</b> <b>urinary</b> δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-AlaU) and <b>urinary</b> porphyrins and <b>lead</b> blood <b>level</b> in Congolese people. This is the aim of this study targeting at first people living in Kinshasa. Methods: Blood <b>lead</b> and <b>urinary</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The Bio-Rad ALA/PBG by Column Test and spectrophotometer method were used to quantify the concentration of δ-Ala in urine. The separation of porphyrins was carried out by HPLC coupled with fluorescence detector. Results: 37 % of studied population presented blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> above the 100 μg/L threshold (geometric mean: 133. 29 μg/L) with a higher concentration in women than in men (140. 30 μg/L vs 130. 78 μg/L). 50 % of children (0 - 17 years) presented blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> above the 100 μg/L threshold and 43 % of the same population presented blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> above 50 μg/L as accepted nowadays in US. In the adult population, some targeted occupations were found to be associated with high blood lead. A small correlation was observed between <b>urinary</b> <b>lead</b> and blood lead, but no correlation was noticed between δ-AlaU and Porphyrins with <b>lead</b> blood <b>levels.</b> Conclusion: This study confirmed a relatively important Pb impregnation of the Kinshasa population and the existence of a major public health issue requiring corrective actions and the implementation of an appropriate regulation.

The tests used were haemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and blood <b>lead,</b> and <b>urinary</b> <b>lead,</b> coproporphyrin, 8 -aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), and porphobilinogen (PBG) estimations. Of these, the <b>urinary</b> <b>lead</b> was similar for all three groups and the blood lead estimation was of less value for determining the clinical group of the men than the haemoglobin and urinary coproporphyrin or ALA estimations, which correlated well with the clinical assessment and with each other but showed no correlation with the <b>urinary</b> and blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels.</b> PBG levels became raised only with the onset ofsymptoms oflead poisoning.

The primary goals of the analysis were to examine blood lead, tibia lead, and DMSA-chelatable <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> by ALAD and VDR genotypes, controlling for covariates; and to evaluate whether ALAD and VDR genotype modified relations among the different lead biomarkers. There was {{a wide range of}} blood lead (4 - 86 microg/dL), tibia lead (- 7 - 338 microg Pb/g bone mineral), and DMSA-chelatable lead (4. 8 - 2, 103 microg) <b>levels</b> among <b>lead</b> workers. Among lead workers, 9. 9 % (n = 79) were heterozygous for the ALAD(2) allele and there were no homozygotes. For VDR, 10. 7 % (n = 85) had the Bb genotype, and 0. 5 % (n = 4) had the BB genotype. Although the ALAD and VDR genes are located on different chromosomes, lead workers homozygous for the ALAD(1) allele were much less likely to have the VDR bb genotype (crude odds ratio = 0. 29, 95 % exact confidence interval = 0. 06 - 0. 91).

The skeleton is the major endogenous source of lead in circulating blood, particularly under conditions of accelerated bone turnover and mineral loss, such as during pregnancy and in postmenopausal osteoporosis. We studied the influence of bone resorption rate on the release of lead from bone in 333 men, predominantly white, middle-aged and elderly (mostly retired) from the Boston area. We evaluated bone resorption by measuring cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx) in 24 -hr urine samples with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We used K-X-ray fluorescence to measure lead content in cortical (tibia) and trabecular (patella) bone; we used graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy to measure lead in blood and urine, respectively. After adjustment for age and creatinine clearance, the positive relation of patella <b>lead</b> to <b>urinary</b> <b>lead</b> was stronger among subjects in the upper two NTx tertiles (beta for patella lead > or = 0. 015) than in the lowest NTx tertile (beta for patella lead = 0. 008; overall p-value for interactions = 0. 06).

This study of 167 children identified that eight children (4. 8 per cent of those in the study group) had blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> greater than or equal to 10 µg/dl. Of these, one had a blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> greater than 20 µg/dl. Statistical analyses revealed a significant decline between this survey and the 2007 survey in both the geometric mean blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and the percentage of children’s blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> at or above 10 micrograms per decilitre (µg/dl). While care should be taken in interpreting such declines, the results do however indicate a step in the right direction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Anemia is {{a health}} problem among infants and children. It is often {{associated}} with a decrease in some trace elements (iron, zinc, copper) and an increase in heavy metals as lead. This study was done to determine the association of blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> > 10 μg/dl, with the increased risk to anemia, also, to investigate the relationship between anemia and changes in blood iron, zinc and copper <b>levels,</b> and measure <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> in drinking water. The study is a cross-sectional performed on 60 children. Venous blood samples were taken from the studied population for estimating hematological parameters as well as iron and ferritin levels. The concentrations of zinc, copper, and lead were measured. The studied population was divided into anemic and non-anemic (control) groups. The anemic group was further classified into mild, moderate and severe anemia. The study subjects were also categorized into low and high blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> groups. Findings Approximately 63. 33 % of children had blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> ≥ 10 μg/dl. At the blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> range of 10 - 20 μg/dl, a significant association was found for mild and severe anemia. The blood level of iron and ferritin was found to be significantly lower in high blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and anemic groups than those of the low blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and control groups. <b>Lead</b> <b>level</b> in drinking water was higher than the permissible limit. Conclusion <b>Lead</b> <b>level</b> ≥ 10 μg/dl was significantly associated with anemia, decreased iron absorption and hematological parameters affection. High blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with low serum iron and ferritin. <b>Lead</b> <b>level</b> in drinking water was found to be higher than the permissible limits. </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{literature}} review of academic studies on Chinese children's blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> {{found that the}} <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> declined when comparing the studies published during 1995-2003 and 2004-2007 periods. <b>Lead</b> <b>levels</b> also showed a declining trend after China banned lead in gasoline in 2000. <b>Lead</b> <b>levels</b> were still higher than those in developed nations.

5000|$|Blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> (BLL), is {{a measure}} of lead in the blood. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed its view on blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in 2012 because of [...] "a growing body of studies {{concluding}} that blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> (BLLs) lower than 10 μg/dL harm children" [...] with [...] "irreversible" [...] effects, and [...] "since no safe blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> in children has been identified, a blood lead 'level of concern' cannot be used to define individuals in need of intervention". The new policy is to aim to reduce average blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in US children to as low a level as possible.|$|R
500|$|In adults, {{symptoms}} {{can occur}} at levels above 40μg/dL, but {{are more likely}} to occur only above 50–60μg/dL. Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60μg/dL. However, the <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual. At blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> between 25 and 60μg/dL, neuropsychiatric effects such as delayed reaction times, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as slowed motor nerve conduction and headache can occur. Anemia may appear at blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> higher than 50μg/dL. In adults, abdominal colic, involving paroxysms of pain, may appear at blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> greater than 80μg/dL. Signs that occur in adults at blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> exceeding 100μg/dL include wrist drop and foot drop, [...] and signs of encephalopathy (a condition characterized by brain swelling), such as those that accompany increased pressure within the skull, delirium, coma, seizures, and headache. In children, signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior, discoordination, and apathy occur at <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> exceeding 70μg/dL. For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> exceed 100μg/dL.|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a cross-sectional epidemiologic study {{to assess the}} association between blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and hematocrit in 579 one to five year-old children living near a primary lead smelter in 1974. Blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> ranged from 0. 53 to 7. 91 mumol/L (11 to 164 micrograms/dl). To predict hematocrit {{as a function of}} blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and age, we derived non-linear regression models and fit percentile curves. We used logistic regression to predict the probability of hematocrit values less than 35 per cent. We found a strong non-linear, dose-response relationship between blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and hematocrit. This relationship was influenced by age, but (in this age group) not by sex; the effect was strongest in youngest children. In one year-olds, the age group most severely affected, the risk of an hematocrit value below 35 percent was 2 percent above background at blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> between 0. 97 and 1. 88 mumol/L (20 and 39 micrograms/dl), 18 percent above background at <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of 1. 93 to 2. 85 mumol/L (40 to 59 micrograms/dl), and 40 percent above background at <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of 2. 9 mumol/L (60 micrograms/dl) and greater; background was defined as a blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> below 1. 88 mumol/L (20 micrograms/dl). This effect appeared independent of iron deficiency. These findings suggest that blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> close to the currently recommended limit value of 1. 21 mumol/L (25 micrograms/dl) are associated with dose-related depression of hematocrit in young children...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{completed}} {{of more than}} 170, 000 records of pediatric venous blood levels and supporting demographic information collected in New York City during 1970 - 1976. The geometric mean (GM) blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> shows a consistent cyclical variation superimposed on an overall decreasing trend with time for all ages and ethnic groups studied. The GM blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> for blacks are significantly greater than those for either Hispanics or whites. Regression analysis indicates a significant statistical association between GM blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and ambient air <b>lead</b> <b>level,</b> after appropriate adjustments are made for age and ethnic group. These highly significant statistical relationships provide extremely strong incentives and directions for research into casual factors related to blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in children...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. We {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> (>/= 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood), risk factors, and previous blood lead testing among children in 2 high-risk Chicago, Ill, communities. Methods. Through high-intensity targeted screening, blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were tested and risks were assessed among {{a representative sample of}} children aged 1 to 5 years who were at risk for lead exposure. Results. Of the 539 children who were tested, 27 % had elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels,</b> and 61 % had never been tested previously. Elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with chipped exterior house paint. Conclusions. Most children who lived in these communities [...] where the prevalence for elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> among children was 12 times higher than the national prevalence [...] were not tested for lead poisoning. Our findings highlight the need for targeted community outreach that includes testing blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to compare blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of childbearing women near Addis Ababa-Adama highway with those who live far from it. Study Design. A comparative cross-sectional study design was used to compare blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of 40 childbearing women (study group) who lived relatively near Addis Ababa-Adama highway and other 36 childbearing women (comparative group) who lived relatively far (10 [*]km) from the highway. Methods. In the study, women having a fertile age within 15 – 49 years were considered as “childbearing women. ” Blood samples were collected from each group and analyzed for blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> comparison. Result. The study indicated significant blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> difference (p< 0. 001) between the groups. The study group had higher blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> (34. 32 ± 6. 39 [*]μg/dL) than the comparative group (8. 47 ± 3. 01 [*]μg/dL). The mean blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of both groups was higher than the advised blood lead concentration for a woman to avoid occupational or vocational lead exposure. Conclusion. This study concluded that blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of women who lived relatively near Addis Ababa-Adama highway was significantly higher than those who lived relatively far from the road...|$|R

40|$|Consumption of leaded {{gasoline}} in Iran cause to emit lead compounds in ambient air of gasoline stations {{and is known}} to effect on workers health in these locations. The objectives {{of this study were}} assessment of ambient <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of gasoline station workers in Hamadan city, Iran. For this purpose, 82 samples were obtained in ambient air of gasoline station locations. Serum samples from 44 workers and 44 unexposed people were collected to determine blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels.</b> Samples were analyzed with atomic absorption spectrometry. Blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in workers and control group were 30. 05 and 17. 31 µg/dl, respectively. The correlation coefficient between blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and ambient <b>lead</b> <b>level,</b> age as well as duration of employment were 0. 44, 0. 66 and 0. 81, correspondingly. The highest concentration of lead was recorded at the gasoline station in the city center. A high correlation between vehicle numbers in gasoline station locations and lead concentration was determined in the city center, but with a poor correlation in the suburb of the city. 48 % of exposed workers had blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> more than the biological exposure limit recommended by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygiene (ACGIH).

40|$|Lead {{pollution}} {{is a substantial}} problem in developing countries such as India. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has defined an elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> in children as ≥ 10 μg/dl, {{on the basis of}} neurologic toxicity. The US Environmental Protection Agency suggests a threshold <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of 20 - 40 μg/dl for risk of childhood anemia, but there is little information relating <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> < 40 μg/dl to anemia. Therefore, the authors examined the association between <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> as low as 10 μg/dl and anemia in Indian children under 3 years of age. Anemia was divided into categories of mild (hemoglobin level 10 - 10. 9 g/dl), moderate (hemoglobin level 8 - 9. 9 g/dl), and severe (hemoglobin level < 8 g/dl). <b>Lead</b> <b>levels</b> < 10 μg/dl were detected in 568 children (53 %), whereas 413 (38 %) had <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> ≥ 10 - 19. 9 μg/dl and 97 (9 %) had levels ≥ 20 μg/dl. After adjustment for child's age, duration of breastfeeding, standard of living, parent's education, father's occupation, maternal anemia, and number of children in the immediate family, children with <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> ≥ 10 μg/dl were 1. 3 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 0, 1. 7) times as likely to have moderate anemia as children with <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> < 10 μg/dl. Similarly, the odds ratio for severe anemia was 1. 7 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 1, 2. 6). Health agencies in India should note the association of elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> with anemia and make further efforts to curb lead pollution and childhood anemi...|$|R
