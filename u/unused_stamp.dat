50|$|Mint never-hinged (MNH or Mint NH, NH, u/m) is an <b>unused</b> <b>stamp</b> {{that has}} full {{original}} undisturbed gum with {{no trace of}} damage done by a stamp hinge. Stamps sell at a considerable premium {{if they are in}} this condition.|$|E

5000|$|Arthur de Rothschild (1851-1903, Belgium), {{collector}} of <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> issued between 1860 and 1880.|$|R
50|$|Genuinely used stamps of Tripolitania (fake cancels are common) {{are valued}} at {{about twice as}} much as <b>unused</b> <b>stamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|AB - Is an <b>unused</b> <b>stamp</b> {{now in the}} Royal Philatelic {{collection}}. Bacon {{refers to}} this stamp being in the Royal collection in 1919 after being acquired by King George V. It was bought from Bridger and Kay stamp dealers on 8 August 1918 for a price of £499 9 shillings. There are gum residues on the stamp {{but there is no}} way of saying whether this is original gum. When viewed from the back the Large Crown watermark is very slightly high of centre and slightly left of centre. The top perforations are scissor-cut in a sloping fashion.|$|E
50|$|Even {{with the}} use of peelable hinges and care to {{minimize}} the moisture used, the hinge will leave a visible disturbance in the gum of an <b>unused</b> <b>stamp.</b> While this was formerly a matter of indifference, since about the middle of the 20th century many collectors have come to prefer “unhinged stamps” showing no trace of hinging. In some cases, the price differential is 2-to-1 or more, resulting in the quip that the “gum {{on the back of a}} stamp is the most valuable substance in the world”. Collectors preferring unhinged stamps typically use pocket-like or sleeve-like hingeless mount. Nevertheless, stamp hinges remain popular as a mounting method.|$|E
50|$|The demonetization of postage {{and revenue}} stamps {{is the process}} by which the stamps are {{rendered}} no longer valid. In general, stamp demonetization is a rare event, since any <b>unused</b> <b>stamp</b> is effectively equivalent to its face value, and there is no financial disadvantage if postal customers use old stamps on their mail. Demonetization chiefly occurs in connection with major upheavals in the postal system, such as a transfer from one country to another, or currency changes, such as decimalisation, or a change of government. The process of exchanging millions or billions of stamps in the public's hands, plus that of exchanging post office stock, is usually complicated and difficult, and offers much interest for students of postal history.|$|E
50|$|Some stamps {{have been}} issed without any gum at all, either {{due to a}} lack of materials, or (in {{particular}} in tropical countries) to avoid the risk of stamp sheets sticking together. Such stamps cannot be found other than in (*) condition. Traditionally, in particular before World War II, stamps were mounted in albums with stamp hinges no matter whether they were used or unused. Hence some experts claim that very few <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> from the 19th century have not been hinged at some point in their existence. This means that old <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> in supposedly mint condition often come under suspicion of having been regummed, and the detection of regummed stamps is an important part of philatelic expertisation. Regummed stamps cannot be valued any higher than <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> without gum.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unused</b> <b>stamps</b> {{with full}} {{original}} gum (OG) {{on the back}} are worth more than stamps without gum or complete gum, for instance {{those that have been}} mounted using a stamp hinge.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the keytypes, the 1966-1976 {{issues were}} sold to {{collectors}} in presentation packs or as singles in mint condition, and therefore <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> are more commonly found. However they are still harder to find in used condition.|$|R
50|$|Since Bergedorf {{was such}} a small town, {{relatively}} few of these stamps were made, and even fewer used; the price of <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> is from US$30 - $50, while genuinely used stamps go for US$300 - $2,000. Reprints, forgeries, and especially faked cancellations are quite common.|$|R
50|$|The gum {{of older}} stamp issues often causes the <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> to roll. To avoid this, some postal authorities, e.g. in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, had the gum broken by rollers, leading to its serration. The {{orientation}} of this serration {{is used to}} distinguish between different production runs.|$|R
5000|$|Stamp gum is {{an item of}} {{importance}} for collectors, although its presence is rarely of use in differentiating between common and rare stamps, and being {{on the back of}} the stamp it is not usually visible. Nevertheless, its condition is reflected in the valuation of <b>unused</b> <b>stamps.</b> Generally, the following conditions are distinguished: ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1920s, Miller {{was on the}} way to his {{ultimate}} achievement: collecting one example of every U.S. postage stamp in the Scott catalogue of his day. He also collected varieties like color shades, frauds and forgeries, fresh <b>unused</b> <b>stamps,</b> and varied cancellations. Miller also enjoyed plating stamps, seeking one copy for each position on a printing plate.|$|R
50|$|The first Stanley Gibbons stamp {{catalogue}} was a penny {{price list}} issued in November 1865 and reissued at monthly intervals {{for the next}} 14 years. The company produces numerous catalogues covering different countries, regions and specialisms; {{many of them are}} reissued annually. The catalogues list all known adhesive postage stamp issues and include prices for used and <b>unused</b> <b>stamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1900, Yvert et Tellier {{associated}} with Paris stamp dealer Théodore Champion, who sold <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> {{from all over}} the world. He fixed the prices of the stamps sold by the company. After Champion's death in 1955, Pierre Yvert and the brothers Ladislas and Alexandre Varga bought Champion's company and the new firm continued to fix Yvert et Tellier's prices.|$|R
50|$|Reutersvärd's {{achievements}} were honoured in 1982 by {{a series}} of three Swedish postage stamps. The stamps were engraved by Czesław Słania, based on watercolours by Reutersvärd. They remained in circulation for only about two years, after which they were withdrawn when the postage rate was changed. The Swedish government had the <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> destroyed; these scarce items are now eagerly sought collectibles.|$|R
50|$|Differences between {{mint and}} used {{values for the}} same stamp {{have led to a}} small {{industry}} in removing, or adding, postal cancellations to stamps. Another common practice is to attempt to remove fiscal cancellations, which are often pen cancels, in order to change a stamp used fiscally (for tax purposes) to one apparently <b>unused.</b> <b>Stamps</b> available for both postage and revenue (fiscal) purposes are usually worth more unused or with a postal cancellation. Madame Joseph specialised in the addition of forged cancels to stamps that were worth more used than unused.|$|R
50|$|As well as catalogues, a {{stamp album}} was available, billed as Mount Brown's Postage-Stamp or Crest Album, price {{seven and a}} half shillings, and lists of <b>unused</b> postage <b>stamps.</b>|$|R

50|$|Known as Madame Joseph {{because she}} {{went by the}} surname Joseph and was {{possibly}} French or Belgian (her first name is unknown), Joseph, her accomplices and successors used fake handstamps to turn common <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> into more valuable used ones. Some fake cachets, cork cancels, surcharges and overprints were also used. Over four hundred fake cancels were used, mainly for British Commonwealth stamps and {{it is believed that}} there are probably additional fake cancels that have yet to be discovered. The wooden cancels were thought to have been made in France while the zincograph and copper plated implements may have been created originally for use as book or catalogue illustrations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unused</b> Zemstvo <b>stamps</b> {{were highly}} {{appreciated}} among the early collectors. For example, stamps {{of the most}} recent issues were 3 to 5 times more expensive than their real price. Rates of stamps of older issues increased in geometrical progression. For some stamps of the first issues, prices were inflated by dealers up to 400 rubles and more. High value of <b>unused</b> Zemstvo <b>stamps</b> was {{due to the fact that}} they had not been collected by philatelists in the 1860s. As for used stamps, they were valued much cheaper, yet stamps of the first issues being expensive, too. Zemstvo stamps were in great demand among foreign philatelists.|$|R
50|$|There are {{typically}} two parts to the process; first, {{the exchange of}} <b>unused</b> <b>stamps</b> for new ones of equivalent value. This normally occurs at post offices, with patrons bringing in their old stamps. The second part is the handling of mail with stamps already on it. Uncancelled letters, such as those dropped in mailbox, will get a grace period, ending {{at roughly the same}} time as the exchange of old stamps. Cancelled letters already in the mailstream may be accepted for a longer period, since remote post offices may not yet have exchanged their stamps, and sometimes there may be delays within the postal system itself.|$|R
5000|$|From 1962 to 1975, {{members of}} the society worked to form a {{complete}} collection of stamps of Lithuania to be donated to the country of Lithuania once it again became a free country. The collection was entitled [...] "The Representative Collection of Lithuanian and Klaipeda (Memel) Stamps". The collection contained 551 <b>unused</b> Lithuanian <b>stamps,</b> 4 souvenir sheets and 2 flight covers in addition to 292 <b>unused</b> Klaipeda <b>stamps</b> and was assembled by members E.Petrauskas (the initiator), K. Meskonis, L. Kairys, I. Sakalas, V. Urbonas and J. Adomenas. After the collection was first exhibited in 1975 at the Lithuanian Youth Center in Chicago, Illinois, it was donated to the country of Lithuania in a ceremony at the Lithuanian National Museum in Vilnius on June 26, 1999.|$|R
50|$|In {{fine and}} <b>unused</b> condition, these <b>stamps</b> are very expensive. In February 2006, a Twelve Penny Black was sold £116,000.|$|R
50|$|The use of stamps was optional: letters {{could still}} be sent {{requiring}} payment of postage on delivery. Indeed, the post office did not issue any 2-cent value for prepaying drop letters in 1847, and these continued to be handled as they had been. Nevertheless, many Americans took up using stamps; about 3,700,000 of the 5¢ and about 865,000 of the 10¢ were sold, and enough of those have survived to ensure a ready supply for collectors, although the demand is such that a very fine 5¢ sells for around $500 as of 2003, and the 10¢ in very fine condition sells for around $1,400 in used form. <b>Unused</b> <b>stamps</b> are much scarcer, fetching around $6,000 and $28,000 respectively, if in very fine condition. One can pay as little as 5 to 10 percent of these figures if the stamps are in poor condition.|$|R
5000|$|In German New Guinea {{issues of}} the German Empire were {{denominated}} in Pfennigs and Marks and were first used on February 15, 1888; later at various postal offices. These issues are recognized by the cancellation mark. Starting in 1897 German definitive stamps carried the overprint [...] "Deutsch-Neu-Guinea" [...] allowing also for the identification of <b>unused</b> <b>stamps.</b> On January 1, 1901 the yacht issues for [...] "Deutsch-Neu-Guinea" [...] were introduced with values from 3 Pfennigs to 5 Marks. The 3 values of the 1914 yacht modification carry the inscription [...] "Deutsch-Neuguinea" [...] and have lozenge watermarks. The 3 Pfennig issue from 1919 has the inscription [...] "Deutsch-Neu-Guinea" [...] and watermarks and was not used postally. British-Australian occupation stamps {{in the form of}} [...] "G.R.I." [...] overprinted yacht stamps started to be used from October 1914.Cancellation marks are Finschhafen, Hatzfeldhafen, Kerawara, Konstantinhafen, Stephansort, Herbertshöhe, Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen, Matupi, and Berlinhafen.|$|R
50|$|Chapman {{was finally}} {{released}} in Kroonstad on 25 June after being held captive for 17 days. The others were released in August 1900. As late as 1909 {{attempts were made}} in Britain to cash postal orders looted from the station and when De Wet's house was search in 1914 over 3,000 <b>unused</b> British <b>stamps,</b> souvenirs of the attack, were found there.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to The London Philatelist, Ted Proud has {{referred}} to two other dealers, known only as Dealer A and Dealer B who carried out similar activities and used to co-operate. Proud has written that Dealer A had a stock of printers blocks of cancels used to illustrate magazine articles and books who would also cancel <b>unused</b> <b>stamps.</b> He has also written that Dealer B, with whom Madame Joseph unsuccessfully tried to start a stamp [...] "repairing" [...] factory, also had a stock of bogus date-stamps that he said was larger than Madame Joseph's. He is also said {{to have had a}} perforating machine which was made by his brother who was a Swiss industrialist. Proud has commented that to say that Madame Joseph's operations were shrouded in secrecy would be an exaggeration and that her business was well known in the stamp trade at the time as one of selling [...] "repaired" [...] stamps with a cancellation service as an extra feature.|$|R
40|$|Every {{distributor}} {{engaged in}} the sale of cigarettes shall keep daily records of the number of tax stamps and meter units used in the distributor’s affixing operations and shall record daily the meter register readings of the meters employed.

50|$|In Britain <b>unused</b> postage <b>stamps</b> {{could be}} {{redeemed}} for cash {{at the post}} office. By agreement with postal authorities, a perfin stamp on a letter could be used only by {{the owner of the}} perfin. Therefore, a stolen perforated stamp would be of no value to the unauthorized bearer. Thus the use of perfins gave organizations better security over their postage. The demise of the perfin came about by the widespread use of postage meter machines which obviated the need for perfins.|$|R
50|$|Stellaland stamps, {{which had}} been issued in 1884, {{continued}} to be used until 2 December 1885. Any external mail had to be franked with both Stellaland stamps and Cape of Good Hope stamps. The cancellations on these stamps was by pen and ink. Stellaland stamps are known used by Warren’s Force at Kimberley. These stamps were withdrawn from use on 2 December 1885. All the <b>unused</b> withdrawn <b>stamps</b> were sold to a stamp dealer, Whitfield, King & Company of Ipswich.|$|R
