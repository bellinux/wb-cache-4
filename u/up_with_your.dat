25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds. In past evictions, the police did not assault a house until long after {{the moment of the}} deadline, and the hope was to take the squatters by {{surprise}} and minimize the time available for them to prepare their defense. A couple of days before the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city. The posters invited people to come to a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said {{that it was a good}} idea to show <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, not many people would attend.|$|E

[...] He stated in 2001: [...] "I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. I get that from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} named Double Nickels on the Dime as a {{reaction}} to the Sammy Hagar song [...] "I Can't Drive 55," [...] a protest against the federally imposed speed limit of 55 miles per hour on all U.S. highways. Minutemen decided that driving fast [...] "wasn't terribly defiant"; Watt later commented that [...] "the big rebellion thing was writing your own fuckin' songs and trying to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> own story, your own picture, your own book, whatever. So he can't drive 55, because that was the national speed limit? Okay, we'll drive 55, but we'll make crazy music." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} {{was praised}} by reviewers, especially {{in comparison to}} the single-player [...] "Story Mode". The multiplayer element was noted for appealing to a diverse demographic for its party game qualities and being an [...] "'everybody' title". Conversely, [...] "Story mode" [...] was criticised for exacerbating issues relating to pace, which was already remarked as having [...] "snail's pace". Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence involved was bemoaned for contributing an imbalance in the game, with the random availability of quality items giving players an unfair advantage. The [...] "reversal of fortune" [...] space, which initiates a minigame by which the victor would receive another player's stars or coins, was criticised for similar reasons, as it potentially penalises players who do well in the game. The minigames were mainly met with a positive reaction, with critics praising their simplicity. The grouping feature in the minigames were also welcomed for contributing a new dynamic of gameplay, although Bramwell commented that [...] "It might seem a little odd to gang <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> competitors in some cases".|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} grew uncomfortable with their success, {{with much of}} the burden of Pearl Jam's {{popularity}} falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for [...] "Jeremy", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for [...] "Black" [...] in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that [...] "Before music videos first came out, you’d listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you’d come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Qur’anic context can be {{explained}} by Surah 4:2, which states [...] "To orphans restore their property (When they reach their age), nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it <b>up)</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> own. For this is indeed a great sin." [...] Therefore, the first part of verse 4:3 is dealing with orphan women who are under the protection of a male guardian, and it is advising the guardian to [...] "deal justly" [...] with the orphans.|$|E

2500|$|McReynolds's rudeness was not {{confined}} to colleagues on the Court. Once, when called before {{the chairman of the}} Golf Committee at the Chevy Chase club after complaints were filed against him, McReynolds said: [...] "I've been a member of this club a good many years, and no one around here has ever shown me any courtesy, so I don't intend to show any to anyone else." [...] The indignant chairman replied: [...] "Mr Justice, you wouldn't be a member of this club if it wasn't for your official position. The members of this club have put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> discourtesy for years, merely because you are a member of the Supreme Court. But I'm telling you now that the next time there is a complaint against you, you'll be suspended from the privileges of the golf course." [...] Justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter transferred from the Chevy Chase club to Burning Tree because McReynolds [...] "got disagreeable even beyond their endurance".|$|E
