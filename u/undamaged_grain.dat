50|$|While {{confused}} (and red) flour beetles cannot feed on whole, <b>undamaged</b> <b>grain,</b> {{they are}} often found in large numbers in infested grains, feeding on broken grain, grain dust, and other household food items such as flour, rice, dried fruit, nuts, and beans. Both types of beetles are often found not only in infested grains, but in crevices in pantries and cabinet, as well. Damage to food is caused somewhat by the beetles' feeding, but also by their dead bodies, fecal pellets, and foul-smelling secretions. In addition to creating a foul odor, the beetles' presence encourages the growth of mold.|$|E
40|$|The sorghum head bug, Calocoris angustatus Lethiery (Hemiptera: Miridae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of grain sorghum in India. Studies were conducted to quantify the effect of head bug damage on grain quality and seedling establishment on head bug-resistant cultivars (IS 17610 and IS 21443), a moderately susceptible cultivar (IS 9692), and a susceptible commercial cultivar (CSH 11). Differences in 1000 -grain mass, seed germination and percentage of floaters were significant between protected and unprotected plots in CSH 11 and IS 9692, but not in IS 17610 and IS 21443. Grain damage ratings were significantly lower in IS 17610 than in IS 9692 and CSH 11 across different protection levels. Head bug-damaged grain had greater protein content than the <b>undamaged</b> <b>grain,</b> possibly because of depletion in starch, and a marginal increase in soluble sugars. Amounts of proline and tyrosine were greater in the bug-damaged grain than in the <b>undamaged</b> <b>grain,</b> while the reverse was true for aspartic acid, methionine, leucine and lysine. Head bug damage also increased the tannin content in IS 9692 (which is a high-tannin genotype). Moisture regimes and insecticide protection levels significantly affected seedling emergence. Seedling emergence of CSH 11 was lower than that in IS 17610. In the latter genotype, the differences between protected and unprotected plots were not significant. Head bug damage thus not only leads to quantitative loss in grain yield, but also spoils the grain quality and renders the grain unfit for seed purposes. These qualitative effects should be taken into account while estimating losses due to bug damage and determining economic thresholds. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, grain {{that had}} been damaged by the bug Eurygaster spp. and/or Aelia spp., plus some <b>undamaged</b> <b>grain,</b> was {{selected}} from hard red winter (HRW) wheat. The changes in endosperm proteins were determined by 2 -dimensional (2 -D) electrophoresis and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC). Although some new protein spots and a slight decrease in the staining intensities of some polypeptides were observed in the 2 -D map of the bug-damaged sample, {{other parts of the}} gels were similar to the sound (control) sample in terms of relative mobilities and intensities of the polypeptide spots. The major difference between bug-damaged and control samples was that a group of polypeptides, presumably HMW-glutenins, shifted to a more basic region of the map. The SE-HPLC patterns of the total proteins extracted from control and bug-damaged samples in SDS-buffer showed that they differed in the size distribution of the polymeric glutenin protein and in their glutenin/gliadin ratios. The solubility of proteins in SDS buffer was greater in the bug-damaged sample. The 'unextractable' polymeric protein (only extractable in SDS-buffer after sonication) (UPP %) was significantly lower in the bug-damaged sample than in the control. The results of 2 -D analysis and the decline in the quantity of unextractable proteins in SDS buffer suggest that bug-protease causes dough weakening by degradation of polymeric glutenin, presumably by hydrolysis, and possibly other mechanisms that affect the aggregation of the gluten molecules. 7 page(s...|$|E
30|$|High {{temperatures}} during {{grain filling}} often cause serious {{damage to the}} grain quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Terashima et al. [2001]; Lanning et al. [2011]; Kondo et al. [2012]), reducing the proportion of first-grade rice (Hasegawa et al. [2009]) or milling quality (Lyman et al. [2013]). One {{of the main reasons}} for the reduction is the decreased percentage of <b>undamaged</b> <b>grains,</b> which is due to increased proportions of chalky and unfilled grains. The occurrence of chalky grains under high temperatures is attributable mainly to the inhibition of starch accumulation (Morita [2008]; Morita and Nakano [2011]).|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of the reduction in <b>undamaged</b> <b>grains</b> under E-[CO 2] is not understood, but a possible mechanism is a higher canopy temperature in E-[CO 2] than in ambient [CO 2] (AMB) conditions, which was observed in a free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) study (Yoshimoto et al. [2005]). If higher canopy temperature due to E-[CO 2] {{is the main reason}} for the reduced grain appearance quality, heat-tolerant cultivars might also be resistant to the occurrence of chalky grains under E-[CO 2], but this hypothesis has never been tested. Therefore, we conducted a FACE experiment using several rice cultivars to determine whether heat-tolerant cultivars could maintain high grain quality under E-[CO 2].|$|R
30|$|The {{percentage}} of <b>undamaged</b> <b>grains</b> of five standard cultivars (Akitakomachi, Kinuhikari, Koshihikari, Matsuribare, Nipponbare) averaged 61.7 % in the ambient [CO 2] (AMB) plot and 51.7 % in the FACE plot, whereas that of heat-tolerant cultivars (Eminokizuna, Wa 2398, Kanto 257, Toyama 80, Mineharuka, Kanto 259, Saikai 290) averaged 73.5 % in AMB and 71.3 % in FACE. This {{resulted in a}} significant [CO 2] by cultivar interaction. The {{percentage of}} white-base or white-back grains increased from 8.4 % in AMB to 17.1 % in FACE in the sensitive cultivars, but from only 2.1 % in AMB to only 4.4 % in FACE in the heat-tolerant cultivars.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the efficacy of different storage methods of maize grains in Ibadan (a humid tropical ecology) between year 2002 and 2003. The results shows that storage methods (SM), treatment (Tr), SM x Variety (V) and Tr x V interactions were highly significant for numbers of <b>undamaged</b> maize <b>grains</b> (P< 0. 05). Second order interaction (SM x Tr x V) was highly significant for <b>undamaged</b> maize <b>grains,</b> while first and second order interaction were also highly significant for initial kernel weight, kernel weight loss, remained kernel weight (RKW), percentage weight loss, tolerance level, as well as number of insects pest responsible for the damage...|$|R
30|$|The {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration ([CO 2]) is increasing. [CO 2] {{has increased}} from 280  μmol mol− 1 in 1800 to 396  μmol mol− 1 in March 2013 (NOAA [2013]). Its continued increase {{is expected to have}} a big influence on crop production. Elevated [CO 2] (E-[CO 2]) is expected to increase the grain yield of rice (Kobayashi et al. [2006]; Hasegawa et al. [2007], Ainsworth [2008]), but it decreases the protein content (Lieffering et al. [2004]; Terao et al. [2005]; Yang et al. [2007]; Taub et al. [2008]; Seneweera [2011]) and the proportion of <b>undamaged</b> <b>grains</b> (Yang et al. [2007]). These studies suggest that production of high-quality rice grains will become even more difficult under the expected higher air temperatures and [CO 2], but attempts to cope with both factors have yet to begin.|$|R
40|$|A {{sandstone}} outcrop {{exposed to}} freshwater seepage supports a diverse assemblage of photosynthetic microbes. Dominant taxa are two cyanophytes (Oscillatoria sp., Rivularia sp.) and a unicellular green alga (Palmellococcus sp.). Less abundant taxa include a filamentous green alga, Microspora, and the desmid Cosmarium. Biologic activity {{is evidenced by}} measured levels of chlorophyll and lipids. Bioassay methods confirm the ability of these microbes to dissolve and metabolize Fe from ferruginous minerals. Chromatographic analysis reveals citric acid as the likely chelating agent; this low molecular weight organic acid is detectable in interstitial fluid in the sandstone, measured as 0. 0756 mg/mL. Bioassays using a model organism, Synechoccus elongates strain UTEX 650, show that Fe availability varies among different ferruginous minerals. In decreasing order of Fe availability: magnetite > limonite > biotite > siderite > hematite. Biotite was selected for detailed study {{because it is the}} most abundant iron-bearing mineral in the sandstone. SEM images support the microbiologic evidence, showing weathering of biotite compared to relatively <b>undamaged</b> <b>grains</b> of other silicate minerals...|$|R
40|$|The maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), {{is among}} the major storage pests that enhance food {{insecurity}} among maize farmers. New sources {{of resistance to the}} maize weevil are critical in a successful breeding program to address grain damage by postharvest pests. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate resistance in maize genotypes to the maize weevil, and consequently their value for use in breeding programs. A total of 175 genotypes, including hybrids, landraces, open-pollinated varieties and checks, were tested for resistance to the maize weevil. The percentage grain damage, weight loss, flour weight and weight of damaged and <b>undamaged</b> <b>grains</b> were measured. Significant differences (P) were observed among the genotypes for all the traits evaluated. The distribution of the genotypes among the different categories of resistance was an indication of the existence of genetic variation. The most resistant genotypes were CKPH 08003 and BRAZ 2451 while the most susceptible were PH 3254 and BRAZ 4, among the hybrids and landraces respectively. Genotypes that were superior to the resistant checks were identified. The percentage weight loss and flour weight were identified as the most important insect-resistance traits for discriminating genotypes as evident from the canonical discriminant analysis. Correlation coefficients among the traits evaluated were highly significant. The resistant hybrids identified can be recommended for release and adoption by farmers, whereas the resistant landraces can act as sources of resistance for use in breeding programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of losses caused by insects and sustained by farmers who stored maize or sorghum on their farms was {{undertaken in the}} Shire Valley Agricultural Development Project area in Southern Malawi. During the survey current recommended methodology for undertaking loss surveys and for sample analysis was critically evaluated under practical conditions. Probability procedures and stratified, random sampling methods were used to choose the farmers {{who participated in the}} exercise. Each farmer was visited as soon after harvest as possible so that the amount of produce stored could be ascertained. Thereafter, at approximately monthly intervals local extension workers collected samples of produce for analysis and information regarding food consumption patterns from each farmer. At each visit the extension worker had to complete a questionnaire. Some of the questions were found to be too complex for the field worker, though in general the information retrieved provided useful data. Samples of grain were analysed for losses by determining the weight of a standard volume of grain (SVW) and comparing the extrapolated dry weight to that of a known sample. A second method, that of counting and weighing damaged and <b>undamaged</b> <b>grains</b> was also employed. Difficulties were experienced with both methods because of the relatively large variations in the results obtained and because of the low levels of loss. Significantly greater losses were recorded by the SVW method than by the count and weigh method. Most farmers did not store their produce beyond the dry season when insect activity was low. The lack of insects was reflected in the low losses obtained, 1 - 2 % for sorghum and 2 - 5 % for maize. However, even those few farmers who stored through the rains did not lose a significantly greater percentage...|$|R
40|$|Advancing maize crop {{maturity}} {{is associated}} with changes in ear-to-stover ratio which may have consequences for the digestibility of the ensiled crop. The apparent digestibility and nitrogen retention of three diets (Early, Mid and Late) containing maize silages made from maize of advancing harvest date [dry matter (DM) contents of the maize silages were 273, 314 and 367 g kg(- 1) for the silages in the Early, Mid and Late diets respectively], together with a protein supplement offered in sufficient quantities to make the diets isonitrogenous, were measured in six Holstein-Friesian steers in an incomplete Latin square design with four periods. Dry-matter intake of maize silage tended to be least for the Early diet and greatest for the Medium diet (P= 0 (.) 182). Apparent digestibility of DM and organic matter did not differ between diets. Apparent digestibility of energy was lowest in the Late diet (P = 0 (.) 057) and the metabolizable energy concentrations of the three silages were calculated as 11 (.) 0, 11 (.) 1 and 10 (.) 6 MJ kg(- 1) DM for the Early, Medium and Late diets respectively (P = 0 (.) 068). No differences were detected between diets in starch digestibility {{but the number of}} <b>undamaged</b> <b>grains</b> present in the faeces of animals fed the Late diet was significantly higher than with the Early and Mid diets (P = 0 (.) 006). The apparent digestibility of neutral-detergent fibre of the diets reduced significantly as silage DM content increased (P = 0 (.) 012) with a similar trend for the apparent digestibility of acid-detergent fibre (P = 0 (.) 078). Apparent digestibility of nitrogen (N) was similar for the Early and Mid diets, both being greater than the Late diet (P = 0 (.) 035). Nitrogen retention did not differ between diets. It was concluded that delaying harvest until the DM content is above 300 g kg(- 1) can negatively affect the nutritive value of maize silage in the UK...|$|R
