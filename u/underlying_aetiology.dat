40|$|Depression is a {{combination}} of affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms. Each of these symptom types is probably related to different brain processes that are altered in the depressed state. A further line of investigation is in the exploring of these brain processes. Even if the symptoms presenting in the patients are not able to discriminate between the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiologies,</b> it is possible that associated neurocognitive deficits do. Depression is a disorder of mood, cognition, and behaviour with associated disturbance of brain structure and function. Psychomotor retardation reflects ventral striatum-cortico-thalamic network dysfunction and is associated with severe depression. There is decreased hippocampal volume and disturbed memory and learning in depression. Amygdala- anterior cingulate networks normally responsible for emotion regulation are disturbed in depression. Cognitive distortions seen in depression have associated abnormalities in prefrontal regions. Neurocognitive characteristics can distinguish between unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders...|$|R

30|$|Whereas {{there is}} clear {{evidence}} for improved survival with CPR and defibrillation during cardiac arrest management, there is today lacking evidence {{that any of}} the recommended and used drugs leads to any long-term benefit for the patients.

40|$|Objectives Despite known {{overlaps}} in {{the pattern}} of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SZA), few studies have examined the extent to which cognitive performance validates traditional diagnostic boundaries in these groups. Method Individuals with SZ (n= 49), schizoaffective disorder (n= 33) and BD (n= 35) completed a battery of cognitive tests measuring the domains of processing speed, immediate memory, semantic memory, learning, working memory, executive function and sustained attention. Results A discriminant functions analysis revealed a significant function comprising semantic memory, immediate memory and processing speed that maximally separated patients with SZ from those with BD. Initial classification scores {{on the basis of this}} function showed modest diagnostic accuracy, owing in part to the misclassification of SZA patients as having SZ. When SZA patients were removed from the model, a second cross-validated classifier yielded slightly improved diagnostic accuracy and a single function solution, of which semantic memory loaded most heavily. Conclusions A cluster of non-executive cognitive processes appears to have some validity in mapping onto traditional nosological boundaries. However, since semantic memory performance was the primary driver of the discrimination between BD and SZ, it is possible that performance differences between the disorders in this cognitive domain in particular, index separate <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that certain {{cardiovascular}} and metabolic risk factors tend to cluster together. For example, in the 1940 s the French clinician, Vague, described the diabetic and atherogenic risk associated with android (upper body) obesity. The relatively recent concept of a metabolic syndrome suggested that the clustering represents a discrete entity due to a single <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> (insulin resistance). Yet, despite several definitions and its own International Classification of Diseases code its validity and utility remains unclear. The evidence does not fully support the existence of a single <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology,</b> and most, but not all, evidence suggests that the syndrome as currently defined appears to have little value in predicting cardiovascular disease risk over other approaches that consider individual risk factors. At present there is no specific treatment for the syndrome other than targeting the individual risk factors. It is concluded that at this time its main utility is as a reminder to the clinician that certain risk factors tend to cluster, and as an indicator of the public health importance of the risk factor clustering associated with obesity and physical inactivity...|$|E

Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are chronic {{inflammatory}} bowel diseases (IBD) with unclear <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiologies.</b> Severe cardiac arrhythmias {{have been}} emphasised {{in a few}} studies on adult IBD patients. This study aimed to investigate the alteration of the P-wave and QT interval dispersion parameters to assess the risk of atrial conduction and ventricular repolarisation abnormalities in pediatric IBD patients. Patients and Methods. Thirty-six IBD patients in remission (UC: 20, CD: 16) aged 3 – 18 years and 36 age- and sex-matched control patients {{were enrolled in the}} study. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were used to determine durations of P-wave, QT, and corrected QT (QTc) interval dispersion. Transthoracic echocardiograms and 24 -hour rhythm Holter recordings were obtained for both groups. Results. The P-wave dispersion, QT dispersion, and QTc interval dispersion (Pdisp, QTdisp, and QTcdisp) were significantly longer in the patient group. The mean values of Pminimum, Pmaximum, and QTcminimum were significantly different between the two groups. The echocardiography and Holter monitoring results were not significantly different between the groups. Furthermore, no differences in these parameters were detected between the CD and UC groups.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} novel underlying {{associations of}} classic acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN). METHODS: Multimodal imaging case series evaluating patients with classic AMN lesions and previously unreported <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiologies.</b> RESULTS: Six patients were included (five women, one man, mean age 30 ± 7  years). Mean distance best corrected visual acuity at initial presentation was 0. 21 ± 0. 3 logMAR (mean Snellen acuity: 20 / 30, range 20 / 15 - 20 / 100) {{and at last}} follow-up visit 0. 09 ± 0. 17 logMAR (Snellen acuity: 20 / 20, range 20 / 15 - 20 / 60). All cases but one had bilateral lesions and showed typical parafoveal hyporeflective lesions on infrared imaging, which corresponded to the hyper-reflectivity in the Henle's layer with attenuation of the external limiting membrane, the ellipsoid zone and interdigitation zone. Underlying diseases included thrombocytopenia and anaemia associated with dengue fever, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, chronic kidney disease and ulcerative colitis, while Valsalva-like manoeuvre {{was found to be}} a potential trigger. Other novel associations included the use of lisdexamphetamine. CONCLUSIONS: Classic AMN may be associated with leukaemia, dengue fever, ulcerative colitis and chronic kidney disease, probably as a result of chorioretinal hypoxia in the setting of thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Adrenergic agonists such as lisdexamphetamine may also contribute to the manifestation of AMN...|$|R
