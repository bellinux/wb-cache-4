5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions.</b> Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.|$|E

5|$|While Joseph Priestley {{was writing}} {{about the history of}} electricity, Franklin {{encouraged}} him to use an electrostatic machine to perform the experiments he {{was writing about}}. Priestly designed and used his own variations of Franklin's machine. While replicating the electrical experiments, some <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> prompted Priestly to design additional experiments, leading to additional discoveries. In 1767 he published a 700-page book on his findings called The History and Present State of Electricity.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Unanswered</b> <b>Question</b> is {{a musical}} work by American {{composer}} Charles Ives. Originally paired with Central Park in the Dark as Two Contemplations in 1908, The <b>Unanswered</b> <b>Question</b> was revived by Ives in 1930-1935. As {{with many of}} Ives' works, it was largely unknown until much later in his life, and was not performed until 1946.|$|R
5|$|The What If? book {{contains}} {{a selection of}} questions and answers from the original blog, as well as nineteen new ones. Furthermore, Munroe selected a few <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> from his inbox and collected those in separate sections in the book. Alt text, which was commonly used for illustrations on the original blog, was omitted from the book in many cases, though is sometimes included as small captions underneath the images. Instead, Munroe has added footnotes to the essays in the book to inform or entertain the reader. The cover of the book depicts a Tyrannosaurus rex being lowered into a Sarlacc from Star Wars, a topic not covered in the book.|$|E
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|The viewers' {{confused}} {{reaction to}} their story {{based on the}} first half, disappointed and frustrated Sato and Ibira. Sato explained the first two episodes were to capture the viewers' attention, and remaining episodes would reveal greater details of the story. Mania complained this franchising tactic is a poor excuse for initial episodes lacking substance. They said although the later half answered much of the questions raised in the first, it created <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> of its own. IGN and DVD Talk felt the story was darker and flowed better in the later half than the first, but IGN felt the revelation of details came {{too late in the}} show. DVD Verdict felt the story was pointless. Despite the protagonist reaffirming himself as a protector of the city, his showdown with the antagonist reduced most of Shinjuku to ruins. Reviewers found if they stripped the plot to its basics, it is a shallow good-versus-evil story made complex by its presentation in the first half. They, however, appreciated the surprising deaths of certain characters whose sacrifice in vain rendered a poignant emotion at that point of story.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{geometry}} arose {{and developed}} {{as a result of}} and in connection to the mathematical analysis of curves and surfaces. Mathematical analysis of curves and surfaces had been developed to answer some of the nagging and <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> that appeared in calculus, like the reasons for relationships between complex shapes and curves, series and analytic functions. These <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> indicated greater, hidden relationships.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, the FDA {{convened a}} Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) {{consisting}} of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and brain cancer. The PBOI concluded aspartame {{does not cause}} brain damage, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> about cancer in laboratory rats.|$|E
25|$|In April and May 2008, Jesse Ventura, {{in several}} radio {{interviews}} {{for his new}} book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, reiterated his concerns about {{what he described as}} some of the <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> about 9/11.

25|$|Though {{there are}} {{multiple}} models that attempt to explain vesicular traffic throughout the Golgi, no individual model can independently explain all observations of the Golgi apparatus. Currently, the cisternal progression/maturation model is the most accepted among scientists, accommodating many observations across eukaryotes. The other models are still important in framing questions and guiding future experimentation. Among the fundamental <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> are the directionality of COPI vesicles and role of Rab GTPases in modulating protein cargo traffic.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} {{also showed}} a video recording of Sayenko's confession, {{in which he}} admits that robbery was a motive {{for some of the}} killings. A video of Alexander Hanzha was also shown, with his face bruised after alleged mistreatment by the police. Michele Canale attempted to obtain an interview with the killers in prison, but was denied by the Ukrainian authorities. A range of motives for the killings was examined, and it was concluded that despite the court verdict, there are still <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> about the case.|$|E
25|$|According to one {{of those}} models, a large chunk of the subducted plate of a former ocean has survived in the {{uppermost}} mantle for several hundred million years, and its oceanic crust now causes excessive melt generation and the observed volcanism. This model, however, is not backed by dynamical calculations, nor is it exclusively required by the data, and it also leaves <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> concerning the dynamical and chemical stability of such a body over that long period or the thermal effect of such massive melting.|$|E

50|$|Ivesiana is {{a ballet}} made by New York City Ballet co-founder and ballet master George Balanchine to Charles Ives' Central Park in the Dark (1906), The <b>Unanswered</b> <b>Question</b> (1906), In the Inn (1904-06?), and In the Night (1906) {{shortly after the}} composer's death. The premiere took place September 14, 1954, at the City Center of Music and Drama. Other works {{to the music of}} Ives in the City Ballet {{repertory}} include Peter Martins' Calcium Light Night, Jerome Robbins' Ives, Songs and Eliot Feld's The <b>Unanswered</b> <b>Question.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{dominant}} {{method is}} {{the emphasis on}} detecting unorthodox or heretical doctrines and contrasting those with orthodox interpretations of the Bible and early creedal documents. Some apologists, such as Francis J. Beckwith, have emphasised a philosophical approach, pointing out logical, epistemological and metaphysical problems within the teachings of a particular group. Another approach involves former members of cultic groups recounting their spiritual autobiographies, which highlight experiences of disenchantment with the group, <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> and doubts about commitment to the group, culminating in the person's conversion to Evangelical Christianity.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the binding problem and multisensory perception {{can be thought of}} as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from <b>unanswered</b> <b>questions</b> about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent perception of their surroundings from the cacophony of electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the visual domain (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory perception.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unanswered</b> <b>{{questions}}</b> {{about the}} tragedy, and questions {{of cause and}} blame, have intrigued observers and haunted survivors for over 50 years. The fact that Andrea Doria and Stockholm were speeding in heavy fog (21.8 knots and 18.5 knots, respectively, at the collision) and questions about their seaworthiness arose at the time. Captain Calamai never assumed another command because the Italian Line feared bad publicity. However, largely because the out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies ended the fact-finding which was {{taking place in the}} hearings immediately after the disaster, no resolution of the cause(s) was ever formally accomplished. This has led to continued development of information and a search for greater understanding, aided by newer technologies in over half a century since the disaster.|$|E
