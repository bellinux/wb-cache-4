5|$|When the war resumed in June 1410, Władysław {{advanced}} {{into the}} Teutonic heartland {{at the head}} of an army of about 20,000 mounted nobles, 15,000 armed commoners, and 2,000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia. After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at Czerwińsk, his troops met <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> of Vytautas, whose 11,000 light cavalry included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and Tatars. The Teutonic Order's army numbered about 18,000 cavalry, mostly Germans and 5,000 infantry. On 15 July, at the Battle of Grunwald after {{one of the largest and}} most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages, the allies won a victory so overwhelming that the Teutonic Order's army was virtually annihilated, with most of its key commanders killed in combat, including Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen and Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode. Thousands of troops were reported to have been slaughtered on either side.|$|E

He was involved on the committee that brought about the merger of the BPS with another denomination to become the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (RPCES) in 1965, and then the RPCES, along with its education institutions Covenant College and Covenant Theological Seminary, {{became part of the}} Presbyterian Church in America in 1982, at which time Harris was elected moderator of the 10th General Assembly of that body.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Viking age proper in Scotland is {{generally}} considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to Skye, arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> of King Magnus of Man and King Dougal of the Hebrides. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at Largs, in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son Magnus the Law-mender ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the Treaty of Perth.|$|E

25|$|The Kozelsk {{offensive}} {{aimed to}} eliminate {{the entirety of the}} German penetration and the 2nd Panzer Army by isolating the salient with a combined attack by the 16th, 61st, and 3rd Tank Armies of Georgy Zhukov's Western Front. Prokofy Romanenko's 3rd Tank Army, reinforced with additional infantry and tank units, would launch the main assault from the Belev area southeast of Kozelsk, cross the Vytebet River, and capture Ulyanovo in the German rear, with Pavel Belov's 61st Army following behind. Meanwhile, Ivan Bagramyan's 16th Army, spearheaded by the mobile forces of Alexey Kurkin's 9th and Vasily Burkov's 10th Tank Corps, and Viktor Baranov's 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, was to attack from positions southwest of Kozelsk and destroy the German defenses along the Zhizdra. Continuing their advance, Bagramyan's troops were to link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> of Romanenko and Belov at Ulyanovo to complete the encirclement of the 2nd Panzer Army.|$|E
500|$|Maginnis {{describes}} {{the opening of}} the song as [...] "a burst of howling guitar feedback and jubilant, church-like organ", adding: [...] "The atmosphere hints at Harrison's fascination with Indian music and Hindu philosophy at the time, having a distinct, Eastern-flavored, droning undercurrent." [...] Following the intro to [...] "I Feel Fine" [...] in 1964, [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] is a rare example of the Beatles' use of feedback on a recording and suggests the influence of Jimi Hendrix. Womack credits this guitar part to Harrison, who played his Epiphone Casino using [...] "the instrument's Bigsby [...] bar in searing, full vibrato force". Harrison later rued the prominence of the brass accompaniment, saying: [...] "To this day I am still annoyed that I let them mess it <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> damn trumpets. Basically, the song's quite good but, you know, messed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> trumpets." ...|$|E

500|$|Esophageal varices are swollen twisted {{branches}} of the azygous vein in the lower third of the esophagus. These blood vessels [...] anastomose (join <b>up)</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> of the portal vein when portal hypertension develops. These blood vessels are engorged more than normal, and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the esophagus. These blood vessels develop {{as part of a}} collateral circulation that occurs to drain blood from the abdomen as a result of portal hypertension, usually as a result of liver diseases such as cirrhosis. This collateral circulation occurs because {{the lower part of the}} esophagus drains into the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Because of the extensive venous plexus that exists between this vein and other veins, if portal hypertension occurs, the direction of blood drainage in this vein may reverse, with blood draining from the portal venous system, through the plexus. Veins in the plexus may engorge and lead to varices.|$|E
500|$|The actors used several {{techniques}} {{to develop their}} characters. Arshad Warsi ("Circuit") encountered some initial problems reviving his character from the first film.

[...] Warsi admits that he had [...] "forgotten" [...] the character of Circuit and had to watch the DVD of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. three times before being able to film the scene correctly. Sanjay Dutt ("Munna Bhai") also confessed that he had to watch the first film eight to nine times to recapture the [...] "persona" [...] of Munna Bhai. In addition, Dutt stated in an interview that he did not read Gandhi's autobiography My Experiments with Truth as a preparation for Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Rather, he comments, his father, Sunil Dutt (who portrays Munna Bhai's father in the first film, Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.) and his mother (the late actress Nargis) were his role models as they [...] "were basically Gandhians.

500|$|Following the {{fighting}} on Tsimba Ridge, the 31st/51st was relieved by the 26th Infantry Battalion, and the Australians continued to advance north towards Soraken. Over {{the course of}} several months, the 26th advanced on several axes: from Downs' Ridge they crossed the Nagam River, while on the coast another element advanced though Lalum to the Compton River. Between these two forces, another linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> that had crossed the Nagam, and proceeded north over the Compton towards Soraken Plantation. Elsewhere, barges were used to land forces on the Soraken Peninsula in several locations to dislocate the Japanese forces there and sever their lines of communication, while other landings took place on Saposa Island and Torokori Island. In April, the 26th was relieved by the 55th/53rd Infantry Battalion which advanced north to Ratsua, from where the Australians planned to move along the Bonis Peninsula. By late May, however, casualties amongst the 55th/53rd meant that they had to be withdrawn from the line, and the 26th Infantry Battalion was moved back up to replace them, along with the 31st/51st. At the start of June the Australians were stretched out across a [...] line between Ratsua to Ruri Bay.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in {{the lead}} group, Sylvain Calzati had stormed {{away from the other}} five escapees with about [...] to go, only to be chased after {{somewhat}} later by Patrice Halgand and Kjell Carlström. The other three riders mainly {{looked at each other and}} did not believe they could stay out of the peloton's grip. However, the peloton would catch <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> three non-believers, but the other three were not to be caught before the finish line. Sylvain Calzati proved to be too strong for the other two as they coöperated to get back to him but never saw him again before Lorient, instead the gap only became bigger. In the end Sylvain Calzati scored his most beautiful professional victory of his career as he came over the finish line more than two minutes ahead of Carlström and Halgand, who both just ended a few seconds before the peloton. In the peloton, Robbie McEwen again won the sprint, enlarging his lead in the standings for the green jersey over the other sprinters.|$|E
2500|$|According to Joyce Appleby, Jefferson had {{opportunities}} to disassociate himself from slavery. In 1782, after the American Revolution, Virginia {{passed a law}} making manumission by the slave owner legal and more easily accomplished, and the manumission rate rose across the Upper South in other states as well. [...] Northern states passed various emancipation plans. Jefferson's actions did not keep <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> of the antislavery advocates. On September 15, 1793, Jefferson agreed in writing to free James Hemings, his mixed-race slave who had served him as chef since their time in Paris, after the slave had trained his younger brother Peter as a replacement chef. [...] Jefferson finally freed James Hemings in February 1796. According to one historian, Jefferson's manumission was not generous; he said the document [...] "undermines any notion of benevolence." [...] With freedom, Hemings worked in Philadelphia and traveled to France. About the same time, in 1794 Jefferson allowed James' older brother Robert Hemings to buy his freedom. These {{were the only two}} slaves Jefferson freed by manumission in his lifetime. (They were both brothers of Sally Hemings, believed to be Jefferson's concubine.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the mammoth}} steppe the wolf's ability to hunt in packs, to share risk fairly among pack members, and to {{cooperate}} moved {{them to the}} top of the food chain above lions, hyenas and bears. Some wolves followed the great reindeer herds, eliminating the unfit, the weaklings, the sick and the aged, and therefore improved the herd. These wolves had become the first pastoralists hundreds of thousands of years before humans also took to this role. The wolves' advantage over their competitors was that they were able to keep pace with the herds, move fast and enduringly, and make the most efficient use of their kill by their ability to [...] "wolf down" [...] a large part of their quarry before other predators had detected the kill. The study proposed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, some of our ancestors teamed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> pastoralist wolves and learned their techniques. Many of our ancestors remained gatherers and scavengers, or specialized as fish-hunters, hunter-gatherers, and hunter-gardeners. However, some ancestors adopted the pastoralist wolves' lifestyle as herd followers and herders of reindeer, horses, and other hoofed animals. They harvested the best stock for themselves while the wolves kept the herd strong, and this group of humans was to become the first herders and this group of wolves was to become the first dogs.|$|E
2500|$|Mordor's {{war effort}} was focused {{in the south}} against Gondor, but using his outstretched right arm Sauron {{attempted}} to flank the lands of the Free Peoples through the north, using Orcs and allied dark nations of Men. [...] In this northern theatre of the war (which had spread far across Middle-earth) Sauron's primary objective was to use the forces at his primary base of operations in the areas, Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, to defeat Lothlórien, then pass the Misty Mountains (attacking Rivendell), and wheel around to take Rohan and Gondor from the rear. [...] However, Dol Guldur {{had to deal with}} the threat of Thranduil of the Woodland Realm, and thus split their forces between the attack on Lothlórien and the one on the Woodland Realm. [...] Sauron wanted to use his dark Easterling allies in a joint attack with the Orcs from Dol Guldur on the Woodland Realm, and then have this victorious army link up with the other ones attacking Lothlórien and defeat it. [...] However, unfortunately for Sauron a strong Dwarf nation now existed at the Lonely Mountain thanks to the efforts of Gandalf, as well as the Dwarves of the Iron Hills and allied Men of Dale. [...] Mordor's Easterling allies were tied up fighting the Dwarves of Erebor and Men of Dale, and never linked up with the Mordor forces assaulting the Woodland Realm, which in turn could not link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> attacking Lothlórien, and the line held.|$|E
