25|$|Symbolic {{communication}} systems are distinguished from writing systems {{in that one}} must usually <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the associated spoken language to comprehend the text. In contrast, symbolic systems, such as information signs, painting, maps, and mathematics, often do not require prior knowledge of a spoken language. Every human community possesses language, a feature regarded by many as an innate and defining condition of mankind (see Origin of language). However the development of writing systems, and their partial supplantation of traditional oral systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven, and slow. Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts and often preserve features and expressions that no longer exist in the spoken language. The greatest benefit of writing is that it provides the tool by which society can record information consistently and in greater detail, something {{that could not be}} achieved as well previously by spoken word. Writing allows societies to transmit information and to share knowledge.|$|E

She is shown to tune things out when she cannot <b>understand</b> <b>something.</b> For her part in the final attack on the Mew Mews, Sweet Juliet disguises herself as an announcer named [...] "Otome Sakuragasumi" [...] who gives an enthusiastic report of the Mew Mews saving the day. Sweet Juliet claims to feel bad for Berry when the plan successfully causes the public to attack Berry for [...] "making the Mew Mews evil", {{towards the end of}} the series, but she also notes that she [...] "guesses" [...] Berry deserves it.|$|E

500|$|In {{the weeks}} before the release of their third album, Say Anything {{released}} several songs from the album on MySpace. They also announced pre-ordered copies could be ordered with a signed CD booklet. The band released their first single from the new album, [...] "Baby Girl, I'm a Blur", on October 2, 2007. In Defense of the Genre was released on October 23, 2007. It was released in a dual-disc format complete with 27 songs and contained many guest vocals. When asked about {{the name of the}} record, Bemis said, [...] "Whatever 'genre' (or music) one loves needs a defense, because half the world is too ignorant to really <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> before they dismiss it." [...] Before recording the record, Bemis stated, [...] "I hope that [...] will be more inspiring and uplifting. I want [...] to be The Joshua Tree with balls on laughing gas." ...|$|E
500|$|Mendes avoided using close-ups, as he {{believed}} the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted {{at the bottom of}} the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a [...] screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault; and everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault." [...] Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: [...] "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{specific}} issue of his mathematical education, Darwin came to regret {{his lack of}} ability and application: [...] "I attempted mathematics, and even went {{during the summer of}} 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense".|$|E

2500|$|This poem is {{directly}} related to the theme of “whiteshamanism” (discussed above) and based in Rose’s personal indignation toward non-Native Americans who claim to understand the Native American experience. Rose takes the firm stance that it is not possible to <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> that one is not a part of. She uses powerful images associated with native traditions and mentions them in a flippant matter, practically throwing each image out (painted faces, doeskin, etc.) and [...] reflecting the way in which white Americans believe they can simply put on moccasins, walk in them for a time, and completely understand what it means to be an Indian. She uses sarcasm and irony in the poem.|$|E
2500|$|Asked how she {{can write}} so believably about a man's inner life, Flynn says, [...] "I'm kind of part guy myself." [...] When {{she needs to}} <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> about how men think, she asks her husband or a male friend. [...] Flynn's autobiographical essay [...] "I Was Not a Nice Little Girl..." [...] invites readers to believe she took {{inspiration}} for Amy Dunne from her own interior monologue. In that essay, Flynn confesses to sadistic childhood impulses like [...] "stunning ants and feeding them to spiders." [...] A favourite indoor game called [...] "Mean Aunt Rosie" [...] allowed Flynn to cast herself as a [...] "witchy caregiver" [...] who exercised malevolent influence over her cousins. The same essay argues that women fail to acknowledge their own violent impulses and incorporate them into their personal narratives, though men tend to cherish stories of their childhood meanness.|$|E
2500|$|Hofstadter's {{writing is}} {{characterized}} by an intense interaction between form and content, as exemplified by the 20 dialogues in GEB, many of which simultaneously talk about and imitate strict musical forms used by Bach, such as canons and fugues. Most of Hofstadter's books feature some kind of structural alternation: in GEB between dialogues and chapters, in The Mind's I between selections and reflections, in Metamagical Themas between Chapters and Postscripts, and so forth. Both in his writing and in his teaching, Hofstadter stresses the concrete, constantly using examples and analogies, and avoids the abstract. Typical of the courses he teaches is his seminar [...] "Group Theory and Galois Theory Visualized", in which abstract mathematical ideas are rendered as concretely as possible. He puts great effort into making ideas clear and visual, and asserts that when he teaches, if his students do not <b>understand</b> <b>something,</b> it is never their fault but always his own.|$|E

2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you <b>understand</b> <b>something,</b> Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.|$|E
2500|$|Romoşan, who {{had earlier}} denied {{involvement}} with the Securitate, claimed that Negoiţescu had actually both been recruited as an agent since their release from prison in the 1960s, and had spied for the Securitate's foreign bureau during his time in Germany. Speaking after Corlăţan's article, he admitted having functioned as a Securitate informer, but not before 1987, when his wife, writer Adina Kenereş, was threatened with losing her travel privileges. He indicated that his signature on any other such documents was obtained {{with the use of}} violence and intimidation. He argued: [...] "I presently think that I was being used by the Securitate, which destroyed my reputation in order to provide Negoiţescu with a cover", and claims that Negoiţescu himself apologized to him for [...] "all the harm" [...] during a chance meeting in the early 1990s. According to Nistorescu's assessment: [...] "When the threads of Negoiţescu's file will come loose, perhaps I'll <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> from [...] adventure." [...] In contrast, Morar and Ştefan Agopian both assessed that Romoşan's own flight abroad was part of a Securitate diversion. Literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu gave Romoşan's claims {{the benefit of the doubt}} and urged for the Negoiţescu file to be publicized in its entirety, but also asserted that Romoşan had lost his credibility.|$|E
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
6000|$|Agatha thought Thirlwell <b>understood</b> <b>something</b> of her feelings, {{because he}} did not talk except when he showed her the posts.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{immediately}} obvious aspects of the two series' is how they fundamentally contradict one another. In Series a, Blake explicitly states that Man is purely physical and limited to that physicality; [...] "Naturally he is only a natural organ subject to sense", and he [...] "cannot naturally Perceive. But through his natural or bodily organs." [...] Because of this, Man can only understand that which he has already encountered (i.e. he cannot <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> he has not encountered, because {{to do so would}} involve faculties beyond the physical senses); Man [...] "can only compare & judge of what he has already perceiv'd." [...] Man cannot even extrapolate new comprehensions by combining old ones; [...] "From a perception of only 3 sense or 3 elements none could deduce a fourth or fifth." [...] Thus, because man is limited by organic physicality ("None could have other than natural or organic thoughts if he had none but organic perceptions"), both his thoughts and his desires are so limited; [...] "Mans desires are limited by his perceptions. none can desire what he has not perceiv'd." [...] As such, [...] "The desires & perceptions of man untaught by any thing but organs of sense, must be limited to organs of sense." [...] Overall, Series a serves as a declaration of extreme empiricism, which goes much further than any of the empiricist theorists ever took it.|$|E
