25|$|Following {{a failed}} {{run for the}} {{presidency}} in 1996, Gorbachev established the Social Democratic Party of Russia, a union between several Russian social democratic parties. He resigned as party leader in May 2004 following a disagreement with the party's chairman over the direction taken in the 2003 election campaign. The party was later banned in 2007 by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation due to its failure to establish local offices with at least 500 members in the majority of Russian regions, which is required by Russian law for a political organization to be listed as a party. Later that year, Gorbachev founded a new political party, called the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats.</b> In June 2004, he represented Russia at the funeral of Ronald Reagan.|$|E

40|$|The Jewish <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{who founded}} the Bund in 1897 were russified intellectuals who saw the Jewish labour {{movement}} {{as an integral part}} of the Russian revolutionary movement. Thanks to the greater deprivations and higher revolutionary potential of the Jewish workers, the Jewish <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> made contact with the masses earlier than their Russian counterparts. The turn to mass agitation for economic demands as a means of awakening the political consciousness of the masses was given theoretical justification by a leading Vilna <b>Social</b> <b>Democrat,</b> Arkadi Kremer, in Ob Agitatsii (1894) By the mid-nineties a politically led labour movement, centred on Vilna, had developed in the north-west region of the Jewish Pale of Settlement, The leaders of this movement were closely associated with the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>of</b> St. Petersburg and those in exile abroad. From the mid-nineties, the Vilna <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> made deliberate efforts to spread their experience to other cities in Russia. The founding of the Bund in September 1897 was a formalization of the existing labour organization. It was hastened by the imminent prospect of the formation <b>of</b> the ail-Russian <b>Social</b> Democratic Party and by the activities of Arkadi Kremer. Kremer, by his contacts with <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> in Petersburg and Kiev, and with the Plekhanov Group abroad, was also partly instrumental in summoning the First Congress of the RSDRP held in March 1898. The main initiative for this, however, belongs to the Kiev <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats.</b> The Congress was held in Minsk, the seat of the Bund's Central Committee who were responsible for the technical arrangements for the Congress. Kremer became one of the three members of the new Party's Central Committee, and through his association with Plekhanov arranged that the new Party should be represented abroad by the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats.</b> The Congress unanimously agreed to the Bund's request for autonomy in all matters pertaining to the Jewish proletariat.

In 1935 he became head of the Jüdische Künstlerhilfe (Jewish Artists' Aid) of Berlin, also frequently known as the Künstlerhilfe der jüdischen Gemeinde (Artists' Aid of the Jewish Community) of Berlin.
