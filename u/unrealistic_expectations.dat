5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations</b> of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations</b> of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E

25|$|Perfectionism {{is a prime}} {{cause for}} {{procrastination}} because demanding perfection usually results in failure. <b>Unrealistic</b> <b>expectations</b> destroy self-esteem and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, {{it is essential to}} recognize and accept the power of failure without condemning, to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set goals that are easier to achieve.|$|E
25|$|High {{turnover}} {{often means}} that employees are {{dissatisfied with their}} jobs, especially when it {{is relatively easy to}} find a new one. It can also indicate unsafe or unhealthy conditions, or that too few employees give satisfactory performance (due to <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations,</b> inappropriate processes or tools, or poor candidate screening). The lack of career opportunities and challenges, dissatisfaction with the job-scope or conflict with the management have been cited as predictors of high turnover.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be as much {{confusion}} about smart adherence technology as there is whenever a new technology comes on stream. Overzealous journalists tend to confuse science fiction with reality. Marketers and PR departments over promise and engineering and product departments under deliver.

50|$|The French army in {{the center}} of the Western Front needed to match the {{advances}} of its allies. In the Champagne region, this meant breaking through at Blanc Mont. After four years of constant warfare, including 1916's bloody Pyrrhic victory at Verdun and the mutinies of 1917, this was simply an <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectation.</b> Despite three days of heavy fighting, the disheartened French once again failed to retake the stronghold.|$|R
25|$|Biff {{leaves the}} {{restaurant}} in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy has picked up. They leave a confused and upset Willy {{behind in the}} restaurant. When they later return home, their mother angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries unsuccessfully to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father {{that he is not}} meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The feud reaches an apparent climax with Biff hugging Willy and crying as he tries to get Willy {{to let go of the}} <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations.</b> Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed (despite her urging him to follow her), lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he sees his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy idolized. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house. Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out.|$|E
500|$|In 1957 he {{returned}} to his earlier theme on the failings of officer training, in a three-part exposition on the Dardanelles Campaign for The Naval Review, the journal he had helped found over forty years previously. [...] In the concluding article, published in October, 1957, Dewar wrote that the failure of the Navy to adequately support the Army at Gallipoli [...] "is {{to be found in the}} system of training officers which consciously or unconsciously suppressed independent thought and suggestions from subordinates." [...] Despite his later close association with Churchill, he criticised the former First Lord's <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations</b> and also Lord Fisher's inability to rein him in for want of a naval staff; and Admiral of the Fleet (at the time Commodore) Roger Keyes for actively trying to gain support for forcing the straits again instead of acting as chief of staff and only advising the Naval Commander at the Dardanelles.|$|E
500|$|The {{problems}} {{of command and}} cohesion became more acute following the 1793 introduction of mass conscription, the so-called levée en masse. French commanders walked {{a fine line between}} the security of the frontier and the Parisian clamor for victory. Add to this the desperate condition of the Armyin training, supplies, and leadershipand the military leadership faced a disaster. They themselves were constantly under suspicion from the representatives of the new regime and sometimes from their own soldiers. Failure to achieve <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations</b> implied disloyalty and the price of disloyalty was the guillotine: [...] the aged Nicolas Luckner, Jean Nicolas Houchard, Adam Philippe Custine, Arthur Dillon, and Antoine Nicolas Collier all fell under its blade. Francisco de Miranda's failure to take Maastricht landed him in La Force Prison for several years. [...] Many of the old officer class already had emigrated, forming émigré armies; the cavalry in particular suffered from their departure and two entire regiments, the Hussards du Saxe and the 15éme Cavalerie (Royal Allemande) defected en masse to the Austrians. The artillery arm, considered by the old nobility to be an inferior assignment, was less affected by emigration, and survived intact.|$|E

Even if consensus is reached on the function specific unification as a transitional phase, completion of ECEC integration would be hard to realize because the transitional phase may become fixed.

500|$|SS-Obersturmführer Irmfried Eberl was {{appointed}} the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre {{and the only}} physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others {{point out that the}} number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command's wildly <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations</b> of Treblinka's ability to [...] "process" [...] these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague Unterscharführer Hans Hingst, Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: [...] "So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled." [...] On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed {{what was going to happen}} to them. The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to [...] away.|$|E
500|$|Holby City {{has also}} been accused of medical inaccuracies. The British Medical Association denounced a January 2004 episode of the serial which portrayed organ {{donation}} being carried out despite withdrawal of consent by the patient's relatives. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: [...] "This simply would not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme." [...] The British Medical Association later opined that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery. Andrew Thomson, a Dundee GP, deemed this [...] "a terrible distortion of the truth." [...] In a follow-up story for The Times, Vivienne Parry highlighted {{the fact that in}} reality, less than half of patients who require resuscitation survive the initial catastrophe and only a third of those live to leave hospital. At the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth in April 2010, Holby City was accused of fostering <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations</b> of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe in miracles and fuelling compensation culture. Accident and Emergency nurse John Hill stated: [...] "In A it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received. Unfortunately, unlike in Holby City, I am a mere mortal and cannot perform miracles. But many relatives believe because of that, you can. And the injury lawyers assure them that if you don't they will get recompense for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the intense}} and careful {{screening}} that most {{who wish to}} adopt children must go through, sometimes the adoption does not succeed.

30|$|Detailed {{elaboration}} {{of how to}} foster what {{are likely to be}} context-specific means of engaging local communities may be an <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectation</b> for a negotiated, international framework, but the seemingly backward trajectory of the discourse surrounding participation is noteworthy. Given the concern expressed for failures to understand local context and implement HFA at the local scale, the observed shift in language from the Yokohama Strategy to SFDRR, as well as a failure to direct future funding and efforts to understanding place-based vulnerability, raises significant concerns regarding the future management of disaster risks.|$|R
50|$|People fail to {{recognize}} that photo-shop is widely used on models in magazines and in advertisements which gives an <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectation.</b> An online survey in 2010 consisting of 100 girls aged 13-17 was conducted by Girl Scouts.

2500|$|Confusion over Franco-British command {{arrangements}} {{south of}} the Somme was to an extent sorted out on 25 May, when the 51st (Highland) Division was subordinated to Ihler, the IX Corps commander, part of Groupe A (Altmayer) of the Seventh Army (Frère) and the 1st Armoured Division to Groupe A, which then became the Tenth Army. Military Mission 17 led by Lieutenant-General James Marshall-Cornwall, joined the Tenth Army HQ to co-ordinate British operations with the French. The inadequacy of previous command arrangements was exposed by <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectations</b> of the French as to {{the capacity of the}} 1st Armoured Division, which was equipped with fast, lightly armoured light and cruiser tanks, not the heavily armoured types in French armoured divisions.

2500|$|The modern {{presidency}} {{holds the}} president {{as one of the}} nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as [...] "propagandized leadership" [...] which has a [...] "mesmerizing power surrounding the office". Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras. One critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed [...] "in rich detail" [...] which [...] "drew on the power of myth" [...] regarding the incident of PT 109 and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.

Sellars expected this additional cost to eventually be supported by the associate director's finding their own private sponsorships, but this was never achieved. This <b>unrealistic</b> <b>expectation</b> may have come from Sellar's work in American contexts where private support is much more common, whereas in Australia the mix of government, corporate and philanthropic funding is markedly different, especially in Adelaide where few major corporations have their headquarters.|$|R
