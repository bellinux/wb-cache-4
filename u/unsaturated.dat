5|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply <b>unsaturated</b> α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Amaranth oil, {{from the}} seeds of grain {{amaranth}} species, including Amaranthus cruentus and Amaranthus hypochondriacus, high in squalene and <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Artichoke oil, {{extracted}} from {{the seeds of the}} artichoke fruit, is an <b>unsaturated</b> semi-drying oil with potential applications in making soap, shampoo, alkyd resin and shoe polish.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrant {{seed oil}} {{is rich in}} vitamin E and <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids, {{including}} alpha-linolenic acid and gamma-linolenic acid.|$|E
5|$|Snowball {{seed oil}} (Viburnum oil), from Viburnum opulus seeds. High in tocopherol, carotenoides and <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids. Used medicinally.|$|E
5|$|Extensions of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} {{are generally}} also subsumed {{under the same}} name. For example, an α-β, γ-δ <b>unsaturated</b> ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso-Nazarov cyclization reaction. Other such extensions have been given similar names, including homo-Nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous Nazarov cyclizations.|$|E
5|$|In Bertrand's {{persistent}} carbenes, the <b>unsaturated</b> carbon is {{bonded to}} a phosphorus and a silicon. However, these compounds seem to exhibit some alkynic properties, and when published the exact carbenic {{nature of these}} red oils was in debate.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An <b>unsaturated</b> double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly <b>unsaturated,</b> is liquid.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with <b>unsaturated</b> carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with <b>unsaturated</b> carbon bonds.|$|E
5|$|US Navy {{exceptional}} exposure tables use an 8 compartment Haldanean model {{developed by}} Workman, with half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 and 240 minutes, {{and are not}} compatible {{with the rest of}} the US Navy Air tables for repetitive diving, although for convenience they have been appended to the standard US Navy Air tables. The tables warn that no repetitive diving is permitted following an exceptional exposure dive, and although the 240-minute tissue would only desaturate completely in 24 hours, there is no restriction to assuming an <b>unsaturated</b> diver after 12 hours.|$|E
5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. <b>Unsaturated</b> and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of <b>unsaturated</b> fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is <b>unsaturated,</b> and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E
5|$|Prenol lipids are {{synthesized}} {{from the}} five-carbon-unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate that are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. The simple isoprenoids (linear alcohols, diphosphates, etc.) are {{formed by the}} successive addition of C5 units, and are classified according to number of these terpene units. Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as polyterpenes. Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones, which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a quinonoid core of non-isoprenoid origin. Vitamin E and vitamin K, {{as well as the}} ubiquinones, are examples of this class. Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols (called bactoprenols) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains <b>unsaturated,</b> whereas in animal polyprenols (dolichols) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids {{are easy to}} culture {{on a large scale}} in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E
5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an <b>unsaturated</b> cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating A.muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{molecules}} attacked by oxidation are <b>unsaturated</b> fats; oxidation {{causes them to}} turn rancid. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, {{it is important to}} avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in aluminium foil or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.|$|E
5|$|While all the {{reaction}} mechanisms {{of these species}} within the body are not yet fully understood, {{one of the most}} reactive products of oxidative stress is the hydroxyl radical (·OH), which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of lipid peroxidation in the <b>unsaturated</b> lipids within cell membranes. High concentrations of oxygen also increase the formation of other free radicals, such as nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and trioxidane, which harm DNA and other biomolecules. Although the body has many antioxidant systems such as glutathione that guard against oxidative stress, these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that prevent or repair it. Cell damage and cell death then result.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{compounds}} used as polar comonomers are {{vinyl alcohol}} (Ethenol, an <b>unsaturated</b> alcohol), acrylic acid (propenoic acid, an <b>unsaturated</b> acid) and esters containing {{one of the}} two compounds.|$|E
25|$|A {{fatty acid}} is {{characterized}} as either saturated or <b>unsaturated</b> {{based on the}} presence of double bonds in its structure. If the molecule contains no double bonds, it is said to be saturated; otherwise, it is <b>unsaturated</b> to some degree.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>unsaturated</b> alanes are oxygen- and moisture-sensitive, {{they are}} most often {{prepared}} for immediate use without isolation. However, the method of preparation determines {{the configuration of the}} intermediate <b>unsaturated</b> alane, which {{is directly related to the}} configuration of the product (transfer of the alkenyl group occurs with retention of configuration). Thus, an understanding of available hydroalumination methods is important for the study of reactions of <b>unsaturated</b> alanes. This second describes the most common methods of hydroalumination, and subsequent chemical reactions that the resulting alkenylalanes may undergo.|$|E
25|$|Chromium can oxidize allylic {{alcohols}} to alpha-beta <b>unsaturated</b> ketones on {{the opposite}} side of the <b>unsaturated</b> bond from the alcohol. This is via a concerted hetero-Claisen reaction, although there are mechanistic differences since the chromium atom has access to d- shell orbitals which allow the reaction under a less constrained set of geometries.|$|E
25|$|Straight-chain {{fatty acids}} occur in two types: {{saturated}} and <b>unsaturated.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fats contain long {{hydrocarbon}} chains, {{which can}} either be <b>unsaturated,</b> i.e., have double bonds, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations. In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40°C). Partial hydrogenation of the <b>unsaturated</b> fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids made are Palmitoleoyl-ACP (16:1ω7) and cis-vaccenoyl-ACP (18:1ω7).|$|E
25|$|These can {{undergo the}} Wittig {{reaction}} to form α,β <b>unsaturated</b> ketones or aldehydes.|$|E
25|$|Strawberries {{contain a}} modest amount of {{essential}} <b>unsaturated</b> fatty acids in the achene (seed) oil.|$|E
25|$|In other countries, {{there are}} legal limits to trans fat content. Trans fats levels {{can be reduced}} or {{eliminated}} using saturated fats such as lard, palm oil or fully hydrogenated fats, or by using interesterified fat. Other alternative formulations can also allow <b>unsaturated</b> fats {{to be used to}} replace saturated or partially hydrogenated fats. Hydrogenated oil is not a synonym for trans fat: complete hydrogenation removes all <b>unsaturated</b> fats.|$|E
25|$|For <b>unsaturated</b> ligands such as alkenes, one {{electron}} {{is added}} for each carbon atom binding to the metal.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to measure or estimate the actual human consumption of these substances. Highly <b>unsaturated</b> omega-3 rich oils such as fish oil are being sold in pill form so that the taste of oxidized or rancid fat is not apparent. The health food industry's dietary supplements are self regulated and outside of FDA regulations. To properly protect <b>unsaturated</b> fats from oxidation, it is best to keep them cool and in oxygen free environments.|$|E
25|$|In {{both the}} {{saturated}} and <b>unsaturated</b> cases a phosphine ligand is replaced with an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), which {{is characteristic of}} all second-generation-type catalysts.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} zone {{can also be}} saturated, <b>unsaturated</b> or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are vertical, except the flow to subsurface drains.|$|E
25|$|PFOA is also {{synthesized}} by the telomerization represented below, {{where the}} telogen is the organoiodine compound and the taxogen is the <b>unsaturated</b> tetrafluoroethylene.|$|E
25|$|In general, both {{anaerobic}} and aerobic <b>unsaturated</b> {{fatty acid}} synthesis will not occur {{within the same}} system, however Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio ABE-1 are exceptions.|$|E
