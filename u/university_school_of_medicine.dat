5|$|Gerald D. Fischbach (born November 15, 1938) is an American neuroscientist. He {{received}} his M.D. from the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University in 1965 before beginning his research {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health in 1966, where his research focused on the mechanisms of neuromuscular junctions. After his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach was a professor at Harvard University Medical School from 1972–1981 and 1990–1998 and the Washington <b>University</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Medicine</b> from 1981–1990. In 1998, he was named {{the director of the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke before becoming the Vice President and Dean of the Health and Biomedical Sciences, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, and the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Columbia University from 2001–2006. Gerald Fischbach currently serves as the scientific director overseeing the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. Throughout Fischbach's career, much of his research has focused on the formation and function of the neuromuscular junction, which stemmed from his innovative use of cell culture to study synaptic mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Gerald Fischbach {{spent nine}} {{years at the}} Washington <b>University</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Medicine,</b> where he served as the Edison Professor of Neurobiology and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology. During his time here, Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E
