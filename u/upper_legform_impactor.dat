40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is one of}} the key topics of discussion in the area of vehicle safety legislation in Europe and Japan. Leg injuries are the most common injuries found in nonfatal pedestrian accidents. The EC regulation and Euro NCAP are evaluating pedestrian leg protection performance in current vehicles. The TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> is specified by the EC regulation, where Phase 1 took effect during 2005 and a draft phase 2 is scheduled to take effect in 2013. The global technical regulation (GTR) pedestrian protection test protocol was made basically using the TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> However, a flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> has been under development. When the flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> development is fully completed and evaluated, it is possible that both <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> may be determined to be useful in the GTR. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of pedestrian leg protection performance of the frontal area of current vehicles using the TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> Different types of vehicles (sedan, sport utility vehicle (SUV), height wagon, and 1 box car) were used. The center of the bumper and center of the side members (i. e., the vehicles main longitudinal beams) were selected as impact locations for the <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> tests. This paper discusses an equivalence of injury assessment between the TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the biofidelity of LSTC and TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> A finite element model of {{simplified}} front vehicle structure was established. The simulation tests were conducted by using this simplified car model against two different <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> and a FE lower extremity, respectively at a speed of 40 km/h. The simulation results from the two <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> were compare with that of the FE lower extremity. The compared outputs include tibia acceleration, shear displacement, knee bending angle. The test results show that the tibia acceleration of the impactors and the FE lower extremity are approximately consistent. As to the shear displacement and the knee bending angle, though the output of the impactors are not agreed so well with that of the FE lower extremity, the trend are comparable to some extent.

40|$|Abstract—Development, {{calibration}} {{and validation}} of a threedimensional {{model of the}} <b>Legform</b> <b>impactor</b> for pedestrian crash with bumper are presented. Lower limb injury is becoming an increasingly important concern in vehicle safety for both occupants and pedestrians. In order to prevent lower extremity injuries to a pedestrian when struck by a car, {{it is important to}} elucidate the loadings from car front structures on the lower extremities and the injury mechanism caused by these loadings. An impact test procedure with a legform addressing lower limb injuries in car pedestrian accidents has been proposed by EEVC/WG 17. In this study a modified <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> is introduced and validated against EEVC/WG 17 criteria. The finite element model of this legform is developed using LS-DYNA software. Total mass of <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> is 13. 4 kg. Technical specifications including the mass and location of the center of gravity and moment of inertia about a horizontal axis through the respective centre of gravity in femur and tibia are determined.

40|$|Pedestrians and cyclists are {{the most}} {{unprotected}} road users and their injury risk in case of accidents is significantly higher than for other road users. The understanding of the influence and sensitivity between important variables describing a pedestrian crash is key {{for the development of}} more efficient and reliable safety systems. This paper reflects the related work carried out within the AsPeCSS project. The results summarized out of virtual and physical tests provide valuable information for further development. 1168 virtual and 120 physical tests were carried out with adult and child pedestrian headform as well as <b>upper</b> and lower <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> representatives of 4 different vehicle front geometries {{in a wide range of}} impact speeds, angles and locations. This test matrix was based on previous work carried out within the AsPeCSS project. The results obtained show several trends and influences of input variables (impact speed, angle, location, impactor masses, impactor type) on the particular outcomes. In general, impact speed was the most influential parameter. The increase of impact speed resulted in higher HIC, bending moment or force presumably generating a higher injury risk. The work carried out provided the results to enable further development of Injury Risk Curves regarding VRU protection for different body regions. This work provides insight into the variation of injury criteria when also considering different speed and angles which is especially useful for the evaluation of active safety systems (e. g. AEB) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} test {{procedure}} {{proposed by the}} European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC) /WG 17 for evaluating leg injuries to pedestrians, a <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> with a rigid bony structure is used. The risk of damages to knee ligaments is evaluated with the shearing displacement and the bending angle at the knee joint. A recent study has focused on evaluating biofidelity of the legform. However, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a local deformation at the knee joint from published experiments with Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHSs). In addition, past PMHS experiments have suggested that the height of a bumper significantly affects the risk of ligamentous damages. In this study, three kinds of finite element models were used in order to investigate the relationship between the bumper height and the shearing displacement / bending angle of the knee; 1) a <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> with a rigid bony structure, 2) a recently developed pedestrian dummy (Polar) with both a flexible tibia and a biofidelic knee joint structure, 3) a human lower limb. By utilizing the human model, a local deformation at the knee joint could be obtained. The model for the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the pedestrian dummy have been validated against experiments with an actual car and in component level, respectively. The human lower limb model has been validated against published PMHS experiments. The result of a parameter study with these models in a range of bumper heights showed that the dynamic response of the dummy model is quite similar to that of the human model. In addition, it was found that the mass of the upper body significantly affects the bending angle of the knee. A geometric analysis of the knee joint was also performed to obtain tensile strains of four principal knee ligaments as a function of both the shearing displacement and the bending angle. The result suggested that the shearing displacement and the bending angle should be considered in combination when developing an injury criteria for knee ligaments...|$|R

40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is one of}} the main research fields inside the automotive safety and one of the main pillars of innovation in the automotive industry. Data accident shows that each year died 6000 people in Europe as a consequence of a traffic accident. The lower extremities are represented by the lower <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> in the laboratory tests. The lower legform that is being used nowadays is the one of the TRL. The magnitudes that it measures and the biomechanics limits are:- Acceleration; with 150 g as a limit value. - Knee bending angle; angle between tibia and femur, with 15 º as a limit value. - Shear displacement; gap between tibia and femur, with +/- 6 mm as a limit value. The main target of this research project is to obtain a simplified model to analyse and to predict the behaviour of the front of the vehicle in the lower legform pedestrian protection.

In previous built levels it already showed good test results on real cars as well as under idealised test conditions but also revealed further need for improvement. A research study at the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) deals with the question on how leg injury risks of modern car fronts can be revealed, reflected and assessed by the FlexPLI and how the impactor can be used and implemented as a legislative instrument for the type approval of cars according to current and future legislations on pedestrian protection. The latest impactor built level (GTα) is being evaluated by a general review and assessment of the certification procedure, the knee joint biofidelity and the currently proposed injury criteria.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCar-pedestrian {{collision}} fatalities {{have been}} reported for {{a significant number of}} roadside accidents around the world. Protection of pedestrians is taking on an increasingly significant role to car manufactures in developing new designs. The dynamic responses of the pedestrians in vehicle crashes can better be evaluated by examining the biomechanical responses. In order to reduce the lower extremity injuries in car-pedestrian collisions, it is important to determine the impact forces on the pedestrian and conditions that the car frontal side impacts on the lower extremities of the pedestrian. The Working Group 17 (WG 17) of the European Enhanced Vehiclesafety Committee (EEVC) has developed a <b>legform</b> subsystem <b>impactor</b> and procedure for assessing pedestrian collisions and potential injuries. This study describes a methodology for the evaluation of the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> kinematics after a collision utilizing finite element (FE) models of the legform and cars, and comparing the simulation results with the ones from a multi-body legform model as well as a 50 th percentile male human pedestrian model responses. Two approaches are carried out in the process. First, the collision strike simulations with the FE model using an FE lower legform is considered and validated against the EVVC/WG 17 regulation criteria. Secondly, the collision strike simulations with a multi-body legform and an ellipsoidal multi-body car model are conducted to compare the responses from the FE model and the multibody model. The results from the impact simulations of FE legform and the multi-body legform are also compared with the ones from a full-size pedestrian model at different speeds. All the FE models of the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the car model are developed and evaluated using the LSDYNA nonlinear FE code, while the multibody legform, car, and full-sized pedestrian models are developed and evaluated in MADYMO. The results from this study demonstrate the differences between the subsystem legform and the full-size pedestrian responses as well as suitability of various FE and multibody models related to pedestrian impact responses...|$|R
40|$|Current EuroNCAP test {{specifications}} attempt to predict pedestrian lower limb injury in a lateral impact with a rigid legform test device {{developed by the}} UK 2 ̆ 7 s TRL (Transportation Research Lab). Research shows that the measurements taken from this device (knee bending angle, knee shear, and upper tibia acceleration) do not necessarily correspond to accurate injury prediction. Recent {{research suggests that the}} primary improvement to the current test device would be a flexible legform, or one that has more biofidelity (i. e., simulates actual human lower limb response). The work presented in this paper first reviews current legforms developed for pedestrian impact testing, including the TRL impactor used in EuroNCAP tests, Honda 2 ̆ 7 s POLAR II pedestrian dummy, and JAMA/JARI 2 ̆ 7 s FLEX-PLI <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> Component level testing shows the FLEX-PLI performance to be close to the human lower limb response corridors.

The values of maximum tibia acceleration, maximum knee bending angle, and maximum knee shearing displacement have been extracted for 25 dierent accident congurations and compared with their admissible ranges. It has been shown that tibia acceleration is mainly in uenced by extension of the area transferring the impact load between the legform and the vehicle.

To account for one of the limitations of the legform as a device for measuring the stiffness of a surface, a methodology for determining a correction factor using the multi-body modelling software MADYMO is presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the stiffness of the knee joint, in order to provide a basis for developing a biofidelic pedestrian <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> A biofidelic lower limb model was employed to replicate structural responses of the human knee joint by finite element simulations. In the simulation, a single displacement was imposed on the thigh or leg, and constrained six freedoms of the other part.

Considering knee joint kinematics under lateral car-pedestrian impacts, a stiffness matrix was established including lateral bending, lateral shearing and torsion effects that significantly influence pedestrian lower limb injuries. Then, this stiffness matrix was applied in a developed legform model. The structural responses of the legform were obtained by the impact with a family car model.

40|$|The EEVC WG 17 {{upper leg}} test {{as used in}} Euro NCAP was reviewed. Previous work {{revealed}} shortcomings of the EEVC WG 17 test set-up. Recent published accident data show that injuries to the lower extremities by the bonnet leading edge, not including ground impacts, only accounted for 5 % of all AIS 2 + injuries and 4 % of all AIS 3 + injuries. Previous work and this data indicate a discrepancy in importance of the upper leg test between Euro NCAP and real-life injury frequencies. Suggested <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> threshold values have {{so far not been}} based on human injury risk transferred to impactor values. The implications of the proposed improvements to the test set-up from Snedeker et al. (2005) for Euro NCAP test results have not been assessed. Both the above issues are aimed at in this study. They are important as only with the right targets and evaluation methods, traffic related injuries can be minimized. Human injury threshold values for femur and pelvis impact were derived from applicable and original PMHS data. Data was scaled to a mid-sized male, survival analysis with Weibull fit was performed with exact femur 3 -point bending data, logistic regression with doubly censored pelvis impact data. Legform thresholds were derived using a linear regression between impactor and THUMS values derived form tests conducted by Snedeker et al. (2005). It is assumed that THUMS and upper leg surrogates have a similar response. The implications of the new set-up and thresholds for Euro NCAP test results were assessed for results published 2009 and 2010 using empirical relationships between impact energy, measured force and moment. Using this approach, the resulting thresholds to be used with the legform were determined to be 7. 9 - 9. 0 kN for the pelvis test and 300 - 365 Nm for the femur test. These values correspond to 5 and 20 % fracture risk, respectively. With the currently used set-up and limits, the average score for the upper leg test is 22 % of the maximum score. With the proposed method and limits, the average score calculated is 70 %. With only 30 % missing, the score matches better with the accident frequency of bonnet leading edge induced injuries to lower extremities...|$|R
40|$|Statistic studies {{carried out}} during last decades have {{underlined}} as pedestrians - with a prevalence {{of children and}} elderly - are a category with great risk in car accidents, particularly in the urban areas: according to recent investigations of a research committee of the European Community (CEC 2001), {{the risk of death}} in case of accident is, for pedestrians and cyclists, equal respectively to 9 and 8 times vehicle occupants' one. Particularly, in the European Union every year about 7000 pedestrians die (EEVC, European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee, "Improved test methods to evaluate pedestrian protection afforded by passenger cars," 1998; ETSC, European Transport Safety Council, "Safety of Pedestrian and Cyclists in Urban Areas,"[1, 5] 1999); that value represents around the 20 % of the total of death caused from road accidents. In the world, this percentage varies from 14 % in the United States (NTSHA, "Traffic safety facts 1994," 1995) at 47 % in Thailandia (D. Mohan, J. Kajzer, K. Bawa Blialla, S. Chawla, S. Sarabjit, Conference on the Biomechanics of Impacts, 1995). Sensitization of the public bodies and of the private companies towards the problem of pedestrian passive safety allowed the start of systematic study in subject, so that the European Committee, in 1988, appointed a working group (WG 10) which, in the 1994, {{at the end of its}} task, has defined a test protocol for the evaluation of the "aggressiveness" of the front part of the vehicle towards pedestrians.
