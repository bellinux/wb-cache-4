50|$|Gaultheria cuneata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Ericaceae, native to western China. It is a densely branched, dwarf, evergreen shrub growing to 30 cm tall by 100 cm wide, with narrow glossy green leaves and white flowers in spring followed by white berries 1 cm in diameter in autumn. Like others of its family, it is a calcifuge, preferring an acid peaty soil. In cultivation it is used as groundcover for <b>underplanting</b> larger shrubs.|$|E
50|$|Anemone blanda (common names Balkan anemone, Grecian windflower or winter windflower) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Ranunculaceae, native to southeastern Europe, Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria. An herbaceous tuberous perennial, it grows to 15 cm tall and broad. It is valued for its daisy-like flowers which appear in early Spring, a time when little else is in flower. The flowers are an intense shade of purple blue, but are also available in shades of pink and white. It grows in any well-drained soil which dries out in summer; hence it is often used for <b>underplanting</b> deciduous trees which provide the necessary conditions. It rapidly colonises any favoured location. The dark green foliage dies down in summer. This plant and its cultivar A. blanda var. rosea 'Radar', have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
50|$|O'Connell Terrace {{forms the}} {{northern}} edge of the park and was part of the boundary of the QAS grounds. Two Bauhinias (Bauhinia sp) survive from an earlier row of street trees on the footpath. The park edge is defined by low stone wall and hedges (Acalypha sp. and Spiraea sp.). Clumped palms (Chrysalidocarpus lutescens and Syagarus romanzoffiana) mark two pedestrian entries onto pathways through the park.The northern lawns segment extends from the O'Connell Terrace edge across the park to the impressive edge formed by the fig trees (Ficus benjamina) and associated exuberant planting and from Bowen Bridge Road to the eastern pedestrian entry. A set of Brisbane tuff stairs ascends from O'Connell Terrace at the north-west corner to a now open level lawn area which was the site of the Superintendent's cottage from 1914 to 1949. It was later established as a series of circular ornamental beds planted with annuals and surrounded by hedging under Oakman's management. The lawn area is edged by the early plantings of leopard (Caesalpinja ferrea), buahinia (Bauhinia hookeri), flame (Brachychiton acerifolium) and fig (Ficus microcarpa var. Hillii) trees with their associated <b>underplanting</b> that frame the north entrance off Bowen Bridge Road. The central sloping lawn is bisected by a path and planted randomly with a variety of palms. Many of the palms are plantings from the early twentieth century. This portion of the park, formerly containing the glasshouse, cottage and associated nursery activities, served as a separate area to the primary display and recreation areas of the QAS Gardens and the Brisbane Municipal Council's 1914 redevelopment. The Figs (Ficus benjamina) and associated understorey planting may have served as a separation between the areas.|$|E

40|$|Forest {{structural}} change affects the forest’s {{growth and the}} carbon storage. Two treatments, thinning (30 % thinning intensity) and <b>underplanting</b> plus thinning, are being implemented in a coastal Metasequoia glyptostroboides forest shelterbelt in Eastern China. The vegetation carbon storage significantly increased in the underplanted and thinned treatments compared with that in the unthinned treatment (P 0. 05). The soil light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) was significantly higher at the 0 – 15 [*]cm soil layer in the thinned and underplanted stands compared with that in the unthinned stand (P< 0. 05). The soil respiration of the underplanted treatment {{was significantly higher than}} that of the unthinned treatment only in July (P< 0. 05). This study concludes that 30 % thinning and <b>underplanting</b> after thinning could be more favorable to carbon sequestration for M. glyptostroboides plantations in the coastal areas of Eastern China...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Scientists {{typically}} publish {{research results}} in scientific journals in formats, language, and styles {{that are not}} always useful to many professional and general public users. To address this gap in technology transfer, we developed a method to get research published in journal articles out to a broader spectrum of users. This paper uses a study of oak regeneration to illustrate how scientific information can be conveyed to the user in a more useful, applied way. Due to the quantitative and complex technical nature of the published model, its usefulness was limited mainly to scientists {{and others who have}} skills in statistics and computer programming. To communicate these research results to non-scientists we developed an interactive, Internet-based version of the oak regeneration model which we named the Oak <b>Underplanting</b> Success (OAKUS) model. Foresters can use OAKUS online to evaluate combinations of alternative silvicultural treatments (i. e., shelterwood harvest, <b>underplanting</b> oak seedlings and controlling competition) before they actually start the regeneration proces...|$|E

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the relationships}} between the components of relative irradiance and density of parent Norway spruce stand as well as the impact of light on height growth and crown architecture of beech and fir underplantings and natural regeneration of spruce. We observed three variants of regeneration: fir <b>underplanting,</b> beech <b>underplanting</b> and spruce natural regeneration. For each variant three circular research plots with the size 500 m 2 were established. To determine the intensity of relative irradiance 15 hemispherical photographs in the height of 1. 5 m were taken for each variant. The analysis confirmed a significant relationship only between indirect site factor (ISF) and basal area and partly stem number of parent stand. There is almost no influence of spruce overstorey density (within the observed range of basal area and stem number) on the values of total site factor (TSF) and its main component direct site factor (DSF). The relevant predictor for the height increments of underplanted saplings is ISF. Relationship between TSF and height increment is weak. Apical dominance ratio (ADR) that was used to characterize crown architecture is significantly correlated with ISF only for beech and fir. In the case of spruce, increase of light intensity in the observed range does not lead to a significant change of saplings crown architecture...|$|E
40|$|The use of beech {{seedlings}} from South-East European and North-West (NW) provenances for <b>underplanting</b> in coniferous {{forests in}} North-West Europe was investigated {{by means of}} experimental shading. The effects of this treatment on survival, morphology, phenology, physiology and growth were analysed by applying an individual plant growth model integrating these aspects. It was concluded that plant performance under full-light conditions are representative of shaded conditions, so good performing provenances can be selected in a field situation. It was further concluded that good performing South-East European seedlings {{can be used in}} North-West European conditions. The modelling results indicated an interesting trade-off between height growth and biomass increase and different provenances show different strategies. This allows selection of suitable provenances for specific situations, e. g. when beech seedlings need to compete with other plant species in the understorey...|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of the task and the variety of options available, the design of mixed-species forest stands and the development of goal-oriented quantitative silvicultural prescriptions depend on appropriate models, simulators, and algorithms for silvicultural regulations. Scenario analyses and the resulting guidelines for the design of mixed-species stands should ideally consider the entire life cycle of the stand, including how to initially establish, tend, thin, and again regenerate a mixed-species stand after the final harvest. The establishment and management after clearcutting of mixed stands of Norway spruce and common alder or sessile oak and Scots pine are prime examples for starting in mixture right {{from the beginning of the}} rotation. Scenario analyses should also consider how to transform (or transition) existing monocultures into mixed-species stands. For this, the transition of existing Norway spruce monocultures into mixed stands of two species (following canopy openings in the mature stand phase to naturally regenerate spruce, coupled with <b>underplanting</b> of beech) is an important contemporary example.|$|E
40|$|Main {{objective}} of this thesis was searching for optimal management in natural reservation Tesák, which should lead to preservation, eventually increasing and stabilization of silver fir's local population in the future. For these purposes there was carried out field mapping using Field-Map technology, which was targeted to most unsatisfactory part - segment B (from current conditions point of view). Information base for growth simulator Sibyla was formed by field investigation data. It was created and evaluated four alternative management scenarios. Best option was chosen based on their results. After 50. years of management, values of the variables were best with scenarios 4 and 3. These scenarios represented thrifty restoration interventions in spruce part of segment, fencing of insolated parts and <b>underplanting</b> with targeted tree species. A positive result was based mainly on silver fir appearance and its living specimen numbers in the area. At {{the same time there}} would be decline in the numbers of spruce - below 10 %, which would make possibility to classify segment B as naturalness degree III - close to nature...|$|E

There were measured overall 7 parametres (total height of seedlings, seedling height of last year, increment per the last year, length and width of the leaf, root collar diameter and deflection of stem from the vertical axis). Based on weight rating was find out, that each one of preparing stands has different impact to <b>underplanted</b> cultures. Under birch preparing stand was best conditions find out at site, where was density of stand reduced to 30 %.

40|$|The aim of my diploma thesis was to {{evaluate}} growth of <b>underplanted</b> beech, silver fir and Norway spruce on salvage clearings covered by rowan. The second {{aim of the}} thesis was to develop the most suitable techniques for vegetation reconstruction. 19 plots were evaluated {{and the results of}} rowan underplantings were compared among each other. Results of plots with beech underplantings show that plots with low rowan stocking level (0 - 2) have the best growth dynamics. Between stocking 3 - 5 the results of beech growth dynamics are still acceptable, but from stocking 6 the growth dynamics of beech is not favourable anymore. Norway spruce growth dynamic is the best with low stocking of rowan (0 - 2). Higher rowan stocking causes serious reduction in growth dynamics. Divergence of rowan stocking does not cause losses of <b>underplanted</b> trees.
