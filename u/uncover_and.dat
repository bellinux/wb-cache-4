5|$|Abel Starkey was {{a native}} of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The story of Starkey's capture was {{published}} by George Hubbard in The New England Magazine. Starkey was part of a gang of counterfeiters, including Stephen Burroughs, Samuel Corson and James Smith. Pursued by the authorities, Abel Starkey disappeared in the vicinity of a lightning splitter home that was owned by the Shephardson family. A thorough search of the house was conducted and the authorities found nothing. According to Hubbard, the house was the refuge of the counterfeiters for a number of years. After a time the public and authorities continued to track members of the gang to the location and investigations were performed only to turn up empty. Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to <b>uncover</b> <b>and</b> arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken to make sure no secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the chimney was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace. Contained in the trash was some snuff and a sneeze came from above, alerting the officers of hidden occupants in the chimney. After the fire had been extinguished and raked out, Sheriff Johnson attempted to climb up into the chimney. A brick was dropped from above and wounded him. The authorities capped the chimney and smoked the counterfeiters until they fell unconscious. Starkey was amongst the three arrested counterfeiters.|$|E

25|$|The Lost Chapters {{features}} all {{the content}} {{found in the}} original Fable, as well as additional new content such as new monsters, weapons, alignment based spells, items, armour, towns, buildings, and expressions, {{as well as the}} ability to give children objects. The story receives further augmentation in the form of nine new areas and sixteen additional quests. Characters such as Briar Rose and Scythe, who played only minor roles in the original game, are now given more importance and are included in certain main and side quests. Other character-based augmentations include the voice of the antagonist, Jack of Blades, sounding deeper, harsher and more demonic, and the ability to <b>uncover</b> (<b>and</b> resolve) the murder mystery of Lady Grey's sister.|$|E
25|$|In his writings, one of al-Kindi's central {{concerns}} was {{to demonstrate}} the compatibility between philosophy and natural theology on the one hand, and revealed or speculative theology on the other (though in fact he rejected speculative theology). Despite this, he did make clear that he believed revelation was a superior source of knowledge to reason because it guaranteed matters of faith that reason could not <b>uncover.</b> <b>And</b> while his philosophical approach was not always original, and was even considered clumsy by later thinkers (mainly {{because he was the}} first philosopher writing in the Arabic language), he successfully incorporated Aristotelian and (especially) neo-Platonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.|$|E

500|$|In {{many places}} during the nesting season, workers and volunteers search the {{coastline}} for nests, and researchers may also go {{out during the}} evening to look for nesting females for tagging studies and gather barnacles and tissues samples. Volunteers may, if necessary, relocate the nests for protection from threats, such as high spring tides and predators, and monitor the nests daily for disturbances. After the eggs hatch, volunteers <b>uncover</b> <b>and</b> tally hatched eggs, undeveloped eggs, and dead hatchlings. Any remaining live hatchlings are released or taken to research facilities. Typically, those that lack the vitality to hatch and climb to the surface die. Hatchlings use the journey from nest to ocean to build strength for the coming swim. Helping them to reach the ocean bypasses this strength-building exercise and lowers their chances of survival.|$|E

IBM Watson Group will have headquarters in New York's Silicon Alley and will employ 2,000 people. IBM has invested $1 billion to get the division going. Watson Group will develop three new cloud-delivered services: Watson Discovery Advisor, Watson Engagement Advisor, and Watson Explorer. Watson Discovery Advisor will focus {{on research and development}} projects in pharmaceutical industry, publishing, and biotechnology, Watson Engagement Advisor will focus on self-service applications using insights on the basis of natural language questions posed by business users, and Watson Explorer will focus on helping enterprise users <b>uncover</b> <b>and</b> share data-driven insights based on federated search more easily.

500|$|Don and Roger Sterling (John Slattery) {{meet with}} Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the Jewish {{owner of a}} large {{department}} store. Roger, feeling uncomfortable due to the novelty of having a Jewish client, enlists the only Jewish person in the company, {{a young man who}} works in the mailroom, to attend the meeting, disguised {{as a member of the}} art department, in order to make Rachel feel comfortable. Rachel, looking to attract wealthier customers, is disappointed by the agency's suggestions of coupons to attract frugal housewives. The meeting becomes heated, with Don angry that a woman would talk to him in such a commanding way, and Rachel angry that the men will not respect her bold plans for the family business. A later meeting with executives from Lucky Strike tobacco company also appears to go badly, as Don still struggles to find a new approach to cigarette advertising. Pete suggests the [...] "death wish" [...] idea put forth by the company's research, but the executives reject his idea. Just when it seems that the meeting is over, Don comes up with a new tagline—"It's toasted!"—along with a strategy that ignores the question of health risks while extolling the virtues of the supposedly unique way that Lucky Strikes are prepared. The client is impressed, but Don is furious at Pete for literally fishing through Don's trash can to <b>uncover</b> <b>and</b> revive something Don had explicitly rejected.|$|E
