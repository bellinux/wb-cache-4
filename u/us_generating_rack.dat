40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the method of}} the discretization of the gear tooth flank in involute segments for the determination of conjugate gear tooth profiles. Instead of following a point-to-point analytical approach {{to the problem of}} determining the path of contact and the geometry of the <b>generating</b> <b>rack</b> and the mating wheel, the actual tooth flank is considered to be composed of infinitesimal local involutes and therefore a closed solution can be achieved. Due to its simplicity, the method is faster than the standard theory of gearing and this is particularly useful in problems requiring iterative calculations of the tooth geometry such as gear optimization. The method is implemented on modified involute as well as loboid gears used in lobe pumps and it is verified against existing theories. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{teeth of}} {{ordinary}} {{spur and helical}} gears are generated by a (virtual) rack provided with planar generating surfaces. The resulting tooth surface shapes are a circle-involute cylinder {{in the case of}} spur gears, and a circle-involute helicoid for helical gears. Advantages associated with involute geometry are well known. Beveloid gears are often regarded as a generalization of involute cylindrical gears involving one additional degree-of-freedom, in that the midplane of their (virtual) <b>generating</b> <b>rack</b> is inclined with respect to the axis of the gear being generated. A peculiarity of their generation process is that the motion of the generating planar surface, seen from the fixed space, is a rectilinear translation (while the gear blank is rotated about a fixed axis); the component of such translation that is orthogonal to the generating plane is the one that ultimately dictates the shape of the generated, envelope surface. Starting from this basic fact, we set out to revisit this type of generation-by-envelope process and to profitably use it to explore peculiar design layouts, in particular for the case of motion transmission between skew axes (and intersecting axes as a special case). Analytical derivations demonstrate the possibility of involute helicoid profiles (beveloids) transmitting motion between skew axes through line contact and, perhaps more importantly, they lead to the derivation of designs featuring insensitivity of the transmission ratio to all misalignments within relatively large limits. The theoretical developments are confirmed by various numerical examples...|$|R

30|$|The {{combined}} 2015 {{total of}} wind and solar generation from the top five NEMS regions was 154.0 billion kWh of electricity. This is a 108.6 billion kWh increase from 2008 generation in these same regions. Nearly one-third of the regions, including those comprising the southeastern <b>U.S.,</b> <b>generated</b> less than 1 billion kWh from wind and solar combined in 2015. Renewable generation by NEMS regions will be considered when examining how the additional weather-dependent capacity has impacted coal generation patterns.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the greater hours worked by Americans {{compared}} to Germans in terms of forward-looking labor supply responses to differences in earnings inequality between the countries. We argue that workers choose current hours of work to gain promotions and advance {{in the distribution of}} earnings. Since US earnings are more unequally distributed than German earnings, the same extra work pays off more in the <b>US,</b> <b>generating</b> more hours worked. Supporting this inequality-hours hypothesis, we show that in both countries hours worked is positively related to earnings inequality in cross section occupational contrasts and that hours worked raises future wages and promotion prospects in longitudinal data. ...|$|R
