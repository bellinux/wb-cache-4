40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to record and analyze <b>underwater</b> <b>sounds</b> {{generated}} by a small hydraulic cutterhead dredge during maintenance dredging in the Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel (SDWSC), California. Of particular interest was determining 1) the sound frequency characteristics of the excavation process, 2) the received sound pressure levels at various distances from the source, 3) the predicted source level, and 4) ambient sound sources in the study area. These data will fill important knowledge gaps and inform future dredging project management decisions. BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the potential impact of <b>underwater</b> <b>sounds</b> associated with dredging and disposal operations has come under increasing scrutiny by regulatory agencies. Underwater noise has been previously identified as a concern, but has primarily been linked to petroleum industry seismic surveys and construction activities such as pile driving (Richardson et al. 1995). In fact, the scant scientific literature pertaining to the effects o...|$|R

2500|$|Sonar (originally {{an acronym}} for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a {{technique}} that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or {{under the surface of}} the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the name [...] "sonar": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of [...] "targets" [...] in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.|$|E
