40|$|This paper {{presents}} a research into reliability calculations of agriculture double <b>universal</b> joint <b>shafts</b> based on temperature measuring in cardan-type universal joint bearing assemblies. Special laboratory equipment {{was developed for}} this research which {{is presented in the}} paper. The objective of this research was to test the real life span of <b>universal</b> joint <b>shafts</b> in the laboratory and in field, to obtain the results which can be used to improve the reliability of <b>universal</b> joint <b>shafts.</b> If the presented research were used along with maintenance measures recommended in the paper and with proper use, the level of reliability of the shafts would be 2. 1 times higher. The presented results of the research showed that needle bearings, i. e. bearing assemblies of the joints, are the most critical elements on <b>universal</b> joint <b>shafts</b> and are possible causes of their lower reliability. The second universal joint is the part with the lowest reliability in the observed technical system. ...|$|R
50|$|TNX 5.2R (TGM-04) is {{basically}} {{the same as the}} TNX, but mounts a larger and more powerful 5.2 cm³ engine, instead of the 3 cm³ engine. Aside from the engine upgrade, Tamiya made a few minor modifications to improve the truck's performance. Weight was further reduced to 4.4 kg. The dual shocks were simplified to a single shock, and <b>universal</b> <b>shafts</b> were also simplified to the dog-bone type universals. The on-board starting system was abandoned for hand-held starting motor, which further saved weight.|$|R

The performance of the rolling mill depends on the <b>Universal</b> joint <b>shaft</b> through which the power is transmitted to the rollers of a mill. This paper mainly focuses on the modal analysis of <b>universal</b> joint <b>shaft</b> for rolling mills because this shaft is subjected to vibrations caused due to the jerk produced during the passing of billet through the rollers.

The model is solved by the state space method. The influence of the angle between transmission shafts and intermediate support stiffness on the vibration and noise of the main reducer is obtained and verified experimentally.

5000|$|SP 9113 when being rebuilt {{carried the}} {{unofficial}} identity 'SPMW #1'. The railroad's traffic computer required 4 digits, {{and so it}} emerged from the shop bearing a small SPMW 1166 stencil. In June 1969 it was renumbered to SP 8799, in standard Southern Pacific locomotive lettering configuration. The most drastic change in appearance was the locomotive's short hood (or [...] "nose"), which had been removed. In its place, a custom structure was fabricated to house twin Mitchell 35-millimeter film cameras and Nagra III timecode magnetic recording equipment, with stand-up headroom and two seats salvaged from another KM for operators. Heavy, thick steel was used for collision protection and to replace lost weight. The front Voith L830rU transmission was removed to create space for the camera enclosure, while the Number 1 radiator compartment was emptied of radiators and ancillary equipment to house an Onan skid-mount generator to power the camera equipment. The two engines and rear transmission were simply disabled, principally being retained for weight. All gearboxes and Cardan (<b>universal)</b> <b>shafts</b> were removed; gears were left in place on the six axles. All of the controls remained in the cab {{so that it could}} control a locomotive pushing behind it, much like a cab car is used on a commuter train. The camera car could be put on the lead of any train, but it primarily operated as special trips with just one locomotive behind it for power. Known locomotives used for power are a single EMD F7 B-unit, an EMD GP-9, an EMD GP35, and a Cotton Belt (St. Louis Southwestern) SD45T-2.|$|R

Automatic restarting of the engine was provided. Electric direction indicators were now built into the body pillars.|$|R

50|$|In 1959 Austin Mini was {{launched}} by the British Motor Corporation, designed by Alec Issigonis {{as a response to}} the first 'oil crisis', the 1956 Suez Crisis, and the boom in bubble cars that followed. It was the first production front-wheel-drive car with a watercooled inline four-cylinder engine mounted transversely. This allowed eighty percent of the floor plan for the use of passengers and luggage. The majority of modern cars use this configuration. Its progressive rate rubber sprung independent suspension, low centre of gravity, and wheel at each corner with radial tyres, gave a massive increase in grip and handling over all but the most expensive cars on the market. It used GKN designed Constant-velocity joint drive <b>shaft</b> <b>universal</b> joints.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: _It {{is known}} that speed control on the {{universal}} motor by means of microprocessors is very complex and expensive. However, the speed control application on universal motor by peripheral interface controller (PIC) may be done with more simple hardware and software program. Generally, the microcontrollers are preferred because of their capability to find solutions {{for all kinds of}} control problems that couldn’t be solved by the microprocessors. Hence, they have been developed rapidly and used in various fields recently. Also due to superior capabilities of the PIC, they are preferred on the universal motor speed control. Usually, two different methods have been used on the universal motor speed controls; one is period measuring and the other is frequency measuring. In this study, both methods were applied on the universal motor speed control. The triggering angles of the triac were changed with feedback received from the tachogenerator that was coupled to the <b>universal</b> motor <b>shaft</b> and the speed of the universal motor was ensured to remain stable under the variable load. The working principle of the program and the written text of the program were presented in this study. In addition to the application results, the suggestions on the advantages and development of with microcontroller system have been made. In conclusion, it was found that this application may be more secure speed control method than the others...|$|R

40|$|The axial {{proteins}} of the bacterial flagellum {{function as}} a drive <b>shaft,</b> <b>universal</b> joint, and propeller driven by the flagellar rotary motor; they also form the putative protein export channel. The N- and C-terminal sequences of the eight axial proteins were predicted to form interlocking α-domains generating an axial tube. We report on an ≈ 1 -nm resolution map of the hook from Salmonella typhimurium, which reveals such a tube made from interdigitated, 1 -nm rod-like densities similar to those seen in maps of the filament. Atomic models for the two outer domains of the hook subunit were docked into the corresponding outermost features of the map. The N and C termini of the hook subunit fragment are positioned {{next to each other}} and face toward the axis of the hook. The placement of these termini would permit the residues missing in the fragment to form the rod-like features that form the core domain of the hook. We also fit the hook atomic model to an ≈ 2 -nm resolution map of the hook from Caulobacter crescentus. The hook protein sequence from C. crescentus is largely homologous to that of S. typhimurium except for a large insertion (20 kDa). According to difference maps and our fitting, this insertion is found on the outer surface of the hook, consistent with our modeling of the hook...|$|R
