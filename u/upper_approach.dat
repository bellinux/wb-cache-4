The locks were {{carefully}} {{designed to address}} the great variation in {{the height of the}} river, the difference between high and low water being 55 ft. This condition made it necessary to build a series of three sets of gates, increasing in height from the lower entrance to the huge upper guard gate, only two sets being used at one time. When the river was low, the upper guard gates remained open continually and the lower sets were operated. When the water rose enough to drown the lower gates, they were swung open and the lifting work was done by the others. The <b>upper</b> <b>approach</b> was formed by masonry wall extending from the guard gate in a long sweep of 1200 ft, and the bank behind was armored against floods with riprapped stone.|$|E

University-affiliated hospital. Population. Women who underwent laparoscopic gynecologic surgery the <b>upper</b> quadrant <b>approach</b> between January 2002 and December 2010. Methods. Medical records were reviewed. Main outcome measures. Demographic data, past surgical histories, indications for surgery and {{the use of}} the left <b>upper</b> quadrant <b>approach,</b> intraoperative findings, diagnosis and any complications. Results. 143 patients were identified, accounting for 4. 9 % of all gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. The indications for using the left <b>upper</b> quadrant <b>approach</b> were: previous open abdominal surgery (113, 79. 0 %), surgery in the second trimester of pregnancy (16, 11. 1 %), presence of large pelvic mass (9, 6. 2 %), previous transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap for breast reconstruction (3, 2. 0 %), previous periumbilical hernia repair (1, 0. 6 %) and previous laparoscopic umbilical wound dehiscence (1, 0. 6 %). In women with previous abdominal surgery, the overall incidence of adhesions between omentum and/or bowel to the anterior abdominal wall in the umbilical region was 58. 4 %. Twelve (8. 3 %) patients required conversion to laparotomy. One patient had subcutaneous surgical emphysema over the left upper quadrant entry site. Conclusions. The left <b>upper</b> quadrant <b>approach</b> is an effective, safe and easy technique for peritoneal cavity access in women undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery and should be considered in women with risk factors of periumbilical adhesions and in the presence of a large pelvic mass. © 2011 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{classical}} <b>upper</b> bound <b>approach</b> of limit {{analysis is}} based on assumption of rigid blocks of deformation that move between lines of tangential displacement discontinuity. This assumption leads to considerable simplification but often at cost of higher estimate of the actual load. Moreover, in many cases, it does not give a correct shape of the plastic field. In order to overcome these limitations a modified <b>upper</b> bound <b>approach</b> is proposed in this article. The proposed approach is basically an energetic approach but unlike the classical <b>upper</b> bound <b>approach</b> {{it is capable of}} including presence of statically governed stress field. As an application, of proposed approach, theoretical plane strain solutions are presented for deeply cracked fracture mechanics specimens (single edge cracked specimen in pure bending – SE (PB), single edge cracked specimen in three-point bending – SE (B), and compact tension – C (T) specimens). Plane strain plasticity problem in rigid elastic–plastic mono-material (homogeneous) was solved to evaluate useful parameters like limit load, plastic eta function (ηp) and plastic rotation factor (rp) and in bi-material (mismatch welds) to evaluate mismatch limit load, for deeply cracked specimens. New kinematically admissible velocity fields are proposed for SE (B) and C (T) specimens. Proposed theoretical solutions were confirmed by classical slip-line field solutions, wherever available, and by detailed elastic–plastic finite element analysis with Von-Mises yield criterion. Good agreement was found between proposed solutions and results obtained from the classical slip-line field theory and finite element analysis...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the positive and}} normative analysis of endogenous R&D investment on two types of resources: renewable and non-renewable. The specificity of the paper has {{to be found in}} the following assumption: resource-specific R&D investment allows to increase the efficiency of re-source exploitation, but the feasible efficiency improvements are globally bounded from above. We make this crucial assumption to take into ac-count the second principle of thermodynamics. It has important implica-tions for the analysis. First, the system does not admit any balanced path for the decentral-ized economy, because the growth rate in the efficiency of exploitation of any resource cannot be constant. Both effort in R&D sectors is decreasing since the marginal reward to R&D activity declines as the <b>upper</b> bound <b>approaches.</b> Second, in the decentralized economy, R&D effort is decreas-ing in the resource-specific efficiency level, because the marginal reward to R&D activity declines as the <b>upper</b> bound <b>approaches.</b> As a consequence, the share of resources devoted to R&D falls asymptotically towards zero. Third, the finiteness of efficiency improvements together with that of the non-renewable resource supply, imply that the initial conditions deter-mine the qualitative feature of the transition path. In this case, R&D firms make choices taking into account a limited time horizon since suc-cessive innovations make patents obsolete. R&D tends to concentrate in the resource sector where the demand is the largest and where the scope for efficiency improvement is the highest. When the first effect dominates, the technological gap increases, giving rise t...|$|R

30|$|In our study, both {{superior}} and middle calyceal puncture were favorable for achieving complete stone clearance. Studies conducted by Aron et al. (2004) and Netto et al. (2005) had shown better results with superior calyceal puncture. The <b>upper</b> calyceal <b>approach</b> {{is believed to}} favor good manipulations of the nephroscope and forceps within the pelvicalyceal system while the lower calyceal approach caused undue angulations, and torque. This difference {{is believed to be}} because of the straight tract of the upper infundibulum along the long axis of the kidney and the anatomical lie of the kidney over iliopsoas muscle that cause the upper pole positioned more posterior as compared with the lower pole and these two factors provide excellent visualization of the pelvicalyceal system when an approach is made through the upper calyx (Singh et al. 2015). But the disadvantage with the <b>upper</b> calyceal <b>approach</b> {{is that it is not}} always subcostal, and may necessitate supracostal puncture which may cause serious thoracic complications. The upper pole of each kidney lies anterior to the posterior portion of the 11 th and 12 th ribs and during exhalation the lower limit of the parietal pleura crosses these ribs obliquely, such that the lateral portions of these ribs are inferior and lateral to the lower limit of the pleura (Munver et al. 2001). The incidence of thoracic complication during supracostal punctures in various studies ranges between 3 and 16  % (Sukumar et al. 2008; Lojanapiwat and Prasopsuk 2006). Keeping this consideration in mind while choosing puncture site, the middle calyceal puncture was very common in our study and almost equally good results were achieved using middle calyceal puncture as the upper calyceal puncture.|$|R
