25|$|The {{works of}} Paul Gauguin had {{achieved}} {{center stage in}} the avant-garde circles of Paris following the powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906.

The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to Les Demoiselles in 1907.

40|$|Gatekeepers {{in social}} {{research}} constitute an interesting social phenomenon as powerful and normally <b>unpaid</b> <b>agents</b> of research access. Yet, questions {{relating to the}} recruitment of potential gatekeepers and {{to the nature of}} the rewards than they might seek are under-considered and locating key gatekeepers is often characterised as a matter of luck or happenstance. This paper suggests that access to gatekeepers in the conduct of social research is critical when engaging with elite organisations and that it is something which cannot be left to chance but needs to be systematically pursued. Using the example of the shipping industry the paper explains how social researchers can make use of their understandings of the non-pecuniary motivations of gatekeepers in seeking research access. Negotiations with gatekeepers are more likely to succeed when researchers are able to mobilise non-financial resources which have some alternative form of ‘exchange value’. Every year executives come together at commercially organized conferences focussed upon human resource management in the shipping industry. At these events, major global players discuss a programme of issues related to the business of recruiting and training seafarers. However, these international conferences are both much more and much less than they seem. This paper explores their purpose and in doing so reveals the ways in which they can be useful to social researchers. It argues that unlike most conferences these can only be seen as ‘field configuring events’ to a very limited extent but that they nonetheless serve an important purpose in securing symbolic, and more significantly reputational, capital for both individual delegates and interested academics. The paper argues that researchers can mobilise such capital in their favour in negotiating research access...|$|R

That, on {{complaint}} of those proceedings, the said Hastings did {{of his own}} authority, and without communicating with his Council, direct the native collector aforesaid to be removed, and the territory of Furruckabad {{to be left to}} the sole management of its natural prince. But in a short time the said Hastings, pretending to receive many complaints purporting that the tribute to the Nabob remained wholly <b>unpaid,</b> and the <b>agent</b> to the prince of Furruckabad at the Presidency, and afterwards chief manager to the prince aforesaid, having, as the said Warren Hastings saith, [...] "had the insolence to propagate a report that the interference to which his master owed the power he then enjoyed was purchased through him," [...] he, the said Hastings, did again (but, as before, without the Council) [...] "withdraw his protection and interference altogether," [...] on or about the month of August, 1782, and did signify his resolution, through the Resident, Middleton, to the Nabob Vizier. But the said Hastings asserts that [...] "the consequence of this his own second dereliction of the prince of Furruckabad was an aggravated renewal of the severities exercised against his government, and the reappointment of a sezauwil, with powers delegated or assumed, to the utter extinction of the rights of Muzuffer Jung, and actually depriving him of the means of subsistence." [...] And the said Hastings did receive, on the 16th of February, 1783, from the prince aforesaid, a bitter {{complaint of}} the same to the following tenor.|$|R

5000|$|Brenda Helt, in The Making and Managing of American Modernists: Norman Holmes Pearson and the Yale Collection of American Literature, {{based in}} part on Pearson’s {{unpublished}} letters, examines his role in developing that collection. He used his personal connections with authors like H. D., Bryher, Ezra Pound, and Gertrude Stein to acquire major collections of their work for Yale. Reciprocally, Pearson used his authoritative position to further interest in and obtain publishers for the work of these modernists, securing their reputations for posterity and facilitating the success of some of their best work. He states that Pearson worked tirelessly as H.D.’s tactful editor, as well as her literary advisor and (<b>unpaid)</b> <b>agent,</b> roles that had a significant positive effect on {{the quantity and quality of}} her late work. Pearson promoted Pound’s work apart from his political involvements, helping to prevent it from being “disappeared" [...] due to Pound's very unpopular World War II politics and consequent incarceration at St. Elizabeths Hospital (a psychiatric hospital operated by the District of Columbia Department of Mental Health).|$|E
