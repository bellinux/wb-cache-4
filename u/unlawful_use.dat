25|$|The Rebel Heart tour {{included}} controversies like late {{start of}} the show, <b>unlawful</b> <b>use</b> of the country's flags as well as ticket goof-ups. Her appearance in Manchester attracted large criticism from fans, who booed at her for her late arrival. Madonna responded to the audience during the show, stating that {{it was due to}} technical difficulties. During her first concert in Hong Kong and Taipei, Madonna was two-and-a-half hours late; the former caused a small protest outside the show. Another late incident happened for the shows in Brisbane.|$|E

The creation of the Non-Intervention Committee did not obstruct the sending of gold to France, and the government of Prime Minister Largo Caballero, formed in September of the same year, continued the former Government's policy. French and British governments disregarded the complaints of Nationalist authorities about the allegedly <b>unlawful</b> <b>use</b> of the gold.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark the <b>unlawful</b> <b>use</b> of {{coats of}} arms and other {{insignia}} of Danish and foreign authorities is a criminal offence (Danish Criminal Code §§ 132-133). Non-official coats of arms are not protected. A specific rendition of a coat of arms is protected through copyright law and a coat of arms {{can be used as}} a trademark and will thus be protected by trademark law. There is no official heraldic authority for private arms in Denmark. Most insignia used by municipalities are regulated by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State (an office under the Danish National Archives). Registration by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State is a prerequisite for protection of official Danish insignia under the Criminal Code's §§ 132-133. Protection of an insignia in terms of trademark law requires registration by the trademark authorities. If an insignia is registered by the Heraldic Consultant, trademark rights are automatically acquired as well.|$|E

The Court stated that this was because the statute amounted to a wholesale statutory ban on the exercise of a personal right that was specifically named in and guaranteed by the United States Constitution, as construed by the United States Supreme Court. [...] A conviction for Unlawful Possession of a Firearm (UPF) was proper because the possession of handguns by minors was conduct that fell outside the scope of the Second Amendment's protection.|$|E

500|$|In December 2011, Keef {{left his}} grandmother's home holding a coat over {{his hands in}} front of his waistband. A {{policeman}} stopped to question the rapper, who dropped the coat, flashed a handgun and ran away. Officers chased then 16-year-old Keef, who turned around several times and pointed the gun at them. The policemen [...] "discharged their weapons," [...] but missed. They caught him a half-block later and recovered the pistol, which was loaded. Keef was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm on a police officer and aggravated <b>unlawful</b> <b>use</b> of a weapon. He was also given a misdemeanor charge for resisting arrest. He was held in the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center until a judge sentenced him to home confinement at his grandmother’s house.|$|E
500|$|Illinois was {{the last}} {{state in the nation}} to allow {{concealed}} carry of a handgun. [...] Prior to 2013, Illinois prohibited the carry of a firearm in a loaded condition, other than at one's own property. [...] If the firearm was loaded and not in a locked case, or if it was otherwise available for immediate use, it was a felony offense called Aggravated <b>Unlawful</b> <b>Use</b> of a Weapon (AUUF). [...] Illinois courts had uniformly upheld the constitutionally of the statute prior to 2008. [...] The state also had a law called Unlawful Possession of a Firearm (UPF), which prohibited anyone under the age of 18 from possessing a firearm. [...] Additionally, the City of Chicago had enacted strict gun control laws prohibiting the possession of any handgun that had not been registered prior to 1982, when the law took effect.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Keef first earned local {{attention}} from Chicago's South Side community with his mixtapes, The Glory Road and Bang. In December, Keef fired gunshots from a Pontiac Grand Prix in Chicago's Washington Park neighborhood. Police {{showed up at}} the scene and the incident resulted in Keef being arrested and charged with <b>unlawful</b> <b>use</b> of a weapon. Keef was consequently placed under house arrest at his grandmother's house for 30 days, followed by another 30 days of home confinement. It has been noted that by the time this incident occurred, Keef had already achieved local South Side popularity, and that much of his early fan base consisted of high school students in the area. While under house arrest, Keef posted several videos to his YouTube account. These videos were at the forefront of Chicago's hip hop subgenre, drill. The attention he received increased during the short time between the release of his mixtapes, Bang and Back From the Dead, and music videos, including [...] "Bang", [...] "3Hunna" [...] and [...] "I Don't Like". Once his house arrest ended, WorldStarHipHop released a video of a child hysterically celebrating Keef's release from house arrest, affording Keef further virality. Early in his music career, Keef's song [...] "I Don't Like" [...] became a local hit in Chicago, which was described by a local party promoter, as [...] "the perfect Chicago song because 'niggas just hate everything out here.'" [...] It also caught fellow Chicago rapper Kanye West's attention, and West created a remix of the song with rappers Pusha T, Jadakiss and Big Sean. In response to these events, David Drake of Spin writes that in 2012, Keef [...] "suddenly shot up out of obscurity." ...|$|E

500|$|After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington {{issued a}} {{statement}} apologizing for repeating the word on the Golden Globes carpet. On January 30, 2007, a source told People magazine that Washington was scheduled {{to return to the}} Grey's Anatomy set as early on that Thursday {{for the first time since}} entering [...] "executive counseling" [...] after making the comments at the Golden Globes. However, on June 7, 2007, ABC announced it had decided not to renew Washington's contract, and that he would be dropped from the show. [...] "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore," [...] Washington said in a statement released by his publicist, borrowing the famous line from Network. In another report, Washington stated he was planning to [...] "spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, work on an independent film and avoid worrying about the show." [...] In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that [...] "they fired the wrong guy", referring to Knight, and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey's Anatomy. Washington, in late June 2007, began asserting that racism within the media was a factor in his firing from the series. On July 2, 2007, Washington appeared on Larry King Live on CNN, to present his side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who, he felt, was treating him like a [...] "B-word," [...] a [...] "P-word," [...] and the [...] "F-word," [...] which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back." [...] Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past. He later stated that if he were to be asked to make a cameo appearance on the show, he would not hesitate to say [...] "yes". Washington's image was used in advertisements for the May 9, 2008 episode [...] "The Becoming". After this aired, Washington's attorney Peter Nelson contacted ABC and Screen Actors Guild and cited this as an <b>unlawful</b> <b>use</b> of his client's image. His publicist, Howard Bragman, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "they have the rights of the character to advance the story, but not the image" [...] and stated he expected this to result in a [...] "financial settlement", but it is still uncertain whether this ultimately happened.|$|E
