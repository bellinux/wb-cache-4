Therefore, they facilitate the set up of the uncertainty budget of the analysis, which can then be expressed in mathematical form. If the uncertainty is calculated as the Gaussian sum of all uncertainty parameters, {{it is necessary to}} quantitate them all, a task that is usually not practical. The other possible approach is to use the intermediate precision as a base for the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>calculation.</b> In this case, it is at least necessary to consider the uncertainty of the purity of the reference material in addition to the precision data.

40|$|Abstract — With {{the goal}} of the {{realization}} of a primary standard of amount-of-substance fraction of VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) at trace level, a dynamic generator is constructed, based on the diffusion phenomena, according to ISO 6145 - 8. Generator will be followed by a dilution system. In the present paper, generator performances are discussed. The analysis of ISO 6145 - 8 shows that temperature control gives the main contribution to uncertainty. The use of a more precise temperature and evaporated VOC mass results to be the main contribution. Weekly measurements of diffusion rate demonstrate the correct <b>uncertainty</b> <b>calculation</b> and the enhances due to the more precise temperature control. Uncertainty of diffusion rate was calculated as composed uncertainty of measured variables to be 0, 4 % for 20 µg/min by weekly measurements instead 0. 8 % calculated for the ISO 6145 - 8 conditions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a method is {{demonstrated}} {{which allows the}} user to carry out <b>uncertainty</b> <b>calculations</b> in arbitrary 3 -dimensional radiation transport problems in an easy and straightforward manner. Although 3 D uncertainty tools do exist their use is very limited because they are tied to 3 D deterministic radiation transport codes, which are not commonly used because of their complexity. The method we present makes use of the 3 D Monte Carlo code MCNP, which is world-wide {{the most commonly used}} radiation transport code. Using standard options of MCNP we produce a sensitivity profile, which is converted to an uncertainty value. This conversion may be carried out by a suitable uncertainty code. In the current work we used the modular code SUSD. Because of the minimal effort needed to carry out these analyses, 3 -D <b>uncertainty</b> <b>calculations</b> may be performed as standard practice. Design calculations for advanced nuclear systems (such as Generation-IV reactors and ADS systems) may greatly benefit from this development. Increased insight may be obtained from neutronics design <b>calculations,</b> as <b>uncertainty</b> bands may be associated to critical design parameters. Note, however, that proper covariance data are an essential ingredient in the analysis. Unfortunately these data are rather scarce. We strongly support the current initiatives to produce high-quality covariance datalibraries for all relevant isotopes. ...|$|R
