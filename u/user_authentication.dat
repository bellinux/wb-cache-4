25|$|TFTP is {{a simple}} {{protocol}} for transferring files, implemented {{on top of the}} UDP/IP protocols using well-known port number 69. TFTP was designed to be small and easy to implement, and therefore it lacks most of the advanced features offered by more robust file transfer protocols. TFTP only reads and writes files from or to a remote server. It cannot list, delete, or rename files or directories and it has no provisions for <b>user</b> <b>authentication.</b>|$|E
25|$|When an {{operating}} system is {{running on a}} system without file encryption, access to files normally goes through OS-controlled <b>user</b> <b>authentication</b> and access control lists. However, if an attacker gains physical access to the computer, this barrier can be easily circumvented. One way, for example, would be to remove the disk {{and put it in}} another computer with an OS installed that can read the filesystem; another, would be to simply reboot the computer from a boot CD containing an OS that is suitable for accessing the local filesystem.|$|E
25|$|Besides content filtering, other {{imperfect}} {{methods for}} cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One {{example is the}} use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based <b>user</b> <b>authentication.</b> Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies. To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.|$|E

2500|$|File sharing is {{an example}} of {{transferring}} large amounts of data across the Internet. A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a [...] "shared location" [...] or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of [...] "mirror" [...] servers or peer-to-peer networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by <b>user</b> <b>authentication,</b> the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed– usually fully encrypted– across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.|$|E

2500|$|A wiki enables {{communities}} of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively. All that people require to contribute is a computer, Internet access, {{a web browser}} and {{a basic understanding of}} a simple markup language (e.g., HTML). A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a [...] "wiki page", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well-interconnected by hyperlinks, is [...] "the wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows non-linear, evolving, complex and networked text, while also allowing for editor argument, debate and interaction regarding the content and formatting. A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review by a moderator or gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website. Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of user accounts. Many edits can be made in real-time and appear almost instantly online. However, this feature facilitates abuse of the system. Private wiki servers require <b>user</b> <b>authentication</b> to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them. Maged N. Kamel Boulos, Cito Maramba and Steve Wheeler write that the open wikis produce a process of Social Darwinism. [...] " 'Unfit' sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled, edited and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page. While such openness may invite 'vandalism' and the posting of untrue information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a 'quality' wiki page." ...|$|E

40|$|Access {{management}} {{illustrates the}} process of providing controlled, and secure access to resources. It involves both authentication—{{the process of}} determining the validity of a user who claims to be, and autorisation—the process of determining what resources a user is permitted to access. Access management is significant as an important {{as well as one}} of the key services for the network infrastructure of digital repository activities {{for a wide range of}} audiences. Like the digital collection of digital repository, it also requires that the content be accessed and distributed as widely as possible to valid users around the globe. Access management and control is one of the major concerns for digital content authority over the Internet. Confidentiality and integrity of information cannot be ensured without a proper access management mechanism. Though most of the Institutional Repositories or Open Access Repositories are satisfied with the current mechanisms of the Open Source Software, which they use to build the repositories, restricted repositories or digital libraries demand more security and authenticity. The paper discusses the current practices and issues of access management for digital repositories including <b>user</b> <b>authentications,</b> <b>user</b> authorisation, <b>authentication,</b> and the technology of secured digital communication of digital materials.
