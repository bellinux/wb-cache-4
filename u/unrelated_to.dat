5|$|According to the {{population}} census of 2011, there are 43 Jews in Mauritius. The current community is <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> the 1940s fugitives. The first Bar Mitzvah in Mauritius since World War II took place in 2000.|$|E
5|$|IC in a Sunflower {{consists}} of seven short stories, a format that Mitsukazu Mihara frequently uses for her narrative. The stories are <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> each other, each featuring a different protagonist. The stories of IC in a Sunflower sometimes incorporate a twist ending.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, Mehdi Hashemi, the leaker of the scandal, was {{executed}} in 1987, allegedly for activities <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> the scandal. Though Hashemi made a full video confession to numerous serious charges, some observers find the coincidence of his leak {{and the subsequent}} prosecution highly suspicious.|$|E
2500|$|What ties most of {{the stories}} {{together}} is that they are an examination and deconstruction of incest. In the context of his [...] "tales" [...] Heinlein examines the morality of a variety of possible incestuous situations: from <b>unrelated</b> [...] "twins", <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> parent-child, <b>to</b> distant relatives, and finally close relatives when Lazarus sleeps with his own mother. Heinlein seems to conclude that, absent genetic risk, it is not immoral at all.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Liberty Reserve {{was linked}} <b>to</b> (<b>unrelated)</b> {{attempts}} <b>to</b> sell thousands of stolen Australian bank account numbers and British bank cards. In 2012, {{a group of}} hackers attempted to blackmail anti-virus software company Symantec into transferring $50,000 into a Liberty Reserve account.|$|R

5|$|Many {{bird species}} arid regions across {{southern}} Australia are nomadic; they follow {{water and food}} supply {{around the country in}} an irregular pattern, <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> season but related to rainfall. Several years may pass between visits to an area by a particular species.|$|E

5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> oil and energy.|$|E
5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Super Paper Mario, was {{developed}} by Intelligent Systems and released for the Wii in 2007. It has a stronger emphasis on platforming than its predecessor. Super Paper Marios plot is <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> the story of The Thousand-Year Door, but it contains many easter eggs referencing characters from the previous two games.|$|E

5|$|An {{adaptation}} of the visual novel, the anime takes place in an alternate reality. The main female characters and their relations are unchanged, but the storyline is <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> the game's. The plot follows {{the perspective of the}} three sisters and their maid rather than the game's protagonist; all the game's major female characters appear and many of the minor characters are used in supporting or cameo roles.|$|E
5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (<b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Applying the {{proceeds}} of a book deal, the family moved in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago. The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> Obama.|$|E
50|$|Ultraviolet {{incorporates}} technology traditionally used in <b>unrelated</b> fields <b>to</b> {{drive and}} control the “psycho taste” and enhance the perception of food.|$|R

5|$|Garland {{began writing}} the script in 2006, {{although}} {{the development of}} a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Warren Jeffs {{was convicted}} in Texas on sexual assault charges <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> Wall's case and {{sentenced to life in}} prison plus 20 years.

50|$|Demos is <b>unrelated</b> either <b>to</b> the US {{think tank}} {{of the same}} name or to Demos Helsinki, the Nordic {{research}} and development organisation.|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{cognitive}} {{responses are}} elicited via a cognitive response to novel information, the primary method in which automatic responses are elicited is through structural cues {{of the communication}} situation. Lang, et al. (2000) elaborates on this by controlling the structural features. They discovered that the relatedness of the media messages mattered. They dissected the pacing of mediated content into two categories: one that used related editing in camera angle and content; and, another with <b>unrelated</b> cuts <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> information <b>to</b> the previous information that was being encoded and stored. These pacing cues are important to media producers because they can either help reinforce attention into memory; or they can created a low memory retention condition {{in the minds of}} the message processor.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, Turkey Tayac was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia. His family worked with Congressional and Senate representatives to gain permission for Proctor to be buried at the park. Senator Paul Sarbanes attached an amendment <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> legislation <b>to</b> achieve this. It was opposed by the Alice Ferguson Foundation, which had donated land for the park. In 1979, Turkey Tayac {{was buried in the}} ossuary site at Moyaone.|$|R
5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, the 610 Office {{performs}} functions <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> {{the monitoring}} and persecution of unrecognized religions.

5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
