2500|$|Harvey's time as Health Minister, however, {{was plagued}} with {{difficulties}} from the beginning. She {{was forced to}} deal with a major health crisis which had sparked threats by hospital doctors to resign en masse, the Ward 10B scandal surrounding abuse of psychiatric patients at Townsville Hospital, and recurrent issues over the storage of toxic medical waste. She also came under attack for appointing her daughter and sister-in-law to her paid staff, as well as a woman previously convicted on fraud charges, and using government funds to pay her hairdressing bills, leading the opposition to dub her [...] "Minister for Goldilocks". She had a difficult relationship with many in the medical profession; David Lindsay, former head of medicine at the Gold Coast Hospital, recounted in 2005 that Harvey [...] "treated us like schoolchildren" [...] and [...] "told <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> precious her time was and how we were wasting her time". Harvey's caucus colleague Di McCauley, herself later a minister, remarked in her 2004 memoir Diving Off The Ironing Board that Harvey [...] "seemed unable to cope from the beginning in what was the enormous and difficult portfolio of Health." ...|$|E

In particular, three principles emerge from existing data: the modal principle, the exhaustive principle, and the equivalence principle.
