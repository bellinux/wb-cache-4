5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the <b>unifying</b> <b>concept</b> that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} written for non-specialist readers and {{attracted}} widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T.H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During [...] "the eclipse of Darwinism" [...] from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With {{the development of the}} modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the <b>unifying</b> <b>concept</b> of the life sciences.|$|E

The popular usage of the term in Sweden, Denmark and Norway as a <b>unifying</b> <b>concept</b> became established {{in the nineteenth century}} through poems such as Hans Christian Andersen's [...] "I am a Scandinavian" [...] of 1839. After a visit to Sweden, Andersen became a supporter of early political Scandinavism.

2500|$|Herbert Spencer was a 19th-century English philosopher who {{developed}} {{ideas about the}} <b>unifying</b> <b>concept</b> of evolution across the natural and social sciences.

It is also he and not Darwin who coined the phrase survival of the fittest. Much of the positivist ideas of progress that dominated the social science philosophy of Spencer and subsequent Social Darwinists has been criticized by present-day sociologists, but such ideas continue {{to be one of the}} major critiques made by creationists against evolution in general, even though strict biological evolution does not depend on it nor offer any type of endorsement of so-called [...] "social Darwinism" [...] or its derivative philosophies such as eugenics.|$|E

This <b>unifying</b> <b>concept,</b> codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced by many over the last two centuries. Even though the term [...] "Indian" [...] generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas—such as the Aleuts, Inuit, or Yupik peoples, who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years before, and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the Asiatic Arctic Russian Far East—these groups are nonetheless considered [...] "indigenous peoples of the Americas".

2500|$|The Fall of the Western Roman Empire was {{the process}} of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule. The Fall {{is not the only}} <b>unifying</b> <b>concept</b> for these events; the period {{described}} as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse. The loss of centralized political control over the West, and the lessened power of the East, are universally agreed, but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376. For Cassius Dio, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 CE marked the descent [...] "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron". Gibbon started his story in 98 and Theodor Mommsen regarded the whole of the imperial period as unworthy of inclusion in his Nobel Prize-winning History of Rome. Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke argue that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in republican times. As one convenient marker for the end, 476 has been used since Gibbon, but other markers include the Crisis of the Third Century, the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 (or 405), the sack of Rome in 410, the death of Julius Nepos in 480, {{all the way to the}} Fall of New Rome in 1453.|$|E
