5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy.

5000|$|Wood {{identified}} {{a very low}} ultraviolet albedo (reflectivity, that is most of the ultraviolet is absorbed) region in the Aristarchus Plateau region of the Moon which he suggested was due to high sulphur. The area continues to be called Wood's Spot. In 1909, Wood constructed the first practical liquid mirror astronomical telescope, by spinning mercury to form a paraboloidal shape, and investigated its benefits and limitations. Wood {{has been described as}} the [...] "father of both infrared and ultraviolet photography". Though the discovery of electromagnetic radiation beyond the visible spectrum and the development of photographic emulsions capable of recording them pre-date Wood, {{he was the first to}} intentionally produce photographs with both infrared and ultraviolet radiation. [...] In 1903 he developed a filter, Wood's glass, that was opaque to visible light but transparent to both ultraviolet and infrared, and is used in modern-day black lights. [...] He used it for ultraviolet photography but also suggested its use for secret communication. He was also the first person to photograph <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>fluorescence.</b> He also developed an ultraviolet lamp, which is widely known as the Wood's lamp in medicine.

50|$|During {{his years}} at Sheffield, Weber {{continued}} {{to lay the}} foundations of modern fluorescence spectroscopy developing both fluorescence theory and instrumentation. His pioneering contributions during these early years included his report with Laurence of aromatic secondary amines, which were strongly fluorescent in apolar solvents but very weakly fluorescent in water, the most spectacular case being the anilino naphthalene sulfonates (ANS). More than 50 years after that first report, ANS is still being used in protein studies, quite often {{as an indicator of}} the “molten globule state.” During those early years at Sheffield, Weber and his postdoctoral fellow, F.W. John Teale, began their studies on intrinsic protein fluorescence. At that time, compounds resembling the aromatic amino acids had been shown to possess appreciable fluorescence in the near ultraviolet but the fluorescence of the aromatic amino acids themselves had not yet been unequivocally characterized (although Debye and Edwards had made observations on the phosphorescence of the aromatic amino acids and the position of these phosphorescence bands indicated to McClure the probable existence of fluorescence bands in the near ultraviolet). In 1953, Weber hypothesized that emission bands for tyrosine and tryptophan should exist with maxima in the region 3000 - 4000 Å. At about the same time Weber and Teale were carrying out their studies, Shore and Pardee adapted a Beckman DU spectrophotometer to view the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>fluorescence</b> of tyrosine, tryptophan and a number of proteins through a filter that passed wavelengths greater than about 300 nm. Shore and Pardee could not record emission spectra with their apparatus, however, and the excitation spectra obtained were very approximate. In 1957, Weber and Teale published the first emission spectra of the aromatic amino acids, and the first accurate excitation spectra (figure 7 from this paper has been reproduced many times). In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Weber and Teale published a series of important papers and communications on intrinsic protein fluorescence and the determination of absolute quantum yields. The quantum yield Weber and Teale reported for tryptophan, 0.20, was later found to be somewhat higher than the currently accepted value near 0.14. At the time Weber and Teale carried out their experiments, however, the large temperature effect on tryptophan’s lifetime and quantum yield was not appreciated and their work, reported as done at “room temperature”, was in fact carried out in the winter in a Quonset hut without heating, which caused a marked increase in their tryptophan quantum yield relative to that expected for 25°C. In 1960, Weber published the excitation polarization spectra of the aromatic amino acids and numerous proteins and also gave the first demonstration of electronic energy transfer among tyrosines and tryptophans and the critical transfer distances from tyrosine to tryptophan and among tyrosine or tryptophan residues. In 1959, Weber and Teale also demonstrated the first use of electronic energy transfer in the study of hemeproteins by comparing the fluorescence of hemoglobin and horseradish peroxidase before and after removal of the heme. During the four decades since the first description of protein fluorescence, thousands of papers have been written on the fluorescence of tryptophan, tyrosine or phenylalanine or some aspect of intrinsic protein fluorescence. The study of intrinsic protein fluorescence has, in fact, {{become one of the most}} important techniques used in protein research and has been of great importance in establishing the dynamic nature of proteins. This potential was certainly not lost on Weber who presented a classic paper at the “Light and Life” conference held in 1960 and, in a true understatement, summarized his presentation by saying “There are many ways in which the properties of the excited state can be utilized to study points of ignorance of the structure and function of proteins”. In fact, in an earlier communication (presented at the annual meeting of the British Biochemical Society on April 3, 1959) Weber estimated that the excited state lifetime of tryptophan in proteins was on the order of 4 ns and commented “These values are too short to permit measurements of fluorescence polarization to be of value in the determination of the rotational relaxation times of proteins in solution, but can give useful information on local conditions about the tryptophan or tyrosine residues.” Now that present day methods of site-directed mutagenesis permit the facile removal and/or addition of tryptophan residues to allow the creation of novel single-tryptophan containing proteins, Weber’s vision of the utility of intrinsic protein fluorescence is being fully realized.|$|E
