50|$|The Club avoided closure {{during the}} dark {{days of the}} early 1930s; the club {{did not have a}} single <b>unencumbered</b> <b>asset</b> during that period. In 1932, Britannia Boating Club's {{basketball}} team, the Ottawa Valley Champions, were scheduled to compete in the Dominion playdowns in Quebec, however they were unable to make the trip to Quebec for financial reasons. In 1931, the Club property was sold for arrears of taxes. A group of members purchased the property on behalf of the Club, receiving clear title from the Crown. In 1931, an addition in the North side of the Clubhouse accommodated a men's locker room and washrooms for men and women. The Club's semi-monthly booklet outlining varied water and land based activities, known as the 'Amphibian', was founded in 1931.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, borrowers {{have raised}} enough cash {{at the last}} minute (usually through desperate fire sales of other <b>unencumbered</b> <b>assets)</b> to offer good tender and have thereby avoided {{foreclosure}} or at least preserved their rights to challenge the foreclosure process. Courts have been unsympathetic to attempts by such borrowers to recover fire sale losses from foreclosing lenders.|$|R

50|$|Often {{fraudulent}} transfers {{occur in}} connection with leveraged buyouts (LBOs), where the management/owners of a failing corporation will cause the corporation to borrow on its assets and use the loan proceeds to purchase the management/owner's stock at highly inflated prices. The creditors of the corporation will then often {{have little or no}} <b>unencumbered</b> <b>assets</b> left upon which to collect their debts. LBOs can be either intentional or constructive fraudulent transfers, or both, depending on how obviously the corporation is financially impaired when the transaction is completed.|$|R
50|$|Interest {{rates on}} {{unsecured}} loans are nearly always {{higher than for}} secured loans, because an unsecured lender's options for recourse against the borrower {{in the event of}} default are severely limited. An unsecured lender must sue the borrower, obtain a money judgment for breach of contract, and then pursue execution of the judgment against the borrower's <b>unencumbered</b> <b>assets</b> (that is, the ones not already pledged to secured lenders). In insolvency proceedings, secured lenders traditionally have priority over unsecured lenders when a court divides up the borrower's assets. Thus, a higher interest rate reflects the additional risk that in the event of insolvency, the debt may be uncollectible.|$|R
2500|$|The U.S. never {{adopted the}} {{floating}} charge directly {{because at the}} time it was developing in England in the 19th century, U.S. courts generally held that a debtor simply could not create a security interest in future property; general creditors ought to have a pool of <b>unencumbered</b> <b>assets</b> to look to; and even if such a thing could exist, it was a fraudulent conveyance. [...] However, creditors' lawyers gradually developed an diverse variety of methods, some authorized by state legislatures and others tolerated by state courts, to evade the general ban on security interests in future property. [...] As it had become clear that creditors and debtors were going to find ways to create enforceable de facto security interests in after-acquired property and general intangibles whether courts liked it or not, the UCC drafters in the 1940s (particularly Grant Gilmore) successfully argued that such interests should be legitimized and simplified in the form of the floating lien.|$|R
40|$|By {{the end of}} 2012, all {{standardised}} over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives {{will have}} to be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). We estimate the financial resources that different CCPs would need to clear safely the full volume of interest rate swaps and credit default swaps currently held by major derivatives dealers. Our results suggest that these dealers already have sufficient <b>unencumbered</b> <b>assets</b> to meet initial margin requirements, but that a few may need to increase their cash holdings to meet variation margin calls in a timely way. We also find that the potential costs of individual or multiple dealer defaults for CCPs and their non-defaulting clearing members are likely to be small relative to their equity as long as CCPs factor into initial margin requirements the extent of tail risk and time variation in risk of different types of derivatives. Finally, clearing different types of OTC derivatives in a single CCP could reduce both margins and collective loss-absorbing resources. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} five years, the idea that {{bankruptcy}} practice has trounced the scheme of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code (from now on “The Code”) has emerged. Pioneered by professors Baird and Rasmussen, a cluster of legal literature has developed around the changes in bankruptcy practice, the reasons behind those changes and possible efficiency implications of the professed novel occurrences. There are conflicting opinions over {{almost every aspect of}} the debate, but everyone seems to agree at least that actual bankruptcy practice has evolved from the depictions commonly made two decades ago. Technological changes and financial innovations 3 seem to be the triggering factor for the new developments. Financial contracting design has adopted a widespread use of agreement specific increasingly detailed covenants, which allowed writing contracts that depended upon the new monitoring technology. The financial strategist is now able to employ security interests in virtually all the debtor’s property, present and future, intertwined with the credit agreement in order to reinforce the power of the lender. These innovations have helped to create new scenarios for lenders, who under the new conditions have a tighter grip to closely monitor the debtor financial health. As a result of the increased efficiency of the system, lenders willingness to advance funding seems to have grown, as evidenced by the fewer <b>unencumbered</b> <b>assets</b> that debtors have when entering bankruptcy...|$|R

The nature of counterparty exposures in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets is widely considered to have exacerbated the recent financial crisis. Trading in this market is decentralised, and exposures were often inadequately collateralised. Their bilateral character both led to the possibility of default cascades and made it difficult to assess the overall risks taken on by market participants. 2 Clearing trades centrally can mitigate these structural weaknesses. This involves a central counterparty (CCP) standing between the parties to bilateral transactions and taking on their respective counterparty risks. The more transactions a well collateralised CCP covers, the less likely default cascade...|$|R
40|$|As the American Bankruptcy Institute’s Commission to Study the Reform of Chapter 11 {{considers}} {{the state of}} business bankruptcy in this country, the narrative on chapter 11 is well-established and oft-repeated. According to this narrative, whereas in the past firms filing for chapter 11 came into the bankruptcy process with at least some <b>unencumbered</b> <b>assets,</b> modern firms tend to have capital structures that are entirely consumed by multiple layers of secured debt. Moreover, as secured creditors have come to dominate capital structures, conventional wisdom has it that they have “captured” chapter 11 {{to the detriment of}} unsecured creditors. This development has justifiably troubled many scholars on both efficiency and distributional grounds. However, it remains an open question whether the perceived downsides of secured creditor control can be satisfactorily addressed through bankruptcy law reform. In this Article, Professor Walters examines English attempts to use bankruptcy law to adjust the priority and control rights of secured creditors with the aim of improving the welfare of unsecured creditors. The Article starts from the premise that lenders that are powerful enough to bargain for superior control and priority rights inside or outside of bankruptcy will be equally capable of adjusting to legal changes that affect, or are perceived as affecting their interests. Four ways in which lenders will adjust to “adverse” bankruptcy reform are identified: (i) metabargaining; (ii) adjustments to prebankruptcy behavior; (iii) transactional innovation; and (iv) “shape shifting”. In Parts II and III, the Article then illustrates how English lenders have successfully adjusted to statutory erosion of their priority rights through transactional innovation and to statutory attempts to curb their control rights through “shape shifting”. Walters’ conclusion on the efficacy of bankruptcy law reform is cautionary and skeptical. He assesses English attempts to improve the position of unsecured creditors by dampening the rights of secured creditors as a failed conceit...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{proved too}} large for the Institute's needs and when HMG wished to find {{a home for the}} University of London, a transfer of leases was agreed in 1899 under which the Institute assigned its 999-year lease (with the consent of the landlord) to the Commissioners of Works, who contemporaneously sub-let back to it approximately half of the building, free of rent and rates and with the benefit of various communal services including maintenance, heating and lighting. The transaction also included a capital payment and in later years was portrayed as a gratuitous act of rescue by HMG, however while the Institute had an <b>unencumbered</b> property <b>asset</b> of such substance and value and the power under its Charter to borrow on the security of such assets, it was not at risk financially.|$|R
40|$|In Nairobi, {{where the}} {{economic}} and social consequences of business failure are high, entrepreneurs' risk-management strategies work separately and together to discourage firm growth. Many manage risk through flexibility. By working in rent-free quarters, using family labour and little capital, they minimise fixed costs and increase opportunities for additional income. Business owners also avoid risk by manufacturing standard products for a known market. Successful entrepreneurs diversify their income and assets rather than expanding one enterprise. Finally, most prefer to preserve land and other <b>assets</b> <b>unencumbered</b> by debt. These rational responses to a risky business environment inhibit formation of a dynamic manufacturing sector. Policymakers, NGOs, and the private sector can help by creating broad policies and targeting specific programmes to remove or reduce risk...|$|R
40|$|Greek {{banks are}} close to collapse, even if a new bail-out {{programme}} is agreed soon. The deterioration of the economy means that their fragile capital position is deteriorating further. In this CEPS Commentary, Daniel Gros observes that any new programme needs to include recapitalisation, comprising possibly a bail-in and restructuring to get the banking system working again. With {{only a small part}} of the <b>assets</b> <b>unencumbered</b> and a government with empty pockets, the depositors might have to take a large part of the burden. As private investors are unlikely to participate in a recapitalisation, foreign official funds will be needed. A direct equity investment by the EIB or the EBRD could be used to transfer control rights, and special ESM bonds could be used to provide additional capital without entailing additional risk to the creditor...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{abundant}} {{literature on}} {{the social and economic}} benefits of encouraging tiny "informal" firms, scholars generally agree that somewhat larger enterprises create more unskilled jobs, use resources more efficiently, and are better at building technological capacity. Yet the vast majority of firms will never grow beyond six workers. This paper argues that one very significant reason why small firms stay small is risk. In Nairobi — and probably elsewhere — the economic and social consequences of business failure are extremely high. Not surprisingly, entrepreneurs try to protect themselves from failure and, in the process, ensure that their firms will remain small. Our research identified four risk-management strategies that work separately and together to discourage firm growth. First, many entrepreneurs manage risk through flexibility. By working in rent-free quarters, using family labour and little capital, they minimise fixed costs and maximise opportunities for additional income. Second, many small manufacturers also avoid risk by manufacturing standard products for a known market. Third, successful entrepreneurs frequently diversify their income and assets rather than expand a single enterprise. Finally, moot prefer to preserve their land and other <b>assets</b> <b>unencumbered</b> by debt. These rational responses to risky business environment ensure that most firms will stay very small and, in the process, work against formation of a dynamic manufacturing sector. Policymakers are challenged to improve the enabling environment by creating broad policies conducive to firm growth and by targeting specific policies and programmes to small-scale industry. Kenya needs macroeconomic and social policies that indirectly encourage firm growth by removing or reducing business and background risks. The country also needs an industrial policy that provides positive incentives for enterprising business owners ready and willing to expand employment, improve efficiency, and upgrade their technology and their workers' skills...|$|R
