5|$|By 8:30pm on {{the evening}} of March 18, most of {{northern}} Quảng Trị was under North Vietnamese control. ARVN Colonel Do Ky, also the provincial chief of Quảng Trị Province, tried to lead what was left of his troops back to Huế but was pursued by the North Vietnamese along National Highway 1 <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> An Lo.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Moon. The Agena would then {{have been used to}} perform Lunar orbit insertion. Following the completion of activities in Lunar orbit, the Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.|$|E
5|$|By noon, Knyphausen and his Hessians {{restarted}} their advance. As soon as {{the tide}} was high enough, Mathew and his troops, accompanied by Howe, were ferried across the Harlem River. They landed under heavy fire from the American artillery on the Manhattan shore. The British troops charged up the hillside and dispersed the Americans <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> a redoubt defended by some Pennsylvania Volunteer companies. After brief fighting, the Americans turned and ran towards the fort.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May {{the brigade}} became the corps reserve and at noon {{were ordered to}} assist the 179th (2/4th London) Brigade in their attack on El Haud. The {{regiment}} crossed the bridge and started forward, through artillery fire, first walking then increasing their pace to a canter, <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> cover. But then they were ordered back and {{had to return to}} Umm Es Shert, so they headed back through the shellfire <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the village. They remained there overnight until ordered forward to support the 4th Light Horse Brigade defending the road from the Ed Damieh ford to Es Salt, which was the only route back {{for the rest of the}} force attacking Es Salt. For the next day the regiment held a defensive position along the road, and then moved, dismounted, into the mountains to help the Australian Mounted Division extricate themselves. On 3 May, once the Australians had moved past them, the regiment walked back down the track behind them, shelled by Turkish artillery. They then moved into the lines held by the infantry until the other forces had reached safety, before forming the rearguard back to Ghoraniyeh, arriving at 16:00 on 5 May.|$|E
5|$|The Allied army {{continued}} to make {{its way to the}} assembly point at Gualeguaichu. Urquiza and his cavalry traveled overland from Montevideo, while the infantry and artillery were carried by Brazilian warships up the Uruguay River. After meeting up, they marched west <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the city of Diamante {{on the east side of}} the Paraná River in the middle of December 1851. Eugenio Garzón and his the Uruguayan troops were taken from Montevideo up to Potrero Perez by Brazilian warships and continued on foot until arriving at Diamante on 30 December 1851, when all the Allied forces were finally reunited.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperial}} party {{arrived in}} Rio Grande do Sul's capital, Porto Alegre, in July 1865. From there, they traveled inland <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Uruguaiana in September. This Brazilian town {{was occupied by}} a Paraguayan army. By the time Caxias and his party arrived, the town was under siege by a combined force of Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan units. The Paraguayans surrendered without further bloodshed, freeing the Emperor and Caxias {{to return to the}} imperial capital.|$|E
5|$|By 10:00 {{the rest}} of the {{division}} had passed the Nahr el Falik. Although the division had been ordered to avoid conflict <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the entrenched line near Liktera, leading squadrons attacked 200 Ottoman infantry in a large orchard east of Basse el Hindi. Here they captured about 60 prisoners, two guns and many wagons at the cost of one man killed and two wounded. Another isolated machine gun was captured further north. Near Mukhalid, the 9th Hodson's Horse outflanked another Ottoman position, and another at Nahr Iskanderun at 10:15. A total of 110 prisoners, 2 artillery pieces and 12 wagons were captured.|$|E
5|$|Finding {{themselves}} {{surrounded by}} the Viet Minh, the French at Sop-Nao stood for six days while in radio contact with Teullier at the main strong point. The survivors, following authorisation from the French captain, retreated during the night of April 9/10 along a round-about route following the assumption by Grézy that the Viet Minh had laid ambushes along the most direct path. The French hacked a new path through the jungle <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Laotian tribesmen on April 11, who warned them of Viet Minh units following them. The French attempted to turn for Phong-Saly {{to the north and}} met an allied convoy travelling down the Nam Hou in canoes. The two forces combined and sailed down the river towards Muong Khoua.|$|E

5|$|Ingenohl {{decided that}} another {{raid on the}} English coast should {{to be carried out}} in the hopes of luring a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be destroyed. At 03:20 on 15 December, Seydlitz, Moltke, Von der Tann, the new battlecruiser , and Blücher, along with the light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, {{consisting}} of 14 dreadnoughts and 8 pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of 2 armored cruisers, 7 light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover.|$|E
5|$|Rescue trains were {{dispatched}} {{from across}} Atlantic Canada, {{as well as}} the northeastern United States. The first left Truro around 10am carrying medical personnel and supplies, arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3pm. The track had become impassable at Rockingham, on the western edge of Bedford Basin. To reach the wounded, rescue personnel had to walk through parts of the devastated city <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> a point where the military had begun to clear the streets. By nightfall, a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro, Kentville, Amherst and Stellarton and from the New Brunswick towns of Sackville, Moncton and Saint John.|$|E
5|$|Suleiman {{tried to}} {{reinforce}} his offensive, {{not knowing what}} had happened in the valley, but then Stephen, with the full support of his boyars, ordered a major attack. All his troops, together with peasants and heavy cavalry, attacked from all sides. Simultaneously, Moldavian buglers concealed behind Ottoman lines started to sound their bugles, and in great confusion some Ottoman units changed direction to face the sound. When the Moldavian army hit, Suleiman lost control of his army. He desperately tried to regain control, but was later forced to signal a retreat. The battle lasted for four days, with the last three days seeing the fleeing Ottoman army being pursued by the Moldavian light cavalry and the 2,000-strong Polish cavalry <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the town of Obluciţa (now Isaccea, Romania), in Dobruja.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{commander}} of the German High Seas Fleet, decided that another raid on the English coast should be {{carried out in the}} hopes of luring a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be destroyed. At 03:20, CET on 15 December 1914, Blücher, Moltke, Von der Tann, the new battlecruiser , and Seydlitz, along with the light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade estuary. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, consisting of 14 dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of two armored cruisers, seven light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover for the bombardment force.|$|E
5|$|Derfflingers first combat {{operation}} was {{a raid on}} the English coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. One raid had already been conducted by the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group, on the town of Yarmouth in late 1914. Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{the commander of the}} High Seas Fleet, decided to conduct another raid on the English coast. His goal was to lure a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be isolated and destroyed. At 03:20 on 15 December, Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, with his flag in , departed the Jade estuary. Following Seydlitz were Derfflinger, , , and , along with the light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet departed to provide distant cover. The main fleet consisted of 14 dreadnoughts, eight pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of two armored cruisers, seven light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{repeated}} efforts, the French Navy {{failed to}} reinforce and resupply the garrison, as their ships were intercepted and defeated either in European waters {{or in the}} Caribbean itself. The British had intercepted {{a number of these}} messages, and launched a series of successful invasions during 1809, until Guadeloupe was the only French colony remaining. A British expeditionary force landed on 28 January 1810, and found that much of the island's militia garrison had deserted. Advancing from two landing beaches {{on opposite sides of the}} island, they were able to rapidly push inland. It was not <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge outside the capital Basse-Terre that the expeditionary force faced strong opposition, but in a battle lasting for most of 3 February, the French were defeated and driven back. The island's commander, Jean Augustin Ernouf, began surrender negotiations the following day.|$|E

5|$|In 59, the Romans {{marched to}} the south, towards Tigranocerta, Armenia's second capital city. On their way, Corbulo's men punished those who {{withstood}} or hid from them, while leniency was shown to those who surrendered. In the harsh, dry terrain of northern Mesopotamia, the army suffered from lack of provisions, especially water, <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the more fertile areas near Tigranocerta. During that time, a plot to murder Corbulo was uncovered and suppressed. Several Armenian nobles who had joined the Roman camp were implicated and executed. According to a story provided by Frontinus, when the Roman army arrived at Tigranocerta, they launched the severed head {{of one of the}} conspirators into the city. By chance, it landed right where the city council was assembled; they immediately decided to surrender the city, which was consequently spared. Shortly after, an attempt by the Parthian army under king Vologases to enter Armenia was blocked by Verulanus Severus, the commander of the auxiliaries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 863, Umar struck again, joining forces with the Abbasid general Ja'far ibn Dinar al-Khayyat (probably the {{governor}} of Tarsus) for a successful raid into Cappadocia. The Arabs crossed the Cilician Gates into Byzantine territory, plundering as they went, <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> a place near Tyana. There, the Tarsian army returned home, but Umar obtained Ja'far's leave to press on into Asia Minor. Umar's forces represented {{the bulk of his}} emirate's strength, but their size is unknown: the contemporary Muslim historian Ya'qubi claims that Umar had 8,000 men at his disposal, while the Byzantine historians Genesius and Theophanes Continuatus inflate the numbers of the Arab army to 40,000 men. The Byzantinist John Haldon considers the former number to be closer to reality, and estimates the size of the combined Arab force at 15,000–20,000 men. It is likely that a Paulician contingent under Karbeas was present as well.|$|E
5|$|On the left, on {{the other}} hand, Count William Louis of Nassau {{advanced}} with the remaining Dutch cavalry but was halted by the musketry fire of the 200 men standing on the advanced ditch. Aiming to disrupt the Dutch right, Verdugo then charged ahead of Frate's Albanian company and that of Baron de Bievres. The Dutch horse, disorganized by the musketry fire, could not resist Verdugo's rush and turned back, breaking the order, in turn, of the English foot standing behind. To capitalize on this success, Verdugo ordered his foot to follow up the victory. Unaware of the Spanish success {{on the other}} side of the field, the English infantry continued pressing back the Spanish right flank <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Spanish camp. When they realized what had happened, however, the Englishmen turned back in a vain attempt to escape. The Spanish centre and left were blocking the way, and thus the English attempted to save themselves fleeing across the bogged ditches, only to be killed in large numbers.|$|E
