50|$|Mechanically made foams and froths, {{involves}} {{methods of}} introducing bubbles into liquid polymerisable matrices (e.g. an <b>unvulcanised</b> elastomer {{in the form}} of a liquid latex). Methods include whisking-in air or other gases or low boiling volatile liquids in low viscosity lattices, or the injection of a gas into an extruder barrel or a die, or into injection molding barrels or nozzles and allowing the shear/mix action of the screw to disperse the gas uniformly to form very fine bubbles or a solution of gas in the melt. When the melt is molded or extruded and the part is at atmospheric pressure, the gas comes out of solution expanding the polymer melt immediately before solidification. Frothing (akin to beating egg whites making a meringue), is also used to stabilize foamed liquid reactants, e.g. to prevent slumping occurring on vertical walls before cure - (i.e. avoiding foam collapse and sliding down a vertical face due to gravity).|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Theses. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Through {{the use of a}} sec-butyllithium. N,N,N',N'- tetramethylethylene-diamine chelate complex it was possible to anionically graft a conventional <b>unvulcanised</b> rubber, SBR (solprene 1204), with vinyl aromatic monomers such as styrene, o(-methylstyrene and vinyltoluene. By choosing suitable solvents and reaction conditions high yields were obtained. Grafting efficiencies, determined from the amounts of homopolymer present in the gel permeation. chromatograms of the products, were found in the 60 to 100 & range. Grafting efficiencies for the o(-methylstyrene only systems were generally found {{at the lower end of}} this range whereas the grafting efficiencies for the other JBR graft copolymers were usually greater than 80...|$|E
40|$|Motivation for {{the current}} paper comes from the {{expected}} enhancements in mechanical and viscoelastic properties of <b>unvulcanised</b> Natural Rubber (NR) reinforced with nano-dimensioned Graphene Oxide (GO). Due to their large aspect ratio, specific surface area and tensile stiffness these nano-dimensioned particles are expected to provide significant property enhancements compared to conventional fillers (e. g. Carbon Black). The NR-GO nanocomposites are made in concentrations up to 1. 00 wt %, prepared by "latexmixing" with aqueous dispersions of GO platelets, a procedure that requires no heat or chemical input and very little processing. Three sets of specimens have been tested from the same master batch. Two sets of specimens have been tested 4 weeks apart in order {{to look at the}} effect of crystallisation on the quasi-static properties and give clearer information on the strength of the GO networks. The third set of specimens undergoes stress relaxation tests to better understand the viscous properties. The quasi-static behaviour shows that the Young's Modulus increases, the strength increases and strain to failure decreases as GO concentration increases. The continuous increase in strength as the concentration of GO is increased gives a good indication that the dispersion of filler is homogeneous, with few agglomerations or stress concentrations. The most significant effects of the GO are at low strain levels, causing the well understood phenomenon of 'strain amplification'. This has significant effects upon the materials ability to crystallise under high strain, and by testing specimens to non-destructive stress levels we have shown evidence of the rotation of GO nanoplatelets under high strain. Stress relaxation of the specimens shows that, in addition to an increase in the elastic properties, the viscous properties also increase; caused by the presence of GO nanoplatelets restricting the movement of the elastomer chains...|$|E
