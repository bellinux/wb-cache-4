40|$|Purpose: Objective {{diagnosis}} of symptomatic <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in patients prone to asymptomatic bacteriuria is compromised by local host responses {{that are already}} present and the positive urine culture. We investigated interleukin- 6 as a biomarker for nonfebrile <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> severity and diagnostic thresholds for interleukin- 6 and 8, and neutrophils to differentiate between asymptomatic bacteriuria and <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> Materials and Methods: Patients with residual urine and neurogenic bladders due to spinal lesions included in a long-term Escherichia coli 83972 asymptomatic bacteriuria inoculation trial were monitored for 2 years. Symptom scoring and urine sampling to estimate interleukin- 6 and 8, and neutrophils were performed regularly monthly and at <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> episodes. Results: Patients were followed in the complete study for a mean of 19 months (range 10 to 27) and those with asymptomatic bacteriuria with E. coli 83972 were followed a mean of 11 months (range 4 to 19). A total of 37 nonfebrile <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> episodes with complete data on interleukin- 6 and 8, neutrophils and symptom scoring were documented. Interleukin- 6 was the only marker that persistently increased during <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> compared to asymptomatic bacteriuria in pooled and paired intra-individual comparisons (p < 0. 05). Interleukin- 6 above the threshold (greater than 25 ng/l) correlated to more severe <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> symptoms (p < 0. 05). The sensitivity and specificity of all biomarkers were poor/moderate when differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria vs all <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> episodes. However, in <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> with worse symptoms interleukin- 6 and neutrophils demonstrated equal good/excellent outcomes. Conclusions: Triggered interleukin- 6 correlated to <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> symptom severity and demonstrated a promising differential diagnostic capacity to discriminate <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> from asymptomatic bacteriuria. Future studies should explore interleukin- 6 as a biomarker of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> severity and assess the treatment indication in nonfebrile <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

Patients and Methods : We retrospectively evaluated asymptomatic, jaundiced neonates for evidence of a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> Data reviewed including demographic and historical data were included with data of blood studies, radiological evaluation and treatment. Results : 32 neonates of 152 cases had <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> Most commonly isolated organisms were Klebsiella and Escherishia coli.

40|$|Objective To {{examine whether}} {{uncomplicated}} <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> can be predicted {{on the basis}} of symptoms, if necessary combined with information about urine clarity and smell and dipstick results for nitrite and leukocyte-esterase. Design of study Cross sectional study Methods Between March and June 2011 80 women (aged 12 years and older) whose urine was investigated because of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> complaints in one of the four participating primary practices were included. Symptoms, urine clarity and smell and dipstick results for nitrite and leukocyte-esterase were documented. Dipslides were used as reference standard, a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> was diagnosed if growth of ≥ 104 colony forming units was present. Results <b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> was diagnosed in 57, 5 % of included women. Dysuria, frequency and nitrite were associated with <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> The positive predictive value of this combination of variables was 100 % and specificity was also 100 %. When nitrite was negative, the positive predictive value and specificity of dysuria and frequency were too low to confirm <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> (59 % and 54 %). Exclusion of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> was not possible {{on the basis of}} the tests investigated in this study, who all had low sensitivity and low negative predictive value. Conclusion Uncomplicated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> can not be confirmed or excluded on the basis of symptoms. When a patient has complaints of frequency and has turbid urine, the possibility of finding <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> is 93 % and specificity is good (97 %), so dipstick testing is not necessary. <b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> is very likely when a patient presents with dysuria and frequency and has a positive nitrite, but the symptoms have little added value because a positive nitrite dipsticktest in itself is already affirmative for <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> When nitrite is negative, the symptom’s predictive value is too low to confirm a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> It is not possible to exclude uncomplicated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> on the basis of symptoms, urine clarity and smell and dipstick results for nitrite and leukocyte esterase. ...|$|R

Objectives: To analyze the epidemiologic/microbiological characteristics of 1 st and recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in infants < 2 months of age. Methods: A retrospective study including all infants < 2 months of age with <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> admitted during 2005 – 2009 and followed till the age of 1 year. Results: 151 neonates were enrolled (2. 7 % of all 5617 febrile infants < 2 months of age admitted). The overall incidence of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> occurring during the first 2 months of life was 151 / 73, 480 (0. 2 %) live births during 2005 – 2009 in southern Israel (2. 1 cases/ 1000 live births). One pathogen was isolated in 133 (88. 1 %); Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus spp., and Enterobacter spp. represented the most common pathogens (57. 9 %, 12. 2 %, 7. 9 %, 6. 7 %, 6. 1 %, and 5 %, respectively). Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and cefuroxime-axetil were the most commonly recommended prophylactic antibiotics (45 %, 13. 2 %, and 8 %, respectively). Twenty-three recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> episodes were recorded in 20 (13. 2 %) patients; 6 / 23 (26 %) were diagnosed within one month following 1 st episode.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Background. No {{population-based}} stud-ies {{have examined}} {{the degree to which}} practice parame-ters are followed for <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in infants. Objective. To describe the medical care of children in their first year of life after a first <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> Methods. Using Washington State Medicaid data, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> during their first year of life to determine how many of these children received recom-mended care based on the most recent guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Recommended care included timely anatomic imaging, timely imaging for reflux, and adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis. Multi-variate logistic-regression models were used to evaluate if hospitalization for first <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection,</b> young age at time of diagnosis, gender, race, primary language of parents, having a managed care plan, and rural loca-tion of household residence were associated with recom-mended care. Results. Less than half of all children diagnosed with a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in their first year of life received the recommended medical care. Children who were hos-pitalized for their first <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> were sig-nificantly more likely than children who were not hos-pitalized to receive anatomic imaging (relative risk [RR]: 1. 38; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 20 – 1. 57) and imaging for reflux (RR: 1. 62; 95 % CI: 1. 34 – 1. 90).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{research}} different methods for decreasing catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in hospitalized patients. Background: Catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> (CAUTIs) are very common in the hospital setting. These infections are very costly {{to the hospital and}} compromise patient safety by increasing rates of morbidity and mortality. In order for CAUTI rates to decrease, nurses and physicians must become more aware of the presence of catheters in patients. Method: A search was conducted using CINAHL, Medline, and Google Scholar for current research studies regarding the reduction of catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections.</b> Results: The implementation of reminder systems, both physical and virtual, significantly reduced the number of catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in hospitalized patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Our {{goal is to}} {{determine}} if antimicrobial prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prevents recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> and renal scarring in children who are found to have vesicoureteral reflux after a first or second <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND METHODS. The Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Six hundred children aged 2 to 72 months will be recruited from both primary and subspecialty care settings at clinical trial centers throughout North America. Children who are found to have grades I to IV vesicoureteral reflux after the index febrile or symptomatic <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> will be randomly assigned to receive daily doses of either trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or placebo for 2 years. Scheduled follow-up contacts include in-person study visits every 6 months and telephone interviews every 2 months. Biospecimens (urine and blood) and genetic specimens (blood) will be collected for future studies of the genetic and biochemical determinants of vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection,</b> renal insufficiency, and renal scarring. RESULTS. The primary outcome is recurrence of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> Secondary outcomes include time to recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection,</b> renal scarring (assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid scan), treatment failure, renal function, resource utilization, and development of antimicrobial resistance in stool flora.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Antibiotic {{prophylaxis}} {{is given}} to children at risk for <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> However, evidence concerning its effectiveness in grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux is lacking. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in young children with low grade vesicoureteral reflux. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children 1 month to 3 years old with grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux were assigned randomly to receive daily cotrimoxazole or no treatment, and followed for 18 months. A <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> constituted an exit criterion. Infection-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. RESULTS: A total of 225 children were enrolled in the study. Distribution of gender, age at inclusion and reflux grade were similar between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> between the 2 groups (17 % vs 26 %, p = 0. 2). However, a significant association was found between treatment and patient gender (p = 0. 017). Prophylaxis significantly reduced <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in boys (p = 0. 013), most notably in boys with grade III vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0. 042). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce the overall incidence of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in children with low grade vesicoureteral reflux. However, such a strategy may prevent further <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in boys with grade III reflux...|$|R
