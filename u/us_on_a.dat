5|$|Released in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2011, The King's Speech {{was a major}} {{box office}} and {{critical}} success. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the <b>US.</b> <b>On</b> <b>a</b> budget of £8million, it earned over £250million internationally ($400 million). It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance; his Golden Globe Award for Best Actor was the sole win at that ceremony from seven nominations. The King's Speech won seven British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film, Best Actor (Firth), Best Supporting Actor (Rush), and Best Supporting Actress (Helena Bonham Carter). The film also won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth), and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler).|$|E

25|$|The first, less {{aggressive}} {{strain of the}} disease fungus, Ophiostoma ulmi, arrived in Europe from the Far East in 1910, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1928, but was steadily weakened by viruses and had all but disappeared in Europe by the 1940s. The second, far more virulent strain of the disease Ophiostoma novo-ulmi was identified in Europe in the late 1960s, and within a decade had killed over 20 million trees (approximately 75%) in the UK alone. Approximately three times more deadly, the new strain arrived in Europe from the <b>US</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cargo of Rock Elm; the hypothesis that it arose from a hybrid between the original O. ulmi and another strain endemic to the Himalaya, Ophiostoma himal-ulmi is now discredited.|$|E

In the first, running from 1880 to 1884, he represented the US in regard to claims involving France which mostly emanated from the Civil War. He next served as counsel for Haiti (1885), and then again for the <b>US</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> commission with Chile (1893–94), which addressed claims against both governments most of whose origins were in either the War of the Pacific or the Chilean Civil War of 1891. In 1881, Boutwell turned down the appointment of Secretary of the Treasury from President Chester A. Arthur. He served for a time as a legal representative for the Kingdom of Hawaii, whose acquisition by the US he opposed.|$|E

25|$|Edwards {{disappeared}} on 1 February 1995, on the {{day when}} he and James Dean Bradfield were due to fly to the <b>US</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> promotional tour. In the two weeks before his disappearance, Edwards withdrew £200 a day from his bank account, which totalled £2800 by the day of the scheduled flight. He checked out of the Embassy Hotel in Bayswater Road, London, at seven in the morning, and then drove to his apartment in Cardiff, Wales. In the two weeks that followed he was apparently spotted in the Newport passport office, and the Newport bus station. On 7 February, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King's Hotel in Newport, and drove him around the valleys, including Blackwood (Edwards' home as a child). The passenger got off at the Severn View service station near Aust and paid the £68 fare in cash.|$|E
25|$|Escobar {{was born}} in Rionegro, Colombia {{and grew up in}} nearby Medellín. He studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellin but left without a degree; he began to engage in {{criminal}} activity that involved selling contraband cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, and he participated in motor vehicle theft. In the 1970s, he began to work for various contraband smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom before beginning to distribute powder cocaine himself, as well as establishing the first smuggling routes into the United States in 1975. His infiltration to the drug market of the U.S. expanded exponentially due to the rising demand for cocaine and, by the 1980s, it was estimated that 70 to 80 tons of cocaine were being shipped from Colombia to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> monthly basis. His drug network was commonly known as the Medellín Cartel, which often competed with rival cartels domestically and abroad, resulting in massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Mortal Kombat gave Anderson free rein to choose his next project, the science fiction action film Soldier, written by Blade Runner screenwriter David Peoples. Peoples' script - and {{eventually}} the film itself - contains references to his work on Blade Runner, and can {{be considered to be}} taking place in the same universe, as a sidequel or standalone sequel of sorts. Kurt Russell became attached to star, but decided to take some time off to build up his body, as required by the role, which delayed the production. In the meantime, Anderson directed the 1997 science fiction horror film Event Horizon, which was written by Philip Eisner and stars Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill. Despite attaining praise about its visuals and production design, the film wasn't received well by critics, or audiences (D+ on a Cinemascore poll), and failed to break even, which Anderson blamed on a tight post-production schedule and studio-enforced cuts. Event Horizon later sold well on home video and gained a small cult following. Plans to complete a director's cut that would restore the deleted footage came to a stop when it was discovered most of it had been lost or degraded. Soldier was eventually completed and released in 1998, but was an exceptionally big critical and commercial disaster, making below $15 million in the <b>US,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> budget of $60 million, and releasing straight-to-video in several other markets. Anderson has expressed his regret about the planned shoot on locations being changed to studio soundstages when the El Niño hurricane swooped in, which ended up compromising the film's look. He also verbalized his disappointment with Warner Bros., who, he believes, tried to market the film to the same male teen audience as Mortal Kombat, rather than grown-up audiences, which would include women.|$|E
