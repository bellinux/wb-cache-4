5000|$|Rando {{had never}} {{directed}} a musical of this size, and quickly proved overwhelmed according to cast members. Choreographer Carrafa wasn't helping; {{his idea of}} staging a big dance number was to tell the performers, [...] "Just rock on!" [...] Company morale was no better, as cast members began poking fun at Crawford's weight-sensitive costumes behind his back, calling him a [...] "fat rooster." [...] Crawford himself was no angel either; co-author Michael Kunze attested after the fact that Crawford [...] "rejected any well-meant suggestions for change by saying 'I don't wanna talk about it anymore.'" [...] Indeed, Kunze, the original author of the German work, had much to complain about {{when it came to}} changes, but most of all that there was no [...] "final moment" [...] where one concept for the production was crystallized, partly because the director didn't seem [...] "able to decide what was good or bad about both Jim Steinman's and Michael Crawford's ideas." [...] Adding to the lack of a definitive creative head was the director's <b>unplanned</b> <b>absence,</b> due to his mother's death, which sidelined Rando from the production during several weeks of previews. [...] Steinman proved to have a bad attitude about the process; although publicly he put on a brave face for the press preview and for most interviews, he later claimed he could see what was wrong with the show, which he dubbed [...] "a runaway train": [...] "We ended up with two shows at war with each other. One was sensual and Gothic, the other was camp Rocky Horror. I knew the critics would kill us for that. We were the perfect target, a fat lady with a sign on her back that said, 'Kick me!'" [...] However, unable to express his opinions without fighting with Crawford or {{the rest of the team}} (to the point that sharp- and quick-witted Steinman was viewed as verbally abusive by certain cast members), he opted instead to stop coming to the theater regularly, according to his account. It later emerged that in truth, presumably for his inactivity if Steinman's account is believable, Steinman was fired from the show by his own manager, acting as producer. Similarly, citing Sonenberg's inability to come up with his share of the investment, Steinman managed to get Sonenberg thrown overboard as a producer; the two did not speak for some time after the mutual firing. At about the same time, some cast members left the show, sensing that all was not well.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{teleworking}} {{as one of the}} genus of flexible working options for new economy service organisations. The research took the form of a multi-dimensional case study at Lloyd's Policy Signing Office (LPSO) which is the largest profit centre division of the Corporation of Lloyd's. The Corporation is responsible for the international insurance market, Lloyd's of London. LPSO employs 400 people and provides professional support services to its customers being the Lloyd's syndicates, Insurance Brokers and Managing Agencies that make up the market. The study involves examination of the business case for teleworking from the perspective of all the principal constituencies involved. The findings of previous research in relation to costs and benefits, staff productivity, staff retention and absenteeism levels are critically examined. Similarly the employee perspective in relation to the demand for teleworking, their job satisfaction and perception of work-life balance are also investigated within the context of existing research. The theory paradigms used to provide the structure to the research are principally the theory of the flexible firm, use of Balanced Score Card and from the Operational Research arena, use of six sigma methodology. The financial case for teleworking is also examined in detail. The fact that LPSO teleworkers perform largely the same tasks as their office based colleagues, and both groups work within the same management and process structure is a feature unusual in existing studies. Also, the level of access to and degree of co-operation from within Lloyd's made it possible to examine the case to a degree not found in existing research into any comparable organisation. The investigation found higher levels of productivity for teleworkers, lower levels of <b>unplanned</b> <b>absence,</b> and some evidence of a propensity to stay with LPSO because of the availability of teleworking. Teleworkers reported levels of work and life satisfaction that were never lower than office based colleagues and higher in some key respects. This was despite the fact that teleworkers feared that they might be disadvantaged in terms of career development and access to training. The study found that the financial pay-back for introducing teleworking was near neutral. Further, it was found that for LPSO higher levels of productivity might not be attributable solely to teleworking per se. Improved productivity might also arise because {{of the way in which}} work was distributed and output measured for teleworkers. Adopting comparable distribution and measurement for office based staff was potentially a viable option for LPSO management. Therefore, despite the significant increase in the productivity of teleworkers compared to their office base colleagues the resources required to introduce teleworking might be better applied to other means of improving per capita efficiency with the effects on employees' work-life balance being only an incidental by-product...|$|E
40|$|<b>Unplanned</b> {{employee}} <b>absences</b> {{are estimated}} to account for a loss of 3 % of scheduled labor hours. This can be costly in railroad dispatcher scheduling because every absence must be filled through overtime or a qualified extra dispatcher. One factor that complicates this problem is the uncertainty of <b>unplanned</b> employee <b>absences.</b> The ability to predict <b>unplanned</b> <b>absences</b> would facilitate effective scheduling of extra dispatchers and help reduce overtime costs. This thesis uses data from a railroad company over a four year period to examine company-wide factors thought to impact the number of <b>unplanned</b> <b>absences</b> among dispatchers. Using Poisson regression, we identify several factors that provide statistical evidence of influencing the number of <b>unplanned</b> <b>absences.</b> These factors are month, snowstorms, shift, and certain holidays. Despite these findings, the overall predictive capability of our regression model is very weak. Instead, we model the number of <b>unplanned</b> <b>absences</b> by shift as a Hadrom process with a Negative Binomial distribution and use Monte Carlo simulation to explore the impact on overtime costs of {{increasing the number of}} scheduled extra dispatchers and increasing the number of positions on which each employee is qualified to work. Our results show that increasing the number of extra dispatchers has a greater effect on reducing overtime, but the cost savings from reducing overtime expenses are not enough to offset the additional labor costs of having more employees on staff. Our results provide insight regarding the relationship among extra staff, higher levels of qualification among employees, and the willingness to use overtime in handling <b>unplanned</b> <b>absences.</b> by Taylor Jensen and Qi Sun.

5000|$|The Bradford Factor or Bradford Formula is used {{in human}} {{resource}} management {{as a means of}} measuring worker absenteeism. The theory is that short, frequent, and <b>unplanned</b> <b>absences</b> are more disruptive than longer absences. According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development the term was first coined due to its supposed connection with research undertaken by the Bradford University School of Management in the 1980s. It was developed as a way of highlighting the disproportionate level of disruption of an organisation's performance that can be caused by short-term absences compared to single instances of prolonged absence.|$|R

40|$|Les auteurs utilisent des données provenant d'entrevues afin de décrire les activités hors-travail d'un échantillon d'employés d'hôpital lors de journées passées à l'extérieur du travail. Even if {{the last}} fifty years of {{research}} is a testimony to its' importance to organizations, a satisfactory understanding of employee absence remains to be achieved. In reviewing the literature, this article shows that research on absence may be critiqued on two major grounds: a) A clear lack of mutual relationship between the empirical findings, the explanatory theories and the applied interventions, b) An over reliance on the absence record of employees as the dependent variable. It is further diagnosed that this problem may be directly attributed to the limitations in the basic paradygm used to study absence in organizations. Indeed, there has been practically no attempt to describe absence {{from the point of view}} of the absent person. This article attempts to contribute to the descriptive issue by presenting a complete re-analysis of a previously reported data set detailing how a sample of hospital workers spent their absence time. The data was gathered from 75 semi-skilled men and women employees who were interviewed immediately upon their return from a one day absence, which was either previously scheduled (day-off) or <b>unplanned</b> (<b>absence).</b> This data structuring presents the opportunity for investigating sex differences in absence time behaviors under two different types of absences. The raw interview information was subjected to content analyses by independent raters providing numerical structures which were then analysed quantitatively. The principal dependent variable was structured, using Robinson's (1977) classification scheme, around an «obligatory-leisure» continuum. Using this information structuring process and appropriate data transformation procedures it was possible to derive a single score for each respondent. This score expresses the total activity patterns during absence time in terms of the obligatory-leisure measure. The data was analysed using analyses of variance which were followed by hierarchical regressions. The initial analysis showed that women tend to engage in more obligatory activities during absences than their maie counterparts who maintained a greater equilibrium between leisure and obligatory activities (this accounting for 16 % of the variance). There was a modest (p <. 10) tendency for people to weight their activities towards leisure rather than obligatory activities during casual absence days. The hierarchical regressions showed that, in general, respondent sex was the single best predictor of absence time activities. This was particularly true for married (or cohabitating) women whose activities were clearly more obligatory. The marital status variable was a much better predictor of absence time activity structures than whether or not the respondent was responsable for dependents. For single people rather than gender it was age which best predicted how absence time was spent. However that equation showed low levels of prediction. The data was interpreted to indicate support for the generalized idea by which absences are generally taken for «purposive» reasons as opposed to respond to a desire for increased leisure time. This basic conclusion allows for an analysis of existing absence control programs in organizations. Other work has shown that absence control programs are indeed less powerful than might have once been thought. This data suggests a preliminary explanation: If absence is purposive the typical control of absence strategies (placing pressure on individuals, either by punishing absence or rewarding presence) will indeed yield sub optimal results. Consequently this report recommends the institution of absence control strategies which allow the employee greater flexibility in the distribution of time to meet work and non-work obligations. The paper presents an appraisal of this unusual procedure for the study of absence. It highlights the potential contributions as well as the inferential limits it forces upon both the practice and the theories of absence behavior.

50|$|Each Federal Executive Branch {{agency has}} an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). An EAP is a voluntary, {{confidential}} program that helps employees (including management) work through various life challenges that may adversely affect job performance, health, and personal well-being to optimize an organization's success. EAP services include assessments, counseling, and referrals for additional services to employees with personal and/or work-related concerns, such as stress, financial issues, legal issues, family problems, office conflicts, and alcohol and substance abuse. EAPs also often work with management and supervisors providing advanced planning for situations, such as organizational changes, legal considerations, emergency planning, {{and response to}} unique traumatic events. EAP’s can reap benefits for agencies, employees, families and communities. Some of those aspects {{that we will be}} focusing on are: the improvement of productivity and employee engagement, improving employees’ and dependents’ abilities to successfully respond to challenges, developing employee and manager competencies in managing workplace stress, reducing workplace absenteeism and <b>unplanned</b> <b>absences,</b> supporting employees and managers during workforce restructuring, reduction-in-forces, or other workforce change events, reducing workplace accidents, reducing the likelihood of workplace violence or other safety risks, supporting disaster and emergency preparedness, managing the effect of disruptive incidents, such as workplace, injury, or other crises,facilitating safe, timely, and effective return-to-work for employees short-term and extended absences, reducing healthcare costs associated with stress, depression, and other mental health issues, reducing employee turnover and related replacement costs.|$|R

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a influência da espessura do esmalte e a aplicação prévia de dessensibilizante na eficácia do tratamento clareador. O trabalho foi dividido em 2 estudos. No primeiro estudo foi testada a influência da espessura do esmalte (0, 5 mm de espessura, 1, 0 mm de espessura planificada, 1, 0 mm de espessura não planificada e sem esmalte- controle) na eficácia do clareamento em profundidade, variando-se o tipo de agente clareador, peróxido de carbamida (PC) 10 % e peróxido de hidrogênio (PH) 35 %. No segundo estudo foi avaliada a influência da aplicação prévia de agente dessensibilizante, fluoreto de sódio 2 % e nitrato de potássio 5 % associado ao fluoreto de sódio 2 % e, sem agente dessensibilizante (controle) na eficácia do clareamento dental com PH 35 %. Nos dois estudos foram usados fragmentos dentais bovinos, pigmentados por chá preto, e distribuídos por esquema inteiramente casual no primeiro estudo e aleatório por sorteio no segundo estudo (n= 10) em grupos de acordo com os tratamentos acima. As amostras foram armazenadas em saliva {{artificial}} durante as 3 semanas de tratamento. As leituras de cor da dentina oposta (1, 75 mm de espessura) do estudo 1 e as leituras de cor do esmalte (1, 0 mm de espessura) e dentina oposta (1, 75 mm de espessura) do estudo 2 foram realizadas após o manchamento (baseline) e após cada semana de tratamento clareador, utilizando o método CIE Lab através de espectrofotômetro (Konica Minolta CM 700 d, Japan). Para o estudo 1 os valores de ?E, ?L, ?a e ?b datados foram submetidos à análise de variância ANOVA em esquema fatorial e teste de Tukey (?= 0, 05). Para o estudo 2, a coordenada L* datada (L= 100 - lightness; L= 0 - darkness) foi submetida por meio de análise de medidas repetidas PROC MIXED e teste de Tukey-Kramer e os valores de ?E datados foram submetidos à análise de variância ANOVA e teste de Tukey (?= 0, 05). O esmalte de 2 amostras de cada grupo do estudo 2 foi observado em microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV). Nos resultados destes estudos pode-se observar que o clareamento com PC 10 % foi mais efetivo que o PH 35 % em profundidade dentinária para todos os parâmetros de delta, com exceção no terceiro tempo dos deltas. A presença da camada aprismática no esmalte interferiu na eficácia do PC 10 % somente no primeiro tempo de clareamento em ?E 1, ?L 1 e ?b 1, entretanto não interferiu nos tempos de clareamento testado com PH 35 % (estudo 1). Ainda, o uso de agente dessensibilizante realizado previamente ao clareamento dental não interferiu no mecanismo de ação do PH 35 % em profundidade (estudo 2) The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the influence of enamel thickness and prior application of a desensitizing agent on the effectiveness of bleaching treatment. This project was divided into two studies. Firstly, we tested the influence of enamel thickness (0. 5 mm thick, 1. 0 mm planned thick, 1. 0 mm <b>unplanned</b> thick and <b>absence</b> of enamel - control) on the effectiveness of bleaching, in-depth, according to the type of bleaching agent, as follows: 10 % carbamide peroxide and 35 % hydrogen peroxide. Secondly, we evaluated the influence of prior application of a desensitizing agent (potassium nitrate associated with 2 % sodium fluoride, 2 % neutral fluoride, or with no desensitizing agent - control) on the effectiveness of tooth bleaching by using 35 % hydrogen peroxide. In both studies we used bovine teeth fragments, stained with black tea, which were allocated into groups according to the aforementioned treatments, by an entirely causal scheme for the first study and by random drawing for the second one (n= 10). The specimens were stored in artificial saliva during the 3 -week-treatment. Color readings of the underlying dentin (1. 75 mm thick) concerning the study 1, and color readings of enamel (1. 0 mm thick) and underlying dentin (1. 75 mm thick) of the study 2, were performed after staining (baseline) and after each week of bleaching treatment using the CIE Lab method by means of spectrophotometer (Konica Minolta CM 700 d, Japan). For the study 1, the values of ?E, ?L, ?a and ?b recorded were subjected to factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (? = 0. 05). For the study 2, the coordinate L* recorded (L = 100 - lightness, L = 0 - darkness) was submitted to analysis of repeated measures PROC MIXED and Tukey-Kramer's test, and the ? values registered underwent analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (? = 0. 05). The enamel of 2 specimens from each group of the study 2 was observed under scanning electron microscopy. According to the findings, it could be observed that the bleaching with 10 % CP was more effective than that with 35 % PH as regards dentin depth for all parameters delta, except the third time deltas. The presence of the prismless layer of enamel interfered with the effectiveness of 10 % CP just in the first time of bleaching in ?E 1, ?L 1 and ?b 1, however it did not affect the times of bleaching when 35 % HP was tested (study 1). In addition, the use of a desensitizing agent prior to tooth bleaching did not interfere with the mechanism of action of the 35 % hydrogen peroxide concerning tooth depth (study 2...|$|R
