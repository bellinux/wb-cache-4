5|$|According to the 1995 presidential decree, the {{national}} flag {{is to be}} <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> staff that is colored gold (ochre). Other parts of the protocol specify the finial (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and colored in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (similar to that used in national emblem). The diamond-pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag-traditions.|$|E

The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; {{there are a number of}} Books where the text was completed but the illustrations were left empty.|$|E

5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Fares on {{the network}} {{are based on a}} zone tariff set between two {{specified}} points by GO Transit, and the type of passenger using the ticket. Passenger categories exist for adults, students, seniors, children, and groups. Tickets are also sold for single trip, or passes for one day or one month. Tickets can be <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> GO train, bus, or a combination of both. They can be purchased at train stations, bus terminals, ticket agencies, or on GO buses.|$|E
5|$|Heraldry {{in general}} {{underwent}} {{something of a}} renaissance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{and many of the}} illogicalities of previous centuries were discarded.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{showcase}} the PlayStation Portable's capabilities, {{the team had}} to develop a download system that could provide the game with future downloadable content, which included new tracks, music and ships. In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content {{had the potential to}} bring in more revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team {{had to find a way}} to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files. The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> web-based Java application.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a large {{quantity}} of unissued Morgan dollars {{was discovered in}} the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value, and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E

5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are further}} {{encouraged}} to customize their characters through nano-augmentationsâ€”cybernetic devices that grant characters superhuman powers. While the game contains eighteen different nano-augmentations, the player can install {{a maximum of}} nine, as each must be <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> certain part of the body: one in the arms, legs, eyes, and head; two underneath the skin; and three in the torso. This forces the player to choose carefully between the benefits offered by each augmentation. For example, the arm augmentation requires the player to decide between boosting their character's skill in hand-to-hand combat or his ability to lift heavy objects.|$|E

5|$|The Berkshire No. 7 has {{historical}} importance {{because of}} its design, which reflects the construction of 19th-century canal boats. However, {{there is no record}} that the barge was ever <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> canal. The barge is one of two surviving wooden-hulled canal boats in existence. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. Its nomination and listing is unusual because the Berkshire No. 7 was not yet 50 {{years old at the time}} of its nomination, and it sank in 1974. It and the other two barges that sank with it are the only shipwrecks in Connecticut listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|The M-43 {{designation}} {{dates back}} to at least July 1, 1919, when it was <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> series of roadways running between Kalamazoo and St. Charles. Its northern- and easternmost sections were transferred to other highways in the 1930s. Additions to M-43 extended it to its current termini. Several sections of the highway were realigned during its history, one of these changes {{led to the creation}} of a business loop in Grand Ledge. Another former segment of the trunkline in the Lansing area has been renumbered M-143.|$|E
