5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E

25|$|There is the {{illusion}} that the New Germany left after the annexations {{can be reduced to}} a 'pastoral state' (Morgenthau's vision). It cannot be done <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> exterminate or move 25,000,000 people out of it.|$|E

Our nation cannot go on just repelling invasion after invasion of the Chinese for we have other things to do. Let us stop the slaughter, and let their people and our people live in peace.|$|E
25|$|A theodicy, on {{the other}} hand, is a more ambitious attempt to provide a {{plausible}} justification {{for the existence of}} evil. A theodicy attempts to answer the evidential problem of evil. Richard Swinburne maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods, <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> know what they are, i.e., we have a successful theodicy.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril. There may still be {{disputes}} about exactly how much is naturally occurring, but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us {{to a point of}} no return. And <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.|$|E

25|$|The {{fight is}} not for us, not for our {{personal}} wants and needs. It is for every animal that has ever suffered and died in the vivisection labs, and for every animal that will suffer and die in those same labs <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> end this evil business now. The souls of the tortured dead cry out for justice, the cry of the living is for freedom. We can create that justice and we can deliver that freedom. The animals have no one but us. We will not fail them.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem is}} that <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> impose very strong {{mathematical}} restrictions, we cannot say that this Cobb-Douglas production function for sector i plus one for sector j (plus that for sector k, etc.) {{adds up to a}} Cobb-Douglas production function for {{the economy as a whole}} (with K and L being the sum of all of the different sectoral values). In short, for the sum of Cobb-Douglas production functions to equal a Cobb-Douglas, the production functions for all of the different sectors have to have the same values of A and a.|$|E
25|$|We risk {{erosion of}} First Amendment liberties <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> train our {{vigilance}} upon the methods whereby obscenity is condemned {{no less than}} upon the standards whereby it is judged. Questions of procedural safeguards loom large {{in the wake of}} an order such as the one before us. Among them are: (a) whether Congress can close the mails to obscenity by any means other than prosecution of its sender; (b) whether Congress, if it can authorize exclusion of mail, can provide that obscenity be determined in the first instance in any forum except a court, and (c) whether, even if Congress could so authorize administrative censorship, it has in fact conferred upon postal authorities any power to exclude matter from the mails upon their determination of its obscene character.|$|E

25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is easy to see that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} narrated {{in the third}} person, limited point of view: the reader learns of events as Perowne does. Using the free {{indirect}} style the narrator inhabits Perowne, a neurosurgeon, who often thinks rationally, explaining phenomena using medical terminology. This allows McEwan to capture some of the [...] "white noise that we almost forget {{as soon as we}} think it, <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> stop and write it down."
