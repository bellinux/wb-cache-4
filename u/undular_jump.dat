40|$|A {{consolidation}} work, {{which may}} be called a submerged sill, is constructed across a river channelin order to prevent the river bed from being lowered due to a dam construction. The stability of itsfoundation should not be threatened by the local scour downstream of the sill. In this study, char-acteristics of the scouring process downstream of a consolidation work are discussed experimentallyand analytically, using a simplified flow model. The flow downstream of a submerged sill has towpatterns; submerged jet and <b>undular</b> <b>jump.</b> In the state of submerged jet, the main flow is deflecteddownwards and sweeps along the bed with a roller near the water surface.

The purpose of the research is to analyze what parameters affect the phenomenon, to provide semiempirical formulations for wave dimensions, and to assess whether previous models for <b>undular</b> hydraulic <b>jumps</b> and antidunes are reasonably predictive. The dimensionless wavelength and wave amplitude were correlated to the Froude number at the sill. The first wavelength appears linearly related to the Froude parameter, whereas the amplitude of the first wave shows a less defined behavior, possibly indicating that a maximum value occurs for sill Froude numbers around 1. 6 – 1. 7. The corresponding wave steepness (i. e., wave amplitude/length) results between 0. 15 – 0. 16, and this range also characterizes {{the point at which}} the dimensionless trough depth below the sill achieves a local maximum, probably related to hydrodynamic conditions just before wave breaking.

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump is {{the transition from}} supercritical to subcritical flow in an open channel flow. Hy-draulic jumps are often observed behind dams and they are also used as an energy-dissipation mechanism in spillways. A {{hydraulic jump}} {{is characterized by the}} upstream Froude number Fr = u√ gh 0, where u is the (uniform) upstream horizontal flow velocity, g is the gravitational constant, and h 0 is the flow depth. Depending on the upstream Froude number, different types of jumps are possible, including <b>undular</b> <b>jumps,</b> and fully developed turbulent jumps [2]. All hy-draulic jumps experience some form of energy loss. While the energy loss in a turbulent hydraulic jump can be attributed to turbulent dissipation, an <b>undular</b> hydraulic <b>jump</b> loses energy due to an increasing number of waves in the downstream part. The present study is concerned with weak hydraulic jumps, where it is assumed that no wave-breaking is taking place. The common explanation for the energy loss in an <b>undular</b> hydraulic <b>jump</b> is that energy is radiated from the jump by an increasing number of oscillations traveling downstream. The energy loss can be computed by an analysis of the conservation equations associated with a jump solution of the shallow-water system ηt + h 0 ux + (uη) x = 0, (1) ut + gηx + uux = 0, (2) where η denotes the deflection of the free surface.

The first type of flow is an <b>undular</b> hydraulic <b>jump</b> on a plane smooth boundary when the approach flow Froude number marginally exceeds its critical value of unity. Here, it is established that the <b>undular</b> hydraulic <b>jump</b> phenomenon can be treated as an instability of the free surface flow being described by the instability principle. The results reveal that the threshold of an <b>undular</b> hydraulic <b>jump</b> is represented by a monotonic increase of approach flow Froude number with boundary inclination. The elevation of the undular free surface increases, as the boundary inclination increases. However, the amplitude of the free surface waves decreases with downstream distance. The second type of flow is that over a submerged hemi-cylindrical boss (inverted semi-circular section) placed on the channel bottom with its horizontal diameter lateral to the flow direction. The steady-state flow analysis shows {{that there is a}} drop in the free surface elevation on the downstream end of the cylinder with an undular free surface profile. The third type of flow is that over a continuous sinusoidal boundary of a channel. A numerical experiment shows that there exists a phase lag between the free surface profile and the boundary profile.

40|$|Water flow over short {{hydraulic}} transitions {{is usually}} modelled by the irrotational flow theory, {{for which the}} energy head remains constant over the entire flow domain. Velocity and pressure distributions are then obtained based on the stream and potential functions of the flow net. However, experimental evidence may dictate non-uniform energy profiles resulting either from vorticity, viscous effects, or both. For rapidly-varied flows, Hunter Rouse (1906 - 1996) proposed in the early 1930 s the inviscid Euler flow equations. Most of the current curvilinear flow models, however, resort to irrotational flow. In this work, a generalized curvilinear method for real fluid flow is proposed. Based on the streamline vorticity equation, a practical approach is presented for inviscid, rotational flow.

40|$|In open channels, slow flow {{motion is}} called {{subcritical}} or fluvial flow motion, while rapid flows are termed supercritical flows. For intermediate conditions, the flow {{is said to}} be critical. Critical flow conditions correspond to a singularity, where the flow depth and velocity are function of the flow rate only, for a given cross-sectional shape. This singularity is unstable and critical flow conditions cannot be sustained over a long distance without the development of free-surface undulations. Undulations are stationary standing waves and they are often observed in hydraulics jumps and positive surges with low inflow Froude numbers. <b>Undular</b> <b>jump</b> A hydraulic jump is a stationary transition from a rapid (supercritical flow) to a slow flow motion (subcritical flow).

40|$|In open channels, the {{transition}} from supercritical to subcritical flows is called a hydraulic jump. For low upstream Froude numbers, free-surface undulations develop downstream of the jump. Such a hydraulic jump is called an <b>undular</b> <b>jump.</b> An earlier report (CHANSON 1993) described over 75 experiments on undular hydraulic jumps, performed in a rectangular channel in which the upstream flows were fully developed turbulent shear flows (both in terms of bottom and sidewall boundary layers). Visual and photographic observations indicated five types of undular jumps. One of the main flow characteristics was the presence of lateral shock waves for Froude numbers larger than 1. 2. The present document describes a second series of more than 20 new experiments. The experiments were performed in the same flume previously used. The basic features of all the experiments are : a rectangular channel cross-section, and the upstream flows were uniform turbulent flows with fully-developed bottom and sidewall boundary layers. The experimental data include free-surface profiles, velocity distributions, pressure distributions and local head profiles upstream and downstream of undular jumps. The measurements were taken along the jump as well as across the flume width. The results show a major three-dimensional flow redistribution immediately upstream of the first wave crest. Velocity and pressure distributions were recorded at very close intervals in that region. And they provide some understanding of the flow redistribution mechanisms. The analysis of all the data (first and second series of experiments) shows that the energy dissipation occurs by the propagation of a train of stationary waves, lateral shock waves and a breaking wave (roller) mechanism at the first wave crest. The disappearance of the <b>undular</b> <b>jump</b> occurs for Froude numbers ranging from 1. 5 to 2. 9 {{and it is a}} function of the aspect ratio dc/W. Further the flow field properties (pressure, velocity, free-surface height) are functions not only of the upstream Froude number but also of the inflow conditions, the aspect ratio and the sidewall roughness. The flow characteristics of undular hydraulic jumps are compared also with near-critical flows : undular surges, free-surface undulations above broad-crested weirs, undulations downstream of backward-facing steps. After an introduction, the reader will find a bibliographic review on undular hydraulic jumps. Then the experimental apparatus is described.
