Macedonians live south of the Vardar, in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, and Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are considered more traditional, whereas the south side evokes to Macedonians modernity and rupture from rural life.|$|E
25|$|Between 1974 and 1981, Tismăneanu {{worked as}} a sociologist, {{employed}} by the <b>Urban</b> <b>Sociology</b> Department of the Institute Typified Buildings Design in Bucharest.

500|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>sociology</b> {{involves}} {{the analysis of}} social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory {{on the nature of}} the city, important to both <b>urban</b> <b>sociology</b> and criminology, utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of globalization, for instance, in Saskia Sassen's study of the [...] "Global city". Rural sociology, by contrast, is the analysis of non-metropolitan areas. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists.|$|E

2500|$|Simmel {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{generation}} of German sociologists: his neo-Kantian approach laid the foundations for sociological antipositivism, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?', presenting pioneering analyses of social individuality and fragmentation. For Simmel, culture referred to [...] "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Simmel discussed social and cultural phenomena in terms of [...] "forms" [...] and [...] "contents" [...] with a transient relationship; form becoming content, and vice versa, dependent on the context. In this sense he was a forerunner to structuralist styles of reasoning in the social sciences. With his work on the metropolis, Simmel was a precursor of <b>urban</b> <b>sociology,</b> symbolic interactionism and social network analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Based on data {{which he}} {{indicated}} formed {{part of his}} CNSAS file, Tismăneanu also specified {{that he was the}} object of constant Securitate surveillance after his departure, that his mother was subject to pressures, and that derogatory comments on him, including a coded reference to his Jewish background (tunărean), were gathered from various informants and agents. He made mention of the fact that, according to the documents (the last of which were allegedly compiled in April 1990), the post-Revolution Foreign Intelligence Directorate had continued to monitor him. Tismăneanu also indicated his belief that the author of a denunciation note, who used the name Costin and recommended himself as a Faculty of Sociology professor, was the same person who, after 1989, had sent a letter to his University of Maryland employer, in which he had called attention to the communist activities of Leonte Tismăneanu (according to Vladimir Tismăneanu, the letter was dismissed as [...] "abject" [...] and irrelevant by its recipient). Tismăneanu also cited Costin's report to the Securitate, which expressed concern that his doctoral thesis was a covert popularization of the Frankfurt School and its reinterpretations of Marxist thought. According to his former colleague Radu Ioanid, the <b>Urban</b> <b>Sociology</b> Department group had been under constant Securitate surveillance, especially after Tismăneanu defected. Ioanid quoted his own Securitate file, which, in a post-1981 comment, referred to his [...] "close contacts" [...] with Tismăneanu, defining the latter as [...] "a sociologist of Jewish nationality, a former office colleague , presently an outstandingly hostile collaborator of Radio Free Europe [...] settled in the USA." [...] Ioanid also referred to Tismăneanu's family in Romania having been [...] "heckled" [...] by the Securitate, especially after he himself had been made suspect by his historical research into Romanian antisemitism.|$|E

40|$|W. E. B. Du Bois' The Philadelphia Negro ([1899], 1996) is {{a classic}} work in urban ecology and urban ethnography. In this small area social study, Du Bois {{demonstrates}} how {{an understanding of the}} properties of social structure provides a framework for discussing African American quality of life in an urban setting. Relying on extensive use of census data, a survey of Philadelphia's Seventh Ward and ethnographic description, Du Bois utilizes methodological triangulation to specify how Philadelphia's urban inequality is a function of race and class, a point which is also made in Wilson and Taub's 2006 study on neighborhood transition in Chicago. Du Bois anticipates the work of Park, Burgess and McKenzie as he comments on the movement of groups in and out of slum areas, and he provides evidence which suggests that the Seventh Ward functioned as an African American economic enclave. In addition to being a seminal thinker in the development of scientific sociology in the U. S., Du Bois is also one of <b>urban</b> <b>sociology's</b> pioneering figures...|$|R
