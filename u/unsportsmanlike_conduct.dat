5|$|Following the 2005 ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field, {{refusing to}} talk to reporters {{following}} the loss. Vick, who picked up a 15-yard <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty late in that game, also earned several <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalties in the 2006Gator Bowl, where post-game replays revealed he purposefully stomped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals' defensive end Elvis Dumervil. Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology was made. In {{the wake of the}} incident, Virginia Tech officials announced that they would be conducting a review of Vick's conduct on and off the field.|$|E
5|$|The Hokie win was {{marred by}} {{excessive}} penalties and <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> {{that resulted in the}} ejection of oneplayer. Following the game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was released from the team as a result of several incidents of misconduct, including a stomp on Louisville defender Elvis Dumervil's leg during the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing a}} bitter {{series against the}} rival Rangers in the opening round of the 2008 NHL playoffs, Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery's hand. During game three of the series, in an unusual move, Avery turned to face Brodeur during a 5-on-3 power play, and began waving his hands and stick in front of Brodeur's face {{in an effort to}} {{distract}} him. The day after this game the NHL announced that it had revised its <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> rule, now known as The Sean Avery Rule, effectively outlawing such antics.|$|E
5|$|Drake {{was able}} to score the first {{touchdown}} as he was the starting running {{back in the game}} due to T. J. Yeldon being suspended for the first quarter by Nick Saban for his <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty against A the week before. They extended their lead to 14–0 early in the second quarter when Drake blocked a Rams punt that was returned 15-yards by Dillon Lee for a touchdown, and then to 17–0 at halftime when Cade Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal late in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2006, just a {{few days}} after that game, Virginia Tech {{officials}} dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team, citing a December 17 traffic stop in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license. Vick had hidden the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal.|$|E
5|$|Tailback Cedric Humes {{was named}} the most {{valuable}} player of the game for Virginia Tech, and quarterback Hunter Cantwell {{was named the}} Cardinals' most valuable player. Tech punter Nic Schmitt set Gator Bowl records for punt yardage and average punt distance, kicking the ball six times for 300yards, an average of 50yards per kick. Virginia Tech's win was marred by excessive penalties and <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> that resulted in the ejection of oneplayer. Following the game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was released from the team as a result of several incidents of misconduct, including a stomp on Louisville defender Elvis Dumervil's leg during the game. Several players who participated in the game, including Dumervil, later went on to careers in the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|Because Tech {{committed}} a 15-yard <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty following the touchdown, NC State {{was able to}} acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44-yard line. On the second play of the drive, Erik Kramer completed an 18-yard pass to Nasrallah Worthen, driving State into the Tech side of the field. After a short play, Kramer again completed a long pass, this time to Bobby Crumpler for 24yards. Now inside the Tech red zone, Kramer was tackled for a big loss, losing some of the yardage that he had gained with the previous play. NC State was unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer to attempt a 33-yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 2422 lead.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture {{was not intended to}} be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct.</b> The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E
5|$|High-stepping {{into the}} endzone, Aqib Talib {{committed}} a 15-yard <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty, which was enforced on the post-score kickoff. The penalty, {{coupled with a}} good kick return by Virginia Tech, gave the Hokies excellent field position for their third possession of the game. Quarterback Sean Glennon capitalized on that field position, connecting on a 24-yard pass to wide receiver Justin Harper. The catch pushed Virginia Tech inside Kansas territory and seemingly set up the Hokie offense for their first score of the game. After twoplays for no gain and a five-yard loss when Glennon was sacked by James Holt, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt a 49-yard field goal. Jud Dunlevy's kick fell short, however, and Virginia Tech was denied a score. Kansas recovered the short kick, which landed in the end zone, and returned the ball 39yards. Despite the momentum earned by the missed kick, Kansas went three plays without gaining a first down {{and was forced to}} punt the ball away. Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 15-yard line and ran two plays before time ran out in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|On Penn State's {{first play}} from {{scrimmage}} {{in the second}} half, Zach Zwinak fumbled, and it was returned for a touchdown by Frank Clark to pull within four points. After another Penn State drive stalled, Michigan drove down the field, and {{was faced with a}} third-and-short before a freshman offensive lineman committed a dead ball <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty to back up Michigan to face a third and long; on that play Olaniyan recorded his third sack of the day, and Michigan punted. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they turned the ball over again, this time via a Hackenberg interception; Michigan capitalized by kicking a field goal. When Penn State got the ball back, they ran a sustained, balanced drive (4 run plays, 5 pass plays, 50 yards) down the field during which they went to Bill Belton in the running game (as Zwinak had fumbled previously in the half) that culminated with Sam Ficken kicking a 45-yard field goal to go up by 4 points. Michigan promptly drove right back down the field, and Gardner threw a touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon to take the lead for the second time, 27–24. In the fourth quarter, Ficken attempted a 47-yard field goal, but missed, and Penn State's 10-play 45-yard drive came up empty. Michigan took advantage of their ensuing field position and ran a quick drive that ended with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Gardner to Funchess, putting them on top by 10 with 10:28 to go. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they converted a fourth down and one near midfield prior to a penalty and then a sack setting up a third and long on which Hackenberg threw an incomplete pass, so they were forced to settle with pulling within 7; Sam Ficken kicked a 43-yard field goal. Michigan tried to run out the clock on their next drive, and Penn State burned all three of their timeouts. Though they were at one point within field goal range, they committed a five-yard delay of game penalty that pushed them out of range, and they had to punt. Penn State got the ball with 50 seconds left and no timeouts at their own 20-yard line. Needing a touchdown to tie the game, Penn State's first play of scrimmage was a pass from Hackenberg to Robinson along the sideline that was ruled incomplete on the field, but was reviewed and overturned and counted as a 14-yard gain. The next play was an acrobatic catch by Felder for 29 yards, and then a pass down the sideline to Robinson for 36 yards to put the ball inside the one yard line with 29 seconds remaining. Michigan then called their final timeout. Hackenberg then attempted a quarterback sneak over the right side for a touchdown; the play was reviewed and the call was confirmed, and Ficken made the extra point to tie the game with 27 seconds left. Michigan took the ball at their own 35, drove it to the other 35, and lined Gibbons up to attempt a 52-yard field goal, which he missed short. Penn State got the ball with two seconds left, but downed the ball to send the game into overtime.|$|E
25|$|Some administrators (NASCAR and IndyCar) do not {{distinguish}} mechanical problems or <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> from rules violations and simply use the solid black flag for all violations.|$|E
25|$|Penalties {{may occur}} before a play starts (such as offside), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball {{situation}} (such as <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct).</b>|$|E
25|$|Other time {{penalties}} can be incurred {{during the}} race for, among other things, drafting on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct.</b>|$|E
25|$|Events on the cricket pitch have {{occasionally}} been {{elevated to}} diplomatic incidents in Australian history, {{such as the}} infamous Bodyline controversy of the 1930s, in which the English team bowled in a physically intimidating way leading to accusations of <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct.</b>|$|E
25|$|With 9 {{minutes left}} in the 3rd quarter, Miami H-back James Bryant caught a 5-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Kyle Wright, making the score 13-0 Miami. After scoring, Bryant pointed towards Miami's West end zone. Bryant, who later transferred to the University of Louisville, was called for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modifying {{the rule}} {{regarding}} offensive substitutions made and rushing to snap the ball before the defense {{can make their}} changes; eliminating the five yard penalty for the first offense (but stopping play and warning the offensive team), but maintaining the 15 yard <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty for further violations.|$|E
25|$|In the 1985 Orange Bowl, the Schooner came {{onto the}} playing field to {{celebrate}} a field goal but received a penalty flag for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct.</b> After the loss of yards resulting from the penalty, the field goal repeat attempt was blocked and the OU football team went on to lose the game.|$|E
25|$|During the November 14, 2015 {{game against}} the North Dakota State Bison in the 4th quarter, Pelini engaged the referees in several heated {{arguments}} for penalties they called including two <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalties on Pelini (his team was leading by 14 points going into the 4th quarter). He was reprimanded by the Missouri Valley Football Conference for his on field conduct.|$|E
25|$|The Schooner {{was already}} {{out on the field}} before the Oklahoma {{sideline}} and the RUF/NEKS realized the kick had been disallowed. Worse, while moving across the wet, sloppy natural turf, the Schooner's wagon wheels ended up in a sticky, muddy patch of field and got stuck – {{right in front of the}} Washington bench. The Sooners were quickly penalized an additional 15 yards for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 11, 2009, McNabb led the Eagles {{past the}} Giants in the divisional {{round of the}} playoffs. The Eagles won 23–11 and {{advanced}} to the NFC Championship game against the Arizona Cardinals, whom they had beaten earlier in the season. In the game, McNabb was penalized for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> when, after being tackled into the Giants' sideline after a lengthy run, {{he picked up the}} Giants' coaching phone in jest.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the season, Buffalo coach Rex Ryan {{expressed}} {{that he wanted}} his team to be last {{in the league in}} penalties (the Bills had led the league in penalties in 2014). In that respect, this game was notably embarrassing for the Bills as they committed an outrageous 17 penalties for 135 yards. 5 of those were either personal fouls or <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct,</b> and 2 of them negated Buffalo touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|A late Washington rally {{fell short}} {{and the game}} ended in controversy. Quarterback Jake Locker scored on a 3-yard {{touchdown}} run with 2 seconds remaining in the game, cutting BYU's lead to 28–27. But Locker was flagged for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct,</b> and the extra point attempt was moved back 15 yards. The ensuing PAT try was blocked, BYU players rushed the field, and a chorus of boos rained down from the Husky faithful.|$|E
25|$|On {{the college}} level in a dual meet, the wrestler not only wins the match for himself, but also gains points for his team. The number of points awarded to a team during a dual meet depends on the victory condition. It is {{possible}} for a team to lose team points in certain infractions, such as <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct,</b> flagrant misconduct, team personnel illegally leaving the reserved zone around the mat, and unauthorized questioning of the referee by the coach.|$|E
25|$|If a team {{calls for}} an instant replay {{challenge}} after it has used all its challenges or is out of timeouts, it will be assessed an <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty. The penalty will also be assessed if a team calls for a challenge inside of two minutes of either half or overtime, when only the replay assistant can initiate reviews. Previously, the request was only denied by the Referee. This change was made to prevent head coaches from constantly stopping the game for any reason, including to just argue with the Referee.|$|E
25|$|Against rival Tennessee, Alabama {{defeated}} the Volunteers, 13–6 at Legion Field. After a scoreless first quarter that featured several defensive stops for each team, both scored second-quarter touchdowns {{to tie the}} game 6–6 at the half. Joe Demyanovich scored for Alabama first on an eight-yard run and then Tennessee tied the game on a two-yard George Craig run. During the Volunteers scoring drive, Bear Bryant was ejected from the game due to an <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty. In the third, Don Hutson scored the game-winning touchdown on an end-around run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Tennessee 11–5–1.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{started all}} 16 {{games for the}} second {{straight}} season and recorded 131 tackles, one sack and three passes defended. On December 3, 2007, Scott was penalized twice for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> {{in the fourth quarter of}} the Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots. The second call came after Scott picked up the official's flag from the first call and threw it. Following the game, teammate Samari Rolle made accusations of disrespectful language by the official involved. In his final year with Baltimore, Scott again started all 16 games contributing with 104 tackles, 1.5 sacks and five passes defended.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a second}} {{category}} of fouls called technical fouls, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record {{a player in the}} scorebook, or for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct.</b> These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time. Repeated incidents can result in disqualification. A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA). In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.|$|E

25|$|Arkansas {{scored on}} their first two plays; Joe Adams {{catching}} an 18-yard pass from Ryan Mallett (Alex Tejada kick) followed by a Jarius Wright 48-yard pass from Mallett. Georgia would score on a Joe Cox TD pass and Blair Walsh field goal, followed by a Greg Childs 30-yard touchdown reception from Ryan Mallett {{to make it a}} 21-10 Razorback lead to end the first period. Early in the second quarter, Razorback linebacker Jerry Franklin was assessed two <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalties and was ejected. Georgia opened the second quarter scoring with an 80-yard run by Richard Samuel, followed by a 25-yard pass from Joe Cox to A.J. Green.

25|$|The Bulldogs {{broke the}} halftime tie {{on their first}} drive of the second half, with Lucas Beatty {{completing}} another touchdown pass to Earnest Harmon from the 1-yard line. Gardner-Webb dominated the third quarter, adding two more touchdowns. The second score of the quarter would come after Blake Brewer’s 48-yard field goal attempt was blocked by Drew White and recovered by the Bulldogs. On the same play Charlotte was penalized twice for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct.</b> The result was a Juanne Blount 1-yard touchdown run on the next play. The third GWU touchdown of the quarter would come on their next drive. Richard Jules would complete a 27-yard pass to Mike Estes. Blake Brewer would miss a 39-yard field goal to close out the half, with Gardner-Webb having a lead, 45–24.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, Blackwood {{recorded}} his second interception, only to see it wiped out by a defensive holding penalty. But the next play fared no better for New York, as Todd threw a pass that bounced {{out of the hands}} of running back Mike Augustyniak and was intercepted by Duhe. A few plays later, Nathan appeared to lose a fumble, but officials ruled him down by contact before he lost the ball. Another key play on the drive occurred when Woodley completed a 13-yard pass to Duriel Harris on third down and 3. Safety Darrol Ray vehemently protested the call of a completed pass, drawing an <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty that moved the ball to the Jets 7-yard line, and running back Woody Bennett ran the ball into the end zone on the next play.|$|E
25|$|In {{the quarterfinals}} on 6 December, Hari {{defeated}} three time K-1 World champion Peter Aerts by TKO {{in the second}} round. In the semis he knocked out Errol Zimmerman and headed to his first K-1 Final against Remy Bonjasky. After suffering a knockdown in the first, Hari was disqualified {{in the second round}} for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> by stomping and punching an already downed Bonjasky. First the referee Nobuaki Kakuda issued a yellow card and one point deduction. Meanwhile, Hari proceeded to Bonjasky’s corner shouting, and quarreled with his opponent's trainer Ivan Hippolyte who then also approached Hari aggressively, but the officials prevented any further physical contact between them. After the five-minute recovery time elapsed, the doctor reported Bonjasky was seeing double and could not continue. Hari was issued a red card and Bonjasky was declared the K-1 World GP 2008 champion.|$|E
25|$|Penn State {{received}} the ball first in overtime and {{scored on a}} touchdown run from Bill Belton. The Buckeyes responded on their possession, scoring in three plays on a run from Barrett, sending the game to a second overtime. Following an <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty on Penn State, Ohio State again drove {{the ball into the}} endzone on three plays, taking a 31–24 lead. Penn State was unable to score on their ensuing possession, with Hackenberg being sacked on the final play of the game by Joey Bosa, sealing the victory for the Buckeyes. Bosa was recognized for his achievements, which included six tackles and 2.5 sacks, by being named the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week. With the win, Ohio State improved their overall record against Penn State to 16–13 (17–13 without NCAA vacations and forfeits)(Penn State's victories that were previously vacated were reinstated by the NCAA).|$|E
25|$|With leading rusher Bruce Perry out due to {{a sprained}} ankle, Terps running back Josh Allen adeptly filled in, and racked up 257 yards and two {{touchdown}}s. Virginia quarterback Matt Schaub threw for a touchdown and ran for another, but his second-half comeback attempt ultimately fell short. In the game, Schaub overtook Shawn Moore's career passing record at the school. There was also some excitement even before the game started. Maryland assistant coach James Franklin and Virginia head coach Al Groh had a heated exchange after a Cavaliers player interrupted the Terps' warm up drills. Then, after Virginia won the coin toss, Al Groh infamously elected to kick off to start both halves. Immediately after the decision, the entire Maryland team rushed the field in celebration and was given a 15-yard <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> penalty before the opening kickoff. The win kept the Terps' ACC title hopes alive, but Florida State narrowly beat N.C. State 50–44 to win the conference outright. Maryland finished second-place in the ACC.|$|E
25|$|In the Australian Open, Nalbandian had a five-set loss to Isner and {{was fined}} $8,000 for <b>unsportsmanlike</b> <b>conduct</b> {{following}} the match. On February, David participated in two Davis Cup matches for Argentina against the German team, defeating Florian Mayer in a singles match and then partnering with Eduardo Schwank {{to win a}} doubles match against Tommy Haas and Philipp Petzschner to help the Argentinian team advance to the quarterfinals. Afterwards, Nalbandian played a string of clay tournaments, reaching the quarterfinals in the Brasil Open, semifinals in Buenos Aires and a first round exit at the Mexican Open. He then entered the first ATP Masters 1000 tournament of the year, the 2012 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, losing in the quarterfinals to Rafael Nadal. After the tournament, Nalbandian reached No. 40 in the ATP Rankings but failed to progress past the first round in the 2012 French Open as he was beaten by the Romanian, Adrian Ungur in four sets.|$|E
