5000|$|Initiated by the RLM (Reichsluftfahrministerium - Reich Aviation Ministry), the Mü18 [...] "Meßkrähe" [...] was an {{experimental}} flying wind-tunnel used to research aerofoil sections in <b>undisturbed</b> <b>airflow.</b> With the airframe {{designed and built}} at Akaflieg München, test aerofoil sections were provided by Akaflieg Chemnitz, Akaflieg Danzig and Akaflieg Göttingen. Test sections were suspended, in <b>undisturbed</b> <b>airflow</b> on an adjustable trapeze, for measurement of pressure distribution at various angles of attack. Progress on the glider was slow due to a very low priority for resources, but the Mü18 [...] "Meßkrähe" [...] eventually flew {{towards the end of}} World War II.|$|E
5000|$|To {{maximise}} {{the precision}} of this compensation effect, the total energy probe {{needs to be in}} <b>undisturbed</b> <b>airflow</b> ahead of the aircraft nose or tail fin (the [...] "Braunschweig tube", the long cantilevered tube with a kink in the end that can be seen projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} tail fin on most modern sailplanes.) ...|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{turbines}} {{are placed}} in a grid pattern of lines and rows. But the turbines of AOWF {{are placed in}} an unusual pattern, governed by two principles: put most of them along the edges, and put most in <b>undisturbed</b> <b>airflow</b> from the main direction, which is West-southwest. This would increase production by 1.5%, a lifetime value of more than 100m DKK.|$|E
25|$|The Avid Flyer is a {{conventional}} layout, single engine, {{side by side}} two seat light aircraft, with a strut-braced high wing configuration. Aluminum tubes serve as leading edge/main spar and rear spar, each wing being supported {{by a pair of}} tubular lift struts. Sawn plywood wing ribs are bonded to the aluminum tube spars using a filled epoxy compound. The Avid Flyer features Junkers style one-piece flaperons supported by three offset hinge arms. The Junkers design moves the control surfaces well underneath the wing, where they remain in <b>undisturbed</b> smooth <b>airflow</b> at low speed and/or higher climb angles.|$|R
2500|$|The Lightning {{had several}} {{distinctive}} design features, {{the principal of}} these being the twin engine arrangement, notched delta wing, and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimizing frontal area, providing <b>undisturbed</b> engine <b>airflow</b> across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the drag equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin engine installations. The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. However, because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other engine. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance; although this was rarely done operationally because {{there would be no}} hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed [...]|$|R
5000|$|Some aircraft, {{such as the}} Denney Kitfox, {{suspend the}} {{flaperon}}s below the wing (rather {{in the manner of}} slotted flaps) to provide <b>undisturbed</b> <b>airflow</b> at high angles of attack or low airspeeds. When the flaperon surface is hinged below the trailing edge of a wing, they are sometimes named [...] "Junker Flaperons", from the doppelflügel (lit., [...] "double wing") type of trailing edge surfaces used on a number of Junkers aircraft of the 1930s, such as the Junkers Ju 52 airliner, and Junkers Ju 87 Stuka iconic World War II dive bomber.|$|E
5000|$|The {{arrival of}} Harvey Postlethwaite {{led to a}} total {{overhaul}} of the car {{in time for the}} [...] season. The turbo engine was further developed and reliability found, while an all-new chassis and bodywork were designed, featuring Ferrari's first genuine full monocoque chassis with honeycomb aluminum panels for the structure, which made it more similar to its British specialist competitors' cars than the previous year's car had been. Smaller, nimbler and with vastly improved aerodynamics, the 126C2 handled far better than its predecessor. Villeneuve and Didier Pironi posted record times in testing with the new car and began the season with several solid results. At the Long Beach Grand Prix, the car was fitted with an unusual configuration of two thin rear wings, each individually as wide as the regulations allowed, but placed side-by-side and staggered fore and aft, making it effectively a single double-wide wing. This was done as a deliberate exploitation of rule loopholes in retaliation for Williams' [...] "water-cooled brakes" [...] exploit, part of the FISA-FOCA wars, and resulted in disqualification. Then came the infamous race at San Marino after which Villeneuve accused Pironi of having disobeyed team orders. The fallout from the race preceded Villeneuve's death in an horrific accident during qualifying at the next round in Belgium, which left Pironi as team leader. Pironi himself was nearly killed in a similar accident in Germany, putting an end to his motor racing career, but this did not stop Ferrari from winning the constructors' championship that year. The 126C2 was further developed during the season, with new wings and bodywork tried, and the engine's power boosted to [...] in qualifying trim and around [...] in races. An improved chassis was designed and developed mid-season that was introduced for the French Grand Prix that changed the rocker arm front suspension to a more streamlined pull-rod suspension. A thinner longitudinal gearbox was also designed and developed to replace the transverse gearbox to promote better <b>undisturbed</b> <b>airflow</b> from the underside of the ground-effects chassis's side-pods.|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{response of}} snow gauges {{when exposed to}} the wind is responsible for a significant reduction of their collection performance. The modifications induced by the gauge and the windshield onto the space–time patterns of the <b>undisturbed</b> <b>airflow</b> deviate the snowflake trajectories. In Part I, the disturbed air velocity field {{in the vicinity of}} shielded and unshielded gauge configurations is investigated. In Part II, the airflow is the basis for a particle tracking model of snowflake trajectories to estimate the collection efficiency. A Geonor T- 200 B gauge inside a single Alter shield is simulated for wind speeds varying from 1 to 8 m s− 1. Both time-averaged and time-dependent computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed, based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) models, respectively. A shear stress tensor k–Ω model (where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and Ω is the turbulent specific dissipation rate) is used for the RANS formulation and solved within a finite-volume method. The LES is implemented with a Smagorinsky subgrid-scale method that models the subgrid stresses as a gradient-diffusion process. The RANS simulations confirm the attenuation of the airflow velocity above the gauge when using a single Alter shield, but the generated turbulence above the orifice rim is underestimated. The intensity and spatial extension of the LES-resolved turbulent region show a dependency on the wind speed that was not detected by the RANS. The time-dependent analysis showed the propagation of turbulent structures and the impact on the turbulent kinetic energy above the gauge collecting section...|$|E
