50|$|In Norway (and {{some other}} countries) the {{directory}} {{services in the}} 1970s distinguished between secret number, <b>unlisted</b> <b>number</b> and listed number with a hidden address. The first type secret number was typically used by celebrities (in this case the address was hidden as well). The second type <b>unlisted</b> <b>number</b> was not listed in the (paper based) phone book, but was listed on the directory service (a voice call to 018 in the 1970s). Listed number with a hidden address is useful for women's shelter etc., where the number needs to be listed, but where the address shall be hidden to the general public. Naturally there are many changes when directory services became available on the Internet, but this case shows that separate user groups may have different needs to hide various parameters relating to privacy.|$|E

Overall, 31 % of randomly selected persons eligible to participate had unlisted telephone numbers—about 50 % of black men and women and 11 % and 17 % of white men and women, respectively. There was no difference in proportions of <b>numbers</b> <b>unlisted</b> by educational level, except for white men, who {{were more likely to have}} <b>unlisted</b> <b>numbers</b> at a low educational level than at a high educational level. There was no consistent pattern of differences in rates of participation across race, sex, or education subgroups for <b>unlisted</b> and listed <b>numbers,</b> and there were no significant differences for selected health measures, except smoking. The findings suggest that in Chicago, there is a potential bias in estimates of sociodemographic characteristics from the exclusion of <b>unlisted</b> <b>numbers,</b> but it is likely to be insignificant if recruitment is stratified according to race, sex, and education.

50|$|Malicious caller {{identification}} facility, also called {{malicious call trace}} or caller activated malicious call trace, when subscribed or enabled, works by allowing a phone call recipient to mark or flag the preceding phone call connection as malicious (i.e. harassing, threatening, obscene, etc.) The phone system will then automatically trace the call by flagging station to station billing and routing data including start and end times. The call trace is not dependent upon call duration (as envisioned in dramatic movie plots) and will record all meta-data regardless of source conditions - even if the call was made from an <b>unlisted</b> <b>number,</b> a payphone or a number with {{caller identification}} disabled. To protect privacy the resulting trace data is only made available to law enforcement.|$|E

If desired, customers should inquire carefully {{to make sure their}} number will not be displayed. The telephone service provider may also have vertical service codes which can be dialed to configure blocking as active for all calls or on a call-by-call basis.|$|R

5000|$|Now in {{her late}} thirties, Dennis's birth mother Jerry Sherwood sought out Dennis in the early 1980s, {{assuming}} that he would now be a young adult and—as she {{had given birth to}} four more children with Dennis's birth father—might want to meet his siblings. Her search led her eventually to his grave, and her continued investigation led to a phone call to Lois Jurgens to inquire about what had happened. Lois was cordial on the phone, and even offered to mail some mementos. When these mementos failed to arrive, Sherwood called again, only to discover that the Jurgenses had switched to an <b>unlisted</b> <b>number,</b> further fueling her suspicions. Sherwood eventually located Dennis's death certificate; because the death was categorized as [...] "deferred," [...] the case was still technically open. This, coupled with the lack of a statute of limitations for a murder charge, could lead the way to a prosecution of Lois Jurgens. Jerry took her case to the White Bear Lake police department and then to the local media.|$|E
5000|$|Robocalls {{can be and}} are legitimately used by {{mainstream}} {{political parties}} in Canada to reach voters. Controversy surrounded the use of robocalls during the Canadian federal election, 2011, leading Elections Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate claims that robocalls were used {{in an attempt to}} dissuade voters from casting their ballot by falsely telling them their poll stations had changed locations. Elections Canada traced the origin of the automated calls to a disposable cellphone registered to a fictional name [...] "Pierre Poutine" [...] at a phony address from 450 area code of Joliette, Quebec, and issued a subpoena to the cellphone provider that produced a list of outgoing calls from the same number. One of the calls was to the toll-free number used by customers of 2call.ca, a subsidiary of Edmonton-based Internet Service Provider RackNine, to phone in and record their outgoing messages. The burner cell phone belonging to [...] "Pierre Poutine" [...] was used to contact the owner of Racknine at his personal <b>unlisted</b> <b>number</b> and gave the name [...] "Pierre Jones". This burner phone initiated a series of automated robocalls mostly in Guelph but with a few dozen in other ridings, that targeted mostly non-Conservative voters with false voting location changes. Some voters attended what they had been led to believe were their voting locations, and sometimes destroyed their voter registration cards in anger.|$|E
50|$|The {{last straw}} was the {{appointment}} of the little-known Terry Lewis to be Whitrod's Assistant Commissioner. The position had become vacant, and Whitrod chose his preferred candidate. He advised the Cabinet of this name, {{and the names of}} two others also acceptable to him and to the Police Union. It had always been the practice for the Cabinet to endorse the Police Commissioner's recommendation for his assistant. In this case, however, they chose Terry Lewis, an inspector, who was known to be a close associate and bagman of the corrupt former Police Commissioner Francis Bischof. He was also less qualified for the position than at least 60 other men. Whitrod believed all his efforts for seven years to eradicate corruption would be undermined if the appointment went ahead, and he asked to speak to Bjelke-Petersen. However, the premier refused to see Whitrod, nor would he allow him to address the Cabinet on the matter. That night, Whitrod wrote out his resignation. Terry Lewis was then appointed Police Commissioner. Prior to leaving Queensland for Canberra, Ray Whitrod and his wife were subject to harassment and intimidation. He would have unordered taxis turning up during the night, sometimes {{three or four times a}} night, to take him to the airport. He would receive calls from strangers enquiring about his health, although he had an <b>unlisted</b> <b>number.</b> A heart specialist came to his house at three o'clock in the morning because he'd been told by police headquarters that Whitrod was having a heart attack. He had a large load of gravel he had not purchased dumped on his front garden. He became so frightened for his and his wife's safety that he took to sleeping with a revolver under his pillow. A large number of personal files, detailing police corruption, were mysteriously lost in transit between Brisbane and Canberra.|$|E
50|$|When {{the desired}} {{coverage}} area matches up closely enough with country codes and area codes, random digits can be chosen within the desired area codes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of people with a silent telephone by demographic and health-related issues and to assess the potential bias in telephone surveys that use the White Pages as the sampling frame. METHOD: A representative annual population health survey of South Australians aged 15 years and over conducted in 1994, 1998, 1999 and 2002. Self-reported information on telephone connection and listings in the White Pages was provided by participants. Questions {{were included in the}} 1998 survey on reasons why telephone number was not listed. RESULTS: The rate of unlisted telephone numbers significantly increased (17. 3 % to 20. 2 %) in South Australia between 1994 and 2002. People with an <b>unlisted</b> <b>number</b> {{are more likely to be}} living in the metropolitan area, single adult households, current smokers, and in the younger age groups. In the multivariate analyses the only health and risk factor variable that was consistently significant over the years was smoking status. The main reason for having an <b>unlisted</b> <b>number</b> was to avoid market research or telemarketing calls (33 %). CONCLUSION: Telephone surveys using White Pages samples are suitable to collect information for prevalence on most commonly collected self-reported health conditions and health-related issues. The exception is smoking status. IMPLICATIONS: The use of Whites Pages telephone samples is a suitable method for obtaining population health information because it is efficient when there is limited time and funds...|$|E

40|$|Two {{explanations}} {{of differences in}} undercoverage and nonresponse between neighbourhoods in a telephone survey among {{the inhabitants of the}} City of Groningen were studied: differences in population composition between neighbourhoods or in their social disorganization. Logistic multilevel analyses were performed on a sample of 7, 000 inhabitants and all 14 city neighbourhoods. Differences in undercoverage and nonresponse between neighbourhoods could be attributed for the greater part to variations in the population composition of the neighbourhoods. Social disorganization had no effect on nonresponse and only a small one on undercoverage: people in neighbourhoods in decay (indicated by prolonged vacancies and relatively frequent criminal offenses) more often had no telephone or an <b>unlisted</b> <b>number</b> than people in other neighbourhoods. ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, an {{emergency}} service can identify the telephone number that a call has been placed from.

However, with mobile phones and business telephones, the address may be a mailing address rather than the caller's location. The latest [...] "enhanced" [...] systems, such as Enhanced 911, are able to provide the address the cell phone tower a mobile telephone is bouncing off of.
