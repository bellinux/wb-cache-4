50|$|The APM mill at Petrie was {{the largest}} {{industrial}} undertaking in southern Queensland during the immediate post-war period and probably the largest individual industrial unit to be constructed {{by the private sector}} in Queensland to that date. It made an important contribution to the post-war development of Queensland's secondary industries. Prior to World War II, Queensland lacked secondary industries of any note and from the 1950s the Queensland government encouraged their growth. The State assisted APM to establish the mill and assisted with financing the water supply scheme by granting a 50% subsidy and helping with raising loans. In 2004, the Petrie Mill was the only coated <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing plant in Australia, producing about thirty different <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> products and with production exceeding 140,000 tonnes per annum.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} downstream perceptions of liquid <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> versus competing materials in packaging applications for juice. The methodology used is focus groups. The context is sustainability and functional performance, and related potential {{implications for the}} beverage industry value chain. The purpose {{is to get a}} deeper insight and understanding of functionality in relation to juice beverage packaging. The results confirm that there is no optimal packaging for every juice product, but a multitude, depending on the distribution channel, retail outlet, customer preferences, and context of consumption. There are some general packaging preferences, but the main deciding criteria for purchase seem to be the product characteristics in terms of quality, taste, brand, price and shelf life. For marketing reasons, packaging has to be adopted to the product and its positioning, liquid <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> packaging seem to have some functional advantages in distribution and is considered as sustainable and functional among many consumers. Major drawbacks seem to be shape limitations, lack of transparency, and lack of a “premium look”.

40|$|<b>Carton</b> <b>board</b> {{packages}} are often closed with an adhesive. The adhesive joint thus formed has {{to meet the}} demands during the entire product life from converting to end-use. The adhesive joint has to be characterized if it is good or bad for the actual application. Today such characterization is done by manually peeling the joint, immediately after the adhesive application in the gluing machine. The manual peel test is a subjective test that is operator dependent. An operator needs long experience to be able to perform a manual peel test. Therefore, the packaging industry is interested in a test method that can objectively predict good or bad adhesive joints. The adhesive joints have been tested in the so-called Y-peel test arrangement. An advantage of the Y-peel test is that it gives an objective result from the force–elongation curve. Testing has been performed with <b>carton</b> <b>boards</b> of two different thicknesses. Hotmelt adhesive was used and the open time was varied in the glue applicator. It was found that the Y-peel test gives results in qualitative agreement with the manual peel test. Moreover, by evaluating the energy consumption (dissipative energy) during the Y-peel test it was possible to obtain not only a qualitative but also a quantitative assessment of the adhesive joint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} the study of a series of photoinitiators (PIs) present in a set of two paper and board samples which have {{different}} composition, grammage and thickness. The chemical compounds released by the paper packaging can contaminate food and may affect the safety and health of consumers. To evaluate if the paper and board could be used as food packaging material, partition coefficients (Kpaper/air) between paper and air of six kinds of PIs in white <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> and kraft paper were determined. The results indicated that Values of Kpaper/air from 1 to 4843 were obtained at different temperatures. Kpaper/air decreases with temperature increasing, and the value is proportional to grammage and thickness of the paper samples. The lower of the grammage and the thickness,the lower of Kpaper/air value will be. The Kpaper/air value of 2 -ethylhexyl- 4 -dimethylaminobenzoate (EHDAB) is the lowest, and the Kpaper/air value of 4 -methylbenzophenone (MBP) is the highest. It shows that the Kpaper/air value depends on the boiling point of the chemical compounds, the chemical properties and the type of the paper sample...|$|R

A main objective was to develop a modified rapid and re-liable method for the identification and quantification of these compounds at low concentrations. The method was based on ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction (UAE) followed by gas chroma-tography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The developed method was applied to analyze 3 commercially available recycled <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> food-packaging materials and also to study the po-tential migration of the 5 organic pollutants from these materials into Tenax to check if these re-cycled cardboards can be considered as suitable for use in direct contact with foodstuffs.

40|$|The {{folding carton}} {{is a widely}} used {{packaging}} solution. Recent European Union packaging legislation has forced carton manufacturers to use lighter-weight grades of <b>carton</b> <b>board.</b> This typically results in a reduction in board stiffness, {{which can lead to}} decreased process efficacy or even prevent successful processing. In order to overcome this, end-users lower production rates and fine-tune packaging machine settings for each pack and material. This trial-and-error approach is necessary because the rules relating machine set-up to pack design and material properties are not generally well known. The present study addresses this fundamental issue through the creation of a finite-element computer simulation of carton processing. Mechanical testing was performed to ascertain the key mechanical properties of the carton walls and creases. The carton model was validated against the experimental results and was then subjected to the machine-material interactions that take place during complex packaging operations. The overall approach was validated and the simulation showed good agreement with the physical system. The results of the simulation can be used to determine guidelines relating machine set-up criteria to carton properties. This will improve responsiveness to change and will ultimately allow end-users to process thinner lighter-weight materials more effectively...|$|R
40|$|<b>Carton</b> <b>board</b> {{packages}} {{subjected to}} concentrated loads near the edges are damaged in a characteristic way. This paper reports {{an attempt to}} simulate the damage process in the lab and Package Collapse Loads measured for this load case. Packages were compressed by a concentrated load. The position of load application was varied along a line parallel to a crease and the package was rotated {{in order to test}} the influence of the height of the load carrying panel. Force and displacement were recorded and the damage evolution during the test was studied. The damage produced was examined using x-ray tomography. The nature of damage at different stages of damage evolution was studied. Both the visual appearance of the damage and the force-displacement curve were similar in all tests. The Package Collapse Load has little dependence on where along a line parallel to a crease of the package the point load is applied. Damage started developing at the crease and a yield line perpendicular to the crease and parallel to the direction of the load developed. When the displacement increased further, a parabolic yield line, symmetric around the previous one, developed. The start of the damage development was associated with at peak in the force-displacement curve. Stiffness was more geometry dependent than strength. On macro scale, the visual appearance of the damage due to concentrated loads shows no significant dependence on geometry...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a grey-box {{model for the}} dimensionalstability properties (i. e. curl and twist) of the carton boardproduced at AssiDomän Frövi paper mill in Sweden. AssiDomän Frövi AB is one of Sweden major cartonboard manufacturer, and produces some 350000 ton of board peryear. Curl {{is defined as the}} departure from a at form, and it mayseriously affect the processing of the paper. For this reason,customers impose quite restrictive limits on the allowedcurvatures of the board. So, it is becoming more and moreimportant to be able to produce a <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> with a curlwithin certain limits. Due to the economic significance of thecurl problem, much research has been performed to find sheetdesign and processing strategies to eliminate or reducecurl. The approach we used to tackle this problem is based ongrey-box modelling. The reasons for such an approach is thatthe physical process is very complex and nonlinear. The inuenceof some inputs is not entirely understood, and besides itdepends on a number of unknown parameters andunmodelled/unmesurable disturbances. One of {{the main part of the}} model is based on classicallaminate theory which is used to model the dimensionalstability of multi-ply board. The main assumption is that eachlayer is considered as an homogeneous elastic medium. The model is then complemented with a sub-model forunmodelled/umeasurable disturbances which are described asstates of a dynamical system, and estimated by means of anextended Kalman filter. The simulated curvatures show a general agreement with themeasurements. However, the prediction errors are too large forthe model to be used in an effective way, and a bigger efforthas to be carried out in order to improve the physicalsub-models. A chapter of this thesis discusses the modelling of thewet-end part of the paper machine with Dymola, a modelling toolfor simulation of large systems based on Modelica language. NR 2014080...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a grey-box {{model of the}} temperature and moisture content for each layer of the multi-ply paperboard inside the drying section of a paper mill. The distribution of the moisture inside the board is an important variable for the board quality, but is unfortunately not measured on-line. The main goal of this work is a model that predicts the moisture evolution during the drying, {{to be used by}} operators and process engineers as an estimation of the unmeasurable variables inside the drying section. Drying of <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> is a complex and nonlinear process. The physical phenomena are not entirely understood and the drying depends on a number of unknown parameters and unmodelled or unmeasurable features. The grey-box modelling approach, which consists in using the available measurements to estimate the unknown disturbances, is therefore a suitable approach for modelling the drying section. A major problem encountered with the modelling of the drying section is the lack of measurements to validate the model. Consequently, the correctness and uniqueness of the estimated variables and parameters are not guaranteed. We therefore carry out observability and identifiability analyses and the results suggest that the selected model structure is observable and identifiable under the assumption that specific measurements are available. Based on this analysis, static measurements in the drying section are carried out to identify the parameters of the model. The parameters are identified using one data set and the results are validated with other data sets. We finally simulate the model dynamics to investigate if predicting the final board properties on-line is feasible. Since only the final board temperature and moisture content are measured on-line, the variables and parameters are neither observable nor identifiable. We therefore regard the predictions as an approximation of the estimated variables. The semiphysical model is complemented with a nonlinear Kalman filter to estimate the unmeasured inputs and the unmodelled disturbances. Data simulations show a good prediction of the final board temperature and moisture content {{at the end of the}} drying section. The model could therefore possibly be used by operators and process engineers as an indicator of the board temperature and moisture inside the drying section. QC 2010111...|$|R

40|$|The {{gas phase}} {{transfer}} of substances from <b>carton</b> <b>board</b> (CB) and corrugated box board (CBB) through intervening layers to foods was studied. Substances covering a boiling point range of 252 - 425 °C {{and a range}} of polarities were incorporated into CB and CBB secondary packaging. Benzophenone was present in some CB materials. Where it was not already present in CB or CBB secondary packaging, it was deliberately incorporated for transfer studies. Transfer of substances was measured in nine foodstuff types stored in the secondary packaging at ambient and sub-ambient temperature. The foods were packaged in primary packaging materials that would be used in retail. Two food types were packed and stored in both single- and multipack formats. Foods were sampled at 0, 10, 30, 90 and 200 days and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after high-performance size exclusion chromatography clean-up. Percentage transfer was between 0 and 100 %. The overall trends were increased transfer of substances with increased storage time; a more rapid transfer of the more volatile substances compared with the less volatile ones and higher levels of transfer of the more volatile substances. No transfer of diheptyl phthalate (DHP) (bp 425 °C) as an incorporated substance was detected to any foods over the test period. The presence of an additional layer of packaging (multipack versus single pack) was shown to reduce transfer up to fourfold over 200 days and to increase the lag period for transfer. In terms of slowing transfer, metallized PP/PP laminate proved a more effective barrier than PP which was more effective than paper. It is postulated that there is a cut-off threshold for transfer at ambient and sub-ambient temperatures. Substances that are less volatile than the cut-off are anticipated not to transfer from secondary packaging to foods stored for up to 200 days, where the substances are present in the packaging at or below the levels tested in this study (up to 1 mg dm- 2). In this study the volatility cut-off threshold lay between that of 2, 2 -dimethoxyphenylacetophenone (2, 2 -DMPAP) (an incorporated substance with bp 352 °C) and DHP. Ideally, the cut-off threshold should be expressed in terms of vapour pressure in the packaging material. In practical terms, it may be more appropriate to express as partition coefficient as this is simpler to determine experimentally. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd...|$|R

40|$|KM 8 på Stora Enso Skoghall som producerar kartong har länge haft ett problem med deras fuktprofil. Problemet har inte drabbat kunderna på något sätt men ändå så har ledningen velat hitta orsaken till problemet. Fuktprofilen är sned och har varit det en längre tid. På KM 8 produceras en rad olika kartongkvalitéer. Exempelvis vätskekartong, liner och Coated Kraft Back. Målsättningen har varit att ta reda på ifall sneda formeringsskor kan vara orsaken till den sneda fuktprofilen samt att finna ett lämpligt mätsystem som mäter formeringskorna online. Sedan att sammanställa de olika mätresultaten som mätfirmorna kommit fram till. KM 8 kan delas upp i fyra olika sektioner: Viraparti, pressparti, torkparti och bestrykningspartiet. Efter att genomsökt bestrykningen utan resultat så togs det in en mätfirma för att mäta hur valsarna i presspartiet stod. Dessa stod snett och misstanke om att andra maskindelar stod snett tvärs maskinen började växa. Därför togs det in ytterligare en mätfirma för att mäta hela presspartiet samt virapartiet. Det visade sig att valsarna stod väldigt snett och en tredje firma hyrdes in för att mäta och rikta in samtliga maskinelement. Mätfirman heter Maskin&Mätservice och har varit den dominerande mätfirman på KM 8. Under tiden för uppriktningar har ett mätsystem har tagits fram för att kunna mäta formeringskon online och heter DSL-A 15 med en tillhörande {{processor}} som visar avståndet. Denna heter minipede. Resultatet blev inte som väntat, det gick inte att se någon skillnad på de loggade profilerna, (fukt och formeringsprofiler). Formeringskorna utgör alltså inte orsaken till problemet med fuktprofilen och inte heller är det motiverat att införskaffa det föreslagna mätsystemet. Dock har uppriktningen gjort att slitaget på virorna har minskat samt att en uteslutning av press och virapartiet som orsak till problemet kunnat göras. Ett fortsatt arbete med att finna orsaken är motiverat då problemet leder till en sämre kvalitetsgrad och på det sättet påverkar produktionen. Sökandet efter en temperaturskillnad på torkcylindrarna i torkpartiet kan vara en lämplig fortsättningBM 8 on Stora Enso Skoghall packaging {{board has}} {{had a problem with}} their profile of moisture content for a long time. The problem has not affected customers, but still it has been a problem and the management wanted {{to get to the bottom}} of it. BM 8 is a board machine that produces several different types of board. For example, liquid <b>carton</b> <b>board,</b> liner and Coated Kraft Back. The purpose was to find out if the diagonal formers were the cause of the problem, and to find an online measuring system to measure the formers. Also to put together the different measure results given by the measuring companies. The board-machine can be divided up to four different parts: wire part, press section, drying section and the coating section. The idea was to search the problem in every section. After having searched for the problem without any results in the coating section, they began to search the press section and found out that there were a lot of machine elements who were diagonal. With this knowledge the management brought in a measuring company that measured the rolls in the press section and the wire part. A lot of rolls were diagonal. Another company was called in to measure the rolls and the former, and also to align the different parts. This company is named Maskin & Mätservice and has been the superior company for measuring the different elements on BM 8. While aligning the elements, a online measuring system was presented for measuring the formers. The measuring system is named DSL-A 15 and the displayer is named Minipede. The results after measuring and aligning the different elements weren’t as pleasing as it was expected to be. There was no difference in the profiles that had been saved. So the problem still remains. The problem is not a consequence of diagonal formers or rolls and an online measuring system is not motivated to install. The good news is that the management can exclude the press section and the wire part in their search after the problem. Also the alignment has reduced the wear and tear of the wires. A continuous work to find the reason that causes the problem is warranted, as the problem results in a lower efficiency factor. The continuous work should be to search in the drying section, looking for a heat difference on the drying cylinders...|$|R
