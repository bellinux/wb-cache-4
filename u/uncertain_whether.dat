Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays {{a central role in}} the immune response, might imply an immune system cause, but it is <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> this directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known autoimmune disease.|$|E

5|$|Dorothy soon fell in {{love with}} Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy {{attended}} his lectures at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> he intended to stay in New York or return to London.|$|E
5|$|In late 1974, the CFA {{decided to}} {{schedule}} a special championship. Although board members were <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> Nea Salamina should play (due to the refugee problem), they decided to participate so the team could remain in the Cypriot First Division and stay alive. Since there was no permanent stadium, the team used GSZ Stadium in 1974–75, the Deryneia municipal stadium in 1975–76, the GSZ Stadium again in 1976–77, Dasaki Stadium in Dasaki Achnas in 1977–78 and GSZ Stadium from 1978 to 1980.|$|E
5|$|Keeping the old {{systems and}} {{converting}} them to encrypted systems was also considered. This {{was estimated to}} cost NOK500 million to install, but could not be guaranteed to work satisfactorily. In particular, encryption would delay communications, {{which would be a}} problem for urgent communications. It was also <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> the level of encryption would be sufficient to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} when {{citizens}} are <b>uncertain</b> about <b>whether</b> a successful revolution {{will turn out}} better than the status quo, communication between citizens reduces the likelihood of successful revolution when {{the status quo is}} sufficiently bad. A bad regime faces a tradeoff: communication helps citizens to coordinate, facilitating revolution; but it also facilitates the dissemination of any negative information about the alternative to the status quo, forestalling revolution. When the regime is sufficiently bad, this latter effect dominates. This result contrasts with the literature that assumes that each citizen knows that he wants to change the regime, but he is <b>uncertain</b> about <b>whether</b> enough citizens will revolt. In such settings, communication always raises the likelihood of successful revolution. ...|$|R

5|$|Pterodroma petrel remains dated {{at between}} 60,000 and 25,000 years BP {{were found in}} two cave sites in Gibraltar. They consist of a more {{abundant}} form similar in size to Zino's, and a larger, less common type. It is <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> they represent {{the site of a}} former breeding colony, or are the result of a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.|$|E
5|$|Several tyrannosaurid skeletons {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana {{probably}} belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> {{they belong to}} G. libratus or a new species. One specimen from Montana (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, osteomyelitis (infection) {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, and possibly a brain tumor.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> or not it was written by Shakespeare.|$|E

It is <b>uncertain</b> today <b>whether</b> the aircraft ever actually flew in either configuration.|$|R
5|$|Ancient {{cultures}} {{around the}} Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus {{made a series}} of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> the artifact was electrical in nature.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} revolutionary {{movement}} was <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> {{to destroy the}} prison, to reoccupy it as a fortress {{with members of the}} volunteer guard militia, or to preserve it intact as a permanent revolutionary monument. The revolutionary leader Mirabeau eventually settled the matter by symbolically starting the destruction of the battlements himself, after which a panel of five experts was appointed by the Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville to manage the demolition of the castle. One of these experts was Pierre-François Palloy, a bourgeois entrepreneur who claimed vainqueur status for his role during the taking of the Bastille, and he rapidly assumed control over the entire process. Palloy's team worked quickly and by November most of the fortress had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or whether he had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E

5|$|Even the Jäger {{battalion}} {{was divided}} {{in the same}} way that the rest of the country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in Germany as they could have chosen the Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted a nationalist war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.|$|E
5|$|For a while, he was <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> {{he would}} attend college, but {{ultimately}} he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where {{a friend had}} also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Great {{white sharks}} (Carcharodon carcharias) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle. There {{is a record}} of a small {{individual}} caught off Argentina that bore bite marks from a copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) or similar species, but it is <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> the porbeagle {{was the target of}} attempted predation or if the two were simply involved in interspecific aggression. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Dinobothrium septaria and Hepatoxylon trichiuri, and the copepods Dinemoura producta, Laminifera doello-juradoi, and Pandarus floridanus. Natural annual mortality is low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, Benson {{started a}} {{research}} project on the efficacy of prayer among patients undergoing {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery. The project, funded by the John Templeton Foundation, was explicit that its objective was not to prove or disprove the existence of god. This [...] "Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)" [...] became popularly known as the [...] "Great Prayer Experiment" [...] and was described as [...] "the most intense investigation ever undertaken of whether prayer can help to heal illness." [...] The trial attempted to differentiate among outcomes in three groups of patients: (1) those <b>uncertain</b> of <b>whether</b> they were being prayed for, who were; (2) those <b>uncertain</b> of <b>whether</b> they were being prayed for, who were not; and (3) those being prayed for who were certain of it. The conclusion, published in 2006, was that intercessory prayer has no beneficial effect on CABG patients. Indeed, certainty of receiving intercessory prayer was actually associated with a higher incidence of complications.|$|R
5|$|In 1111, Domnall evidently {{seized the}} kingship of the Isles by force. It is <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> he enjoyed Uí Briain support in this venture. Several years later, {{at a time}} when his {{aforesaid}} uncle was gravely ill, Domnall was again active in Ireland. Although he may have openly left the Isles to take advantage of his uncle's demise, it is also possible he was forced out by the Islesmen. Domnall was slain in 1115, apparently at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. It is possible that he was survived by two sons.|$|E
5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>uncertain</b> <b>whether</b> a {{building}} {{stood on the}} site of the citadel before the 11th century AD. The Ghouta, the wider area in which Damascus is located, has been occupied since at least 9000 BC, but there is no evidence for settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC. The area occupied by the later citadel was most likely outside this first settlement. The presence of a citadel during the Hellenistic period is uncertain. Damascus certainly had a citadel during the Roman period, but whether it was located {{on the site of}} the present citadel is uncertain and subject to scholarly debate.|$|E
