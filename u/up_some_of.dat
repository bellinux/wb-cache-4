5|$|Adding to the problems, the zip fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the difference. Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling {{one of the two}} bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, another problem arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, Theodore of Tarsus {{resolved the}} situation by deposing Ceadda and restoring Wilfrid as the Bishop of Northumbria. For the next nine years Wilfrid discharged his episcopal duties, founded monasteries, built churches, and improved the liturgy. However his diocese was very large, and Theodore wished to reform the English Church, a process which included breaking <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the larger dioceses into smaller ones. When Wilfrid quarrelled with Ecgfrith, the Northumbrian king, Theodore {{took the opportunity to}} implement his reforms despite Wilfrid's objections. After Ecgfrith expelled him from York, Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the papacy. Pope Agatho ruled in Wilfrid's favour, but Ecgfrith refused to honour the papal decree and instead imprisoned Wilfrid on his return to Northumbria before exiling him.|$|E

Acclaim brought the game to the PlayStation 2 on May 21, 2001 and GameCube on November 18, 2001, while Activision and Strangelite ported the game to the PC in 2002; only the PlayStation 2 port was more successful than the Dreamcast version, and the rest didn't do as well. The Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi was also playable through emulation via Gametap on PC systems.|$|E

5|$|SG 4′s {{mission was}} also a disaster. During the {{assembly}} phase, they flew across JG 11′s flight path, and the formation was broken <b>up.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> the pilots joined JG 11 in the confusion. Unable to recover the formation, I and II./SG 4 then decided to head home. The Kommodore, Druschel, had continued with five other pilots from III./SG 4 who had lost contact with their Gruppe. They crossed the front near Hürtgenwald around 09:10. As they did so, American anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, claiming seven aircraft in the next 30 minutes. Only six of the 50 Fw 190s of SG 4 carried out an attack, against airfields near Aachen and the Asch aerodrome. Of these six, four did not return. Druschel himself was reported missing.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} rocks {{which make}} <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain are unusual {{in that they}} have an acid-neutralizing chemical substance like typical ocean-island basalts but a low percentage of strontium as found at mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, the strontium-bearing volcanic rocks comprising Bowie Seamount also contain lead. Therefore, the magma mixtures that formed Bowie Seamount seem to have originated from varying degrees of partial melting of a depleted source in the Earth's mantle and basalts which had distinctly high lead isotopic ratios. Estimates during geological studies indicate that the abundance of the depleted-source component ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the erupted material.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's {{ability to control}} their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It {{could be argued that}} differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday Survey, the manor was owned by King William, and was the {{principal}} settlement of the largest and wealthiest hundred in Somerset. Over the following years, parts of the original manor were spun off as distinct manors; for example, one was owned by the minster, later passing to the Abbey at Cirencester, which others were leased by the Crown to important families. By the 13th century, the Abbey had bought <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the other manors (although it did let them out again) and was exploiting the profits from market and trade in the town. Local tradition asserts that Frome was a medieval borough, and the reeve of Frome is occasionally mentioned in documents after the reign of Edward I, but there is no direct evidence that Frome was a borough and no trace of any charter granted to it. However, the Kyre Park Charters of Edward's reign note a Hugh, lord of Parva (or little) Frome, as well as other witnesses. Additionally, Henry VII did grant a charter to Edmund Leversedge, then lord of the manor, giving him the right to hold fairs on 22 July and 21 September. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting {{until the last minute}} to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E

5|$|On 24–25 July, Republican forces {{launched}} {{the last major}} offensive of the war, the Battle of the Ebro. Reconnaissance units of the Condor Legion had noticed a troop build-up, and warned Nationalists forces. The warning went unheeded. Although the Republic gained ground, Republican forces failed {{to gain control of}} Gandesa, with 422 sorties by the Legion having considerable effect. However, tensions in Czechoslovakia and a shortage of pilots in Germany led to the return of 250 pilots from the Legion. Although trained Spaniards made <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the shortfall, Volkmann complained to central command in Berlin, which led to his recall in September. During the battle, which saw 113 days of fighting, only 10 aircraft were lost (some by accident); the Legion claimed around 100 Republican aircraft. Only five aircrew had been killed, and six captured. Aid from Germany temporarily halted in mid-September. Germany and Nationalist Spain settled the issue of German interests in Spanish mines.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} to give <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised {{him that he would}} be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E
5|$|The town {{developed}} {{around its}} 11th-century priory, a Benedictine monastery, {{the remains of}} which make <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the early parts of Great Malvern Priory, now a large parish church. Several slightly different histories explain the actual founding of the religious community. Legend tells that the settlement began following the murder of St. Werstan, a monk of Deerhurst, who fled from the Danes and took refuge in the woods of Malvern, where the above-mentioned hermitage had been established. St Werstan's oratory {{is thought to have}} been located on the site of St Michael's Chapel which is believed to have stood on the site of Bello Sguardo, a Victorian Villa. Bello Sguardo was built on the site of Hermitage Cottage. The cottage was demolished in 1825 and ecclesiastical carvings were found within it. A Mediaeval undercroft, human bones and parts of a coffin were also uncovered. Although the legend may be monastic mythology, historians have however concluded that St. Werstan was the original martyr.|$|E

5|$|With {{limited time}} remaining, Clemson {{attempted}} an onside kick {{in an effort}} to retain possession and have a chance to make <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the scoring deficit. The kick was recovered by Virginia Tech, however, and the Vick-led Tech offense returned to the field at the Clemson 44-yard line. Suggs was stopped for no gain on a run up the middle, Vick threw an incomplete pass, then he completed a 14-yard pass to Wynn for a first down at the Clemson 30-yard line. After the first down, Ferguson gained a few yards on a run up the middle, then Suggs advanced the ball to just short of the first-down marker. On third down, Suggs gained the first down with a run up the middle. Following the first down, Clemson defender Alex Ardley was called for a personal foul and ejected from the game. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Clemson 10-yard line. From there, Clemson was called for a five-yard offsides penalty. On the first play after the consecutive penalties, Vick pitched the ball to Suggs, who ran into the end zone untouched. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech extended its lead to 4120 with 3:41 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|As the Giants began 2011, many NFL analysts {{predicted}} that the Philadelphia Eagles were a favorite to win the NFC East title, while the Giants were not expected to make the playoffs. The Giants opened their regular season against the Washington Redskins on September 11, 2011, and lost in FedEx Field 28–14. The Giants then won three straight games, including breaking their six-game losing streak to Philadelphia. By Week 9, New York was 6–2 after beating the Patriots in Foxboro for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLII. At this point however, they entered a difficult stretch of games and lost four straight to a resurgent 49ers, followed by the Eagles, Saints, and Packers. By now, the Giants found their chances of beating Dallas to the division title fading and Tom Coughlin's coaching abilities were increasingly called into question despite reassurances from team president John Mara {{that there were no}} plans to fire him. However, the Giants kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 by beating the Cowboys in Dallas on a last-second scoring drive led by Eli Manning and extending their win streak in Cowboys Stadium to three straight games. Despite another loss to the Redskins afterwards, the Giants defeated the New York Jets in Week 16 by a final score of 29-14, also eliminating the Eagles from playoff contention, to set up a rematch with the Dallas Cowboys in which the winner would win the NFC East. The game was later flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants beat the Cowboys 31–14 to win the NFC East with a record of 9-7. Throughout the regular season, Eli Manning (always viewed as a weak QB compared to his brother) put <b>up</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the best stats of his career.|$|E
