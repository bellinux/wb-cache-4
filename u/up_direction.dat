40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of state {{estimation}} for the vector-tracking loop of a software-defined Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. For a nonlinear system that has the model error and white Gaussian noise, a noise statistics estimator is used to estimate the model error, and based on this, a modified iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) named adaptive iterated Kalman filter (AIEKF) is proposed. A vector-tracking GPS receiver utilizing AIEKF is implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Through road tests, it is shown that the proposed method has an obvious accuracy advantage over the IEKF and Adaptive Extended Kalman filter (AEKF) in position determination. The results show that the proposed method is effective to reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of position (including longitude, latitude and altitude). Comparing with EKF, the position RMSE values of AIEKF are reduced by about 45. 1 %, 40. 9 % and 54. 6 % in the east, north and <b>up</b> <b>directions,</b> respectively. Comparing with IEKF, the position RMSE values of AIEKF are reduced by about 25. 7 %, 19. 3 % and 35. 7 % in the east, north and <b>up</b> <b>directions,</b> respectively. Compared with AEKF, the position RMSE values of AIEKF are reduced by about 21. 6 %, 15. 5 % and 30. 7 % in the east, north and <b>up</b> <b>directions,</b> respectively...|$|R
25|$|Following the {{grouping}} {{ordered by}} the Railways Act 1921 the LBSCR became a constituent company of the Southern Railway. New morning Down services were introduced from July 1925: 07:30 and 08:25 from Three Bridges to East Grinstead (completing the trip in 18 minutes) and a 10:40 service from London Bridge to Tunbridge Wells via Forest Row. Two new lunchtime services were also scheduled: a 13:40 from Three Bridges to East Grinstead, and a 13:27 Saturday service from London Victoria to Forest Row. In the <b>Up</b> <b>direction,</b> presumably {{for the benefit of}} those commuting up to London, a 06:50 service from Tonbridge to Cannon Street via East Grinstead replaced a later 07:05 service from Tunbridge Wells to Three Bridges. In addition, extra 07:58 and 08:56 workings from East Grinstead to Three Bridges were laid on, together with extra midday services at 13:08 from Tunbridge Wells to London Bridge via Forest Row and a 13:56 from East Grinstead to Three Bridges. By July 1930 there were 13 Up and Down daily passenger workings, and four goods services.|$|E

Microfluidic split-ring resonators (MF-SRRs) are fabricated inside a flexible elastomeric material by employing rapid prototyping. The transmission measurements performed for mercury-injected MF-SRR exhibits sharp magnetic resonances at microwave wavelengths. We further calculate transmission properties of the MF-SRR array {{and the effect of}} electrical conductivity of the liquid inside the channel on the magnetic resonance. The measured results agree well with numerical calculations.

40|$|Single-frequency Precise Point Positioning (PPP) using a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{has been}} {{attracting}} increasing interest {{in recent years}} due to its low cost and large number of users. Currently, the single-frequency PPP technique is mainly implemented using GPS observations. In order to improve the positioning accuracy and reduce the convergence time, we propose the combined GPS/GLONASS Single-Frequency (GGSF) PPP approach. The approach {{is based on the}} GRoup And PHase Ionospheric Correction (GRAPHIC) to remove the ionospheric effect. The performance of the GGSF PPP was tested using both static and kinematic datasets as well as different types of precise satellite orbit and clock correction data, and compared with GPS-only and GLONASS-only PPP solutions. The results show that the GGSF PPP accuracy degrades by a few centimetres using rapid/ultra-rapid products compared with final products. For the static GGSF PPP, the position filter typically converges at 71, 33 and 59 minutes in the East, North and <b>Up</b> <b>directions,</b> respectively. The corresponding positioning accuracies are 0 · 057, 0 · 028 and 0 · 121 Â m in the East, North and <b>Up</b> <b>directions.</b> Both positioning accuracy and convergence time have been improved by approximately 30 % in comparison to the results from GPS-only or GLONASS-only single-frequency PPP. A kinematic GGSF PPP test was conducted and the results illustrate even more significant benefits of increased accuracy and reliability of PPP solutions by integrating GPS and GLONASS signals.

Here, we report yet another plasmonic component based {{on a pair of}} surfaces displaying grating coupled plasmon enhanced transmission. We observe high quality factor transmission peaks as high as 100 through our plasmonic filter based on gratings obtained directly from optical storage disks. Wavelength and polarization dependent transmission is also demonstrated in the visible and infrared portions of the spectrum. The resonance wavelength of this filter can be tuned by simply changing the angle of incidence. Numerical calculations agree well with measurements.
