40|$|Commercial starch pearls {{manufactured}} from sago, tapioca, {{sweet potato}} or other starches from Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore were characterized. Samples were milled and pasting properties were evaluated. There were marked differences in pasting characteristics which {{were attributed to}} the pH of the starch pearls. The milled alkaline starch pearls showed high cold paste viscosities and setback ratios while the acidic milled starch had low cold paste viscosities and setback ratios. Furthermore, in alkaline milled starch, the addition of sugar drastically lowered the setback ratios while the setback ratios of the milled acidic starches were minimally affected. From the laboratory preparation of starch pearls from commercial tuber starches (potato and cassava), {{it appeared that the}} process of pearling effected a mild starch modification which increased the stability ratio of the milled starch pearl compared to the <b>unprocessed</b> <b>starch.</b> © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

40|$|Starch {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of reserve of carbohydrate in plants and the main source in the human diet due to its abundance in the nature. There no other food ingredient that can be compared with starch in terms of sheer versatility of application in the food industry. <b>Unprocessed</b> native <b>starches</b> are structurally too weak and functionally too restricted for application in today’s advanced food and industrial technologies. The main objective of this study was to compare the thermal behavior of native cassava starch and those treated with hydrogen peroxide, as well as those treated with hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate. The cassava starch was extracted from cassava roots (Manihot esculenta, Crantz) and treated by standardized hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) solutions at 1, 2 and 3 % (with or without FeSO 4). Investigated by using they are thermoanalytical techniques: thermogravimetry - TG, differential thermal analysis – DTA and differential scanning calorimetry - DSC, as well as optical microscopy and X-ray powder diffractometry. The results showed the steps of thermal decomposition, changes in temperatures and in gelatinization enthalpy and small changes in crystallinity of the granules...|$|R
