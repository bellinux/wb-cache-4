5|$|The {{buildup of}} {{vehicles}} and men {{trying to use}} the crossing at Wolfheze caused a bottleneck and made progress slow. Rather than wait, brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose to head <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway line Support and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units to fall back on a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek. The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E
5|$|While {{the north}} and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the {{mountain}} were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, C. E. Rusk searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>The</b> Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was “thrilling to the point of extreme danger.” Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.|$|E

25|$|In 1902, after a fatal crash {{between the}} Delaware and Lackawanna {{railroad}} and a car, the railroad grade was lowered (and {{it is at}} that level today) and the Morris Canal had to make an electric driven incline plane to bring boats <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> railroad and Orange street, and then {{back down into the}} canal, with a pipe to carry the water across the break.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield wiper on the passenger side of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wipers.|$|E
25|$|As designed, the {{armament}} was comprehensive. The {{pilot was}} in control of a 37mm cannon, four fixed Lewis guns fired forward and down, and a machine gun fired forward and upward over the wings. A further two Lewis guns fired to the rear and downwards (through a fuselage tunnel) and a single machine gun <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wings. A gunner's position was in the nose. The armor covered the front half of the fuselage and the engine housings.|$|E

25|$|Exterior {{colors were}} limited to Alpine White, Firecracker Red, Sunshine Yellow, Quick Silver Metallic, or Classic Black. Only the black painted {{versions}} included gold body side stripes that continued <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> roof band, as well as gold paint accents for the standard slot-styled wheels. A carryover 1977 Hornet AMX decal was available for the rear deck and hood, in either gold with orange or black with gold. Polished forged aluminum 5-spoke road wheels were optional.|$|E
25|$|Various {{attempts}} for refloating {{the ship}} were suggested. University of Sydney Honorary Associate Professor Rob Wheen suggested liquefying the sand under the ship by pumping seawater into it. This liquefaction should reduce the friction between {{grains of sand}} and in turn, friction between the ship and sand. Whether {{this would have been}} effective in this case is unknown as Pasha Bulker was lying on rock as well as sand and the ship would have had to be pulled <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rocks.|$|E
25|$|A variant {{known as}} the Bizon-3 was also developed, and {{features}} a flip-up rear peep sight moved further to the rear on the receiver cover and a stock that folds <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> receiver to lock into a spring-loaded latch on the receiver top cover. The weapon's barrel has an adapter for several types of muzzle devices. These are selected by the operator depending on the weapon's tactical employment and include sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, compensators and flash hiders.|$|E
50|$|One more {{practical}} method starts by holding the two ends together, throwing <b>the</b> tips <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to <b>the</b> either {{sides of the}} main parts, bringing the far away end up in between the two main parts, then letting the two ends continue {{to pass through the}} double loop in opposing directions.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler faces a {{standing}} opponent, bends them forwards, takes a hold around their waist and then flips <b>the</b> opponent <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> so <b>the</b> opponent {{is sitting on}} the wrestler's shoulders. The wrestler then faces a corner of the ring and throws the opponent into the corner, driving the back and neck of the opponent to the turnbuckle. The move is commonly used by Seth Rollins.|$|R
50|$|In September 2007 Adjoa Bayor captained the Ghana {{national}} {{team at the}} World Cup in China. Although Ghana did {{not get out of}} the group stage, Bayor scored a remarkable goal from a free kick just outside Norway's penalty area when she faced the wrong way as another player ran <b>up</b> <b>and</b> jumped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ball, then she casually turned and shot.|$|R
25|$|A scoop shot (also {{known as}} a ramp shot, paddle scoop, Marillier shot or Dilscoop) {{has been used by}} a number of {{first-class}} batsmen, the first being Dougie Marillier. It is played to short pitched straight balls that would traditionally be defended or, more aggressively, pulled to the leg side. To play a scoop shot, the batsman is on the front foot and aims to get beneath the bounce of the ball and hit it directly behind the stumps, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wicket-keeper.|$|E
25|$|Noise {{barriers}} {{force the}} pollution plumes {{coming from the}} road to move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> barrier creating the effect of an elevated source and enhancing vertical dispersion of the plume. The deceleration and the deflection of the initial flow by the noise barrier force the plume to disperse horizontally. A highly turbulent shear zone characterized by slow velocities and a re-circulation cavity is created {{in the lee of}} the barrier which further enhances the dispersion; this mixes ambient air with the pollutants downwind behind the barrier.|$|E
25|$|The {{main span}} use a single cable, spun using pre-bundled groups of wires from an anchor {{point at the}} eastern end of the main span, across an eastern corner {{horizontal}} deviation saddle, over a vertical deviation saddle on the eastern end, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> corresponding half of the main tower saddle, down to a 90-degree deviation saddle at the western counterweight, across the counterweight, passing over the hydraulic tensioning saddle, around the opposing western deviation saddle, up to {{the other half of the}} main tower saddle, over an eastern vertical deviation saddle down to the final eastern corner deviation saddle, to the appropriate anchor point in the eastern strand anchor opposite the beginning.|$|E
50|$|Members of the player's team control giant mechs {{known as}} GEARs {{that can be}} leveled <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{upgraded}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of the game. Each GEAR is elementally aligned, which bestows upon them certain special abilities. The game's battles take place on an overhead grid, and are turn-based. Terrain also plays a role, with different types of terrain having different effects.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of mountains influences climate, such as rain or snow. When air masses move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> mountains, <b>the</b> air cools producing orographic precipitation (rain or snow). As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms again (in {{accordance with the}} adiabatic lapse rate) and is drier, having been stripped of much of its moisture. Often, a rain shadow will affect the leeward side of a range.|$|R
50|$|Buena Vista Social Club: Adios {{takes place}} sixteen {{years after the}} 1999 documentary, Buena Vista Social Club. It follows the five {{original}} band members from the first film, as they go on one final tour that ends in their hometown of Havana, Cuba. The musicians recall their <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> downs <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, including award-winning performances and losing many of their fellow band members.|$|R
25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– unless something hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make {{as good a job}} as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings {{were used in the}} outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E
25|$|A major {{offensive}} {{launched by}} the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) on 6 November could not dislodge the Ottoman defenders at Gaza, Hareira and Tel el Khuweilfe. Although Sheria and Tel el Khuweilfe continued to be strongly defended, the heavy EEF bombardment by the XXI Corps against Gaza, resulted in the Ottoman garrison withdrawing from Gaza during the night. During 7 November the attack by the XX Corps, led by the 60th (London) Division {{and supported by the}} 10th (Irish) Division on the left and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division on the right, gained some ground in the morning but was held up by a strong position at Sheria, when the Australian Mounted Division was ordered to attack mounted. The 11th and 12th Light Horse Regiments charged into the face of heavy artillery, machine gun and rifle fire, was forced to stop and dismount as the fire was too fierce. One troop missed the signal and was annihilated, after they charged <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman trenches.|$|E
50|$|After many <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> downs <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{years the}} club {{was taken over by}} a group of {{supporters}} in 2010. The club was withdrawn from the (now defunct) SPHL during the 2009-10 season by the clubs then owner. The club joined the SNL Scottish National League for the 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons and will continue in that league for the 2014-15 season.|$|R

25|$|The cage {{was quickly}} erected {{for the second}} main event and soon after Konnan's La Legión Extranjera came to the ring. Silver King wore his mask as he marched to the ring, {{apparently}} defying a ruling by the Mexican' boxing and wrestling commission. When he reached the cage he took his mask off to reveal that he had his entire head painted to look like his mask, thus avoiding any further legal trouble. El Hijo del Santo was the last wrestler to come out for the match, representing AAA {{for the first time}} in 14 years. La Legión gained the early advantage with their cheating tactics, which included handcuffing La Parka to the cage, both to immobilize him and to ensure that he would not be able to climb out of the cage. After more action Konnan appeared on the Jumbotron, Konnan revealed that he had the key to the handcuffs and that he was not coming near the ring, just to ensure that his team would win. After hearing Konnan's comments special referee Cien Caras went backstage to retrieve the key. Back in the ring Vampiro and Kenzo Suzuki were the first two wrestlers to climb out of the cage, leaving it a four on four match. Moments later Octágon left the cage as well giving Team AAA the advantage. During this time La Hermandad 187 came to ringside to stop anyone from the backstage area from coming to the ring, hired by La Legión to keep the numbers advantage throughout the match. Teddy Hart was the next wrestler to escape, leaving the cage only moments after Cien Caras returned to ringside with the key. La Hermandad tried to stop Caras, but he was able to hand the key to Joaquin Roldan who then freed La Parka. Chessman was the next wrestler to escape, which combined with Konnan coming to ringside meant that La Legión was able to outnumber the wrestlers outside the cage. As La Hermandad and Chessman fought with Octagón and Vampiro Jack Evans climbed up the cage and then leapt off the top with a spectacular somersault splash that knocked everyone down. Inside the ring El Hijo del Santo applied the Camel Clutch on Electroshock, but while Hijo del Santo had the hold locked in Konnan pulled out a fire extinguisher and sprayed white foam in Hijo del Santo's face. Electroshock quickly left the cage, taking advantage of Hijo del Santo being temporarily blinded. La Parka and Silver King fights each other while both try to escape the ring. At one point Konnan tries to climb up and help Silver King escape so his team can win the match but out comes El Zorro, wearing a black mask. Instead of helping out La Legión, Zorro turns on them, handing his kendo stick to Joaquin Roldan, who proceeds to hit Konnan with it. Meanwhile, inside the cage, La Parka takes care of Silver King, helps El Hijo del Santo up and climbs out of the cage. Silver King stops El Hijo del Santo from escaping the cage and the two start to trade punches at the top of the cage wall, ending with Silver King falling down to the mat and Santo climbing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top to win the match for AAA. Following the match El Hijo del Santo hands the urn of Antonio Peña over to Joaquin Roldan and Marisela Peña as the representation of them regaining control of AAA.|$|E
