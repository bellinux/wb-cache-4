5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an <b>underground</b> <b>silo</b> and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A transponder in the missile could respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Soviet UR-100 and the U.S. Titan II missile series, <b>underground</b> <b>silos</b> changed in the 1960s. Both missile series introduced the use of hypergolic propellant, which could be stored in the missiles, allowing for rapid launches. Both countries' liquid fueled missile systems were moved into <b>underground</b> <b>silos.</b> The introduction of solid fuel systems, in the later 1960s, made the silo moving and launching even easier.|$|R

50|$|The missile {{launch control}} {{environment}} also varied by system. Early missiles such as Thor and Atlas, relied on support facilities above ground, with crews protected {{in a shelter}} of some sort. Later systems were buried underground, either with the missiles located nearby (i.e. Titan) or a distance away (Peacekeeper, Minuteman). In the underground environment, crews dealt with artificial lighting, recycled air, loud noises, and intimately close quarters (in Minuteman and Peacekeeper) with equipment racks. The Atlas F was in an <b>underground</b> <b>silo,</b> along with the launch crew quarters, separated by a tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|While the SM-68A Titan I {{system was}} {{becoming}} operational, the USAF recognized {{that it could}} be simplified and improved. Using the same manufacturing and test facilities, the SM-68B took shape as a major step forward in ICBM technology. Perhaps Titan II's most important feature was its quick-launch capability. It could be launched in about 60 seconds from inside its <b>underground</b> <b>silo</b> (Titan I took 15 minutes and had to be elevated above ground first). This speed was crucial in responding to a preemptive nuclear attack before incoming missiles arrived.|$|E

Though the Titan I was operational for only three years, it was an important step in building the Air Force's strategic nuclear forces.|$|R
5000|$|Whether {{explicitly}} nuclear or otherwise, {{the apocalypse}} was never far away the Twilight Zone. [...] "The Midnight Sun" [...] was telecast {{on the day}} the U.S. consolidated its drive for [...] "push-button warfare" [...] with the first successful launching of a Minuteman missile from an <b>underground</b> <b>silo.</b> The episode substitutes a kink in the Earth's orbit—an analogue to what we currently call [...] "the greenhouse effect"—for an atomic holocaust.

5000|$|M sends Bond and Alura to Drake's private {{island in}} the South Pacific, where Drake {{has set up a}} jamming signal. The pair {{infiltrate}} the island and eliminate Drake's defenses. M makes Bond aware of the UN, EU, and NATO forces arriving on the island to dismantle remaining enemy combatants. Bond makes his way to Drake's <b>underground</b> <b>silo,</b> fighting off Kiko before entering one of three space shuttles intending to capture the Space Defense Platform. Kiko is incinerated in the blast pit when Bond's space shuttle launches. Bond reaches the U.S. Space Defense Platform, where Drake is. He successfully sends all eight missiles off course, saving millions of lives, and causes Drake's laser weapon to malfunction, leading to a huge explosion. Finally, Bond kills Drake. As the station goes up in flames, Bond blasts from an escape pod and goes back down to Earth, where M informs him that astronomers from around the globe are reporting [...] "unexpected meteor showers" [...] (which is actually the debris of the now-destroyed Space Defense Platform).|$|E
50|$|The first Atlas flown was the Atlas A in 1957-1958. It {{was a test}} model {{designed}} to verify the structure and propulsion system, and had no sustainer engine or separable stages. The first three Atlas A launches used an early Rocketdyne engine design with conical thrust chambers and only 135,000 pounds of thrust. By the fourth Atlas test, they were replaced by an improved engine design that had bell-shaped thrust chambers and 150,000 pounds of thrust. This {{was followed by the}} Atlas B and C in 1958-1959. The B had full engines and booster engine staging capability. An Atlas B was used to orbit the SCORE satellite in December 1958, which was the Atlas' first space launch. The C was a more refined model with improved, lighter-weight components and a bigger LOX tank and smaller fuel tank. Finally, the Atlas D, the first operational model and the basis for all Atlas space launchers, debuted in 1959. Atlas D weighed 255950 lb (without payload) and had an empty weight of only 11894 lb, the other 95.35% was propellant. Dropping the 6720 lb booster engine and fairing reduced the dry weight to 5174 lb, a mere 2.02% of the initial gross weight of the vehicle (still excluding payload). This very low dry weight allowed Atlas D to send its thermonuclear warhead to ranges as great as 9000 mi or orbit payloads without an upper stage. The final variants of the Atlas ICBM were the E and F, introduced in 1960-61. E and F had fully self-contained inertial navigation systems (INS) and were nearly identical to each other except for interfaces associated with their different basing modes (<b>underground</b> <b>silo</b> for F)and the fuel management system.|$|E
50|$|The Greek {{version of}} the {{abduction}} myth is related to grain - important and rare in the Greek environment - and the return (ascent) of Persephone was celebrated at the autumn sowing. Pluto (Ploutos) represents {{the wealth of the}} grain that was stored in <b>underground</b> <b>silos</b> or ceramic jars (pithoi), during summer months. Similar subterranean pithoi were used in ancient times for burials and Pluto is fused with Hades, the King of the realm of the dead. During summer months, the Greek grain-Maiden (Kore) is lying in the grain of the <b>underground</b> <b>silos,</b> in the realm of Hades and she is fused with Persephone, the Queen of the underworld. At the beginning of the autumn, when the seeds of the old crop are laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter, for at that time the old crop and the new meet each other. For the initiated, this union was the symbol of the eternity of human life that flows from the generations which spring from each other.|$|R

40|$|A {{technical}} improved small HTR (co-generation) on {{the basis}} of AVR in unterground silo type of building is a technic-economic alternative to the nuclear site concepts until now. Under 250 MW thermal power (100 Me) the reactor can be shopfabricated nearly completely at today's technic standard. The four years of erection time for a first facility can be reduced to less than three years for the following projects. But further actions shortening the erection time, as for example simplify the authorisation procedure, use standardized components or short-run production have to be taken. The installation of the reactor in an <b>underground</b> <b>silo</b> makes the application near city or in industry fields possible with regard to the higher expected safety potential.

40|$|Couscous “Lemzeiet” {{was made}} from {{fermented}} wheat using a traditional process specific to the region of Constantine (North East of Algeria). This study involved the valorisation of traditional fermentation techniques of wheat in an <b>underground</b> <b>silo</b> called “Matmor” and manufacture of couscous “Lemzeiet”. The {{first part of this}} study consisted in a survey conducted in the city of Constantine. The 229 participants were from the east of Algeria: Constantine (191), Sigus (22) and Mila (16). The age of the individuals ranged between 20 and 87 years. Thirty-six of them were represented by men, who practice the fermentation of wheat naturally in the “Matmor”. Fifty-eight were represented by women who manufacture the couscous “Lemzeiet” by a process which we have reproduced experimentally in order to assess the technological and nutritional quality of couscous. It involved the use of a mixture of fine semolina (“dkak”) of fermented wheat (70 %) and white couscous (30 %) for forming the grains, a mixture of eggs (50 %) and “smen” (50 %) for the finishing step, and a series of sieves with openings of 410 - 2532 μm, for calibration and sieving the couscous. The experimentally manufactured couscous “Lemzeiet” was composed (%) of three different granulometric sizes fractions (μm) as follows: [1523 - 2532]: 50, 11 %;] 1140 - 1523]: 29, 80 %;] 899 - 1140]: 20, 51 %.
