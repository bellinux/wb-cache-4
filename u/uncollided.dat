Alternatively, the measurements are used to derive a minimization formula based on the macroscopic neutron cross-sections for the <b>uncollided</b> particle radiation at the two neutron beam energies, or the linear attenuation coefficients for the <b>uncollided</b> particle radiation at the two gamma-ray beam energies.

40|$|Reported DSN {{calculations}} of reactivity worths of heterogeneities in ZPR- III fast critical assemblies, caused {{by use of}} various fuel plate and diluent thicknesses, have shown the necessity for high-order approximations to obtain convergence of flux shape and eigenvalue. Convergence properties of solutions for a simplified two-region, oneenergy-group, repetitive slab cell having regional thicknesses and regional cross sections representative of those encountered in some energy -groups of the previous threegroup study are compared for DSN (N = 2, 4, 8, 16), singlespherical harmonics, PN (N = 1, 3, [...] , 11, 13), and double spherical harmonics, DPN (N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), solutions for {{the case of a}} spatially constant unit source density in the alternate regions of the cell. Analogous <b>uncollided</b> flux solutions and an integral transport solution for <b>uncollided</b> flux showing effects of contributions of sources in neighboring cells upon the solution are obtained. As the angular width of the anisotropic flux component occurs predominantly in the region about mu = 0, the "shape" of the spatial flux is largely determined by at most a few nearestneighbor source regions, and the anisotropic component is largely the anisotropic component of the <b>uncollided</b> flux. Use of either a discrete ordinate method in which the quadrature angles and weights are assigned on the basis of an <b>uncollided</b> angular- flux estimate or an integral transport method in which the angular integration is accurately carried out is suggested for more effective convergence. For such quasi-homogeneous cells a simple hand-calculational method is presented in which the spatial flux "shape" is first obtained from an <b>uncollided</b> flux analysis, using an integral transport treatment requiring at most a few nearest neighbor regions and arising from "effective" regional source levels, based upon the constant flux of an equivalent homogeneous cell, which include the elastic scattering sources as well as the "actual" sources. The "level" of the <b>uncollided</b> flux "shape" is sdjusted by a constant flux term to satisfy the neutron inventory requirement of total absorptions equal total "actual" sources. For multigroup solution the energy groups may be analogously treated independently by employing "effective" and "actual" regional source levels for each group based upon homogeneous cell multigroup flux levels.

40|$|In this article, we {{describe}} a mathematical method for solving both conservative and non-conservative {{radiative heat transfer}} problems defined on a multislab domain, which is irradiated from one side with a beam of radiation. We assume here that the incident beam may have a monodirectional (singular) component and a continuously distributed (regular) component in angle. The key to the method is a Chandrasekhar decomposition of the (mathematical) multislab problem into an <b>uncollided</b> transport problem with singular boundary conditions and a diffusive transport problem with regular boundary conditions. Solution to the <b>uncollided</b> problem is straightforward, but solution to the diffusive problem is not so. For then we make use of a recently developed discrete ordinates method to get an angularly continuous approximation to {{the solution of the}} diffusive problem. We suitably compose <b>uncollided</b> and diffuse solutions, and the task of generating an approximate solution to the original multislab radiative transfer problem is complete.

40|$|A {{small set}} of {{independent}} variables generally seems to suffice {{when attempting to}} describe the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to incident solar radiation. This set includes the soil reflectance, the single-scattering albedo, canopy transmittance, reflectance and interception, the portion of <b>uncollided</b> radiation in the total incident radiation, and portions of collided canopy transmittance and interception. All of these are measurable; they satisfy a simple system of equations and constitute a set that fully describes the law of energy conservation in vegetation canopies at any wavelength in the visible and near-infrared part of the solar spectrum. Further, the system of equations specifies {{the relationship between the}} optical properties at the leaf and the canopy scales. Thus, the information content of hyperspectral data can be fully exploited if these variables can be retrieved, for they can be more directly related to some of the physical properties of the canopy (e. g. leaf area index). This paper demonstrates this concept through retrievals of single-scattering albedo, canopy absorptance, portions of <b>uncollided</b> and collided canopy transmittance, and interception from hyperspectral data collected during a field campaign in Ruokolahti, Finland, June 14 [...] 21, 2000.

40|$|Tomography {{refers to}} the {{cross-sectional}} imaging of an object from either transmission or reflection data collected by illuminating the object from many different directions. Classical tomography fails to reconstruct the optical properties of thick scattering objects {{because it does not}} adequately account for the scattering component of the neutron beam intensity exiting the sample. We proposed a new method of computed tomography which employs an inverse problem analysis of both the transmitted and scattered images generated from a beam passing through an optically thick object. This inverse problem makes use of a computationally efficient, two-dimensional forward problem based on neutron transport theory that effectively calculates the detector readings around the edges of an object. The forward problem solution uses a Step-Characteristic (SC) code with known <b>uncollided</b> source per cell, zero boundary flux condition and Sn discretization for the angular dependence. The calculation of the <b>uncollided</b> sources is performed by using an accurate discretization scheme given properties and position of the incoming beam and beam collimator. The detector predictions are obtained considering both the collided and <b>uncollided</b> components of the incoming radiation. The inverse problem is referred as an optimization problem. The function to be minimized, called an objective function, is calculated as the normalized-squared error between predicted and measured data. The predicted data are calculated by assuming a uniform distribution for the optical properties of the object. The objective function depends directly on the optical properties of the object; therefore, by minimizing it, the correct property distribution can be found. The minimization of this multidimensional function is performed with the Polack Ribiere conjugate-gradient technique that makes use of the gradient of the function with respect to the cross sections of the internal cells of the domain. The forward and inverse models have been successfully tested against numerical results obtained with MCNP (Monte Carlo Neutral Particles) showing excellent agreements. The reconstructions of several objects were successful. In the case of a single intrusion, TNTs (Tomography Neutron Transport using Scattering) was always able to detect the intrusion. In the case of the double body object, TNTs was able to reconstruct partially the optical distribution. The most important defect, in terms of gradient, was correctly located and reconstructed. Difficulties were discovered in the location and reconstruction of the second defect. Nevertheless, the results are exceptional considering they were obtained by lightening the object from only one side. The use of multiple beams around the object will significantly improve the capability of TNTs since it increases the number of constraints for the minimization problem...|$|E

The computational model for the TSC is described and the features of TORT and its companion codes that enable such a difficult calculation are discussed.

A method to decompose and calculate the <b>uncollided,</b> once scattered, and multiply scattered radiation components is also presented based on the turbid medium approach. The new model accounts for the some effects exhibited only by homogenous vegetation canopies. This allows the simulation of the scattering processes within the plant canopy {{as a function of}} the traditional canopy architecture parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), leaf reflectance and transmittance, and also the canopy height and leaf size, stem etc [...] . This model integrates two different approaches: the turbid medium approach and an approach that takes into account the finite size of the leaves.

We consider both classical transport theory with exponentially-distributed free paths in arbitrary dimensions {{as well as a}} number of non-classical transport theories (non-exponential random flights) that describe a broader class of transport processes within partially-correlated random media. New rigorous asymptotic diffusion approximations are derived where possible. We also generalize Grosjean's moment-preserving approach of separating the first (or <b>uncollided)</b> distribution from the collided portion and approximating only the latter using diffusion. We find that for any spatial dimension and for many free-path distributions Grosjean's approach produces compact, analytic approximations that are, overall, more accurate for high absorption and for small source-detector separations than either $P_ 1 $ diffusion or rigorous asymptotic diffusion. These diffusion-based approximations are exact in the first two even spatial moments, which we derive explicitly for various non-classical transport types. We also discuss connections between the random-flight-theory derivation of the Green's function and the discrete spectrum of the transport operator and report some new observations regarding the discrete eigenvalues of the transport operator for general dimensions and free-path distributions.

40|$|Abstract. Detecting {{multiple}} pitches (F 0 s) and segregating {{musical instrument}} lines from monaural recordings of contrapuntal polyphonic music into separate tracks {{is a difficult}} problem in music signal processing. Applications include audio-to-MIDI conversion, automatic music transcription, and audio enhancement and transformation. Past attempts at separation have been limited to separating two harmonic signals in a contrapuntal duet (Maher, 1990) or several harmonic signals in a single chord (Virtanen and Klapuri, 2001, 2002). Several researchers have attempted polyphonic pitch detection (Klapuri, 2001; Eggink and Brown, 2004 a), predominant melody extraction (Goto, 2001; Marolt, 2004; Eggink and Brown, 2004 b), and instrument recognition (Eggink and Brown, 2003). Our solution assumes that each instrument is represented as a timevarying harmonic series and that errors can be corrected using prior knowledge of instrument spectra. Fundamental frequencies (F 0 s) for each time frame are estimated from input spectral data using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm with Gaussian distributions used to represent the harmonic series. Collisions (i. e., overlaps) between instrument harmonics, which frequently occur, are predicted from the estimated F 0 s. The <b>uncollided</b> harmonics are matched to ones contained in a pre-stored spectrum library in order that each F 0 `s harmonic series is assigned to the appropriate instrument. Corrupted harmonics are restored using data taken from the library. Finally, each voice is additively resynthesized to a separate track. This algorithm is demonstrated for a monaural signal containing three contrapuntal musical instrument voices with distinct timbres. ...|$|E
40|$|An exact {{solution}} to the monoenergetic Boltzmann equation is obtained for {{the case of a}} plane isotropic burst of neutrons introduced at the interface separating two adjacent, dissimilar, semi-infinite media. The method of solution used is to remove the time dependence by a Laplace transformation, solve the transformed equation by the normal mode expansion method, and then invert to recover the time dependence. The general result is expressed as a sum of definite, multiple integrals, one of which contains the <b>uncollided</b> wave of neutrons originating at the source plane. It is possible to obtain a simplified form for the solution at the interface, and certain numerical calculations are made there. The interface flux in two adjacent moderators is calculated and plotted as a function of time for several moderator materials. For each case it is found that the flux decay curve has an asymptotic slope given accurately by diffusion theory. Furthermore, the interface current is observed to change directions when the scattering and absorption cross sections of the two moderator materials are related in a certain manner. More specifically, the reflection process in two adjacent moderators appears to depend initially on the scattering properties and for long times on the absorption properties of the media. This analysis contains both the single infinite and semi-infinite medium problems as special cases. The results in these two special cases provide a check on the accuracy of the general solution since they agree with solutions of these problems obtained by separate analyses. ...|$|E

In active measurements, an external source of neutrons is used to induce fission in the sample to be analyzed. Typically, a Cf- 252 source inside an ionization chamber is used. Previous studies and measurements showed that the environment, primarily {{the proximity of the}} floor or a wall to the instruments, affects the measured signatures. In this paper, we present an analysis of neutron reflection based on a large number of simulations performed with the MCNP-PoliMi code. The simulations were performed for the time-of-flight configuration. The Monte Carlo program and its post-processor allow us to partition the total signature into the ‘direct ’ and ‘scattered ’ components. The ‘direct ’ component consists of <b>uncollided</b> neutrons and gamma rays traveling from the source to the detector. The ‘scattered’ component is composed of particles that were reflected from the floor. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify and quantify the latter component. The analysis of the data consisted of a search for an empirical fitting curve for the ‘scattered’ component of the signature. The fitting curve depends on a number of parameters that are mainly related to the geometry of the setup.

Measurements were made in C{sub 2 }F{sub 6 } and CHF{sub 3 } discharges in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP-GEC) research reactor operating with power densities, pressures, gas compositions and wafer materials typical of those found in etch processing tools. Wafer substrates investigated included blanket silicon wafers and silicon wafers with varying amounts of photo-resist coverage of the surface (20 %, 80 % and 100 %). In C{sub 2 }F{sub 6 } discharges CF{sub 3 }{sup +} was consistently the dominant fluorocarbon ion present, in agreement with published cross sections for dissociative ionization [1, 2. 3, 4. 5, 6].

The presence of photo-resist, even in small amounts, was found to produce marked changes in the discharge composition. For example in C{sub 2 }F{sub 6 } discharges, concentrations of SiF{sub x} etch products relative to concentrations of C{sub x}F{sub y} species were notably diminished and larger concentrations of water vapor were observed when resist was present. In CHF{sub 3 } discharges, CF{sub 3 }{sup +} and CHF{sub 2 }{sup +} {{were found to be}} the main species present, along with smaller concentrations of CF{sub 2 }{sup +}, CF{sup +}, CHF{sup +}, CH{sup +} and F{sup -}...|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{geographic}} environments (VGEs) {{have been}} regarded as an important new means of simulating, analyzing, and understanding complex geological processes. Plants and light are major components of the geographic environment. Light is a critical factor that affects ecological systems. In this study, we focused on simulating light transmission and distribution within a three-dimensional plant canopy model. A progressive refinement radiosity algorithm was applied to simulate the transmission and distribution of solar light within a detailed, three-dimensional (3 D) loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) canopy model. The canopy was described in three dimensions, and each organ surface was represented {{by a set of}} triangular facets. The form factors in radiosity were calculated using a hemi-cube algorithm. We developed a module for simulating the instantaneous light distribution within a virtual canopy, which was integrated into ParaTree. We simulated the distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) within a loquat canopy, and calculated the total PAR intercepted at the whole canopy scale, as well as the mean PAR interception per unit leaf area. The ParaTree-integrated radiosity model simulates the <b>uncollided</b> propagation of direct solar and diffuse sky light and the light-scattering effect of foliage. The PAR captured by the whole canopy based on the radiosity is approximately 9. 4 % greater than that obtained using ray tracing and TURTLE methods. The latter methods do not account for the scattering among leaves in the canopy in the study, and therefore, the difference might be due to the contribution of light scattering in the foliage. The simulation result is close to Myneni’s findings, in which the light scattering within a canopy is less than 10 % of the incident PAR. Our method can be employed for visualizing and analyzing the spatial distribution of light within a canopy, and for estimating the PAR interception at the organ and canopy levels. It is useful for designing plant canopy architecture (e. g., fruit trees and plants in urban greening) and planting planning...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{recipes for}} {{designing}} lateral slab neutron shielding for electron accelerators {{are available and}} each generally produces rather similar results for shield thicknesses of about 2 m of concrete and for electron beams with energy in the 1 to 10 GeV region. For thinner or much thicker shielding the results tend to diverge and the standard recipes require modification. Likewise for geometries other than lateral to the beam direction further corrections are required so that calculated results are less reliable and hence additional and costly conservatism is needed. With the adoption of Monte Carlo (MC) methods of transporting particles a much more powerful way of calculating radiation dose rates outside shielding becomes available. This method is not constrained by geometry, although deep penetration problems need special statistical treatment, and is an excellent approach to solving any radiation transport problem providing the method has been properly checked against measurements and is free from the well known errors common to such computer methods. This present paper utilizes the results of MC calculations based on a nuclear fragmentation model named DINREG using the MC transport code GEANT and models them with the normal two parameter shielding expressions. Because the parameters can change with electron beam energy, angle to the electron beam direction and target material, the parameters are expressed as functions {{of some of these}} variables to provide a universal equations for shielding electron beams which can used rather simply for deep penetration problems in simple geometry without the time consuming computations needed in the original MC programs. A particular problem with using simple parameterizations based on the <b>uncollided</b> flux is that approximations based on spherical geometry might not apply to the more common cylindrical cases used for accelerator shielding. This source of error has been discussed at length by Stevenson and others. To study this source of error, a run in both spherical and cylindrical geometry were compared...|$|E
40|$|The Nuclear Materials Identification System (NMIS) uses fast {{neutrons}} {{to conduct}} non-intrusive scans of both fissile and non-fissile materials. By time-tagging the source neutrons, the NMIS processor can measure {{the time of}} flight of these neutrons through {{the target of the}} scan and into detectors on the opposite side. With a monoenergetic neutron source, such as a DT generator, these time-of-flight measurements can approximately determine the number of neutrons that travel through the target <b>uncollided.</b> By comparing the results of a scan on an empty container and one made on a container with unknown materials inside, the NMIS processor can subtract the container and determine the configuration of materials inside. Using multiple small detectors, and many horizontal and vertical samples, the NMIS system can produce a picture of the object being scanned, known as a neutron radiograph. With this radiograph, it is thought that other characteristics of the scanned material can be inferred. In this thesis, the material being scanned consists of highly enriched uranium trioxide (UO{sub 3 }) powder. Using the results of the time-of-flight measurements from two reference scans, a container with an unknown configuration was scanned and the mass of the UO{sub 3 } powder inside was estimated. The MCNP-PoliMi computer code was used to simulate these scans. The process was applied to three different unknown geometries of powder, and the scan of each geometry was simulated using three different measurement times, resulting in a total of nine simulated scans. All of the simulated scans produced a mass estimate that is within 3 % of the true mass inside of the container. An analysis of the uncertainty in these measurements determined that the error in the estimates is much larger than the uncertainty in most cases, indicating that the algorithm used to determine the mass produces some systematic error in the results. For powder configurations which are fairly close to those modeled here, this systematic error should be small enough to neglect, but for substantially different models, a correction to the algorithm may be required...|$|E
40|$|Reactor physics {{parameters}} {{were measured}} in eleven two-region subcritical assemblies moderated by heavy water. The {{regions of the}} assemblies consisted of nine different lattices of various fuel rod size, U 235 enrichment, and spacing. The following parameters were measured in the assemblies: bare and cadmium-covered gold foil radial traverses; bare gold foil axial traverses; the ratio of epicadmium to subcadmium capture r tes in U 238 (P 28); and the ratio of fissions in U 238 to fissions in U 233 (628) - From analysis of axial traverses at various radial positions, {{it was determined that}} the axial buckling was independent of radial position in the assemblies. A method was developed to apply the age equation to the experimental gold foil traverses. This analysis yielded the quantity [ [...] . ] for each region of the assemblies. Calculated values of [ [...] . ] were used to obtain values of the infinite multiplication factor from this parameter. For assemblies of sufficiently large inner regions, the values of km so found agreed within experimental uncertainty with independent determinations. The slowing-down spectra. arising from the age theory analysis were used to extrapolate two-region assembly measurements of P 28 to critical assembly values. General agreement was found between these extrapolated values and the results of measurements made in full, single region lattices. The heterogeneous expressions for <b>uncollided</b> flux derived by Pilat were extended to two-region assemblies and used to determine single rod values of 628 from two-region assembly measurements. The theory was also used to predict values of 628 for each of the lattices composing the two-region assemblies. Both the single rod values and the full lattice predictions agreed within experimental error with previously reported results. The determination of material buckling from two-region subcritical assemblies is also discussed. !Because {{of the nature of the}} assemblies investigated, satisfactory measurements of the material buckling could not be made.
