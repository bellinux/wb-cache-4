The arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov in 2001, for alleged infringement of the DMCA, was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures. While working for ElcomSoft in Russia, he developed The Advanced eBook Processor, a software application allowing users to strip <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> information from restricted e-books, an activity legal in both Russia and the United States. Paradoxically, under the DMCA, it is not legal in the United States to provide such a tool. Sklyarov was arrested in the United States after presenting a speech at DEF CON and subsequently spent nearly a month in jail. The DMCA has also been cited as chilling to legitimate users, such as students of cryptanalysis (including, in a well-known instance, Professor Edward Felten and students at Princeton), and security consultants such as Niels Ferguson, who has declined to publish information about vulnerabilities he discovered in an Intel secure-computing scheme because of his concern about being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the U.S.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of mobile}} phone has become {{widespread}} among Nigerians; both old and young. Indiscriminate use of mobile phone has become popular {{in public and}} private places. In public places, it is becoming difficult to achieve total restriction in mobile phone usage because of varying attitudinal tendencies within the society. There is need to evaluate the compliance of the individual phone user to non-compliance with various phone <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> laws in public buildings so as to determine the proactive method that can be employed in forestalling future occurrences. In this paper, the degree of compliance of people to mobile phone <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> laws in public places is evaluated. Information was gathered through questionnaire administration and visitation to selected public places such as, examination halls, banking halls, and detention centers (police cells and prison halls) in Akure. The questionnaires were presented {{in such a way that}} it will provide response to the issue of the degree of phone <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> compliance, attitudinal responses of public places managers to violators, and the perception of unauthorized phone users to restriction regulation. The data obtained were analyzed statistically using descriptive statistics based on percentages. The validation of the results were carried out using paired- t test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the degrees of phone <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> in the specific public places used in this study.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel way of usage management using a infrastructure that enables accountability on the Web at the protocol level. The protocol, HTTPA (Accountable Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), requires the data producer {{and the data}} consumer {{to come to an}} agreement before the data transfer, enabling both parities will be held accountable for the agreement they had entered into. The data consumer will express the intentions of data access and usage, whereas the data producer will express the <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the data. This data transfer is facilitated by a trusted third party “Provenance Controller ” in an “intentions and <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> handshake”. The sender/data producer will evaluate to what extent the <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> match the data consumer’s intentions. If they match, the data consumer is granted access to the data; else she is notified of the mismatched components. This protocol cannot prevent the unauthorized reuse of data, but rather {{it can be used to}} develop accountability mechanisms that will identify violators allowing them to be held them accountable for data they inappropriately consumed and served. ...|$|R

40|$|Side-channel {{attacks and}} in {{particular}} differential power analysis (DPA) attacks pose {{a serious threat to}} cryptographic implementations. One approach to counteract such attacks are cryptographic schemes based on fresh re-keying. In settings of pre-shared secret keys, such schemes render DPA attacks infeasible by deriving session keys and by ensuring that the attacker cannot collect side-channel leakage on the session key during cryptographic operations with different inputs. While these schemes can be applied to secure standard communication settings, current re-keying approaches are unable to provide protection in settings where the same input needs to be processed multiple times. In this work, we therefore adapt the re-keying approach and present a symmetric authenticated encryption scheme that is secure against DPA attacks and that does not have such a <b>usage</b> <b>restriction.</b> This means that our scheme fully complies with the requirements given in the CAESAR call and hence, can be used like other noncebased authenticated encryption schemes without loss of side-channel protection. Its resistance against side-channel analysis is highly relevant for several applications in practice, like bulk storage settings in general and the protection of FPGA bitfiles and firmware images in particular...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the first}} {{practical}} implementations of flexible radio spectrum property rights was initiated in Europe in 2005 under the name ‘Wireless Access Policy for Electronic Communication Services (WAPECS) ’. WAPECS aimed to introduce more flexibility into the European spectrum management framework by allowing technology and service neutrality. Internationally, the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) have been keen to introduce more flexibility into the international service allocation framework. One of the main findings {{of this paper is}} the identification of different negative perceptions and disagreement about WAPECS among industry and regulatory stakeholders. Moreover, it is shown that concerns over WAPECS include that the flexibility associated with it may contradict with spectrum use efficiency and that the responsibility of resolving interference issues moves from the regulator to operators. The assessment of the influence of WAPECS on the market shows that while the concept was aimed mainly towards removing the spectrum <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> for industry, they have not appreciated this mainly due to the high cost and uncertainty associated with flexibility. On the other hand, several positive impacts of WAPECS are revealed including removing technology designation from CEPT decisions. The paper shows also that the international Radio Regulations (RR) can, to a certain extent, accommodate WAPECS...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{ubiquity of}} data on the web, {{and the lack of}} <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> {{enforcement}} mechanisms, stories of personal, creative and other kinds of data misuses are on the rise. There should be both sociological and technological mechanisms that facilitate accountability on the web that would prevent such data misuses from occurring. Sociological mechanisms use coercion to appeal to the data consumer’s self-interest in adhering to the data provider’s desires. This involves a system of rewards such as recognition and financial incentives, and deterrents such as prohibitions by laws for any violations and social pressure. However, there is no well-defined technological mechanism for the discovery of accountability or the lack of it on the web. As part of my PhD thesis I propose to find a solution to this problem by designing a web protocol called HTTPA (Accountable HTTP). This protocol will enable data consumers and data producers to agree to specific usage restrictions, preserve the provenance of data transferred from a web server to a client and back to another web server and so on, and more importantly provide a mechanism to derive an ‘audit trail ’ for the data reuse {{with the help of a}} trusted intermediary called a ‘Provenance Tracker Network’. This paper describes the problem, state of the art, a novel approach, the work in progress and the future work on realizing a sound and a timely solution to the problem of data misuse on the web...|$|E

40|$|Persistent HCV {{infection}} may {{be associated}} with extrahepatic manifestations such as type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (II-MC), a clonal B cell proliferative disorder. In persistent HCV infection without II-MC, an increase in serum immunoglobulins (Ig) is commonly observed. This increase is polyclonal and is determined primarily by increased levels of IgG which include both HCV-specific and nonspecific antibodies. Nonetheless, memory CD 27 (+) B cells do not accumulate. This paradoxical phenomenon depends on heightened sensitivity of memory B cells to BCR-independent noncognate T cell help, which speeds up their terminal differentiation into antibody-secreting cells and makes them more prone to apoptosis. In persistent HCV infection with II-MC, serum Ig elevation is also a general occurrence, and characteristically includes IgM antibodies with rheumatoid factor activity, which are essential for the development of circulating, cryoprecipitable immune complexes. Hypergammaglobulinemia is sustained by a peripheral expansion of IgM(+) k(+) IgD(low/neg) CD 21 (low) CD 27 (+) B cells. These cells exhibit marked V(H), J(H), and V(K) gene segment <b>usage</b> <b>restriction,</b> indicating that a limited number of antigens drive their proliferation through BCR interaction. Recently, two epitopes, one of the human IgG and the second of the HCV(NS 3) protein, had been identified and demonstrated able to link the BCR exposed on II-MC subjects. Based on the above findings, we propose a model whereby BCR binding the IgM/IgG/HCV(NS 3) immune complexes deprives Fc gammaIIR of its natural ligand. This takes the brake off RF(+) CD 27 (+) B cell proliferation and promotes their selective accumulation, which is otherwise prevented by increased apoptosis susceptibility in persistent HCV infection without II-MC...|$|E
