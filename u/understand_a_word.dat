5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
500|$|Though 1965's Von Ryan's Express {{was a major}} success, and he had {{directed}} None but the Brave that year, in the mid 1960s, Brad Dexter wanted to [...] "breathe new life" [...] in Sinatra's film career by helping him display the same professional pride in his films as he did his recordings. On one occasion, he gave Sinatra Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange (1962) to read, {{with the idea of}} making a film, but Sinatra thought it had no potential and did not <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
500|$|McGinty, {{one of the}} two {{winners of}} The Glee Project top prize of a seven-episode {{recurring}} character role on Glee, makes his first appearance in this episode as Rory Flanagan, an Irish exchange student. Murphy revealed that on McGinty's first day of filming [...] "he was shoved into a locker 25 times", and that on [...] "his first take in his first song, the crew gave him a huge ovation." [...] Rory is living with Brittany's family, and the idea of McGinty's character interacting with Brittany was first broached in the penultimate episode of The Glee Project, with the judges speculating that Brittany {{would not be able to}} <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> the character said due to his Irish accent.|$|E

500|$|Thom Jurek, a {{staff writer}} for AllMusic, gave the album a rating of three out of five stars. Jurek gave notice to the album's sound quality, telling readers that it does not [...] "capture the sheer overblown {{intensity}} of the unit in a concert setting," [...] but that it comes closer than one may imagine. Jurek also gave note to how Rick Rubin made the two-discs sound like it were recorded at one gig, writing [...] "Producer Rick Rubin stays out of the way; his production seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to make it sound like this is all one gig." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne said that it was an [...] "accurate aural snapshots of what it's like {{to be part of a}} crowd craning to see the action on a stage that seems two miles away." [...] Browne also said that [...] "they're perfect examples of the sad current state of the once-proud live rock album." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a star ("Honorable Mention is a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like."), saying, [...] "praise the Lord--I can hardly <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> they're singing (Hell Awaits)." [...] Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer said that it was regarded as one of the best live albums released by a heavy metal band.|$|E
2500|$|In Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} other shifts that can make their Pennsylvania German particularly difficult for modern High German speakers to <b>understand.</b> <b>A</b> <b>word</b> beginning in [...] generally becomes [...] (which is more easily pronounced), so that German [...] > [...] > [...] and German [...] > [...] > [...] [...] Likewise, German [...] > [...] > [...] (as if it were English *chite). [...] German [...] > [...] > [...] (exactly as in American English trick but with an extra [...] ). [...] This shift is rather common with German children learning to speak.|$|E
2500|$|Another form of {{discrimination}} towards British Indians is stereotyping, {{one example is}} British Asians stereotyped as being the majority of newsagent and convenience store shopkeepers, the stereotype [...] "Paki shop"; and also making up a majority of doctors. This stereotype was made fun of in the television and radio sketches of Goodness Gracious Me by four British Indian comedy actors. In the comedy sketch Little Britain, a British Indian character called Meera continuously receives racist comments from weight loss advisor Marjorie Dawes who always makes it known {{that she does not}} <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of what Meera says, although it is completely obvious to the surrounding people and the viewer.|$|E

60|$|This, as Michael, {{encouraged}} by the unmistakable geniality and kindness in the voice, wriggled his whole body and thumped double knocks of delight with his tail. Not that he <b>understood</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of it, but that he did understand the something behind the speech that informed the string of sounds with all the mysterious likeableness that white gods possessed.|$|R
2500|$|In 1905, Yellow Robe married Lillian (Lillie) Belle Springer, of Swiss-German ancestry, from Tacoma, Washington. [...] Lillie was a {{volunteer}} nurse at the Rapid City Indian School. Chauncey and Lillian had three daughters, Rosebud, Chauncina and Evelyn. Chauncey chose {{to send his}} daughters to the Rapid City public schools instead of the Indian School because the public schools had academic orientation, while the Indian School focused on vocational courses in agriculture, blacksmithing and domestic arts. On occasion, elderly Indians would visit {{the grounds of the}} Indian School and tell stories in the Lakota language. Chauncey would have Rosebud listen, even though she could not <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> and later he would retell the stories in English. His children used and enjoyed the Indian School's library and programs.|$|E
2500|$|Her parent's {{marriage}} was {{an inspiration for}} Rosebud's ability to cross cultural bridges. Chauncey taught her and her sisters Chauncina and Evelyn in Lakota tradition. On occasion, elderly Indians would visit {{the grounds of the}} Indian School and tell stories in the Lakota language. Chauncey would have Rosebud listen, even though she could not <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> and later he would retell the stories in English.

2500|$|In 1980, Searle {{presented}} the [...] "Chinese room" [...] argument, which purports {{to prove the}} falsity of strong AI. Assume you do not speak Chinese and imagine yourself {{in a room with}} two slits, a book, and some scratch paper. Someone slides you some Chinese characters through the first slit, you follow the instructions in the book, transcribing characters as instructed onto the scratch paper, and slide the resulting sheet out the second slit. To people on the outside world, it appears the room speaks Chinese—they slide Chinese statements in one slit and get valid responses in return—yet you do not <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of Chinese. This suggests, according to Searle, that no computer can ever understand Chinese or English, because, as the thought experiment suggests, being able to 'translate' Chinese into English does not entail 'understanding' either Chinese or English: all which the person in the thought experiment, and hence a computer, is able to do is to execute certain syntactic manipulations.|$|E

6000|$|During this {{dialogue}} the Indians looked from one speaker to another with keen interest, although none but their chief <b>understood</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> {{of what was}} said; and Stalker took advantage of their attention being turned for the moment from himself to carry out what Tolly had styled his [...] "little game," [...] all unaware that the boy was watching him like a lynx.|$|R
6000|$|... "My conscience!" [...] exclaimed the captain, [...] "you haven't <b>understood</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of my story!" [...] He then {{proceeded}} to explain a toll-gate and its office and emoluments; but it was at once evident that the Frenchman knew all about the thing--he {{did not know the}} English words which expressed it; and he had a clear comprehension of the narrative.|$|R

60|$|We need {{scarcely}} {{add that}} she received no reply to her questions, for the natives did not <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of her language, and {{with the exception of}} the names of one or two familiar objects, she did not <b>understand</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of theirs. Of how far or how long they travelled Edith could form no idea, as she slept profoundly during the journey, and did not thoroughly recover her strength and faculties until after her arrival at the camp.|$|E
6000|$|Our spirits {{rose and}} the landlord's fell--at least we thought so; he was confused, at any rate, {{notwithstanding}} {{he had not}} <b>understood</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> that had been said.

5000|$|Sturges was {{nominated}} for a 1945 Academy Award for his screenplay. Many critics consider the film to be one of Sturges' best. [...] It was the eighth film he made for Paramount Pictures, and also his last, although The Great Moment was released after it. Sturges later wrote about his departure [...] "I guess Paramount was glad to be rid of me eventually, as no one there ever <b>understood</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> I said." ...|$|R

60|$|Now it so {{happened}} that this wise and pious Brahmanic peer had four sons, whom {{he brought up}} in the strictest and most serious way. They were taught to repeat their prayers long before they <b>understood</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of them, and when they reached the age of four[FN#121] they had read a variety of hymns and spiritual songs. Then they were set to learn by heart precepts that inculcate sacred duties, and arguments relating to theology, abstract and concrete.|$|R
