5|$|Depopulation {{stemming}} from the Black Death led to increased wages, static food costs and a resulting improvement in {{the standard of living}} for the peasantry. However, under Henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed the English economy to a pitiful state known as the Great Slump. The economy was in ruins by 1450, a consequence of the loss of France, piracy in the channel and poor trading relations with the Hanseatic League. The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s. It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, which drove <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> food and damaged the wider economy. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 per cent in just four years {{at the end of the}} 1440s, collapsing by up to 90 per cent in some parts of the South-West. The Crown's debts reached £372,000, Henry's deficit was £20,000 per annum, and tax revenues were half those of his father.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the output}} of copper {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, driving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> copper money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao of a chance to melt down the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E

50|$|Of course, an armada {{could not}} just sail into an Indian city {{and expect to}} find enough {{supplies}} at hand in the city's spice markets to load up five or ten large ships at once.

50|$|Moral hazard: Investors usually rely on {{the deal}} manager to <b>price</b> <b>the</b> securitizations’ {{underlying}} assets. If the manager earns fees based on performance, {{there may be a}} temptation to mark <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> portfolio assets. Conflicts of interest can also arise with senior note holders when the manager has a claim on the deal's excess spread.|$|R
25|$|Others {{dispute the}} {{importance}} of consumption over income, pointing out that if middle and lower income are consuming more than they earn {{it is because they}} are saving less or going deeper into debt. Income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Gleizes {{had always}} detested {{the art market}} falsified by a {{speculation}} on works of art imposed by the fantasy of fictitious bids to push up the prices in the public sales. When Léonce Rosenberg, whom Gleizes found the most sympathetic of the art dealers, offered to push <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> his pre-war painting La Chasse, which was coming up for auction. Gleizes replied that he preferred to buy it himself and therefore wanted the price to be as low as possible.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, the filmed {{version of}} the novel altered {{the details of the}} plan. Although the {{audience}} is initially led to believe Goldfinger is going to steal the gold, the real plot is revealed to be to render the gold contained in the Depository radioactive and useless, crippling the gold standard-based economy and thereby dramatically driving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the gold Goldfinger already owns. A scene in the film even uses a confrontation between Goldfinger and Bond to point out logistical flaws in the plan as set out in the original novel.|$|E

50|$|A {{flood of}} funds (capital or liquidity) reached the US {{financial}} markets.

25|$|The Dublin community's discontent was deepened by {{the events}} of the Nine Years War of the 1590s, when English {{soldiers}} were required by decree to be housed by the townsmen of Dublin and they spread disease and forced <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> food. The wounded lay in stalls in the streets, {{in the absence of a}} proper hospital. To compound disaffection in the city, in 1597, the English Army's gunpowder store in Winetavern Street exploded accidentally, killing nearly 200 Dubliners. It should be noted, however, that the Pale community, however dissatisfied they were with English government, remained hostile to the Gaelic Irish led by Hugh O'Neill.|$|E
25|$|In 1594, the Compagnie van Verre ("Company of Far Lands") {{was founded}} in Amsterdam, {{with the aim of}} sending two fleets to the spice islands of Maluku. The first fleet sailed in 1596 and {{returned}} in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage. The second voyage (1598–1599), returned its investors a 400% profit. The success of these voyages led to the founding of a number of companies competing for the trade. The competition was counterproductive to the companies' interests as it threatened to drive <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> spices at their source in Indonesia whilst driving them down in Europe.|$|E
25|$|No {{national}} environmental group has ever bid {{in the annual}} EPA Auction, but {{a small number of}} local groups have participated for many years, apparently on the theory that reducing the supply of allowances may someday drive <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> acquiring them. For example, one of the oldest of these groups is the Acid Rain Retirement Fund (A.R.R.F.), a non-profit, all-volunteer, community educational group. A.R.R.F. has raised money and bid alongside polluters since 1995 for as many allowances as their funds can buy. But instead of using or trading them, A.R.R.F. retires them permanently, taking allowances off the market and keeping sulfur dioxide out of the air.|$|E

25|$|Brazil. Eucalyptus was {{introduced}} to Brazil in 1910, for timber substitution and the charcoal industry. It has thrived in the local environment, and today there are around 7 million hectares planted. The wood is highly valued by the charcoal and pulp and paper industries. The short rotation allows a larger wood production and supplies wood for several other activities, helping to preserve the native forests from logging. When well managed, the plantation soils can sustain endless replanting. Eucalyptus plantings are also used as wind breaks. Brazil's plantations have world-record rates of growth, typically over 40 cubic metres per hectare per year, and commercial harvesting occurs after years 5. Due to continual development and governmental funding, year-on-year growth is consistently being improved. Eucalyptus can produce up to 100 cubic metres per hectare per year. Brazil has become the top exporter and producer of Eucalyptus round wood and pulp, and has {{played an important role}} in developing the Australian market through the country's committed research in this area. The local iron producers in Brazil rely heavily on sustainably grown Eucalyptus for charcoal; this has greatly pushed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> charcoal in recent years. The plantations are generally owned and operated for national and international industry by timber asset companies such as Thomson Forestry, Greenwood Management or cellulose producers such as Aracruz Cellulose and Stora Enso.|$|E
500|$|Terrace did {{not have}} enough assets to finance the team, but Firestone {{believed}} that they could do so as part of a development project.

[...] In 1989, Terrace found a suitable site west of Ottawa, [...] of farmland, located {{on both sides of the}} 417 Highway west of Terry Fox Drive in the then City of Kanata.|$|E
500|$|Foster's sock {{campaign}} {{stimulated the}} supply of the much needed item, but may have also met {{with a certain amount}} of suspicion and backlash. Rumors of profiteering by the Quartermaster's office had circulated earlier, when Foster's purchases and impressments of textiles and shoes had driven <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> goods. Foster claimed that new rumors, which he denied as a [...] "malicious falsehood!", had spread that he and his department were profiteering from the socks. It was alleged that contributed socks were being sold, rather than given freely to the troops. The charge would not have been without precedent. The historian Jeanie Attie notes that in 1861, an [...] "especially damaging rumor" [...] (later found to be true) had circulated in the North, alleging that the Union Army had purchased 5000 pairs of socks which had been donated, and intended for the troops, from a private relief agency, the United States Sanitary Commission. As the Sanitary Commission had done in the North, Foster undertook a propaganda campaign in Georgia newspapers to combat the alleged rumors and to encourage the continued contribution of socks. He offered $1,000.00 to any [...] "citizen or soldier who will come forward and prove that he ever bought a sock from this Department that was either knit by the ladies or purchased for issue to said troops." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} increasing electricity tariff to the long run marginal cost on <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> other products using a static input-output approach.

2500|$|In this work, {{his first}} {{published}} pamphlet, Malthus argues against the notion prevailing in his locale that the greed of intermediaries caused {{the high price}} of provisions.

[...] Thus, given a limited supply, the Poor Laws force <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> daily necessities. But he concludes by saying that in time of scarcity such Poor Laws, by raising the price of corn more evenly, actually produce a beneficial effect.|$|E

2500|$|This is the practice, {{especially}} by high-end art auctioneers, of raising false bids at crucial {{times in the}} bidding {{in order to create}} the appearance of greater demand or to extend bidding momentum for a work on offer. To call out these nonexistent bids auctioneers might fix their gaze at a point in the auction room that is difficult for the audience to pin down. The practice is frowned upon in the industry.
