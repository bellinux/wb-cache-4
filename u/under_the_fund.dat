5000|$|There were 3 major {{criticisms of}} the Fund: its teaching, effectiveness, and integrity. Many {{believed}} the Fund was inefficient. Some argued that they inadequately taught doctors and employed subpar medical practitioners. [...] By October 1908, only 43 completely qualified women medical professionals were working <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> however only 11 held university degrees. The British Medical Journal wrote in 1908 that, “The Government {{appears to have a}} perfect delight in swamping the country with unqualified medical practitioners." [...] The Fund was also criticized as ineffective for placing male doctors in Zenana hospitals. Zenana women’s traditions forbade them from seeing, so they could be treated by the doctors the Fund provided. In addition, the Fund was also criticized for not giving the women they were educating enough reason to stay with learning medicine. The Fund paid for their education however their salaries were not high enough so it made more financial sense for the women to marry before they could give back to the hospital that educated them. The Fund set up this cycle of educating women who would then work for them, however it was ineffective in some cases because the women would not stick with the medical profession for financial reasons. Because of the many criticisms of ineffectiveness, some of the Fund’s highest critics like The British Medical Journal called for a reorganization of the Fund. Some also believed vanity, not philanthropy, was the source of motivation for establishing the Fund. [...] They criticized both Lady Dufferin for starting the Fund for her personal image and Queen Victoria for supporting the Fund for Britain’s international image.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents three {{research articles}} {{in the area of}} preparing preservice teachers for Virtual Schooling (VS). The context of the dissertation is embedded in a Teacher Education Goes Into Virtual Schooling (TEGIVS) project <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), U. S. Department of Education. The first article presented TEGIVS curricula and its preliminary evaluation, the second article discussed the study on preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 perspectives and preconceptions about VS, and the third article described the development, validation, and implementation of a rubric to assess the preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 competence as VS facilitators. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from preservice teachers and three practitioners in the area of VS. The main findings of the articles indicate that preservice teachers are ready to learn about VS, but hold preconceptions about VS. The most commonly stated preconception was technology is becomes teacher 2 ̆ 7 s surrogate in VS. The TEGIVS curriculum was found helpful in preparing preservice teachers see the complexity of teaching and learning online. Lastly, the competence assessment instrument developed and implemented to assess preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 competence to facilitate in VS was found to be reliable and valid. Thus, this dissertation provides evidence for the need to integrate VS into teacher education, and further suggests that teacher education should identify and correct preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 preconceptions about VS. The competence assessment instrument that included a scenario and rubric was developed as part of this dissertation and has not been implemented outside the TEGIVS project. Teacher education programs can also use this very first competence assessment instrument to assess VS facilitator competence of preservice teachers in the three aspects of technology, mentoring, and collaboration...|$|E
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony is on the financial condition of the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (Fund). FHA has helped millions of families purchase homes through its single-family mortgage insurance programs and in recent years, has experienced {{a dramatic increase in}} its market role. FHA insures almost all of its single-family mortgages <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund,</b> which is reviewed from both an actuarial and budgetary perspective each year. On the basis of an independent actuarial review, FHA reported in November 2009 that the Fund was not meeting the statutory 2 percent capital reserve requirement as of the end of fiscal year 2009, as measured by the Fund's estimated capital ratio [...] that is, the Fund's economic value divided by the insurance-in-force. Additionally, although the Fund historically has produced budgetary receipts for the federal government, a weakening in the performance of FHA-insured loans has heightened the possibility that FHA will require additional funds to help cover its costs on insurance issued to date. This statement today is based on a report released yesterday, titled Mortgage Financing: Opportunities to Enhance Management and Oversight of FHA's Financial Condition. This statement discusses (1) how estimates of the Fund's capital ratio have changed in recent years and the budgetary implications of changes in the Fund's financial condition; (2) how FHA and its actuarial review contractor evaluate the financial condition of the Fund; (3) the steps FHA has taken to improve the financial condition of the Fund and how the agency has interpreted statutory requirements pertaining to the management of and reporting on the Fund's condition; and (4) changes in the performance and characteristics of FHA-insured mortgages in recent years. ...|$|E

40|$|Scope of this Work The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{undertake}} a comprehensive investigation of the impact, and current use, of the Phase 4 projects commissioned <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> for the Development of Teaching and Learning (hereafter FDTL 4) on {{the teaching and learning}} of Mathematics and Statistics across the HE community. The methodology used within this investigation focuses upon the potential for long-term impact {{and the use of the}} outputs from each project to lead to a change in practice at the departmental level. Consideration is also given to their direct impact upon the student learning experience. This investigation focussed upon the following four research questions: 1. To what extent have the outcomes from the FDTL 4 projects influenced practice within their host departments? 2. To what extent has practice been influenced within partner institutions? 3. How have the outcomes from the FDTL 4 projects influenced the Maths, Stats & OR Community as a whole? 4. How have the outcomes from the FDTL 4 projects impacted directly upon the student learning experience within the Maths, Stats & OR Community? It should be noted that this work is not an evaluation of each project (indeed such work has already been undertaken by the individual project teams themselves), but an evaluation of the impact of the FDTL 4 funding stream made available in October 2002. As such, although past tense may be used when referring to the individual projects, this is simply to recognise that the initial funding made available to each project finished in September 2005.

40|$|The Climate Institute {{requested}} SKM MMA and Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) {{to undertake}} {{an assessment of}} alternative policy options to achieve a given carbon emission target in Australia. The focus {{of the study was}} to compare outcomes under a suite of subsidy based policies to the outcomes under an emission trading scheme. The outcomes of the study are presented in this report. There are several market based approaches that could be used to achieve a carbon emission target. Which approach is more or less effective in achieving the target will depend on any restriction placed on the measure, the ability of each approach to manage the uncertainties on the cost and future scale of abating carbon emissions, the long term behavioural signals provided and the relative impacts on the broader economy. In principle, a subsidy scheme, such as the proposed Emission Reduction Fund (ERF), could achieve the same level of abatement at a similar cost to an emission trading scheme provided the sectoral coverage was the same and the eligible abatement options were the same. Any difference in effectiveness and cost may be due to other factors such as a limit on the budget available to be spent through the subsidy scheme and differences in sectoral coverage. Whether projects receiving funding under the subsidy scheme will proceed or go under either before they are built or after a few years of operation, as has happened under other subsidy scheme, is also important to the effectiveness of the scheme. SKM MMA used a marginal abatement cost approach to assess the options chosen under the subsidy fund. The approach was used to assess a range of emissions abatement opportunities in a range of sectors covering energy, transport, agriculture and land use change, industrial processes, fugitive emissions, and waste. The approach involved the assessment of the cost and potential emission abatement of the eligible options. The assumption was that the lowest cost combination of options is selected <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> to meet the abatement cap up to any budget or other declared constraints. Only options that are additional (i. e. would not have proceeded in absence of the fund or carbon abatement incentive) were considered. The estimated level of abatement by options and their cost are input into CoPS’s Monash Multi Regional Forecasting Model (MMRF) to determine broader economic impacts. This report outlines the assumptions and method used and discusses the result of the modelling. Limitations and uncertainties in the approach are also outlined. The focus of the analysis was on potential impacts – there is no discussion on which approach is more efficient...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{formative}} {{evaluation of the}} Hewlett Foundation's Early Learning Innovation Fund that began in 2011 {{as part of the}} Quality Education in Developing Countries (QEDC) initiative.   The Fund has four overarching objectives, which are to: promote promising approaches to improve children's learning; strengthen the capacity of organizations implementing those approaches; strengthen those organizations' networks and ownership; and grow 20 percent of implementing organizations into significant players in the education sector. The Fund's original design was to create a "pipeline" of innovative approaches to improve learning outcomes, with the assumption that donors and partners would adopt the most successful ones. A defining feature of the Fund was that it delivered assistance through two intermediary support organizations (ISOs), rather than providing funds directly to implementing organizations. Through an open solicitation process, the Hewlett Foundation selected Firelight Foundation and TrustAfrica to manage the Fund. Firelight Foundation, based in California, was founded in 1999 with a mission to channel resources to community-based organizations (CBOs) working {{to improve the lives of}} vulnerable children and families in Africa. It supports 12 implementing organizations in Tanzania for the Fund. TrustAfrica, based in Dakar, Senegal, is a convener that seeks to strengthen African-led initiatives addressing some of the continent's most difficult challenges. The Fund was its first experience working specifically with early learning and childhood development organizations. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund,</b> it supported 16 such organizations: one in Mali and five each in Senegal, Uganda and Kenya. At the end of 2014, the Hewlett Foundation commissioned Management Systems International (MSI) to conduct a mid-term evaluation assessing the implementation of the Fund exploring the extent to which it achieved intended outcomes and any factors that had limited or enabled its achievements. It analyzed the support that the ISOs provided to their implementing organizations, with specific focus on monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The evaluation included an audit of the implementing organizations' M&E systems and a review of the feasibility of compiling data collected to support an impact evaluation. Finally, the Foundation and the ISOs hoped that this evaluation would reveal the most promising innovations and inform planning for Phase II of the Fund. The evaluation findings sought to inform the Hewlett Foundation and other donors interested in supporting intermediary grant-makers, early learning innovations and the expansion of innovations. TrustAfrica and Firelight Foundation provided input to the evaluation's scope of work. Mid-term evaluation reports for each ISO provided findings about their management of the Fund's Phase I and recommendations for Phase II. This final evaluation report will inform donors, ISOs and other implementing organizations about the best approaches to support promising early learning innovations and their expansion. The full report outlines findings common across both ISOs' experience and includes recommendations in four key areas: adequate time; appropriate capacity building; advocacy and scaling up; and evaluating and documenting innovations. Overall, both Firelight Foundation and TrustAfrica supported a number of effective innovations working through committed and largely competent implementing organizations. The program's open-ended nature avoided being prescriptive in its approach, but based on the lessons learned in this evaluation and the broader literature, the Hewlett Foundation and other donors could have offered more guidance to ISOs to avoid the need to continually relearn some lessons. For example, over the evaluation period, it became increasingly evident that the current context demands more focused advance planning to measure impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders and a more concrete approach to promoting and resourcing potential scale-up. The main findings from the evaluation and recommendations are summarized here...|$|E
