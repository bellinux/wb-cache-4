25|$|During Cricket Quarter, {{the school}} uniform can vary {{slightly}} {{from that of}} the two preceding terms. Boys may wear cravats in house colours instead of ties and are permitted to wear straw Boaters similar to the 'Harrow Hat' found at Harrow School, but these are almost never worn by the majority of pupils. Boys in the Under School may also wear navy blazers similar to those worn by the Specialists. As well as these variations, boys may roll <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> in hashes unless asked not to by a beak.|$|E
25|$|Once he is alone, Rudolph {{reads the}} letter and learns about the plot to blow him up. Ludwig arrives, intent on denouncing the plot to him. Before he can do so, Rudolph {{declares}} that he would give anything to avoid being blown up the next day, and Ludwig sees a way out. He feigns patriotism and suggests that the two engage in a statutory duel. He explains that they will hide cards <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> guaranteeing victory to Ludwig. When the plot unfolds, Ludwig will {{bear the brunt of}} it. The next day, when the Act authorizing statutory duels expires, Rudolph can come back to life unharmed. Although Rudolph is sceptical, he accepts Ludwig's proposal.|$|E
500|$|After the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor, the U.S. {{government}} called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods. The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management {{and labor unions}} throughout the 1930s. Directors of companies such as General Motors (GM) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork. In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the United Auto Workers union, GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production. The poster read, [...] "Together We Can Do It!" [...] and [...] "Keep 'Em Firing!" [...] In creating such posters, corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro-war sentiment, with {{the ultimate goal of}} preventing the government from exerting greater control over production.|$|E

50|$|Because 1. FC Köln {{had several}} further young strikers <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve,</b> {{it was decided}} that Uth could leave the club. On 10 May 2012, it was {{announced}} that he had signed for SC Heerenveen on a three-year contract.|$|R
2500|$|Sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote, [...] "Cumberland's {{greatest}} individual play of {{the game}} occurred when fullback Allen circled right end for a 6yard loss." [...] At halftime, Heisman reportedly told his players, [...] "You're doing all right, team, we're ahead. But you just can't tell what those Cumberland players have <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves.</b> They may spring a surprise. Be alert, men! Hit 'em clean, but hit 'em hard!" [...] However, even Heisman relented, and shortened the quarters in the second half to 12 minutes each instead of 15.|$|E
2500|$|Build 5048's closer {{resemblance}} to Windows XP {{than to the}} prior Longhorn builds from 2003 and 2004 surprised many, leading well-known Windows enthusiast Paul Thurrott to write: [...] "My thoughts are not positive, not positive at all. This is a painful build {{to have to deal}} with after a year of waiting, a step back in some ways. I hope Microsoft has surprises <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves.</b> This has the makings of a train wreck." [...] Months later, Thurrott stated that the Vista development process has since recovered in the more recent builds.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the century, women mostly {{occupied}} jobs in factory work or as domestic servants, but as the war came to an end they were able to move on to such jobs as: salespeople in department stores as well as clerical, secretarial and other, what were called, [...] "lace-collar" [...] jobs. In July 1920, The New York Times ran a head line that read: [...] "the American Woman ... has lifted her skirts far beyond any modest limitation" [...] which could apply to more than just fashion; women were now rolling <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> and skirts and making their way into the workforce.|$|E
50|$|The play offs were a step too far for {{the young}} City Stars squad however they still had one last {{surprise}} <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> when they beat league champions Invicta Dynamos 4-1 to ruin the Kent clubs play off hopes.|$|R
60|$|Of course, my dear critic, {{the ancient}} Aryans were just doddering--the old duffers: or babbling, the babes. But as for me, I have some respect for my ancestors, and believe {{they had more}} <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> than just the marvel of the unborn me.|$|R
6000|$|Dunleavy {{went on in}} his thin, overbred, insolent voice, [...] "Now I have it on good authority, from a man who's {{a member}} of the Aero Club, that next year will be the {{greatest}} year aviation has ever known, and that the Wrights have an aeroplane <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> with which they'll cross the Atlantic without a stop, during the spring of 1914 at the very latest." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cheating {{can take}} the form of crib notes, looking over someone's {{shoulder}} during an exam, or any forbidden sharing of information between students regarding an exam or exercise. Many elaborate methods of cheating have been developed over the years. For instance, students have been documented hiding notes in the bathroom toilet tank, in the brims of their baseball caps, or <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Also, the storing of information in graphing calculators, pagers, cell phones, and other electronic devices has cropped up since the information revolution began. While students have long surreptitiously scanned the tests of those seated near them, some students actively try to aid those who are trying to cheat. Methods of secretly signaling the right answer to friends are quite varied, ranging from coded sneezes or pencil tapping to high-pitched noises beyond the hearing range of most teachers. Some students have been known to use more elaborate means, such as using a system of repetitive body signals like hand movements or foot jerking to distribute answers (i.e. where a tap of the foot could correspond to answer [...] "A", two taps for answer [...] "B", and so on).|$|E
2500|$|Later, in {{the week}} of episodes from 27 to 31 August, a fight breaks out {{involving}} the remaining suspects. Kat is seen tending to her lover's injuries, but viewers only saw his arm. Inisde Soap said the arm could eliminate at least one suspect, as it shows some skin and a dark top. They compared it to what the suspects were wearing earlier in the episode and said it could belong to Michael or Derek, but [...] "EastEnders might have a few tricks <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> {{in order to put}} Jack and Max back in the mix." [...] When Kat receives flowers from her lover, Inside Soap opined that Derek would be [...] "the sort of bullish man [...] think nothing of sending flowers to , unconcerned that it might expose the affair." [...] After Kat confesses to Alfie, she concentrates on her marriage, but Inside Soap noted that over a period of weeks, she had been seen [...] "drunkenly flirting with Max, [...] making small talk with Jack [...] and giving Derek some very guilty looks", though it was still not clear who was her lover. They said that Jack had become devoted to Sharon in that time and is bothered by the bond Sharon has with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), but the bold gestures made towards Kat, such has her lover buying back the ring she pawned, are Derek's style, and [...] "he's made no secret {{of the fact that he}} fancies Kat rotten!" [...] When Kat receives a candle with a note saying [...] "Light it. Put it in the window. I'll come knocking", Soaplife thought this was [...] "creepy" [...] and seemed to be something Derek would do.|$|E

50|$|The Soviets {{have decided}} to invade Iran {{in order to gain}} control of the Persian Gulf. They mount a {{surprising}} lightning air attack on Iran and place their aircraft carrier flotilla near the Persian Gulf. The Americans send the USS Nimitz and her carrier battle group in response. They also have Silver Tower, the ace <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> to watch over the carrier and provide real time view from space.|$|R
50|$|The new clan Akkaba {{assembled}} recently under Ozymandias and {{an elderly}} Fredrick Slade. This new clan has {{also revealed that}} Chamber {{is a member of}} their bloodline being a descendant of Jack Starsmore. While the Starsmore family never forgot about Apocalypse, Chamber rejected their offer of membership. It is unknown where the clan's loyalties lie and what plans they have <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve,</b> but as they say Clan Akkaba will always be there.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the college}} {{cultural}} fest. It {{is held in}} {{the second or third}} week of February and usually is a week-long event. Every year we have a theme for Gandhaar which gives us a valuable message. The themes are chosen to enlighten various art forms like dance, street plays, sports, festival days. Gandhaar is the time when students and teachers can roll <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> and get down on stage to let their talents bloom and accept a challenge.|$|R
60|$|So {{when they}} saw Tell hit Friesshardt, they tucked <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> grasped their sticks and cudgels more tightly, and began to run across the meadow towards him.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're fearfully bucked at the Admiralty, I believe," [...] Granet remarked. [...] "Of course, they'll {{pretend that}} they had this new dodge or {{whatever}} it may be, <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> all the time." ...|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{also had}} a card <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve.</b> With control over the dams on the Rur, they could release the water from them and flood the Rur valley and {{everything}} else downstream of {{it as far as}} the Meuse and into the Netherlands. That would cause large scale destruction and destroy Allied bridges over the Rur, isolating all troops east of the river. The Allies did not fully recognize the strategic importance of the dams for some time, and only days {{before the end of the}} offensive they made their first specific moves towards them.|$|R
5000|$|Buzzcocks has {{received}} a mixed-to-favourable response from critics. AllMusic opined, [...] "If Buzzcocks doesn't reinvent this band, it does give their approach {{a bit of an}} overhaul, and the results make for an album which holds onto their strengths while lending a more mature perspective to their work; hard to imagine Rancid having anything this interesting <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> twenty-seven years down the line from their first recording." [...] Entertainment Weeklys review was favourable, writing [...] "it's nice to hear that middle age hasn't diminished the songwriting skills of original 'Cocks Pete Shelley and Steve Diggle." ...|$|R

60|$|Plum and Poole begged and protested, but all to no purpose, and, badly scared, {{took off}} their coats and cuffs, rolled <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> {{and began to}} clean up the muss they had made.

60|$|The little cortege {{was turning}} {{out of the}} great gates {{of the house of}} Justice. It was {{intensely}} cold; a bitter north-easterly gale was blowing from across the heights of Montmartre, driving sleet and snow and half-frozen rain into the faces of the men, and finding its way <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> down their collars and round the knees of their threadbare breeches.|$|E
5000|$|Awarding {{the album}} {{three and a}} half stars for HM Magazine, Rob Shameless states, [...] "With heavy {{breakdowns}} and eerie leads, along with an anthem of liberation, this is a great record to give you a taste of what Facedown has <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> for 2012." [...] Christian Cunningham, giving the album an eight out of ten at Cross Rhythms, writes, [...] "Rather refreshingly, the breakdowns, whilst still liberally spattered across the entirety of the record, manage to sound unique and varied and yet still retain that quintessential hardcore sound, avoiding the recycled riff déjà-vu of so many modern hardcore bands." ...|$|R
50|$|The girls usually live to excess, {{but they}} {{encounter}} a lifestyle that's {{exactly the opposite}} when Laura brings them to an urban homestead: a eco-friendly self-sufficient house.

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a [...] "C". Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic {{gave it a}} {{negative}} review saying, [...] "Saw III is devoid of any suspense or terror or common sense. It's simply an exercise in gore. And really, if that's all the filmmakers have <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve,</b> why bother with a plot? Just show one grisly makeup effect after another and you'd create the same sensory experience". Empires Kim Newman gave the film two out of five stars. He said the acting was [...] "surprisingly good" [...] but criticized the script and torture devices, calling it [...] "more contrived, and thus less effective". He ended his review saying, [...] "It requires a {{stretch of the imagination}} too far, but there's still plenty of gore and tricksy murders here".|$|R
60|$|McMurdo's coat {{had been}} brought to him; but before putting it on he {{examined}} his right arm, which still smarted heavily. There on the flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it, deep and red, as the branding iron had left it. One or two of his neighbours pulled <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> and showed their own lodge marks.|$|E
60|$|Sublette {{ordered his}} men to keep to the camp, being {{recruits}} from St. Louis, and unused to Indian warfare. He and his friend Campbell prepared for action. Throwing off their coats, rolling <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> and arming themselves with pistols and rifles, they mounted their horses and dashed forward among the first. As they rode along, they made their wills in soldier-like style; each stating how his effects should be disposed of in case of his death, and appointing the other his executor.|$|E

They're all laughing <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> at her." ...|$|E
60|$|Archie was shocked. This tragedy touched him. He {{himself had}} never had any money in his life, but somehow he had always seemed to manage to have plenty of clothes. How this was he could not say. He had always had a vague sort of idea that tailors were kindly birds who never failed to have a pair of {{trousers}} or something <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{to present to the}} deserving. There was the drawback, of course, that once they had given you things they were apt to write you rather a lot of letters about it; but you soon managed to recognise their handwriting, and then it was a simple task to extract their communications from your morning mail and drop them in the waste-paper basket. This was the first case he had encountered {{of a man who was}} really short of clothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "My boy, I can't either," [...] Mr. Bullsom declared. [...] "This {{is one of}} the proudest {{nights of}} my life. Do you know what we've done up there at Westminster, eh? We've given this old country a new lease of life. How they were all {{laughing}} at us <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve,</b> eh! Germans, and Frenchmen, and Yankees. It's a horse of another colour now. John Bull has found out how to protect himself. And, Brooks, my boy, it's been mentioned to-night, and I'm a proud man when I think of it. There were others who did the showy part of the work, of course, the speechmaking and the bill-framing and all that, but I was the first man to set the Protection snowball rolling. It wasn't much I had to say, but I said it. A glass of wine with you, Sir Henry? With pleasure, sir! ...|$|R
5000|$|In the men's {{wheelchair}} race, Kurt Fearnley of Australia won an eight-way sprint to {{the finish}} to win {{with a time of}} 1:31:29. He credited a new training regimen for his win and remarked [...] "I realised last year that at the last 300 m if someone's got that extra bit of power <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeve</b> they beat you every time." [...] Marcel Hug of Switzerland took second and Ernst van Dyk from South Africa finished third. Pre-race favourite and six-time winner David Weir of Great Britain finished fifth. Cassidy, who dropped out of the race after the crash, had harsh words for the race organisers. [...] "I don't know who's responsible, but every year we come to overtake the women, there's 10 chairs going at 20 mph and the poor women are scrambling to find their feet," [...] he said. [...] "I have a brand new $2,000 pair of wheels that are damaged, who's going to pay for them? Things have to change." ...|$|R
