40|$|The Miami blue butterfly, Cyclargus thomasi bethunebakeri (Lycaenidae), {{which was}} {{widespread}} in coastal southern Florida {{in the last}} century, is now reduced to a few dozen individuals on a single islet of the Florida Keys. We present the first account of its reproductive ecology, and analyze its decline. We correct the common view that a principal host plant, <b>balloon</b> <b>vine,</b> is an exotic weed. Four other insects also feed on seeds of <b>balloon</b> <b>vine,</b> including a true bug, a wasp, and another lycaenid hairstreak that colonized the area in 1970. Larvae of the two lycaenids were negatively associated across sites, {{due in part to}} oviposition decisions. <b>Balloon</b> <b>vines</b> were more likely to abort fruit containing larval blues than hairstreaks. Most focal host plants disappeared between 1988 and 2003, mainly due to human disturbance.

50|$|Two {{populations in}} {{southern}} Florida are particularly notable. The more southern {{of these two}} populations feeds on the seeds of a native host <b>vine</b> <b>balloon</b> <b>vine</b> (Cardiospermum corindum). This vine produces capsules of a fairly uniform size, which adult J. haematoloma feed on by inserting their mouthparts (beak) through the capsule's exterior and into the interior seeds. In the mid-1950s, a related southeast Asian tree, the Taiwanese Flamegold (Koelreuteria elegans), was introduced as an ornamental plant. It escaped domestication and naturalized. Significantly, the Flamegold was colonized by J. haematoloma, though its capsules are smaller and the seeds less deeply embedded than in the <b>balloon</b> <b>vine.</b>|$|R

40|$|Host range expansion, or {{adaptation}} of insects to new hosts, is a worldwide phenomenon {{that has been}} observed repeatedly and extensively; still, the genetic mechanisms behind host-shifts are not well known. In this thesis I focus on the morphological and genetic variation associated with two recent anthropogenic host shifts in two species of soapberry bug, Leptocoris tagalicus and Jadera haematoloma [...] First, I investigated the host-associated genetic differentiation in Australian Leptocoris soapberry bugs, as determined by genome-wide variation patterns. My results show that specimens feeding on two naturalized Neotropical <b>balloon</b> <b>vines,</b> (Cardiospermum halicacabum and C. grandiflorum) have longer “beaks” that those living on the native trees Atalaya hemiglauca and Alectryon tomentosus. Genetic analyses of mitochondrial haplotypes and amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers indicate that the lineage of bugs on the annual vine C. halicacabum, is intermediate between two subspecies of L. tagalicus found on the native hosts. Moreover, where this annual vine and whitewood tree (A. hemiglauca) co-occur, the morphology and genomic composition of the bugs {{are similar to those}} occurring in allopatry. These results show that hybridization provided the genetic elements underlying the strongly differentiated ‘halicacabum bugs’. In contrast, the bugs feeding on the recently introduced perennial <b>balloon</b> <b>vine</b> (C. grandiflorum) showed no evidence of admixture, and are genetically indistinguishable from the nearby populations on a native host. Second I used a candidate gene approach to investigate the molecular genetic basis of host-adaptation in Floridian populations of the red-shouldered soapberry bug, J. haematoloma. While in Southern Florida soapberry bugs have long beaks to penetrate the large fruits of the native <b>balloon</b> <b>vine</b> (C. corindum), in northern and central Florida, bugs have evolved to feed on an introduced, flat-podded host, the Taiwanese Golden rain tree (Koelreuteria elegans). Specifically I focused on five genes because of their potential role in host preference (orco), “beak” length (Dll, dac, hth) and the adaptation to the toxic compounds of host-plants (Na+/K+-ATPase). My results suggest these genes are highly conserved in this system, and that genetic variation at these loci is not associated with the different host-plants...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{adaptation}} of plant feeding insects to introduced hosts provides clear cases of ecologically based population divergence. In {{most cases the}} mechanisms permitting rapid differentiation are not well known. Here we study morphological and genetic variation associated with recent shifts by the Australian soapberry bug Leptocoris tagalicus onto two naturalized Neotropical <b>balloon</b> <b>vines,</b> Cardiospermum halicacabum and C. grandiflorum that differ in time since introduction. Our results show that these vines have much larger fruits than the native hosts (Whitewood tree -Atalaya hemiglauca- and Woolly Rambutan -Alectryon tomentosus-) and that bugs living on them have evolved significantly longer beaks and new allometries. Genetic analyses of mitochondrial haplotypes and amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers indicate that the lineage of bugs on the annual vine C. halicacabum, the older introduction, is intermediate between the two subspecies of L. tagalicus found on native hosts. Moreover, where the annual vine and Whitewood tree co-occur, the morphology and genomic composition of the bugs {{are similar to those}} occurring in allopatry.

50|$|People, {{plants and}} animals are the three main threats to Burpengary Creek. Along with {{widespread}} settlement along Burpengary Creek came clearing of native plants, pipes built underground, soil erosion, hardening of creek beds and homes built in the flood path, which in turn results in continuing of private and public costs. Early settlement days saw the introduction of horses, cattle and domestic pets, which has seen widespread degradation of natural vegetation which suppresses re-growth and fauna being killed.

50|$|Serinethinae is a {{subfamily}} of the hemipteran family Rhopalidae, sometimes {{known as}} soapberry bugs. They are brightly colored seed-eaters, comprising three genera and about sixty-five species. These bugs are specialists on {{plants in the}} soapberry family (Sapindaceae), which includes maples, <b>balloon</b> <b>vines,</b> and soapberry trees, among others. Seeds of the plants are the main resource used by adults for reproduction and nymphs for growth and development. Their diversity {{is the result of}} an adaptive radiation on these plants, whose cyanide-based defenses the bugs have overcome. The New World genus Jadera consists of nearly 20 species that range naturally from Kansas to southern Argentina. Boisea consists of 4 species, 1 in Africa, 1 in India, and 2 in North America, including the well-known box elder bug, Boisea trivittata. Leptocoris includes more than 40 species, in Oceania, Australia, Asia, and Africa.|$|R
5000|$|Leptocoris is {{the largest}} genus of the soapberry bug subfamily. The 41 species of this genus are {{distributed}} throughout Africa, South Asia, and Oceania and {{are thought to have}} originated in Africa, where the greatest diversity of Leptocoris species are found. [...] Members of this genus are large-bodied and have short, wide pronota; they are similar in appearance to the New World genus Jadera (of which there is no range overlap). Leptocoris species can be easily distinguished from the small, slender Boisea (of which there is substantial range overlap). The Australian Leptocoris tagalicus has been studied for its ability to rapidly adapt to invasive hosts (e.g. <b>balloon</b> <b>vine)</b> and is seen as a possible means of biocontrol for environmental weeds. [...] The southeast Asian species Leptocoris vicinus is common in urban settings, although it is frequently misidentified as Leptocoris augur.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} demographic {{performance of}} biological invaders may often {{depend on their}} escape from specifically adapted enemies. Here we report that native taxa in colonized regions may swiftly evolve to exploit such emancipated exotic species because of selection caused by invaders. A native Australian true bug has expanded it host range to include a vine imported from tropical America {{that has become a}} serious environmental weed. Based on field comparisons and historical museum specimens, we show that over the past 30 - 40 years, seed feeding soapberry bugs have evolved 5 - 10 % longer mouthparts, better suited to attack the forest-invading <b>balloon</b> <b>vines,</b> which have large fruits. Laboratory experiments show that these differences are genetically based, and result in a near-doubling of the rate at which seeds are attacked. Thus a native biota that initially permits invasion may rapidly respond in ways that ultimately facilitate control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Scentless plant bugs (Heteroptera: Rhopalidae) are {{so named}} because adults of the Serinethinae have vestigial metathoracic s ent glands. Serinethines are seed predators of Sapindales, {{especially}} Sapindaceae that produce toxic cyanolipids. In two serinethine species whose ranges extend into the southern United States, Jadera haematoloma and J. sanguinoIenta, sequestration f host cyanolipids as glucosides renders these gregarious, apo-sematic insects unpalatable {{to a variety of}} predators. The blood glucoside profile and cyanogenesis ofJadera varies depending on the cyanolipid chem-istry of hosts, and adults and larvae fed golden rain tree seeds (Koelreuteria paniculata) excrete the volatile lactone, 4 -methyl- 2 (5 H) -furanone, to which they are attracted. Jadera fed <b>balloon</b> <b>vine</b> seeds (Cardiospermum spp.) do not excrete the attractive lactone. Loss of the usual heteropteran defensive glands in serinethines may have coevolved with host specificity on toxic plants, and the orientation of Jadera to a volatile excretory product could be an adaptive response to save time.

40|$|Members of the <b>balloon</b> <b>vine</b> genus, Cardiospermum, {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{moved around the}} globe as medicinal and horticultural species, {{two of which are}} now widespread invasive species; C. grandiflorum and C. halicacabum. A third species, C. corindum, may also have significant invasion potential. However, in some regions the native status of these species is not clear, hampering management. For example, in South Africa it is unknown whether C. halicacabum and C. corindum are native, and this is a major constraint to on-going biological control programmes against invasive C. grandiflorum. We review the geography, biology and ecology of selected members of the genus with an emphasis on the two most widespread invaders, C. halicacabum and C. grandiflorum. Specifically, we use molecular data to reconstruct a phylogeny of the group in order to shed light on the native ranges of C. halicacabum and C. corindum in southern Africa. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that southern African accessions of these species are closely related to South American taxa indicating human-mediated introduction and/or natural long distance dispersal. Then, on a global scale we use species distribution modelling to predict potential suitable climate regions where these species are currently absent. Native range data were used to test the accuracy with which bioclimatic modelling can identify the known invasive ranges of these species. Results show that Cardiospermum species have potential to spread further in already invaded or introduced regions in Australia, Africa and Asia, underlining the importance of resolving taxonomic uncertainties for future management efforts. Bioclimatic modelling predicts Australia to have highly favourable environmental conditions for C. corindum and therefore vigilance against this species should be high. Species distribution modelling showed that native range data over fit predicted suitable ranges, and that factors other than climate influence establishment potential. This review opens the door to better understand the global biogeography of the genus Cardiospermum, with direct implications for management, while also highlighting gaps in current research...|$|R

When he returned to the 1st Pursuit Group's base at Rembercourt the next day, he was confronted by Lt. Grant, his squadron's commanding officer (C.O.). Despite being under threat of arrest by Grant for being AWOL, Luke took off without authorization and flew to a forward airbase at Verdun, where his sympathetic group commander, Major Hartney, canceled the arrest order and gave Luke tacit approval to continue his balloon hunting. That evening Luke flew to the front to attack three balloons in the vicinity of Dun-sur-Meuse, six miles behind the German lines. He first dropped a message to a nearby <b>U.S.</b> <b>balloon</b> company, alerting them to observe his imminent attacks. Luke shot down the enemy balloons, but was then severely wounded by a single machine gun bullet fired from a hilltop above him, a mile east of the last balloon site he had attacked. Luke landed in a field just west of the small village of Murvaux—after strafing a group of German soldiers on the ground—near the Ruisseau de Bradon, a stream leading to the Meuse River. Although weakened by his wound, he made his way toward the stream, intending to reach the cover of its adjacent underbrush, but finally collapsed some 200 meters from his airplane. Approached by German infantry, Luke drew his Colt Model 1911 pistol and fired a few rounds at his attackers before dying.
