Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the competitive network have the universality for a weighted network. The relation between parameters in the weighted network and the competitiveness in the competitive network is obtained. So we can use the expression of the degree distribution of the competitive model to calculate that and the strength of the weighted network directly.

Consequently, this paper presents an adaptive weak signal extraction algorithm, with which the weak distant target signal can be extracted, thus the detecting distance can be obviously lengthened. The algorithm is designed as follows: Firstly, estimates the target signal when the signal is extremely weak. To a given detecting system, the target signal can be estimated by the geometry relationship among the physical references. Secondly, gets the initial normalized coefficients h(i) of the BPFIR filter by sampling the first harmonic of the estimated target signal and then normalized coefficients Sigma 0 Nh(i) = 1 Thirdly, gets the amplification value k of the algorithm using the radiation equation L = radic(Irho/EnKc) and the response property curve of the sensors.
