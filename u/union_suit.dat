25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1910s, Chalmers Knitting Company {{split the}} <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> into upper and lower sections, {{effectively}} inventing the modern undershirt and drawers. Women wore lacier versions of this basic duo known as the camisole and tap pants.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the mass-produced {{undergarment}} industry was booming, and competition forced producers {{to come up}} with all sorts of innovative and gimmicky designs to compete. The Hanes company emerged from this boom and quickly established itself as a top manufacturer of union suits, which were common until the 1930s. Textile technology continued to improve, and the time to make a single <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> dropped from days to minutes.|$|E

5000|$|In 1878, a German {{professor}} named Gustav Jaeger {{published a}} book claiming that only clothing made of animal hair, such as wool, promoted health. A British accountant named Lewis Tomalin translated the book, then opened a shop selling Dr Jaegerâ€™s Sanitary Woollen System, including knitted wool <b>union</b> <b>suits.</b> These were soon called [...] "Jaegers"; they were widely popular.|$|R
25|$|In the 1920s, {{manufacturers}} shifted emphasis from durability to comfort. <b>Union</b> <b>suit</b> advertisements {{raved about}} patented new designs that {{reduced the number}} of buttons and increased accessibility. Most of these experimental designs had to do with new ways to hold closed the crotch flap common on most union suits and drawers. A new woven cotton fabric called nainsook gained popularity in the 1920s for its durability. Retailers also began selling preshrunk undergarments.|$|E
500|$|As {{interest}} grew, purity societies {{attempted to}} ban reproductions of September Morn, {{and people in}} possession of them ran the risk of confiscation and fines. Postcards bearing the painting were banned from the postal system. Harold Marx, a New Orleans art dealer who displayed a reproduction, was arrested a month after being told to take the painting down; displays of reproductions were also forcibly removed in Miami and Atlanta. In Chicago, a man was charged with disorderly conduct after bringing home a reproduction. Irene Deal, who dressed in a <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> and posed as [...] "Miss September Morn" [...] in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, as a publicity stunt, was controversially fined $50 for disorderly conduct. In 1914, students at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio, burned {{a copy of the}} painting for being against their religious beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|Another common {{undergarment}} of the late-19th {{century for}} men, {{women and children}} was the <b>union</b> <b>suit.</b> Invented in Utica, New York, and patented in 1868, this was a one-piece front-buttoning garment usually made of knitted material with sleeves extending to the wrists and legs down to the ankles. It had a buttoned flap (known colloquially as the [...] "access hatch", [...] "drop seat" [...] or [...] "fireman's flap") in the back to ease visits to the toilet. The <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> was the precursor of long johns, a two-piece garment consisting of a long-sleeved top and long pants possibly named after American boxer John L. Sullivan who wore a similar garment in the ring.|$|E

50|$|Winter {{clothes are}} {{especially}} outerwear like coats, jackets, hats and gloves or mittens, but also warm underwear like long underwear, <b>union</b> <b>suits</b> and socks. Military issue winter clothing evolved from heavy coats and jackets to multilayered clothing {{for the purpose}} of keeping troops warm during winter battles. Several shirts and socks, usually four pairs were standard issue for the U.S. Army during WWII. Winter clothes used for sports and recreation includes ski suits and snowmobile suits.Many northern cultures use animal fur to make winter clothes.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, World War I {{soldiers}} were issued button-front shorts as underwear. The buttons {{attached to a}} separate piece of cloth, or [...] "yoke", sewn {{to the front of}} the garment, and tightness of fit was adjusted by means of ties on the sides. This design proved so popular that it began to supplant the <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> in popularity by the end of the war. Rayon garments also became widely available in the post-war period.|$|E
2500|$|Drop seat : One of the {{features}} most commonly associated with blanket sleepers in the public imagination, the drop seat (also known as a trap door or butt flap) is {{an opening in the}} buttocks area, traditionally closing with buttons, designed to allow the wearer to use the toilet without removing the sleeper. Drop seats were very common on sleepers made before the 1950s, but today they are rather rare. (Similar drop seats were also a common feature on the traditional <b>union</b> <b>suit.)</b> ...|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the next}} four decades, the company shifted focus and products. <b>Union</b> <b>suits</b> became less popular, and briefs soon became the company's leading product. Vassar Swiss {{purchased}} the building from Stewart, after having leased it since construction. [...] Rutledge retired in 1937. The company shortened its name to [...] "Vassar Company" [...] and, in 1951, [...] "Vassarette."

60|$|They {{moved forward}} {{a little faster}} {{to see what the}} dog was barking at, and found perched upon a point of rock by the {{roadside}} a curious creature. It had the form of a man, middle-sized and rather slender and graceful; but as it sat silent and motionless upon the peak they could see that its face was black as ink, and it wore a black cloth costume made like a <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> and fitting tight to its skin. Its hands were black, too, and its toes curled down, like a bird's. The creature was black all over except its hair, which was fine, and yellow, banged in front across the black forehead and cut close at the sides. The eyes, which were fixed steadily upon the barking dog, were small and sparkling and looked like the eyes of a weasel.|$|E
60|$|I set myself briskly to {{work and}} {{in half an hour}} had already the {{satisfaction}} of seeing my habitation rising into shape. I was still gnawing with unabated energy when I was interrupted by a low growling in the underbrush. With animal caution I shrank behind a tree, growling in return. I could see something moving in the bushes, evidently an animal of large size. From its snarl I judged it to be a bear. I could hear it moving nearer to me. It was about to attack me. A savage joy thrilled through me at the thought, while my <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> bristled with rage from head to foot as I emitted growl after growl of defiance. I bared my teeth to the gums, snarling, and lashed my flank with my hind foot. Eagerly I watched for the onrush of the bear. In savage combat who strikes first wins. It was my idea, as soon as the bear should appear, to bite off its front legs one after the other. This initial advantage once gained, I had no doubt of ultimate victory.|$|E
60|$|The {{hunting knife}} {{of his father}} hung at his left hip, his bow and his quiver of arrows were slung across his {{shoulder}}s, while around his chest over one shoulder and beneath the opposite arm was coiled the long grass rope without which Tarzan would have felt quite as naked as would you should you be suddenly thrust upon a busy highway clad only in a <b>union</b> <b>suit.</b> A heavy war spear which he sometimes carried {{in one hand and}} again slung by a thong about his neck so that it hung down his back completed his armament and his apparel. The diamond-studded locket with the pictures of his mother and father that he had worn always until he had given it as a token of his highest devotion to Jane Clayton before their marriage was missing. She always had worn it since, but it had not been upon her body when he found her slain in her boudoir, so that now his quest for vengeance included also a quest for the stolen trinket.|$|E

It marches out ponderous battalions to sell a brass pin. It evokes shoes that are uncomfortable, hideous, and perishable, and touchingly hopes that all women will aid the cause of good business by wearing them. It turns noble valleys into fields for pickles. It compels men whom it has never seen to toil in distant factories and produce useless wares, which are never actually brought into the office, but which it nevertheless sells to the heathen in the Solomon Islands in exchange for commodities whose very names it does not know; {{and in order to}} perform this miracle of transmutation it keeps stenographers so busy that they change from dewy girls into tight-lipped spinsters before they discover life.|$|R

50|$|Munsing was a {{technologist}} and {{the company}} received several patents, including those for a crocheting machine in 1891 and a <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> in the early 1890s. The <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> was the company's flagship product until the 1920s, when central heating made it less useful. It continued until 1969. The cream-colored garment became iconic and was featured in the company's advertising with children and adults outfitted in them; underwear ads had never used live models before. In 1894 Munsing left the company.|$|E

The <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> is referred to several times in Laura Ingalls Wilder's books about pioneer life during the mid-to-late 19th century in the United States, and in Harper Lee's book, To Kill A Mockingbird. In the expansion Undead Nightmare for the game Red Dead Redemption, the player begins play wearing a <b>union</b> <b>suit</b> and can choose to continue to wear it throughout the game, if desired.
