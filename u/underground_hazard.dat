40|$|Due {{to safety}} and ethical issues, {{traditional}} experimental approaches to modelling underground risk behaviours can be costly, dangerous and even impossible to realize. Based on multi-agent technology, a virtual coalmine platform for risk behaviour simulation {{is presented to}} model and simulate the human-machine-environment related risk factors in underground coalmines. To reveal mine workers' risk behaviours, a fuzzy emotional behaviour model is proposed to simulate underground miners' responding behaviours to potential hazardous events based on cognitive appraisal theories and fuzzy logic techniques. The proposed emotion model can generate more believable behaviours for virtual miners according to personalized emotion states, internal motivation needs and behaviour selection thresholds. Finally, typical accident cases of <b>underground</b> <b>hazard</b> spotting and locomotive transport were implemented. The behaviour believability of virtual miners was evaluated with a user assessment method. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed models can create more realistic and reasonable behaviours in virtual coalmine environments, which can improve miners' risk awareness and further train miners' emergent decision-making ability when facing unexpected underground situations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of the {{statistics}} data extracted from <b>underground</b> <b>hazards</b> in “A ” region of Yuan Shi oilfield, and with casing failures as an example, engineering hazards such as sand production, casing damages etc. in different geological structures are compared and distinguished. A detailed examination of their relationship is conducted in terms of mineral composition, sedimentary facies and other reservoir aspects. The triggering mechanism of engineering hazards is also theorized. Especially, under water injection, the effect of geological structures on engineering hazards is illustrated. Finally, engineering hazards prevention and minimization measures are presented. The latter include: 1) the shallow underground water must be fine filtered with oxygen removed & sterilized, and water pipelines corroded in the entire process; 2) reduce the casing pipe intensity by injected water corrosion. Introductions Engineering hazards in China are rampant. There are over 200 billion yen of loss annually incurred by various geological factors.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is generation of an <b>underground</b> mining <b>hazard</b> map. The method applied to create the map is based on five categories of areas with different characters of underground mining influence making use of the so-called building site categories. The individual areas with different groups represent various suitability or unsuitability for founding new structures in such influenced territories. They will also reflect a higher or lower degree of influence on already existing structures. Areas affected by underground mining of category V are suitable without any significant restrictions. Areas of the medium category represent influence of building site categories III and IV with economically acceptable measures for founding engineering purposes. The last type is areas with high influence in the category I and II and they are clearly unsuitable for new development. Structures may be founded there in exceptional cases only. This methodology was applied on four map sheets in 1 : 10, 000 scale in a coal mining region {{in the town of}} Karviná and its environs in the direction to the City of Ostrava (Czech Republic).

40|$|In {{laboratory}} tests with adult coyotes (Canis latrans) a pyrotechnic fumigant containing two active ingredients, sodium nitrate and charcoal, {{was found to}} be just as effective as the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Gas Cartridge that contains six active and two inactive ingredients. The two-ingredient cartridge produces high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Field tests with cartridges containing 240 g of 65 % sodium nitrate and 35 % charcoal produced a 96 % mortality rate in coyote pups. A cartridge containing 65 g of 65 % sodium nitrate and 35 % charcoal was effective in both laboratory and field tests on wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). In field tests conducted at a rat-infested cattle feedlot, there was a 77 % average (35 % to 95 % range) reduction in numbers of reopened burrows after fumigation as compared to pretreatment figures. Sodium nitrate and charcoal are not dangerous chemicals. The acute oral LD 5 Q for both sodium nitrate and charcoal is greater than 3, 000 mg/kg in rats, and there was no potentiation when given in combination at 3, 000 mg/kg. No signs of secondary toxicity were observed in bobcats (Lynx rufus) fed rats killed by fumes from burning sodium nitrate and charcoal.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{technical}} aspects of lighting system of underground coalmines using Light Emitting Diode (LED) and incandescent (INC) based Cap lamp. The purpose of the paper is to ensure numerous complex and interrelated factors that must be considered to design and implement a LED based efficient lighting system suitable for underground coalmines, which will satisfy human, needs for good vision and comfort. The workers of mines are very much dependent on visual cues to recognize <b>underground</b> mining <b>hazards.</b> On the other hand, illumination plays a critical role in miners’ safety. Some hazards are located in the miners’ peripheral field-of-view off-axis (10  to about 60 ) or on-axis (0 ). It has been observed {{that by the end of}} the 9 -hour cycle, the light output levels of the INC systems were approximately 64 % (nickel-hydride battery) and 40 % (lead-acid battery) of the initial value. Whereas in case of LED based lighting system the drop is approximately 5 % over the 9 -hour period. Recent research has indicated that an increased short-wavelength content of the spectral power distribution of LEDs relative to incandescent lamps improves peripheral visual performance for low-light conditions. As LED produce light at required the lighting fixture as compared to the white light produced by incandescent bulb hence less energy consumes wavelength. Result of experiments demonstrated the effect of spectral power distribution (SPD) of LED as lighting system for underground coalmines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract For {{one week}} during September 2007, we {{deployed}} a temporary network of field recorders and accelerometers at four sites within two deep, seismically active mines. The ground-motion data, recorded at 200 samples/sec, are {{well suited to}} de-termining source and ground-motion parameters for the mining-induced earthquakes within and adjacent to our network. Four earthquakes with magnitudes close to 2 were recorded with high signal/noise at all four sites. Analysis of seismic moments and peak velocities, {{in conjunction with the}} results of laboratory stick-slip friction experi-ments, were used to estimate source processes that are key to understanding source physics and to assessing <b>underground</b> seismic <b>hazard.</b> The maximum displacements on the rupture surfaces can be estimated from the parameter Rv, where v is the peak ground velocity at a given recording site, and R is the hypocentral distance. For each earthquake, the maximum slip and seismic moment can be combined with results from laboratory friction experiments to estimate the maximum slip rate within the rupture zone. Analysis of the four M 2 earthquakes recorded during our deployment and one of special interest recorded by the in-mine seismic network in 2004 revealed maxi-mum slips ranging from 4 to 27 mm and maximum slip rates from 1. 1 to 6 : 3 m=sec. Applying the same analyses to anM 2. 1 earthquake within a cluster of repeating earth-quakes near the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth site, California, yielded similar results for maximum slip and slip rate, 14 mm and 4 : 0 m=sec...|$|R

40|$|Mine {{hoisting}} is {{the most}} critical and potentially the most dangerous operation in <b>underground</b> mining. Many <b>hazards</b> are related to falls of miners and materials, ground instability, and malfunction or lack of safety devices. All {{have the potential to}} cause a catastrophic accident. A condition know as 'slack rope' is particularly dangerous, especially if it occurs without the operator's awareness. The most common occurrence of slack rope is in metal or nonmetal mines that have a history of ground control problems near the shaft. Studies of hoist safety features and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) accident statistics suggests a need to measure wire rope tension, conveyance speed and position, and shaft guide misalignment. The most accurate data are obtained directly from the conveyance. Such data could warn of potentially dangerous situations during hoisting operations, as well as during inspections, maintenance, and lowering of large equipment.
