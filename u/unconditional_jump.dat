2500|$|To {{these four}} both Wang (1954, 1957) and then C.Y. Lee (1961) added another {{instruction}} from the Post set { ERASE }, {{and then a}} Post's <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> { JUMP_to_ instruction_z } (or to make things easier, the conditional jump JUMP_IF_blank_to_instruction_z, or both. Lee named this a [...] "W-machine" [...] model: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{this version}} the counter [...] "y" [...] is called [...] "r2", and the {{function}} f( [...] x, r2 [...] ) deposits its number in register [...] "r3". Perhaps the reason Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey clear r3 is to facilitate an <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> to loop; {{this is often}} done by use of a dedicated register [...] "0" [...] that contains [...] "0": ...|$|E
2500|$|There was no {{division}} instruction (but various division subroutines were supplied) {{and no way}} {{to directly}} load a number into the accumulator (a [...] "sTore and zero accumulator" [...] instruction followed by an [...] "Add" [...] instruction were necessary for this). [...] There was no <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> instruction, nor was there a procedure call instruction- it {{had not yet been}} invented.|$|E
50|$|<b>Unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> uses Goto and Lbl to operate.|$|R
5000|$|Even better, the [...] "tweaked" [...] {{pseudocode}} example, {{that may}} be performed automatically by some optimizing compilers, eliminating <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> altogether.|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{unnecessary}} {{loading of}} branch prediction electronics, (and therefore unnecessary pipeline stalls) the comparing branch codes {{should never be}} used for <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Beyond general {{algorithms}} {{and their}} implementation on an abstract machine, concrete source code level choices {{can make a}} significant difference. For example, on early C compilers, while(1) was slower than for( [...] ;;) for an unconditional loop, because while(1) evaluated 1 and then had a conditional jump which tested if it was true, while for ( [...] ;;) had an <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> [...] Some optimizations (such as this one) can nowadays be performed by optimizing compilers. This depends on the source language, the target machine language, and the compiler, and can be both difficult to understand or predict and changes over time; this is a key place where understanding of compilers and machine code can improve performance. Loop-invariant code motion and return value optimization are examples of optimizations that {{reduce the need for}} auxiliary variables and can even result in faster performance by avoiding round-about optimizations.|$|E
5000|$|BES (sr. Bezuslovni Skok, en. <b>Unconditional</b> <b>Jump)</b> {{performs}} an <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> to {{the address}} specified by the parameter ...|$|E
50|$|This example {{shows how}} to create three more useful {{instructions:}} clear, <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump,</b> and copy.|$|E
50|$|Group 4 is {{conditional}} and <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps.</b> Functions 40 - 43 jump to {{the first}} instruction of a pair, and 44 - 47 to the second.|$|R
50|$|When Goto n (where n is {{an integer}} in 0-9) is executed, {{the program will}} jump to Lbl n. Loops can be created with <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{definition}} is more general than the intuitive one in some ways. For example, it allows <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> to labels not targeted by other jumps. This definition embodies the properties that make basic blocks {{easy to work}} with when constructing an algorithm.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} control flow {{constructs}} in PROMELA. They are the case selection, the repetition and the <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For example: {{the most}} {{expanded}} set would include each unique instruction {{from the three}} sets, plus <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> J (z) i.e.: ...|$|E
5000|$|... { Increment (r), Decrement (r), Clear (r); Copy (rj,rk), {{conditional}} Jump if {{contents of}} r=0, conditional Jump if rj=rk, <b>unconditional</b> <b>Jump,</b> HALT } ...|$|E
5000|$|Conditional and <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> {{as well as}} subroutines were {{supported}}. The FX-502P series supported 10 {{labels for}} programs and subroutines called P0 [...]. P9. Each program or subroutine could have up to 10 local labels called LBL0 [...]. LBL9 for jumps and branches.|$|R
5000|$|In {{programs}} that never end (such as operating systems), infinite busy waiting {{can be implemented}} by using <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> as shown by this NASM syntax: jmp $. The CPU will unconditionally jump to its own position forever. A busy wait like this can be replaced with:sleep:hltjmp sleep ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} Wang's project {{to seek a}} Turing-equivalent theory [...] "economical in the basic operations", and wishing to avoid <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps,</b> a notable {{theoretical}} language is the 4-instruction language P" [...] introduced by Corrado Böhm in 1964 — the first [...] "GOTO-less" [...] imperative [...] "structured programming" [...] language to be proved Turing-complete.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that only}} one type of [...] "jump" [...] - a {{conditional}} GOTO - is specified; for an <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> a string of GOTO's must test each symbol.|$|E
5000|$|If {{particular}} implementation {{stops the}} computer if it encounters an unknown opcode or it implements additional <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> instruction with opcode [...] "111aaaaa", then such behaviour {{can be used}} as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The x86 {{assembly}} has an <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> operation, , {{which can}} take an immediate address, a register or an indirect address as a parameter (note that most RISC processors only support a link register or short immediate displacement for jumping).|$|E
5000|$|Three-address code {{may have}} {{conditional}} and <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> {{and methods of}} accessing memory. It may also have methods of calling functions, or it may reduce these to jumps. In this way, three-address code {{may be useful in}} control-flow analysis. In the following C-like example, a loop stores the squares of the numbers between 0 and 9: ...|$|R
50|$|Note that, because control {{can never}} {{pass through the}} end of a basic block, some block {{boundaries}} may have to be modified after finding the basic blocks. In particular, fall-through conditional branches must be changed to two-way branches, and function calls throwing exceptions must have <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> added after them. Doing these may require adding labels to the beginning of other blocks.|$|R
5000|$|A {{plethora of}} {{instructions:}} Because any instruction {{acting on a}} single register can be augmented with its indirect [...] "dual" [...] (including conditional and <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps,</b> cf the Elgot-Robinson model), the inclusion of indirect instructions will {{double the number of}} single parameter/register instructions (e.g. INC (d, r), INC (i, r)). Worse, every two parameter/register instruction will have 4 possible varieties, e.g.: ...|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{register}} #2 contains [...] "2". Registers #0, #1 and #3 {{are empty}} (contain [...] "0"). Register #0 remains unchanged throughout calculations {{because it is}} used for the <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump.</b> Register #1 is a scratch pad. The program begins with instruction 1.|$|E
5000|$|But {{he admits}} {{the model is}} easier if he adds some pseudo-instructions O- [...] (combined 0 [...] and - [...] ) and [...] "go(n)". He builds [...] "go(n)" [...] out of the {{register}} w pre-set to 0, so that O- (w, (n)) is an <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> [...] - [...] {{the program}} exit code (P field) {{specifies}} a Program exit hub {{on the control}} panel, which has a wire plugged into it and, via distributors, to Program entry hubs specifying the first, second and third address digit of the instruction to jump to.|$|E
5000|$|RISC-V recycles [...] and [...] to get <b>unconditional</b> 20-bit PC-relative <b>jumps</b> and <b>unconditional</b> {{register}}-based 12-bit <b>jumps.</b> Jumps {{just make}} the linkage register 0 so that no return address is saved.|$|R
30|$|Programming of the {{proposed}} embedded ASIP includes three types of instructions. The first type is the ordinary classes like program flow instructions (conditional and <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps),</b> move instructions, real, and complex ADD/SUB instructions, interfacing control instructions (external reads, output set). The second type is optimized instructions to facilitate the implementation of synchronization subsystem tasks {{as well as other}} algorithms {{in different parts of the}} engine. The third type is vector instructions.|$|R
50|$|FCL is an {{imperative}} {{programming language}} {{close to the}} way a Von Neumann computer executes a program. A program is executed sequentially by following a sequence of commands, while maintaining an implicit state, i.e. the global memory. FCL has no concept of procedures, but does provide conditional and <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps.</b> FCL {{lives up to its}} name as the abstract call-graph of an FCL program is a straightforward flow chart.|$|R
5000|$|Above, {{the value}} of [...] "-1" [...] found at address 31 can either be treated as invalid {{instruction}} causing the computer to stop or as <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> (BES 31) to the same address, resulting in infinite loop that {{does not affect the}} result (control panel can be used to display it).|$|E
5000|$|To {{these four}} both Wang (1954, 1957) and then C.Y. Lee (1961) added another {{instruction}} from the Post set { ERASE }, {{and then a}} Post's <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> { JUMP_to_ instruction_z } (or to make things easier, the conditional jump JUMP_IF_blank_to_instruction_z, or both. Lee named this a [...] "W-machine" [...] model: ...|$|E
5000|$|Previously {{executed}} {{instructions were}} saved in an eight-word cache, called the [...] "stack". In-stack jumps were quicker than out-of-stack jumps because no memory fetch was required. The stack was flushed by an <b>unconditional</b> <b>jump</b> instruction, so unconditional jumps {{at the ends}} of loops were conventionally written as conditional jumps that would always succeed.|$|E
5000|$|The program COPY ( [...] #2, #3) has two parts. In {{the first}} part the program moves the {{contents}} of source register #2 to both scratch-pad #1 and to destination register #3; thus #1 and #3 will be copies of one another and of the original count in #2, but #2 is cleared {{in the process of}} decrementing it to zero. <b>Unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> J (z) are done by tests of register #0, which always contains the number 0: ...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} for control transfers should handle {{a variety of}} applications (e. g., procedure calls and returns, coroutine transfers, exceptions, process switches) in a uniform way. It should also allow an implementation in which the common cases of procedure call and return are extremely fast, preferably as fast as <b>unconditional</b> <b>jumps</b> in the normal case. This paper describes such a mechanism and methods for its efficient implementation. Key words and phrases: architecture, call, frame, procedure, registers, stack, transfer.
