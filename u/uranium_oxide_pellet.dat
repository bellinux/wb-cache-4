In order to achieve this goal, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been trained and validated from image histograms of pellets containing examples not only from normal pellets (flawless), but from defective pellets as well (with the main flaws normally found during the manufacturing process). Based on this technique, a new automatic identification system of flaws on nuclear fuel element pellets, composed by the association of image pre-processing and intelligent, will be developed and implemented on the Brazilian nuclear fuel production industry. Based on the theoretical performance of the technology proposed and presented in this article, it is believed that this new system, NuFAS (Nuclear Fuel Pellets Failures Automatic Identification Neural System) will be able to identify structural failures in nuclear fuel pellets with virtually zero error margins.

This program provides source-term data {{that are relevant to}} plausible sabotage scenarios in relation to spent fuel transport and storage casks and associated risk assessments. We present details and significant results obtained from this program from 2001 through 2007. Measured aerosol results include: respirable fractions produced; amounts, nuclide content, and produced particle size distributions and morphology; measurements of volatile fission product species enhanced sorption [...] enrichment factors onto respirable particles; and, status on determination of the spent fuel ratio, SFR, needed for scaling studies. Emphasis is provided on recent Phase 3 tests using depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>pellets</b> plus non-radioactive fission product dopants in surrogate spent fuel test rodlets, plus the latest surrogate cerium oxide results and aerosol laboratory supporting calibration work. The DUO{sub 2 }, CeO{sub 2 }, plus fission product dopant aerosol particle results are compared with available historical data.

40|$|Interim {{dry storage}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) rods is of {{critical}} concern because a shortage of existing SNF wet storage capacity combined with delays in {{the availability of a}} permanent disposal repository has led to an increasing number of SNF rods being placed into interim dry storage. Safe interim dry storage must be maintained for a minimum of twenty years according to the Standard Review Plan for Dry Cask Storage Systems [1] and the Code of Federal Regulations, 10 CFR Part 72 [2]. Interim dry storage licensees must meet certain safety conditions when storing SNF rods to ensure that there is a ''very low probability (e. g. 0. 5 %) of cladding breach during long-term storage'' [1]. Commercial SNF typically consists of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>pellets</b> surrounded by a thin cladding. The cladding is usually an {alpha}-zirconium based alloy know as ''Zircaloy''. In dry storage, the SNF rods are confined in one of several types of cask systems approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). ''The cask system must be designed to prevent degradation of fuel cladding that results in a type of cladding breach, such as axial-splits or ductile fracture, where irradiated UO{sub 2 } particles may be released. In addition, the fuel cladding should not degrade to the point where more than one percent of the fuel rods suffer pinhole or hairline crack type failure under normal storage conditions [1]. '' The NRC has approved two models [3, 4] for use by proposed dry storage licensees to determine the maximum initial temperature limit for nuclear fuel rods in dry storage that supposedly meet the above criteria and yield consistent temperature limits. Though these two models are based on the same fundamental failure theory, different assumptions have been made including the choice of values for material constants in the failure equation. This report will examine and compare the similarities and inconsistencies of these two models. It will illustrate some of the shortcomings of the current models and suggest modifications as well as some experiments that should be started in the near future. This report will also discuss changes in the current NRC standards with regard to the adoption of a strain-based model to be used to determine maximum allowable temperatures of the SNF...|$|R
5000|$|Zirconium diboride {{is used in}} many {{boiling water}} reactor fuel {{assemblies}} due to its refractory nature, corrosion resistance, high-neutron-absorption cross-section of 759 barns, and stoichiometric boron content. Boron acts as a [...] "burnable" [...] neutron absorber because its two isotopes, 10B and 11B, both transmute into stable nuclear reaction products upon neutron absorption (4He + 7Li and 12C, respectively) and therefore act as sacrificial materials which protect other components which become more radioactive with exposure to thermal neutrons. However, the boron in ZrB2|ZrB2 must be enriched in 11B because the gaseous helium evolved by 10B strains the fuel pellet of UO2 creates a gap between coating and fuel, and increases the fuel's centerline temperature; such cladding materials have been used on the <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> fuel <b>pellets</b> in Westinghouse AP-1000 nuclear reactors. The high thermal neutron absorbance of boron also has the secondary effect of biasing the neutron spectrum to higher energies, so the fuel pellet retains more radioactive 239Pu {{at the end of}} a fuel cycle. In addition to this deleterious effect of integrating a neutron absorber on the surface of a fuel pellet, boron coatings have the effect of creating a power density bulge in the middle of a nuclear reactor fuel cycle through the superposition of 235U depletion and faster burning of 11B. To help level out this bulge, ZrB2/Gd cermets are being studied which would extend fuel lifetime by superimposing three simultaneous degradation curves.|$|R

40|$|DOE has {{initiated}} numerous activities {{to focus on}} identifying material management strategies to disposition various excess fissile materials. In particular the INEEL has stored 1, 700 Kg of offspec HEU at INTEC in CPP- 651 vault facility. Currently, the proposed strategies for dispositioning are (a) aqueous dissolution and down blending to LEU via facilities at SRS followed by shipment of the liquid LEU to NFS for fabrication into LWR fuel for the TVA reactors and (b) dilution of the HEU to 0. 9 % for discard as a waste stream that {{would no longer have}} a criticality or proliferation risk without being processed through some type of enrichment system. Dispositioning this inventory as a waste stream via aqueous processing at SRS has been determined to be too costly. Thus, dry blending is the only proposed disposal process for the <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> materials in the CPP- 651 vault. Isotopic dilution of HEU to typically less than 20 % by dry blending is the key to solving the dispositioning issue (i. e., proliferation) posed by HEU stored at INEEL. RM- 2 mill is a technology developed and successfully tested for producing ultra-fine particles by dry grinding. Grinding action in RM- 2 mill produces a two million-fold {{increase in the number of}} particles being blended in a centrifugal field. In a previous study, the concept of achieving complete and adequate blending and mixing (i. e., no methods were identified to easily separate and concentrate one titanium compound from the other) in remarkably short processing times was successfully tested with surrogate materials (titanium dioxide and titanium mono-oxide) with different particle sizes, hardness and densities. In the current project, the RM- 2 milling technology was thoroughly tested with mixtures of natural <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> (NU) and depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> (DU) stock to prove its performance. The effects of mill operating and design variables on the blending of NU/DU oxides were evaluated. First, NU and DU both made of the same oxide, UO{sub 3 }, was used in the testing. Next, NU made up of UO{sub 3 } and DU made up of UO{sub 2 } was used in the test work. In every test, the blend achieved was characterized by spatial sampling of the ground product and analyzing for {sup 235 }U concentration. The test work proved that these <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> materials can be blended successfully. The spatial concentration was found to be uniform. Next, sintered thorium <b>oxide</b> <b>pellets</b> were used as surrogate for light water breeder reactor pellets (LWBR). To simulate LWBR pellet dispositioning, the thorium <b>oxide</b> <b>pellets</b> were first ground to a powder form and then the powder was blended with NU. In these tests also the concentration of {sup 235 }U and {sup 232 }Th in blended products fell within established limits proving the success of RM- 2 milling technology.
