The reaction as originally reported involved formation of a silyl enol ether followed by treatment with palladium(II) acetate and benzoquinone to yield the corresponding enone.

40|$|Alkyd resins are {{essential}} components of certain classes of paints. They typically {{have in their}} composition vegetable oils or fatty acid derivatives which contain in their carbon chain {{a certain degree of}} <b>unsaturations</b> (CC double bonds). The presence of these <b>unsaturations</b> allows prompting chemical reactions that lead to the oxidative polymerization of the material (reaction with molecular oxygen present in the air). Due to these chemical characteristics the resin becomes a polymeric structure which leads to the formation of a film over the surface, protecting and beautifying it...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the atmospheric plasma polymerization of allyl methacrylate (AMA), n-propyl methacrylate (nPMA), and propyl isobutyrate (PiB), whose chemistry mainly differs by their number of <b>unsaturations.</b> The resulting material is characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) while {{the thickness of}} the coatings is determined by visible spectroscopic ellipsometry (Vis-SE). The results show that the concentration of ester groups at the surface of the plasma polymers, as well as their deposition rate strongly depends on the surrounding <b>unsaturations</b> present in the precursor. A stabilization of the ester groups and an increase in the deposition rate due to the carbon-carbon double bonds is suggested. This study focuses on the atmospheric pressure plasma deposition of molecules that only differ by their number of <b>unsaturations,</b> namely allymethacrylate, n-propylmethacrylate, and propyl isobutyrate. The chemical composition and thickness of the resulting coatings, as well as the influence of plasma power are compared.

5|$|The {{standard}} {{conditions for the}} Weinreb–Nahm ketone synthesis are known to tolerate {{a wide variety of}} functional groups elsewhere in the molecule, including alpha-halogen substitution, N-protected amino acids, α-β <b>unsaturation,</b> silyl ethers, various lactams and lactones, sulfonates, sulfinates, and phosphonate esters. A wide variety of nucleophiles can be used in conjunction with the amide. Lithiates and Grignard reagents are most commonly employed; examples involving aliphatic, vinyl, aryl, and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles have been reported. However, with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles, elimination of the methoxide moiety to release formaldehyde can occur as a significant side reaction.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of <b>unsaturation</b> of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
25|$|The model {{assumes that}} the natural <b>unsaturation</b> in the tissues due to {{metabolic}} reduction in oxygen partial pressure provides the buffer against bubble formation, and that the tissue may be safely decompressed provided that the reduction in ambient pressure does not exceed this <b>unsaturation</b> value. Clearly any method which increases the <b>unsaturation</b> would allow faster decompression, as the concentration gradient would be greater without risk of bubble formation.|$|E
40|$|Polymers with repeating phosphoester {{linkages}} in {{the backbone}} are biodegradable and {{emerged as a}} promising class of novel biomaterials, especially {{in the field of}} drug delivery systems. The pentavalency of the phosphorus atom offers a large diversity of structures and as a consequence a wide range of properties for these materials. The thesis focused on the synthesis of novel well-defined diblock copolymers made of one hydrophilic polyethylene oxide (PEO) block and one polyphosphotriester (PPE) block bearing <b>unsaturations</b> as side-group, as a platform for the design of advanced drug delivery systems. Firstly, novel alkenyl PEO-b-PPE amphiphilic copolymers were self-assembled in water, taking profit of the <b>unsaturations</b> to prepare core cross-linked micelles. Doxorubicin could be successfully loaded by impregnation in these micellar nanocarriers leading to improved stability and loading as compared to the corresponding non-cross-linked systems. Besides, the alkynyl and allyl <b>unsaturations</b> of PEO-b-PPE copolymers were used to prepare novel double hydrophilic block copolymers exhibiting calcium complexation capabilities. They were found quite efficient as template for the formation of calcium carbonate particles providing particles of unprecedented small size, and high size homogeneity. The use of a supercritical carbon dioxide process with carboxylic acid containing copolymers allows reaching CaCO 3 particles about 1. 5 µm. Finally, we demonstrate that adding lysozyme to the process allows encapsulation of this enzyme into the CaCO 3 carriers, the protein activity being better preserved by using the PPE-b-PEO as compared to more conventional hyaluronic acid as a template...|$|R
40|$|Summary. There is {{a paucity}} of {{information}} on quantitative changes occurring in chemical constituents of the testis during maturation. Total carbohydrate, total protein, total lipid, neutral lipid, phospholipid, saponifiable and non-saponifiable fractions of neutral lipid, and non=req- volatile fatty acids of both the phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions were measured. Testis weight was seen to increase at a rate greater than that noted for body weight from 28 days (time of testis descent) to 56 days (time ofcomplete spermatogenesis). Changes in total protein and carbohydrate showed no definitive trends. A marked increase in total lipid was seen at 28 days which was reflected by increased phospholipid and neutral lipid values. The individual fatty acids showed some changes during matura-tion, but the most notable deviation was in the percentage composition of unsaturated fatty acids. The fatty acids of the neutral lipid fraction showed a marked increase {{in the percentage of}} fatty acids containing <b>unsaturations,</b> while those in the phospholipid fraction decreased in percentage containing <b>unsaturations.</b> These data are discussed concerning their possible relations to descent of the testis and initiation and main-tenance of spermatogenesis...|$|R

25|$|The natural <b>unsaturation</b> {{increases}} with depth, so a larger ambient pressure differential is possible at greater depth, and reduces as the diver surfaces.

25|$|Capsaicin is {{the most}} {{abundant}} capsaicinoid found in the Capsicum genus, but at least ten other capsaicinoid variants exist. Phenylalanine supplies the precursor to the phenylpropanoid pathway while leucine or valine provide the precursor for the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. To produce capsaicin, 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA is produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway and condensed with vanillamine. Other capsaicinoids are produced by the condensation of vanillamine with various acyl-CoA products from the branched-chain fatty acid pathway, which is capable of producing a variety of acyl-CoA moieties of different chain length and degrees of <b>unsaturation.</b> All condensation reactions between {{the products of the}} phenylpropanoid and branched-chain fatty acid pathway are mediated by capsaicin synthase to produce the final capsacinoid product.|$|E
30|$|From {{fatty acid}} {{analysis}} {{it was shown}} {{that the amount of}} <b>unsaturations</b> in oils is reduced during heating and frying. Since the fatty acid composition of waste oil shows that there are still many unsaturated fatty acids present, the fatty acids composition may not be the only factor contributing to increased performance. Residual carbohydrates, proteins and fats from foods, available nitrogen compounds, peroxides and heat-degradation products could also be metabolised and may have contributed to increased PHB production.|$|R
30|$|The signals {{resonating}} in {{the region}} included within 3 and 5.4  ppm are mostly attributable to hydroxyalkyl groups, prevalently deriving from carbohydrates. In particular, the signal at around 5.3  ppm is ascribable to hydrogens bond to anomeric carbons in mono- and oligosaccharides. Finally, the signals in the range 5.5 – 8  ppm are ascribable to protons bond to sp 2 hybridized carbons, including simple <b>unsaturations</b> (5.6 – 6.5  ppm) and aromatic structures (6.6 – 8  ppm).|$|R
30|$|All Humeomic {{fractions}} of both soils revealed {{a number of}} structures characterized by 12 or more C atoms, few <b>unsaturations</b> and typically 4 or occasionally more O atoms. These molecules included mostly a single N atom, even though up to four were found in some formulae. Since these compounds were nearly completely saturated, and given that these humic molecules had likely plant or bacterial origin, it may be inferred that membrane lipids or biopolyesters, such as cutin and suberin, were the most probable precursor for this class of compounds [49]. The main constituents of these biomolecules are either long-chain mono- or di-oic acids, with the chain bearing one or more <b>unsaturations</b> and/or one or more O substituents in the ω or mid-chain position. This suggests that the molecules designated as N, LDBE, LOx revealed (Additional file 1 : Tables S 1 –S 14) may derive from the break-down of lipids, cutin and suberin after cell death, and have included nitrogen in the formula at a later stage. ChemSpider and PubChem databases showed that the main compounds fitting this category were aliphatic AD, {{and to a lesser}} extent, some AM and HN.|$|R
25|$|Research {{continues}} on saturation decompression modelling and schedule testing. In 2015 a concept named Extended Oxygen Window {{was used in}} preliminary tests for a modified saturation decompression model. This model allows a faster rate of decompression {{at the start of}} the ascent to utilise the inherent <b>unsaturation</b> due to metabolic use of oxygen, followed by a constant rate limited by oxygen partial pressure of the breathing gas. The period of constant decompression rate is also limited by the allowable maximum oxygen fraction, and when this limit is reached, decompression rate slows down again as the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced. The procedure remains experimental as of May 2016. The goal is an acceptably safe reduction of overall decompression time for a given saturation depth and gas mixture.|$|E
25|$|The safe rate of {{decompression}} from a saturation dive {{is controlled}} by the partial pressure of oxygen in the inspired breathing gas. The inherent <b>unsaturation</b> due to the oxygen window allows a relatively fast initial phase of saturation decompression in proportion to the oxygen partial pressure and then controls the rate of further decompression limited by the half-time of inert gas elimination from the slowest compartment. However, some saturation decompression schedules specifically do not allow an decompression to start with an upward excursion. Neither the excursions nor the decompression procedures currently in use (2016) have been found to cause decompression problems in isolation, but there appears to be significantly higher risk when excursions are followed by decompression before non-symptomatic bubbles resulting from excursions have totally resolved. Starting decompression while bubbles are present appears to be the significant factor in many cases of otherwise unexpected decompression sickness during routine saturation decompression.|$|E
25|$|B.A. Hills and D.H. LeMessurier {{studied the}} {{empirical}} decompression practices of Okinawan pearl divers in the Torres Strait and observed {{that they made}} deeper stops but reduced the total decompression time compared with the generally used tables of the time. Their analysis strongly suggested that bubble presence limits gas elimination rates, and {{emphasized the importance of}} inherent <b>unsaturation</b> of tissues due to metabolic processing of oxygen. This became known as the thermodynamic model. More recently, recreational technical divers developed decompression procedures using deeper stops than required by the decompression tables in use. These led to the RGBM and VPM bubble models. A deep stop was originally an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm. There are also computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops, but these algorithms and the practice of deep stops have not been adequately validated.|$|E

Fourier transform infrared analysis indicates a loss of carbonyl functionalities with increasing plasma power, and Raman microscopy shows C£C double bonds in all plasma films. The methacrylate-like plasma films are found to be heterogeneous with a volatile and a cross-linked fraction observed by thermogravimetric analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals a low glass transition temperature and a characteristic residual reactivity of the coatings. The effect of precursor carbon double bond <b>unsaturations</b> on the specific plasma deposition rate (k 0) and thermal properties of plasma deposited methacrylate-like films is assessed in this work. A significant increase in the plasma deposition rate with increasing number of precursor C£C bonds is found.

40|$|International audienceThere {{are many}} {{different}} ways to convert biomass into liquid fuels, mostly referred to as bio-oils. This paper presents the analysis of bio-oils produced by hydrothermal liquefaction and fast pyrolysis of beech wood. Both processes have a wide panel of parameters that can be optimised influencing the oil quality. Results of the analysis show that both oils have high acidities. Iodine values indicate {{a high degree of}} <b>unsaturations.</b> These two qualities seem to be inversely proportional in the case of pyrolysis oils. In the case of hydrothermal conversion, additives to adjust the pH such as sodium hydroxide increase oil yields, lower its viscosity but do little to further improve the quality of the oils. For pyrolysis oils, increasing the severity does reduce acidity but at the expense of more <b>unsaturations</b> and a loss in yield. The results show that without extensive upgrading or refining, commercial fuel standards cannot be met. Specific norms and standards are being elaborated for pyrolysis used in specific installations. This paper shows how detailed analysis can help to optimise process parameters with an objective that goes beyond the mass or energy yield. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
