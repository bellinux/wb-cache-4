40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study charge {{transport}} in organic semiconductors. We {{do this by}} focusing on the physical characterization of disordered organic field-effect transistors. It will be made clear that the disorder in the polymer films is crucial for the interpretation of the data. The field-effect transistor geometry allows variation of the charge carrier density in the semiconductor, without the presence of counter ions. Therefore, the transistor allows a rather clean study of the charge transport in organic semiconductors {{as a function of the}} charge carrier density and temperature. In the experiments we find that the organic transistors are in several respects not comparable to silicon MOSFETs. Therefore, in this thesis we redefine and re-evaluate basic transistor parameters, such as the threshold voltage, the field-effect mobility, the contact resistance and the dopant density. Subsequently, we study the charge transport as a function of charge density, temperature and electric field, giving insight into the charge transport mechanism. Based on our observations we propose as the main charge transport mechanism: multiphonon hopping of polaronic charge carriers in a Gaussian density of states. We investigate the electrical stability of the polymer layer in metal-insulator-semiconductor diodes, where we determine and analyse the dopant density changes as a function of oxygen and light exposure. The presence of contact resistances in the transistors is addressed by analysing the scaling behavior of the electrical characteristics as a function of the transistor channel length, and an empirical relation between the contact resistance and the charge carrier mobility in the polymer layer is observed. Finally, we discuss why typically only <b>unipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> behavior is observed experimentally, and we demonstrate ambipolar transistor behavior in organic field-effect transistors based on blends of organic semiconductors and on low band gap organic semiconductors.

40|$|Graphene, {{with its}} {{two-dimensional}} nature and unique properties, has {{for over a}} decade captured enormous interests in both industry and academia. This work tries to answer the question of what would happen to graphene when it is subjected to various processing conditions and how this would affect the graphene functionality. The focus is placed on its ability to withstand different thin-film deposition environments with regard to the implementation of graphene in two application areas: as a diffusion barrier and in electronic devices. With single-layer graphene films grown in-house by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), four techniques among the well-established thin-film deposition methods are studied in detail: atomic layer deposition (ALD), evaporation, sputter-deposition and spray-deposition. And in this order, these methods span a large range of kinetic impact energies from low to high. Graphene is known to have a threshold displacement energy of 22 eV above which carbon atoms are ejected from the lattice. Thus, ALD and evaporation work with energies below this threshold, while sputtering and spraying may involve energies above. The quality of the graphene films undergone the various depositions is mainly evaluated using Raman spectroscopy. Spray deposition of liquid alloy Ga-In-Sn is shown to require a stack of at least 4 layers of graphene in order to act as an effective barrier to the Ga diffusion after the harsh spray-processing. Sputter-deposition is found to benefit from low substrate temperature and high chamber pressure (thereby low kinetic impact energy) so as to avoid damaging the graphene. Reactive sputtering should be avoided. Evaporation is non-invasiveness with low kinetic impact energy and graphene can be subjected to repeated evaporation and removal steps without losing its integrity. With ALD, the effects on graphene are of different nature and they are investigated in the field-effect-transistor (FET) configuration. The ALD process for deposition of Al 2 O 3 films is found to remove undesired dopants from the prior processing and the Al 2 O 3 films are shown to protect the graphene channel from doping by oxygen. When the substrate is turned hydrophobic by chemical treatment prior to graphene transfer-deposition, a <b>unipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> behavior is obtained...|$|E

The ambipolar properties of graphene {{provide opportunities for}} increased functionality in unconventional circuit architectures. In this dissertation, I describe the fabrication process of graphene devices, including the optical and Raman spectroscopic characterization and electron-beam lithography. The different electrical characteristics of the single-layer and bilayer graphene field-effect devices reflect differences in the electron band structures of the two systems.

An important issue for high-frequency and analog applications is the low-frequency noise, which up-converts and contributes to the phase noise of the systems.

The device exposure to different gases results in appearance of characteristic peaks in the noise spectral density. The latter can be utilized for selective gas sensing with graphene.
