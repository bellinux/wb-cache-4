5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn {{features}} six humanoid {{races for}} players {{to choose from}} when creating a character. Each race has two subdivisions and males and females of all races are available, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original release.|$|E
5|$|In birds, {{the main}} arteries taking blood {{away from the}} heart {{originate}} from the right aortic arch (or pharyngeal arch), <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mammals where the left aortic arch forms {{this part of the}} aorta. The postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The {{songs are}} {{performed}} live with telephone lines {{open for the}} first round of voting; two songs with least votes do not qualify to the second round. The top 5 battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round - the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen.|$|E
50|$|Equitable {{relief was}} not available, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> , as <b>the</b> {{responsible}} authorities {{were not found}} to have played an affirmative part in any unconstitutional deprivations.|$|R
50|$|Each round {{also has}} a simple musical background, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> any of <b>the</b> {{previous}} Pac-Man games.|$|R
50|$|A dash can be {{used instead}} of a comma to emphasise {{separation}} words and clauses. Note that <b>in</b> example 2, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> English, <b>the</b> end of the appositive is unmarked in Slovene.|$|R
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 20 in a stage. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> better known points classification in the Tour de France, the type of stage {{had no effect on}} what points were on offer– each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25points, second place earned 22points, third 20, fourth 18, fifth 16, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 20th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints; three points for crossing the sprint line first, two points for second place, and one for third.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 in a stage. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> better known points classification in the Tour de France, the type of stage {{had no effect on}} what points were on offer – each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25points, second place earned 20points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.|$|E
5|$|Psionic combat {{from the}} {{original}} 1994 game is retained, but some gameplay features of the original have been removed or adapted. The time units system, the always-visible grid map and the inventory system of the original have been removed. The initial mission phase of disembarking from the transport has also been removed – missions now begin with troops deployed outside the craft. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1994 game, only one XCOM base exists, the location of which is chosen {{at the beginning of}} the game.|$|E
3000|$|<b>Unlike</b> humans, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pig the iliac vessels born {{separately}} from the aorta, {{there is not a}} common vessel. (Figure 3) [...]...|$|R
2500|$|That {{which is}} called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called ljósálfar but the dökkálfar [...] dwell down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earth, and they are <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> appearance, but by far more <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> nature. <b>The</b> Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.|$|R
25|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> {{previous}} years, <b>the</b> {{government did}} not require political parties to apply for permits to hold press conferences.|$|R
5|$|Republican Foster A. Dunlap had won {{the office}} in 1953, {{making it one of}} the few his party {{controlled}} in the city. The party renominated him without opposition. Democrat Alexander Hemphill was the organization-backed candidate, and he defeated political outsider George Glick without difficulty. Hemphill, who had worked with reformers in the campaigns that ultimately defeated the Republican organization in 1951, was a lawyer with a long history of involvement in Democratic politics. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district attorney's race, the Democrats were united on the choice for city controller and Clark and Dilworth both publicly endorsed Hemphill. The result was a solid victory for the Democrats as Hemphill was elected by a thirteen-point margin.|$|E
5|$|The {{measure and}} weight {{systems for the}} large {{mainland}} part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the Italian Peninsula and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries' weight in the unified system was {{essentially the same as}} that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the ounce was divided in 10drachms, rather than the usual8. The scruple, like in Venice but <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Romance region, was divided into 20grains. The existence of a unit called aureo, the equivalent of 1½ dramme, is interesting because 6 aurei were 9 dramme. In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an aureo would have been ⅙ of an ounce.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders were awarded points for finishing {{in the top}} ten in a stage. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of all stages were awarded {{the same number of}} points. Points were also won in intermediate sprints; three points for crossing the sprint line first, two points for second place, and one for third. The leader of the points classification was awarded a green jersey.|$|E
3000|$|... was {{approximately}} 0.07. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{case of the}} YSZ thin-film, the XPS spectra corresponding to an under-stoichiometric ZrO 2 did not appear, <b>unlike</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zirconia thin-film.|$|R
30|$|The fuel {{providers}} interviewed generally {{expect a}} high MGO share, considering that HFO would be banned in ECAs. LNG {{was seen as}} a potentially viable option on structured and regular lanes, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> tramping. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> short run, fuel providers expect a shift from HFO to MGO rather than to LNG. They also point out that low-sulphur fuel can cause ship engines to break down due to insufficient lubrication.|$|R
30|$|We find bounds for a Gronwall-Bihari type {{inequality}} for {{piecewise continuous}} functions. <b>Unlike</b> works <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prior literature, here we consider inequalities involving singular kernels {{in addition to}} functions with delays.|$|R
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} game, players control Nicole Collard {{for selected}} game sections. Besides the new character artwork by Gibbons during conversations, the Director's Cut {{also features a}} new first person view for certain puzzles. In the DS version, there is no spoken dialogue, only subtitles. A version of the Director's Cut for iPhone and iPod Touch was released on January 20, 2010. In May 2010, a version with higher resolution and a digital comic was released on the iPad. A PC version was released on August 27, 2010 on various digital distribution services. An Android version, which is an enhanced version of the iPhone version, was released on Google Play on June 28, 2012. The Wii and Nintendo DS versions of the Director's Cut are available only in stores.|$|E
5|$|With four {{consecutive}} victories after the loss, including {{a win over}} then-No.16 Virginia, the Hokies won the Coastal division and secured a bid to the 2007 ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville, Florida. There, they faced a rematch with Boston College, champions of the Atlantic Division. As in the previous matchup, defense dominated, but <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earlier matchup, Matt Ryan was unable to seize the victory. Two fourth-quarter interceptions by Virginia Tech sealed the Hokie win and an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl game.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} Baron sat {{to hear a}} case, with {{convention}} insisting on a maximum of four Barons after the rule of Edward IV; as a mere convention, it was occasionally broken. When one Baron was ill or otherwise unable to sit it was felt appropriate to appoint a fifth, as in 1604 when Baron Sotherton was ill, and in 1708, when Baron Smith was called to Edinburgh to be a temporary Chief Baron of the Scottish Exchequer. In 1830 a fifth Baron was permanently added to relieve court congestion; at the same time, a fifth judge {{was added to the}} Court of Common Pleas and King's Bench. The First Baron was the Chief Baron of the Exchequer; if the Chancellor and Treasurer were unavailable, he {{was the head of the}} court. When he was also absent the Second Baron took charge, and so on; in one case in 1659, the Fourth Baron was the only judge available. The Second, Third and Fourth Barons were known as puisne Barons; initially treated as individual offices, after the time of James I the order was determined by the judges' seniority. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Court of King's Bench, the different positions did not equate to different degrees of power; each Baron had an equal vote in decisions.|$|E
50|$|His {{earliest}} {{paintings were}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Frans Floris but after 1600 he developed his own style which displayed classicising characteristics not <b>unlike</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work of Otto van Veen.|$|R
50|$|EMA 2007 was <b>the</b> {{television}} show <b>in</b> which Slovenia selected its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. The final {{took place in}} Ljubljana on February 3, 2007 (with the semi-finals broadcast February 1 and 2nd). <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> 2006, <b>the</b> winner was selected through televoting only.|$|R
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} has 38 diploid chromosomes. However, <b>unlike</b> others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{subfamily}} Tragelaphinae, the X chromosome and Y chromosome are compound and each is fused {{with one of}} two identical autosomes.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the client computer and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E
25|$|The split jury/televoting {{results were}} {{announced}} by <b>the</b> EBU <b>in</b> June 2010. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> 2009, only <b>the</b> split totals received by each country were given, not the full breakdown.|$|R
25|$|In Spanish, em dashes {{can be used}} to mark off parenthetical phrases. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> English, <b>the</b> em dashes are spaced like brackets, i.e., {{there is}} a space between main {{sentence}} and dash, but not between parenthetical phrase and dash.Una bandada de gorriones —algunos de ellos jóvenes— se posó y cantó.|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} structures under quasi-static load. We {{restrict the}} study to small strain and displacement and no particular shear behavior is considered, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> [7]. <b>The</b> relationship between cohesive and TLS models is analyzed. A one-dimensional equivalence is analytically first established. Then, these results are used to compare two-dimensional behaviors.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{transition}} to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of the state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 2009, Ubisoft {{released}} {{a special edition}} of The Shadow of the Templars for the Wii and Nintendo DS. According to Cecil, the Director's Cut came about thanks to a group of Broken Sword fans, who started an online petition begging him to bring the series to the Wii and DS. The game starts a day before the Parisian cafe explosion in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky, worked on visual references for the game; He also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. In the Director's Cut, Hazel Ellerby returns to voice Nicole Collard in the new sections, playing Nico again {{for the first time since}} the original game's release. Rolf Saxon, as in every sequel, also returns to voice George Stobbart. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original game, players control Nicole Collard for selected game sections. Besides the new character artwork by Gibbons during conversations, the Director's Cut also features a new first person view for certain puzzles. In the DS version, there is no spoken dialogue, only subtitles. A version of the Director's Cut for iPhone and iPod Touch was released on January 20, 2010. In May 2010, a version with higher resolution and a digital comic was released on the iPad. A PC version was released on August 27, 2010 on various digital distribution services.|$|E
5|$|Peasant {{society is}} much less {{documented}} than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed {{for a wide variety}} of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.|$|E
50|$|College athletes, <b>unlike</b> players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL, are not {{permitted}} by the NCAA to be paid salaries. Colleges are only allowed to provide non-monetary compensation such as athletic scholarships that provide for tuition, housing, and books.|$|R
50|$|Also, <b>unlike</b> {{previous}} games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series, Bomberman Jetters sports various modes and stages.|$|R
50|$|Borrowing from {{standard}} Euchre, this variation makes Jacks <b>the</b> highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of cards, just above Ace. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> Euchre, however, <b>the</b> left bower remains its original suit {{and is not}} considered a trump.|$|R
