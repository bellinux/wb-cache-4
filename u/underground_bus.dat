5|$|International District/Chinatown station, {{the southernmost}} tunnel station, is {{partially}} open-air and located immediately below a public plaza at Union Station. The station has connections to Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail at King Street Station a block to the west, accessible through the Weller Street Bridge, {{as well as}} the First Hill Streetcar on Jackson Street, stopping east of 5th Avenue South. Other attractions near the station include CenturyLink Field to the west and Uwajimaya a block to the southeast. South of the station, the light rail tracks, and bus lanes are separated by railway signals at an <b>underground</b> <b>bus</b> layover and staging area next to the tunnel comfort room for bus drivers. The southern portal of the tunnel is located under the intersection of Airport Way and 5th Avenue South at the western terminus of the Interstate 90 express lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. Light rail trains and southbound buses continue from the tunnel in separated lanes on the SODO Busway, while eastbound buses use a ramp that merges with the Interstate 90 express lanes that will be retrofitted for the East Link light rail service in 2023.|$|E
5|$|Like {{with many}} large {{cities in the}} United States, Denver’s CBD and the {{adjacent}} neighborhoods were blighted {{with the presence of}} many open parking lots in the 1970s and 80’s. Recent focus to redevelop these open lots and increase density/activity in the city’s core have been hugely successful as many of these lots are today being turned into large residential, retail and commercial developments. This is especially true around the newly redeveloped and highly popular Union Station area in Denver’s LoDo (Lower Downtown) neighborhood. What used to be open land, parking lots, warehouses and rail yards as recently as {{the turn of the century}} is now several city blocks of new residential and commercial buildings as well as a new RTD <b>underground</b> <b>bus</b> terminal, rail platforms/pavilions and a park. There are also improved pedestrian friendly connections to the RiNo (River North), Five Points, Auraria and Highland neighborhoods from the new development. Historic Union Station itself has been fully renovated and turned back into a travel and activity hub. It now includes the Denver Amtrak station, a new boutique hotel and several restaurants, bars & shops all centered on the large Great Hall inside and a public plaza outside along Wynkoop Street. Starting in April 2016 the University of Colorado A-Line commuter train began service directly connecting Union Station and downtown Denver to Denver International Airport and the airport's new 500+ room Westin Hotel & conference center.|$|E
25|$|The centre was {{the result}} of many design iterations, some of them being {{substantially}} larger and including an <b>underground</b> <b>bus</b> terminal and a large underground car park. Political concerns and cost implications meant that those concepts did not proceed. However, {{at the time of its}} inception in the early 2000s the centre was still Auckland's largest transport project ever, built to move rail access closer to the city's CBD and help boost Auckland's low usage of public transport. It is one of the few underground railway stations in the world designed for use by diesel trains.|$|E

25|$|Other buses {{depart from}} stops on {{surrounding}} streets, {{some of which}} are up to a block away from the station. The lack of more integrated bus facilities {{has been the subject of}} criticism, particularly due to the fact that the original design for the transport centre included an <b>underground</b> <b>bus</b> station, which was cut from the final design due to costs and the bus operators' preference for above-ground bus facilities. Until early 2016, buses arrived at and departed from Queen Street in front of the station building, but that portion of Queen Street is currently closed to vehicular traffic while trench works for the City Rail Link take place.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1960s, a {{large part}} of the town centre was redeveloped to designs by Bernard Engle (now tp bennett + Engle) under the {{direction}} of Fred Pooley, who prepared the general plan for public inquiry in 1962. The projected provided a new shopping centre, bus station, and linking with the new County Hall. The new town centre was tiered, with an <b>underground</b> <b>bus</b> station and market, an open ground level pedestrian square around which were larger shops and a cafeteria built high on stilts, and above, a three floored department store. While this form of town planning is often scorned today, at the time it provided exactly what was required by its consumers, greater shopping choices with easy access and convenient public transport all in a modern environment contrasting with the war time building restrictions which had lingered, in Britain, until the previous decade.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Newcastle was {{positioned}} ninth {{in the retail}} centre expenditure league of the UK. There are several major shopping areas in Newcastle City Centre. The largest {{of these is the}} Eldon Square Shopping Centre, one of the largest city centre shopping complexes in the UK. It incorporates a Debenhams store as well as one of the largest John Lewis stores in the UK. This John Lewis branch was formerly known as Bainbridges. Newcastle store Bainbridge's, opened in 1838, is often cited as the world's first department store. Emerson Bainbridge (1817–1892), a pioneer and the founder of Bainbridges, sold goods via department, a new for merchant custom for that time. The Bainbridge's official ledgers reported revenue by department, giving birth to the name department store. Eldon Square is currently undergoing a full redevelopment. A new bus station, replacing the old <b>underground</b> <b>bus</b> station, was officially opened in March 2007. The wing of the centre, including the undercover Green Market, near Grainger Street was demolished in 2007 so that the area could be redeveloped. This was completed in February 2010 with the opening of a Debenhams department store as well as other major stores including Apple, Hollister and Guess.|$|E

2500|$|The {{heart of}} student {{activity}} at UBC Vancouver is the centrally located Student Union Building (SUB), which houses offices of many AMS student clubs, {{over a dozen}} restaurants and cafés, a pub ("The Gallery"), a nightclub ("The Pit"), the 425-seat Norman Bouchard Memorial Theatre ("The Norm Theatre"), several shops, and a post office. The AMS runs {{the majority of the}} SUB's outlets and shops; however, UBC Food Services' recent addition of major corporate outlets has generated controversy. The SUB Art Gallery contains mostly students' works. An <b>underground</b> <b>bus</b> loop to replace the [...] "Grassy Knoll" [...] beside the SUB did not receive funding by Translink.|$|E
2500|$|Parking {{and traffic}} issues proved immensely vexing for the {{planners}} of Federal Triangle. The original L'Enfant Plan setting out {{the streets of}} Washington, D.C., still existed in the Federal Triangle area. Both C Street NW and D Street NW still ran from 15th Street NW to 15th Street NE. [...] Ohio Avenue NW ran in a northwest-southeast line from the intersection of D and 15th Streets NW to the intersection of B and 12th Streets NW (soon to be renamed as Constitution Avenue NW and 12th Street NW). Louisiana Avenue NW still ran in a southwest-northeast direction from 10th and B Streets NW to 7th and D Streets NW (along what is currently the diagonal portion Indiana Avenue NW). The McMillan Plan was developed before {{the widespread use of}} the automobile, and now the Board of Architectural Consultants had to decide how to accommodate the [...] "horseless carriage" [...] while also making Federal Triangle pedestrian-friendly. The Board began studying traffic issues in late 1927. A major study of parking needs and solutions was conducted in 1931, and traffic and parking patterns assessed again after the Department of Commerce building opened in early 1932. To achieve some of the traffic and parking goals, the east-west streets and diagonal avenues were eliminated, leaving only the north-south streets through the area, and 12th and 9th Streets NW were submerged in tunnels beneath the National Mall. In the first major change to the Board's [...] "final" [...] plans, the Grand Plaza was abandoned in favor of a parking lot. The Board considered a number of other solutions to the need to accommodate the more than 7,500 cars expected to arrive every day (including an <b>underground</b> <b>bus</b> terminal and underground parking garage under the Grand Plaza), but in the end only approved a small number of underground parking spaces beneath the Apex Building.|$|E
