25|$|The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 {{gave the}} Securities and Exchange Commission {{the power to}} {{regulate}} short sales. The first official restriction on short selling came in 1938, when the SEC adopted a rule known as the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> that dictated that a short sale could only be made {{when the price of}} a particular stock was higher than the previous trade price. The <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> aimed to prevent short sales from causing or exacerbating market price declines. In January 2005, The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted Regulation SHO to target abusive naked short selling. Regulation SHO was the SEC's first update to short selling restrictions since the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> in 1938.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of uptick-related short-sale {{constraints}} first on the Glosten-Milgrom Model of Sequential Trade and then empirically on the stocks in the Russell 3000 index used by the SEC in the pilot program created by Reuglation SHO. Finally, the effect of uptick constraints {{on the relationship between}} the short and put call ratios is studied through the use of impulse response functions. Both the general and alternative <b>uptick</b> <b>rules</b> are found to decrease informational efficiency in hypothetical financial markets, have no statistically significant positive effects on key financial market metrics, and the change in sign from negative to positive in the response of the put call ratio to a positive shock in the short ratio may be seen as evidence of the use of the options market to avoid short-sale constraints. ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} the SEC acted in 2007, two {{different}} types of price tests covered significant numbers of securities. The Nasdaq [...] "bid" [...] test, based on the national best bid, covered approximately 2,900 Nasdaq securities in 2005 (or 44 million short sales). The SEC's former <b>uptick</b> test (former <b>Rule</b> 10a-1), based on the last sale price, covered approximately 4,000 exchange-listed securities (or 68 million short sales)." ...|$|R
2500|$|Short sellers were {{blamed for}} the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Regulations {{governing}} short selling were implemented in the United States in 1929 and in 1940. [...] Political fallout from the 1929 crash led Congress to enact a law banning short sellers from selling shares during a downtick; this {{was known as the}} <b>uptick</b> <b>rule,</b> and this was in effect until 3 July 2007 when it was removed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC Release No. 34-55970). [...] President Herbert Hoover condemned short sellers and even J. Edgar Hoover said he would investigate short sellers for their role in prolonging the Depression. A few years later, in 1949, Alfred Winslow Jones founded a fund (that was unregulated) that bought stocks while selling other stocks short, hence hedging some of the market risk, and the hedge fund was born.|$|E
50|$|On March 28, 2008 Jim Cramer of CNBC {{offered the}} opinion {{that the absence of}} the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> harms the stock market today. He claimed that reintroducing the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> would help {{stabilize}} the banking sector.|$|E

5000|$|On July 3, 2008 Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, {{an adviser}} on mergers and acquisitions, said short-selling was at record levels {{and asked the}} SEC to take urgent action and {{reinstate}} the 70-year-old <b>uptick</b> <b>rule.</b> [...] On November 20, 2008, they renewed their call stating [...] "Decisive action cannot await ... a new S.E.C.

5000|$|On January 20, 2009, Ackerman {{received}} a letter from Chairman Cox - written the day he left the SEC - in which Cox said he supports the reinstatement of an <b>uptick</b> <b>rule.</b> The letter reads, “I have been interested in proposing an updated <b>uptick</b> <b>rule.</b> However, as you know, the SEC is a commission of five members. Throughout 2008 there was not a majority interested in reconsidering the 2007 decision to repeal the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule,</b> or in proposing some modernized variant of it. I sincerely hope that the commission, in the year ahead, continues to reassess this issue in light of the extraordinary market events of the last several months, with a view to implementing a modernized version of the uptick rule.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Gordon J. Alexander and Mark A. Peterson, in an {{academic}} study of the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule,</b> found [...] "the execution quality of short-sell orders is adversely affected by the <b>Uptick</b> <b>Rule,</b> even when stocks are trading in advancing markets. This is inconsistent {{with one of the}} three stated objectives of the rule, i.e., to allow relatively unrestricted short selling when a firm's stock is advancing so that the rule does not affect price discovery during such times." ...|$|E

5000|$|On October 17, 2008, the New York Stock Exchange {{reported}} a survey with 85% {{of its members}} being in favor of reinstating the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> with the dominant reason to [...] "help instill market confidence".|$|E
50|$|On March 10, 2009, the SEC and Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA), Chairman of the Financial Services Committee {{announced}} plans to restore the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule.</b> Frank said he was hopeful {{that it would be}} restored within a month.|$|E

5000|$|The SEC {{eliminated}} the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> on July 6, 2007. [...] The SEC concluded {{from the study}} cited above: [...] "The general consensus from these analyses and the roundtable was that the Commission should remove price test restrictions because they modestly reduce liquidity and do not appear necessary to prevent manipulation. In addition, the empirical evidence did not provide strong support for extending a price test to either small or thinly-traded securities not currently subject to a price test." [...] Commenting on the scrapping of the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule,</b> The Economist reported that [...] "short-sellers argue it was largely symbolic, and it remains in place at {{only a few of}} the world's big stock exchanges." ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{approaches}} require shorting stocks instead of buying them: the trader borrows stock from his broker and sells the borrowed stock, hoping that the price will fall {{and he will be}} able to purchase the shares at a lower price. There are several technical problems with short sales - the broker may not have shares to lend in a specific issue, the broker can call for the return of its shares at any time, and some restrictions are imposed in America by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on short-selling (see <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> for details). Some of these restrictions (in particular the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule)</b> don't apply to trades of stocks that are actually shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF).|$|E
5000|$|On October 6, 2008, Erik Sirri, {{director}} of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Trading and Markets, said that the SEC is considering bringing back the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule,</b> stating, [...] "It's something we have talked about {{and it may be}} something that we in fact do." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1938, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{adopted the}} <b>uptick</b> <b>rule,</b> more {{formally}} known as rule 10a-1, after conducting {{an inquiry into}} the effects of concentrated short selling during the market break of 1937. [...] The original rule was implemented when Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. was SEC commissioner.|$|E
5000|$|On February 24, 2010 the SEC {{adopted the}} {{alternative}} <b>uptick</b> <b>rule.</b> [...] The new rule {{does not apply}} to all securities. It is triggered when a security's price decreases by 10% or more from the previous day's closing price and is effective until the close of the next day.|$|E

5000|$|A {{paper from}} the New England Complex Systems Institute claims that they have found {{evidence}} that suggests the 2008 financial crisis was triggered by a [...] "Bear Raid" [...] market manipulation by short sellers against Citigroup late in 2007. The <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> was repealed in July, 2007, and the alleged bear raid took place in November, 2007.|$|E
5000|$|The rule {{went into}} effect in 1938 and was removed when Rule 201 Regulation SHO became {{effective}} in 2007. In 2009, the reintroduction of the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> was widely debated, and proposals for a form of its reintroduction by the SEC went into a public comment period on 2009-04-08. [...] A modified form of the rule was adopted on 2010-02-24.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, {{the purpose}} of the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> was {{described}} in a standard text [...] "It was not unusual to 1934 to discover groups of speculators pooling their capital and selling short {{for the sole purpose of}} driving down the stock price of a particular security to a level where the stockholders would panic and unload their fully owned shares. This, in turn, caused even greater declines in value." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>uptick</b> <b>rule</b> is {{a trading}} {{restriction}} that states that short selling a stock is only allowed on an uptick. For the rule to be satisfied, the short must be either {{at a price}} above the last traded price of the security, or at the last traded price when the most recent movement between traded prices was upward (i.e. the security has traded below the last-traded price more recently than above that price).|$|E
50|$|The failure {{set off a}} {{worldwide}} run on US gold deposits (i.e. the dollar), and forced the Federal Reserve {{to raise interest rates}} into the slump. Some 4,000 banks and other lenders ultimately failed. Also, the <b>uptick</b> <b>rule,</b> which allowed short selling only when the last tick in a stock's price was positive, was implemented after the 1929 market crash to prevent short sellers from driving the price of a stock down in a bear raid.|$|E
