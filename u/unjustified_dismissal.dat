40|$|Moving {{from the}} {{question}} “why everyone nowadays says that Italy needs {{to increase the}} women’ participation in the labour markets?”, the Author considers the different possible underlying reasons, the ethical case vs. the business case. As {{one of the goals}} targeted by the present Government is just the enhancing of women’ employment, the essay tries to evaluate if and how the recent policies engaged by the Labour Minister Fornero are consistent with this intention and differ from the ones of the past Government. The essay focuses on the recent Act n. 92 / 2012, a deep reform of the labour relationships {{as well as of the}} labour market, that directly or indirectly affects women. The main issues considered are the important changes in the dismissal law (Art. 18 Act. n° 300 / 1967, Statuto dei lavoratori), whose gender character is enlightened. According to the Author, the uncertain distinction between <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissals</b> and discriminatory dismissals, together with the increased dramatic differences in the protection grant by Act n° 92 / 2012 in the two cases, could reduce the real protection against dismissals based on grounds of sex or maternity, on one hand, and could fail to increase the women’ employment on the other hand...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the factors}} {{commonly}} addressed {{to explain the}} size structure of Italian firms, peculiarly characterised by {{a high number of}} small units, the existence of dimensional thresholds for many aspects of the Italian labour regulation has a key role. The paper overviews all labour rules, fixed by the Italian legislation or by main collective agreements, whose scope of application depends on dimensional thresholds. Items considered include: recruitment and hiring, union rights, individual and collective dismissals, non standard labour contracts, working hours and overtime, health and safety, education. The emerging summary shows a multiplicity of thresholds at different levels, which can vary in accordance to matters, sources of regulation, and sectors. Among these, the 15 employees threshold, although not exactly recognizable in statistical terms because of the variety and mutability of calculation’s criteria, represents an important line of demarcation between those firms where Union Rights are merely protected, and those where the Labour Chart – positively promoting them – is applied. This has relevant consequences for the strength of the juridical defence against <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissals</b> and the diffusion of collective bargaining at the plant’s level. While the effects of the former from the employer viewpoint are clear, those concerning collective agreements at the plant’s level cannot be evaluated in general terms as negative or positive, as they depend on the balance between costs, made of likely higher than average wage increases, and benefits, due to productivity improvements enhanced by more flexible organisational arrangements.

50|$|Employees, {{who wish}} to do {{something}} about a reduction in the terms of their employment {{as a result of an}} unjustifiable action by their employer, may file a personal grievance for disadvantage under section 103(1)b of the ERA. Usually, employees who are still working for their employer file a personal grievance for disadvantage. Employees who have been fired or who have quit, would file a personal grievance for <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal</b> or constructive dismissal, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|A {{dismissal}} following poor or unfair procedure {{will not}} necessary {{result in the}} Court finding that the dismissal was unjustified if the conduct was bad enough, but may result in the employee being awarded monetary compensation.

5000|$|In September the {{government}} brought the Jobs Act before Parliament, which provided for, among other things, {{the abolition of}} Article 18 of the Workers' Statute, which protected workers from <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal.</b> The proposal was heavily criticised by the largest Italian trade union, the General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) and its leaders Susanna Camusso and Maurizio Landini. Moreover, the left-wing of the Democratic Party, by then led by the former National Secretary Pier Luigi Bersani, criticised {{the government}} for the reform, threatening to vote against it.|$|E
50|$|Unemployment {{rates among}} youth in Brazil are {{generally}} double the rates among adults. As of 2011, {{there was an}} approximate 15.4% youth unemployment rate. Specifically, youth males have a 12.2% unemployment rate while females have a 19.8% unemployment rate. Unemployment Insurance (UI) stated in Brazil in 1986 and has existed {{in its present form}} since 1994. The insurance covers individuals in the private sector who lose their work through <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal,</b> including being laid-off. There are currently no requirements for an unemployed individual to search for work. An estimated 27% of Brazilian unemployment recipients are under the age of 21. This is partially because youth {{are less likely to be}} eligible for unemployment insurance.|$|E
50|$|Perón {{returned}} to Regiment 12 in Santa Fe the following February. There were labour conflicts {{at the north}} of the province, where the British Forestal Land, Timber and Railways Company faced the first local strike action. Employees asked for better wages, end of <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal,</b> and an eight-hour workday. The company rallied a band of thugs to attack the strikers, arranged blackouts and cut the water supply, and closed the single warehouse in the area. Perón arrived at the place and the laborers explained the events going on. He then met with the warehouse owner, who refused to open it, claiming that the timber company was the only authority in the area; so Perón resorted to a death threat in order to have the warehouse opened.|$|E
50|$|After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Cholokashvili {{returned}} to Georgia and {{became involved in}} Georgia's independence movement. He joined the National Democratic Party of Georgia and helped organize national cavalry units early in 1918. After Georgia declared its independence as a Democratic Republic in May 1918, Cholokashvili {{was put in charge}} of a squadron in the Cavalry Division of the People's Guard of Georgia commanded by Colonel Giorgi Khimshiashvili. In this capacity, Cholokashvili served in the campaigns against Armenia (December 1918 - January 1919), White Russian forces (February-October 1919), pro-Bolshevik rebels in Gori (November-December 1919), and in a raid in the Batumi Oblast (February-March 1920). In April 1920, Cholokashvili and several of his fellow officers were dismissed from service after they protested against what they saw an <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal</b> and arrest of their colleague on criminal charges.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009 Currie was sued by {{a former}} {{assistant}} editor of the Herald on Sunday for <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal.</b> Reporter Stephen Cook, who helped Currie launch the tabloid, was sacked in 2008 after two drug squad detectives visited the Herald on Sunday offices looking for him. Cook had reportedly been seen at an address, which was under police surveillance. On the day the case commenced Currie faced further scrutiny when the New Zealand Herald revealed examples of industrial espionage, including allegations he sent a reporter to the rival Sunday Star-Times' print site to obtain advanced copies {{in a bid to}} get stories for his own paper. The allegations were again reported in the Sunday News and Sunday Star-Times branded [...] "unprecedented spying". Currie, and APN, won the employment case after the court found Cook's dismissal was justified because he could not adequately explain why he was at the address under surveillance.|$|E

This article deal with the legal provisions concerning the termination of contract of employment by the employer, covering topics such as, the procedure of employment contract termination, notice to terminate the contract of employment, damages or compensation for unfair or <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal.</b> It offers a comparative overview of the procedures governing termination of employment in Albania and some industrialized countries of EU Member States.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the values transposed in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights {{and in the}} international sources that have inspired its contents. Special consideration {{is given to the}} right to protection against <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal</b> as set forth by Artiche 30 of the Nice Charter (CFREU), which is connected to Artiche 24 of the European Social Charter. This is the framework also underlying the recent Italian reforms, which firstly in 2012 (law n. 92 / 2012) and later in 2015, with the so called Jobs Act (leg. decree No. 23 / 2015), have been widened to soften protection from dismissal. The paper discusses some controversial issues stemming from analyzing the reform in the light of fundamental principles of guarantees against unlawful dismissal both in the European and supranational framework and puts forward the crucial role of balancing different values within the judicial function...|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} 150 {{years of our}} {{constitutional}} history, a valid grand jury indictment was deemed to be a mandatory prerequisite to a federal court 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of criminal subject matter jurisdiction. Under that view of the Grand Jury Clause, a defendant in a federal felony case could neither waive nor forfeit the right to grand jury indictment. A critical examination of the historical evidence reveals that the legal realist criminal procedure reform project of {{the early twentieth century}} advanced a pragmatic critique of the usefulness of the grand jury that culminated in a provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allowing for waiver of grand jury indictment for the purpose of facilitating a pre-indictment guilty plea, a procedural efficiency mechanism still used with regularity in federal courts today. The reformers were able to secure the waiver provision - despite serious constitutional concerns - by shaping a pro-efficiency modern understanding of the grand jury that obscured - but did not disprove - the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional significance. This Article argues that the reformers prompted the subversion of the mandate of the Grand Jury Clause, and burdened our legal consciousness with a diminished respect for the grand jury that affects our understanding of the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 s place in the constitutional structure to this day. This Article recovers the 2 ̆ 2 jurisdictional heritage 2 ̆ 2 of the grand jury and criticizes the modern understanding for its <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal</b> of the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional significance. The Article places blame for the continued confusion in the federal courts regarding the relationship of grand jury and jurisdiction squarely on the weak historical and logical underpinnings of the modern understanding. The Article also contextualizes the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional heritage within the broader contemporary discussion of 2 ̆ 2 pro-defendant 2 ̆ 2 formalist or originalist approaches to defining criminal procedural rights recently applied by the Supreme Court. Finally, the Article argues that the failure to account properly for the jurisdictional heritage of the grand jury frustrates the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 s fulfillment of its role in the constitutional design...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} «The disciplinary {{responsibility in}} the labour relationship with the public administration». Despite the differences with the system of private labour, related to peculiarities of public employment, the legislator is still following the trend of privatization, even after the reform of 2009. The first chapter analyses the legal basis of disciplinary power, its function and sources of law system regulating disciplinary responsibility. After the so-called “Brunetta Reform”, disciplinary power maintains a private nature, grounded on the employment contract. D. Lgs. no. 150 / 2009 has enlarged the institutions explicitly regulated by legislative provisions and narrowed the role of collective bargaining agreements. Nonetheless it has not caused {{a return to a}} public system of regulation. The disciplinary provisions do not directly aim the protection of public interests, but a private one, concerning the contract of employment. Also the direct effect of the “public employees behaviour code”, provided for by L. n. 190 / 2012, does not demonstrate that the code is aimed to protect public interests, as proved by a comparison with ethical codes of private enterprises. The second chapter concerns disciplinary infringements and sanctions. It starts with considerations about public employees’ contractual obligation, especially about due of loyalty, analysed in relationship with the provisions about incompatibility. The pros and cons of the new regulation on the publication of the disciplinary code on Public administration website are also underlined. The disciplinary infringements introduced by legislative provisions are analyzed in comparison with the ones provided by collective bargaining agreements, trying to give an interpretation with the regulation relevant with the principles of private employment contract. Sanctions provided by the legislator are still to be applied under the proportionality principle. They are aimed to re-establish the regular labour activity. The chapter is concluded by remarks on conservative sanctions and recidivism. The third chapter analyses some aspects of the disciplinary proceeding, with special reference to time limits and active subjects, in relationship with the function of the disciplinary power. On the basis of the new regulation on the time limits of the disciplinary procedure, the legislator has endorsed public managers with the responsibility of granting the effectiveness of the disciplinary system. Moreover, the research analyses the limits of collective bargaining agreements’ competence, and how they have performed these their function. The public administration maintains a discretionary power on sanctions. This is proved by the analysis of the discretionary conciliation on disciplinary sanctions (art. 55, par. 3, D. Lgs. no. 165 / 2001), facultative conciliation (art. 410 et seq C. P. C.) and arbitration. The last is still provided by legislation but cannot be established and regulated by collective bargaining agreement. Finally the fourth chapter deals with the disciplinary responsibility of the public managers, who have the assignment to wield the power on other public employees with no directive position. Disciplinary action is compulsory by law. However, some exceptions are provided on the basis of certain interpretations of art. 55 sexies, par. 3, D. Lgs. no. 165 / 2001. According to these ideas, managers are allowed not to apply sanctions under a justified reason, {{on the basis of their}} discretional evaluation. Nevertheless, a power whose use is provided as compulsory by law is not necessarily aimed to a public interest. In some cases the compulsory use of powers is provided also in the private sector. In this chapter pros and cons of the new rules on the application of conservative sanctions on public managers are emphasized, and some proposals are formulated in order to improve the effectiveness of the relevant legal regime. The thesis ends with some remarks about the dismissal of public managers, and about the protection in case of <b>unjustified</b> <b>dismissal,</b> considering also the debate about the application to the public employment of the art. 18, L. no. 300 / 1970, modified by L. no. 92 / 201...|$|E
