40|$|Biofuels have {{increased}} in popularity because of rising oil prices {{and the need for}} energy security. However, finding new raw <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>biodiesel</b> production is still challenging. The oil which comes from wastewater effluent generated in edible oil mills (EOM) can be considered a low-cost, widely available, emerging and interesting <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>biodiesel</b> production. This study tries to improve the coalescing filtration by using electrospun nanofibrous filters for oil recovery from the EOM effluent. In order to improve the separation efficiency of the filters, thermal treatments (90 oC to 150 oC) were used. Results indicate that oil recovery using coalescing filtration is a promising method for providing a new <b>source</b> <b>for</b> making <b>biodiesel</b> production more economical...|$|R

The global market <b>for</b> <b>biodiesel</b> has been growing rapidly {{during the past few}} years, and it is poised for explosive growth in the next years.
