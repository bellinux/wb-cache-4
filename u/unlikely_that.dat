5|$|In 1874, Parker was {{the caucus}} nominee of the Republican Party for a Missouri Senate seat.

5|$|In October 1974 Abu Nidal {{formed the}} ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council. In November that year a Fatah court {{sentenced him to}} death in {{absentia}} for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas. Seale writes that it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, {{but it was clear}} that he had become persona non grata. As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and a lump sum of $3–5 million.|$|E
5|$|Ipswich's record home {{attendance}} is 38,010 for a sixth round FA Cup match against Leeds United on 8 March 1975. With {{the introduction of}} regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> {{the saga}} writers had {{accurate}} information on {{details of the}} battle beyond the sparse accounts in the surviving poems.

5|$|Jack {{encounters}} {{his future}} wife, Sarah (Julie Bowen), who has arrived in his emergency room after a car crash. Jack saves Sarah's life, but {{goes on to}} tell her that due to spinal cord injury, it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Sarah will regain the ability to walk.|$|E
5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant {{would be an}} individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{battle of}} Salamis {{is not well}} {{described}} by the ancient sources, and it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across {{the width of the}} straits.

5|$|When {{the park}} was proclaimed, land zoning {{regulations}} allowed existing mining prospecting rights to continue. These rights were restricted to previously mined areas; this coupled with further restrictions imposed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service Act (1972) make it <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> mining will occur in the future.|$|E
5|$|A later popular Polish legend {{related to}} the history of the Polish {{coronation}} weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale of the Golden Gate of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Bolesław's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200years later. It is of course possible, however <b>unlikely,</b> <b>that</b> Bolesław notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend.|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
5|$|According to Tough, it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the {{avoidance}} of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as radio waves {{could be used to}} communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.|$|E
5|$|After {{shearing}} ewes {{are typically}} placed in well sheltered paddocks that have good feed and water. Attention to ewes that are lambing {{varies according to}} the breed, size and locations of properties. Unless they are stud ewes it <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> they will receive intensive care. On stations with large paddocks there is a policy of non-interference. On other properties the mobs are inspected by stockmen at varying intervals to stand cast ewes and deal with dystocia. Producers also sometimes quietly drift pregnant ewes away from ewes that have already lambed, {{in order to prevent}} mis-mothering.|$|E
