25|$|One of {{the better}} {{documented}} cultural norms that augment gender disparities in health is the preference for sons. In India, for instance, the 2001 census recorded only 93 girls per 100 boys. This is a sharp decline from 1961, {{when the number of}} girls per 100 boys was nearly 98. In certain parts of India, such as Kangra and Rohtak the number of girls for every 100 boys can be as low as in the 70s. Additionally, low female to male numbers have also been recorded in other Asian countries – most notably in China where, according to a survey in 2005, only 84 girls were born for every 100 boys. Although this was a slight increase from 81 during 2001–2004, it is still much lower than the 93 girls per 100 boys in the late 1980s. The increasing number of unborn girls in the late 20th century has been attributed to technological advances that made pre-birth sex determination, also known as prenatal sex discernment, such as the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>test</b> more affordable and accessible to a wider population. This allowed parents who prefer a son to determine the sex of their unborn child during the early stages of pregnancy. By having early identification of their unborn child's sex, parents could practice sex-selective abortion, where they would abort the fetus if it was not the preferred sex, which in most cases is that of the female.|$|E

Cholecystokinin also stimulates the flow of bile and causes the gall bladder to contract and thus determine if the gall bladder is emptying properly. It also affects the esophageal sphincter and the sphincter of Oddi by reducing contraction as well as increasing motility (movement) of the stomach and intestine. The CCK test may be administered in conjunction with an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>test</b> to visually monitor gall bladder contraction.

40|$|Background: Ultrasound {{technology}} {{is generally considered}} to be reliable and widely used by physicians today. Therefore, given the efficacy and popularity of the technology, the need for quality ultrasound education is evident. Ultrasound training for undergraduate medical students has been increasingly incorporated into school curriculums, but the teaching methods can vary significantly among medical schools. Among many different choices, one effective teaching model was proposed which added hands-on ultrasound experience on live patients that was supervised by radiologists in the last clinical year. Methods: A 2 -week radiology elective course was offered for 6 th-year medical students at Burapha University Hospital, Chonburi, Thailand in the academic year 2014. Fourteen medical students participated in the elective course. Additionally, students who chose radiology as their elective were provided an ultrasound experience on live patients in real-life clinical settings. All 6 th-year medical students then completed a 25 -ultrasound image quiz, and completed a questionnaire {{at the end of the}} academic year. The <b>ultrasound</b> <b>test</b> scores were compared between the elective and nonelective students. The students' background characteristics were determined by a grade point average and the ultrasound experience was determined by the number of scans. These were collected, and analyzed to establish their relationship with the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>test</b> scores. The students' opinions were also surveyed. Results: Fourteen medical students participated in the elective course. The <b>ultrasound</b> <b>test</b> scores in the elective group were significantly higher than those in the nonelective group (p= 0. 013). The students' background characteristics and ultrasound experience had no significant relationship with the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>test</b> scores. Conclusion: By adding hands-on ultrasound experience using live patients proctored by radiologists for final year medical students, in the space of 2 weeks, an effective ultrasound learning model for undergraduate medical students can be provided.

40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} applying an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>test</b> to evaluate {{the ability of a}} powder to interact with a solvent and thus to predict the reconstitution behavior of powders. The <b>ultrasound</b> <b>test</b> consisted of using a probe immersed in a stirring tank to monitor the ultrasound attenuation parameter when powder particles were dispersed in a solvent and to calculate a relaxation time. Analysis of the ultrasound signal and images obtained in the course of dispersion of a native phosphocaseinate dairy powder in various solvents under stirring allowed us to establish that the time required by the ultrasound attenuation parameter to relax is strongly associated with the time required by the solvent to penetrate primary particles. It was also shown that this step is of crucial importance in the dissolution mechanism as it precedes the fragmentation phase, identified as the rate-limiting step affecting the dispersion of the primary particles constituting the agglomerate. The reliability of the ultrasound evaluation to classify powders according to their reconstitution ability was then shown by comparing the ultrasound relaxation times obtained for various milk powders (pure native phosphocaseinate ([NPC]), pure whey protein isolate (WPI), mixture of (NPC/lactose) and mixtures of (NPC/WPI) stored under various conditions) with the rehydration times required to transform the powders into solutions (rehydration test). A static light scattering technique was used to determine particle size changes during rehydration tests and to calculate rehydration times. Classification of dairy powders according to their relaxation times (<b>ultrasound</b> <b>test)</b> and rehydration times (rehydration test) was in good agreement. The acoustic test was demonstrated to be effective in tracking solvent interactions, making it possible to assess the ability of a solvent to bind with the primary particle, and thus revealing it to be a powerful tool to evaluate the ability of a powder (and not only dairy powders) to disperse in a solvent...|$|E

40|$|Prestressed constructions {{have been}} {{extensively}} used since the 1950 s for infrastructure and large-span constructions. During maintenance renovation and after events causing damages, {{it is often}} important to know the current stress on the prestressed steel elements of the structure, such as strands or cables. Limited access can often be provided. Then a nondestructive assessment of the current stress is possible. However, several points {{have to be taken}} into account before micromagnetic or <b>ultrasound</b> <b>testing</b> methods can be used for determining the current stress value. For both methods, the determination of quantitative values requires a prior calibration. Micromagnetic measurements were performed with the micromagnetic multiparameter microstructure and stress analysis approach developed by Fraunhofer IZFP. It has different sensitivities for microstructure and stress state, but disturbing influences related to microstructure, geometrical effects, temperature, etc. also have {{to be taken into account}}. <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>testing</b> for stress determination is based on very accurate time-of-flight (TOF) measurements. The influence of texture of the steel also needs to be considered. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers allow the generation of shear horizontal wave modes, which are optimal to fulfil this requirement. A further advantage is that no couplant is needed and even a small lift off (e. g., due to a coating) is allowed. The paper explains how quantitative stress values can be determined based on micromagnetic and <b>ultrasound</b> <b>testing</b> TOF data recorded in the field and laboratory. Furthermore, a micromagnetic monitoring example is described. Two bundles of bridge cables of a suspension bridge were instrumented with micromagnetic sensors.
