5|$|Cancellara {{earned his}} first victory in 2004 at the Tour of Qatar. Cancellara won the race's fourth stage after attacking {{in the final}} {{kilometers}} of the race and then out-sprinting the riders {{who were able to}} keep pace with him to win the stage. His next victory came in the first stage of the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, where he won the opening stage's bunch sprint. <b>Up</b> <b>next</b> <b>on</b> the calendar for Cancellara was the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara crossed the line in 42nd place, just a little over two minutes after the winner Steffen Wesemann. The next weekend, he raced the Paris–Roubaix for the second time. Cancellara showed great form during the race and {{was a member of the}} four man group that was first to reach the finish line. He lost the sprint to the line and crossed the line in fourth. Cancellara's next success came in the Tour de Luxembourg, where he won the stage four individual time trial by fourteen seconds over the second-place finisher. He then went on to win his second Swiss National Time Trial Championship in late June. Cancellara's next success came at the Tour de France. He won the prologue around the Belgian city of Liege and took the first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Cancellara lost the lead after the second stage to Thor Hushovd. Cancellara did participate in both the time trial and road race at the Road World Championships. Cancellara performed well in the time trial and came in eighth place; he finished over two minutes behind the winner. He entered the men's road race four days later, but did not finish the course.|$|E

50|$|Philadelphia closer Mitch Williams came on to {{the pitch}} {{the bottom of the}} 9th with Philadelphia {{clinging}} to a 6-5 lead. After beginning the inning by walking Rickey Henderson, Williams tried to counter Henderson's speed by pitching out of a slide-step style of pitching delivery. Prior to Game 6 of the 1993 World Series, Williams never used the slide-step delivery in his career. This may have cut back on the velocity of the hard throwing Williams. The walk to Henderson was followed by a Devon White fly out and a single by Paul Molitor. Joe Carter came <b>up</b> <b>next</b> and, <b>on</b> a two strike pitch, he hit an inside pitch just over the left field fence, giving the Blue Jays a come-from-behind 8-6 victory, and the World Series crown.|$|R

50|$|Henke quickly got two {{strikes on}} the Game 5 hero, but Smith battled back {{to run the}} count full. On the eighth pitch of the at bat, Henke walked Smith to put the winning run on base.

Cabrera had {{recorded}} the game and series winning hit in the deciding game of the NLCS and Cox hoped he could come up big again. Henke once again went to eight pitches with Cabrera before he forced him to hit a hard line drive to left that Maldonado nearly lost before jumping to catch it.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the acts, there are three sequential difficulty levels: Normal, Nightmare, and Hell; completing the game (four Acts in the original or five Acts in the expansion) on a difficulty setting will open <b>up</b> the <b>next</b> level. <b>On</b> higher difficulties, monsters are stronger and may be resistant or immune to an element or physical damage, experience is penalized on dying, and the player's resistances are handicapped. However, better items are rewarded to players as they go through higher difficulties. A character retains all abilities and items between difficulties, and may return to a lower difficulty at any time.|$|R

He noted that tax evasion must be prevented to promote social justice.|$|R

All the staff were invited, and before we started our festive meal he would give a speech in two parts—in the first, he told us we had all done well but that we could have done better, and, in the second, he announced that we were at a crucial point for the coming year and that we had to take great care to avoid spoiling everything we had achieved <b>up</b> till then. <b>Next</b> <b>on</b> the programme were the eagerly-awaited skits, for which we were fortunate to have excellent film-making facilities and superb actors, not least among whom were Arnaud Wattiez and Jean-Luc Pouly.|$|R

Playing a Michigan State Spartans team that had just beaten Notre Dame a week earlier, the Hawkeyes turned the ball over four times and {{committed}} ten penalties in a 20 - 10 loss. However, with Michigan <b>next</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the schedule, things would get no easier for the Hawkeyes.

5000|$|<b>Next</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the {{chopping}} block is Amy Grant's early 90's hit [...] "Baby Baby." [...] The Eddies perform the song as if they're performing it during karaoke night at the local Ramada. Dc Talk's [...] "I Luv Rap Music" [...] sounds as though it's performed by a cheesy lounge act. In order to hit the girlishly high vocals of Stryper's [...] "Sing A Long Song," [...] The Eddies actually slowed the tape down and recorded the song at that speed.

2500|$|On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a {{photo shoot}} with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the cover.

Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had John remove his clothes and curl <b>up</b> <b>next</b> to Yoko <b>on</b> the floor. Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled <b>up</b> <b>next</b> to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and {{he looked like he was}} clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover.' I looked him in the eye and we shook on it." [...] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennonhe was shot and killed five hours later.|$|R
