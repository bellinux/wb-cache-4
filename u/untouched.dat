5|$|On 6 September 2013, Helsingin Sanomat {{reported}} that the previously largely <b>untouched</b> wreck of Pallada had been looted.|$|E
5|$|So {{far from}} {{insulting}} {{the bodies of}} the dead and wounded, they permitted them to lie <b>untouched,</b> till carried away; and none were stripped, as is too universally the case.|$|E
5|$|Schiller then showed demos of Infinity Blade III to {{demonstrate}} the A7's processing power and the device's camera using <b>untouched</b> photographs. The release of iOS 7 on September 18, 2013 was also announced during the keynote.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} Prithu is without female intervention. Thus being a ayonija ("born without (the participation) of the yoni"), Prithu is <b>untouched</b> by desire and ego and can thus control his senses to rule dutifully {{upholding}} Dharma.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the American landmass, {{which had}} been conquered by {{military}} force by Spain and Portugal, European missionaries encountered in Asia united, literate societies that were as yet <b>untouched</b> by European influence or national endeavour.|$|E
5|$|After much deliberation, Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna's apartment, {{where he}} murders {{her with an}} axe. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon {{the scene of the}} crime. Shaken by his actions, Raskolnikov manages to steal only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawn-broker's wealth <b>untouched.</b> Raskolnikov then flees and, due to a series of coincidences, manages to leave unseen and undetected.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah officially began {{breeding}} mares in February 2016, and {{was first}} bred to <b>Untouched</b> Talent, an 11-year-old mare owned by Coolmore, dam of Zayat's Bodemeister. Within {{the first two}} months of his breeding career, American Pharoah had about 80 mares in foal after approximately 100 breeding sessions. Notably, he has retained his kind disposition even as a breeding stallion.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the debts}} {{related to the}} costs for the {{construction}} of the building having been settled in the early-mid 19th century, and the church ceasing to exist 100 years later, the three acts of Parliament allowing trustees of the church to levy rates on properties in the parish for the purpose of settling those debts remained in force and <b>untouched</b> until the Law Commission proposed their repeal in July 2014, with a view to presenting recommendations to Parliament in 2015.|$|E
5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively <b>untouched</b> and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 Birmingham City Council {{decided to}} close the museum and to {{construct}} the brand new ThinkTank museum (since re-christened Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum) in nearby Digbeth. In 2001 the locomotive {{was moved to the}} Thinktank where it remains as at September 2017. It differs significantly from the other two preserved locomotives in that it represents the only <b>untouched</b> example of a British Railways Coronation locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to make {{minor changes to the}} film, mostly to the shower scene. In Britain, the BBFC {{requested}} cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left <b>untouched,</b> the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.|$|E
5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} <b>untouched</b> by the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, {{was one of many}} in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style, with coloured marbles.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{the early}} stained glass remains. In the west window of St John's Chapel, for instance, the medieval glass barely survived the {{destruction}} (said to {{have been caused by}} Oliver Cromwell's men). Most of the higher portions went <b>untouched,</b> but others were severely damaged. In some cases the windows were impossible to repair, and clear glass was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes. The Victorian stained-glass windows were created by some of the finest studios of that period.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the event, protests {{over the}} {{imprisonment}} of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim threatened {{to disrupt the}} race. The campaign group, known as Free Anwar, were reported in the media that they would use the Grand Prix {{in an attempt to}} bid for securing Ibrahim's release. However, the director of the campaign Raja Petra Kamarudin subsequently announced the event would be left <b>untouched.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of present-day Chesham grew between the railway {{station and the}} Old Town, leaving the {{architecture}} of the Old Town almost <b>untouched.</b> In June 2009 the Old Town and the present-day town centre were added to Historic England's Conservation Areas at Risk Register, although the local authority claimed that this was owing to a misunderstanding of its responses to English Heritage's questionnaire.|$|E
5|$|The {{site where}} the bones were found was largely <b>untouched</b> by paleontologists until around 1990, when {{excavations}} restarted. Remains of other dinosaurs, fish, turtles, and plants have also been found, including teeth belonging {{to a member of}} the Tyrannosauroidea. Other parts of H. missouriensis, including dental remains and part of a jaw, have also been found. The variety of faunal remnants found at the Chronister site suggest that a large body of water once existed close to the area.|$|E
5|$|Warburton was {{predominantly}} a farming village {{during the}} medieval period. The north western {{corner of the}} township {{was used as a}} deer park. Warburton grew as an agricultural town during the medieval period, and it remained almost <b>untouched</b> by the Industrial Revolution; this is reflected in the population change between 1801 and 1901, dropping from 466 to 403, with little variation {{at a time when the}} rest of Trafford was expanding rapidly.|$|E
5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only {{got as far as}} Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor any of their escorts were damaged; the former were hit by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were <b>untouched.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 10% of Lord Howe Island's forests {{have been}} cleared for agriculture, and another 20% has been disturbed, mostly by {{domestic}} cattle and feral sheep, goats and pigs. As a result, 70% {{of the island}} remains relatively <b>untouched</b> {{with a variety of}} plants and animals, many of which are endemic, some of which are rare or threatened. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. Endemism at the generic level includes the palms Howea, Hedyscepe and Lepidorrhachis, a woody daisy Lordhowea, the tree Negria, the leech Quantenobdella howensis, three annelid worm genera (Paraplutellus, Pericryptodrilus and Eastoniella), an isopod shrimp Stigmops, a hemipteran bug Howeria and a cricket Howeta.|$|E
5|$|An equestrian {{statue of}} the General was erected in Boulogne-sur-Mer; the statue was inaugurated on October 24, 1909, at a {{ceremony}} attended by several units from the Argentine military. The statue was erected through purely private initiative, {{with the support of}} national government of Argentina, the municipal council of Buenos Aires and a public funding campaign. The statue is 10m high, on a 4m by 6m base; it is well known to locals. Located on the beach, it was virtually <b>untouched</b> by the numerous bombings campaigns during both world wars.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, the Republican Guard, the Fedayeen Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively <b>untouched.</b> The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 53 {{begins with}} Gangleri asking {{if any of}} the gods will survive, and if there will be {{anything}} left of the earth or the sky. High responds that the earth will appear once more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, <b>untouched</b> by Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir once owned. Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted.|$|E
5|$|Columbia's {{infrastructure}} {{was relatively}} <b>untouched</b> by the Civil War. Missouri, {{as a slave}} state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority {{of the city was}} pro-Union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern; George Burke, a black man, was lynched in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} of the globe, including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands <b>untouched</b> by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{withdrawal}} from Gallipoli, the 23rd Battalion {{was moved to}} Lemnos Island, where they remained until January 1916 when they were transferred back to Egypt. At this time, the AIF was reorganised and expanded in preparation for future operations. Two new infantry divisions were formed from the experienced troops of the 1st Division who had deployed to Gallipoli {{at the start of}} the campaign, while a third division was raised in Australia from scratch. The 2nd Division was largely left <b>untouched,</b> so that it could complete its formation which had been interrupted by its deployment to Gallipoli. The 23rd subsequently spent the early months of 1916 rebuilding its strength and conducting further training in preparation for its transfer to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests <b>untouched</b> by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{the ride}} {{received}} a new {{coat of paint}} with Victorian-style architecture around the station. In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Giant Dipper was almost completely <b>untouched.</b> The ride was closed {{for about a month}} to be inspected. The park held a benefit for victims of the earthquake. In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event. The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously <b>untouched</b> by the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|In Besançon, the Catholics had {{executed}} Protestants {{for religious}} reasons since 1528. Despite the punishment, prosecution, and banning of Protestants in Besançon, Archbishop Antoine struggled {{to contain the}} spread of Protestant ideas. The preaching of William Farel, Theodore Beza and John Calvin had resulted in people converting to Protestantism; Protestant propaganda, religious gatherings, and iconoclastic attacks on Catholic imagery had also maintained the Protestant community in Besançon. On 1 March 1562, the murder of Huguenots in Wassy, France began the French Wars of Religion. By then, Besançon had become part of an independent republic protected by the Holy Roman Empire, which mostly <b>untouched</b> {{in the beginning of}} the conflict. Despite the oppression in Besançon, many French Protestant reformers continued to flock to the city.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2003, the TF Warrior {{returned}} to Afghanistan, relieving TF Devil from the 82nd Airborne Division for Operation Enduring Freedom IV. For more than 6 months, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the}} country such as Paktika Province, going places previously <b>untouched</b> by the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote {{regions of the country}} to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{newspapers}} cautioned {{about looking}} for an emigrating labor force in Japan, stating that their own country had large areas of available agricultural land that went <b>untouched.</b> A ball was planned in the king's honor by the Masonic Fraternity of Yokohama, which he bowed out of when he learned of the assassination of Alexander II of Russia. The Kalākaua group arrived in Kobe on March 18 for a sightseeing tour and lunch with the mayor. On March 22, they embarked on the steamship Tokio Maru bound for Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|Located to {{the right}} of the main altar and {{sanctuary}} is the side altar of St. Joseph. It was given to the cathedral by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and the donation was facilitated by Joseph Mary Sala, an expatriate living in Hong Kong who was from the nobility of Italy. It is adorned by the royal coat of arms of the House of Savoy; this conspicuous symbol of Italy was said to have helped the cathedral identify itself as Italian rather than British, and thus, remain <b>untouched</b> throughout the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, as the Kingdom of Italy and Empire of Japan were both signatories to the Tripartite Pact.|$|E
5|$|Manchester's {{buildings}} {{display a}} variety of architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The widespread use of red brick characterises the city, much of the architecture of which harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade. Just outside the immediate city centre is {{a large number of}} former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually <b>untouched</b> since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered {{to be one of the}} most important Victorian buildings in England.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them <b>untouched,</b> or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories <b>untouched.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rogers' {{expedition}} suffered further setbacks. An unidentified disease killed {{almost a}} hundred of his expedition members, while leaving the long-term residents nearly <b>untouched.</b> Two of the three navy vessels, having no orders to remain, left for New York. Ships sent to Havana to conciliate the Spanish governor there never arrived, their crew revolting and becoming pirates mid-voyage. Finally, the third naval vessel left in mid-September, its commander promising to return in three weeks—a promise {{he had no intention}} of keeping. Work on rebuilding the island's fortifications proceeded slowly, with the locals showing a disinclination to work.|$|E
