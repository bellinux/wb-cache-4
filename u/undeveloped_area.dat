5|$|Big Wapwallopen Creek {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{flooding}} in Rice Township and Wright Township. It is also a primary flooding source in Conyngham Township, Dorrance Township, Fairview Township, Hollenback Township, and Nescopeck Township. However, in Conyngham Township, a 100 year flood of the creek would only inundate a small and <b>undeveloped</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|The area {{falls into}} the domains of councils {{including}} Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and Mendip. Part of the area falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Most of the <b>undeveloped</b> <b>area</b> is within the Bristol/Bath Green Belt. Many of the villages {{date back to the}} time of the Domesday Book and there is evidence of human occupation since the Stone Age. There are hundreds of listed buildings with the churches being Grade I listed. The main commercial centre is Chew Magna.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} the border town of Dryden, NY38 {{emerges from the}} valley and becomes Dryden–Harford Road as it heads northwestward through a more low-lying but still <b>undeveloped</b> <b>area.</b> The highway gradually curves to the north toward the village of Dryden, where the route changes names to South Street upon {{entering the}} village limits. It continues north across Virgil Creek and past three blocks of homes to the commercial village center, where it intersects both NY13 and NY392. The latter begins here and heads off to the east while the former joins NY38 along North Street.|$|E

5|$|In Kingsbury, US4 and NY149 {{head through}} an open area dotted with farms and ponds. The routes proceed southward to a {{junction}} known as Baldwin Corner, where US4 and NY149 split. While US4 heads to the southeast, NY149 continues due south, paralleling the Champlain Canal to an area known as Smith's Basin. Here, NY149 turns east and crosses both a railroad line and the canal—which NY149 had been following since joining US4 in downtown Fort Ann—to enter the town of Hartford. Here, the route winds its way eastward through a rural, mostly <b>undeveloped</b> <b>area</b> of Washington County as it intersects several county roads {{on its way to}} the hamlet of Hartford.|$|E
5|$|From here to Finch Avenue, {{the freeway}} follows the {{boundary}} line between Toronto and Mississauga. It encounters the third multi-level junction along its length, with Highway409, which {{provides access to}} the airport {{as well as the}} southbound to eastbound movement that cannot be performed at the interchange with Highway401 to the south. Highway427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes. After crossing the Kitchener GO line, it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and beneath Rexdale Boulevard, Morning Star Drive, and Finch Avenue West, the first and last interchange with the route. The freeway bends slightly eastward, diverging from the Mississauga–Toronto boundary, and crosses the West Humber River where it drains from Claireville Reservoir. Approaching the fourth and final sprawling interchange, it crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan. It passes beneath Highway407 and crosses through an <b>undeveloped</b> <b>area</b> before terminating at its final interchange with Highway7. The mainline continues north as a four lane arterial road to Zenway Boulevard and is designated as York Regional Road99.|$|E
5|$|NY15A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY15 {{in the town}} of Springwater hamlet of the same name, also officially known as Springwater Hamlet, located {{on the east side of}} a large valley in southeastern Livingston County. The route heads northward as North Main Street, proceeding along the eastern base of the valley as it passes through the northern half of the community. Outside of the hamlet, NY15A enters a rural, <b>undeveloped</b> <b>area</b> dominated by dense forests to the east and a low-lying, slightly more open area to the west. As the route approaches the Livingston–Ontario county line, the lowlands give way to marshes, which in turn lead to Hemlock Lake at the county line. While in Ontario County {{in the town of}} Canadice, NY15A follows a more inland route to the east, passing through an isolated forest situated between Hemlock and Canadice Lakes. After , the highway reenters Livingston County near the northern end of Hemlock Lake.|$|E

5|$|NY38 {{proceeds}} out of Freeville, {{passing over}} Fall Creek and heading north along Groton Road through a lightly populated {{area of the}} town of Dryden. The route passes by a mixture of open fields, forests, and isolated homes {{on its way to the}} Dryden–Groton town line, where it meets the southern terminus of NY34B southeast of the hamlet of Peruville. NY38 parallels the Owasco Inlet into Groton and the village of the same name, becoming Peru Road at the southern village line. It continues north, following South and Main Streets through the densely populated village to an intersection with NY222's western terminus at Cortland Street. At this point, NY38 becomes Cayuga Street and winds its way northward along the Owasco Inlet and out of the village. Now known as Locke Road, NY38 heads the northwest through another rural, largely <b>undeveloped</b> <b>area</b> into Cayuga County.|$|E
5|$|SR 125 {{begins as}} the South Bay Expressway toll road at an {{interchange}} with SR 11 and SR 905, although the southbound roadway ends {{just to the}} north at Otay Mesa Road, the former alignment of SR 905. The route heads north through an <b>undeveloped</b> <b>area,</b> encountering its first toll plaza just before entering the city of Chula Vista. The freeway cuts through the Eastlake neighborhood of Chula Vista before leaving the city and turning to the northeast, passing through Sweetwater Summit Regional Park near Sweetwater Reservoir. SR 125 intersects with SR 54, where the tolled portion ends. SR 54 runs concurrently with SR 125 north to the Jamacha Road exit. SR 125 continues north again through the unincorporated area of La Presa. The freeway briefly enters Lemon Grove before intersecting with SR 94 and crossing into the city of La Mesa.|$|E
