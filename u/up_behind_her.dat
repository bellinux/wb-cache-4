5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> during the chaos, and pinches her leg {{to make it}} seem that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Ava and Andy {{are alone}} together, she lets the Acheri demon into the building, {{and uses a}} new ability to command it to kill him. After {{revealing}} to Sam that she has actually been in the town all the months she has been missing, killing off other psychic children that Azazel has sent there, she sets the Acheri demon on him. However, Jake sneaks <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> and uses his superhuman strength to break her neck, prompting the now free Acheri demon to flee. As Sam and Jake then start to leave the town, Jake attacks him out of distrust, but Sam gains the upper hand and apparently knocks him unconscious. However, as Sam is distracted by an arriving Dean and Bobby, Jake regains consciousness and fatally stabs him. Dean assures his brother that he {{will take care of}} him, but Sam dies in his arms.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Persano ordered another attack; four ironclads {{would force}} the harbor {{defenses}} at Vis while Regina Maria Pia {{and the rest of}} the fleet would attempt to suppress the outer fortifications. This second attack also proved to be a failure, but Persano decided to make a third attempt the next day. Regina Maria Pia and the bulk of the fleet would again try to disable the outer forts in preparation for the landing. Before the Italians could begin the attack, the dispatch boat [...] arrived, bringing news of Tegetthoff's approach. Persano's fleet was in disarray; the three ships of Admiral Giovanni Vacca's 1st Division were three miles to the northeast from Persano's main force, and three other ironclads were further away to the west. Persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with Vacca's, first in line abreast formation, and then in line ahead formation. Regina Maria Pia initially was the last ship in the line, though Varese later joined <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Depend upon it, a gay young widow {{needs no}} {{kindness}} from me, and had better {{not have it}} from you,' said my mother, getting <b>up</b> from <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> urn and walking off, followed by my father.|$|R
6000|$|Now although, as I suppose, she {{had neither}} seen nor heard me, for I came <b>up</b> from <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> Sihamba {{did not start}} or cry out as any other woman would have done; {{she did not even}} turn to look at me as she {{answered}} in a clear and steady voice: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{motion was}} smooth and easy now. The waves were much {{higher than in the}} shelter of the bay, but they were running easily and regularly, in nearly the same line the boat was following. Coming <b>up</b> threateningly <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> they lifted the stern high into the air, passing gently under her, hurrying her along as she was on the crest, and then passing on ahead and {{dropping}} her gently down into the hollow.|$|R
2500|$|Similar {{to other}} dwarf antelopes, Kirk's dik-diks exist in monogamous pairs on territories. Territories are marked with dung and urine that are {{deposited}} in a ritual that is performed to help helps maintain pair bonds. During the ritual, the female will excrete, {{followed by the}} male, which samples the female's urine stream to check her reproductive capacity. He paws over and then marks his dung and urine over her deposit. Finally, the pair marks nearby twigs with secretions from their pre-orbital glands. Kingon 1982 states that, [...] "The male courts the female by running <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> with his head and neck stretched and his muzzle pointing out in front. Copulation begins with the male standing on his hind legs behind the female and waving his forelegs at an acute angle to his own body in the air over her back". Copulation typically occurs anywhere between three and five times within a 9-hour period.|$|E
60|$|I {{ought to}} have remembered {{and told her that}} Ronny was going. She was just a little vexed because she thought I'd been fixing things <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> back.|$|E
60|$|Lindy set {{her lips}} with a mighty resolve to be silent. I heard some one coming along the gallery, and then I saw Nick's tall figure looming <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Bessy was {{now running}} almost before the wind. Every moment the great waves loomed <b>up</b> high <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> stern, and {{looked as if}} they would dash down upon her deck, but she slipped easily away. The clouds had broken up much now, but the wind had in no way abated. A gleam or two of {{sunlight}} made its way through the rifts of the clouds, and threw light green patches upon the gray and angry sea.|$|R
5000|$|The movie {{ends with}} Jenny and Amy in a park. Amy runs {{off into the}} woods calling [...] "Daddy, Daddy". Jenny follows her and finds Amy, who says her father has gone away. When Jenny bends down to pick Amy <b>up,</b> Carter appears <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> in a wig and a dress; Margo is now in control. Jenny holds Amy in her arms, {{oblivious}} to who is <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{got tired}} of it at last, {{but by that time}} I was so done up I couldn’t say a word. I just dropped on to a box and sat there getting my breath back while the skipper forgave ’is wife for ’er unjust suspicions of ’im—but told ’er not to do it agin—and the office-boy was saying I’d {{surprised}} even ’im. The last I saw of the lady-friend, the two lightermen was helping ’er to walk to the gate, and the two sailormen was follering <b>’er</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind,</b> carrying <b>’er</b> pocket-’ankercher and upberella." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To {{be sure he}} has,' {{retorted}} Mr. Dick, nodding {{his head}} gravely. 'Never came out, till last night! We were walking last night, and he came <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> again, and I knew him again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"And two men scalded thus {{explaining}} my hoots." [...] (The idea {{of telling}} me that!) [...] "Subsequently silly clergyman passenger ran <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> calling for joke, 'Friend, all is lost,' thus accounting very words."' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{on his way}} out he came <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and she was {{whistling}} [...] "Fisher's Hornpipe" [...] {{so loudly}} and clearly that all the piccolos in the world should have disjointed themselves and crept into their cases for shame.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after, {{we learn}} that Hess is a serial rapist at large in Los Angeles. His modus operandi is to gain entry {{to the home of}} a married woman whose husband is away by pretending to be there to repay money loaned by the husband. Once inside, he feigns a headache, pulls out a tin of aspirin, and asks the woman for water. While she is distracted by this errand, he sneaks <b>up</b> <b>behinds</b> <b>her,</b> and then assaults and rapes her. He leaves the tin of aspirin behind as his calling card, leading the police to call him [...] "The Aspirin Kid." [...] Leaving the scene of the first assault portrayed in the film, he is nearly hit by a car. The driver, who is a police detective named Culloran (Steve Cochran), gives him a lift, and the two engage in conversation. The rapist calls himself Arthur Garret, and as the two talk, he learns that Culloran is married, and sees his address on an {{envelope}} on the car seat. After getting out of Culloran's car, he writes down the name and address, and the word [...] "married," [...] foreshadowing his later rape of Culloran's wife.|$|R
50|$|At dinnertime, Bean again {{tries to}} beat his {{neighbour}} {{to the dining}} room by knocking on his door and then running off, only to find that the lift is out of order. Annoyed, he goes to take the stairs, but becomes even more annoyed when he gets stuck behind a slow-moving elderly lady with a crutch. Feeling unable to ask the lady to let him pass, he decides to go around to the other staircase, but becomes further annoyed when he somehow ends <b>up</b> stuck <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> again. He then contemplates pushing her, but stops himself when he hears a couple walking past.|$|R
6000|$|While {{they were}} thus employed, a tallish gentleman with a hook nose and black hair, {{dressed in a}} {{military}} surtout very short and tight in the sleeves, and which had once been frogged and braided all over, but was now sadly shorn of its garniture and quite threadbare--dressed too in ancient grey pantaloons fitting tight to the leg, {{and a pair of}} pumps in the winter of their existence--looked in at the door and smiled affably. Mrs Jarley's back being then towards him, the military gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to apprise her of his presence, and stealing <b>up</b> close <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> tapped her on the neck, and cried playfully 'Boh!' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{went ahead}} with Mrs. Chipperton, and Rectus and I followed, {{one on each side}} of Corny. Neither she nor her mother had yet spoken to us; but while we were going up the stairs, Corny turned to me, as I came <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and said: ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last she}} came to a little rustic gate, leading into a shadowy wood-lane. The gate was bound with willow withes, and, as Sara fumbled vainly at them with her chilled hands, a man's firm step came <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and Lige Baxter's hand closed over her's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Goss, you had best give in--" [...] began Sergeant Brown, when Tom, sneaking <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> {{snatched}} the stew pan from her grasp. As {{she turned on}} the boy, Carter ran in, and in a twinkle she was held and her hands were bound behind her. Then the crowd turned to Mumps.|$|E
60|$|Without a word, Pomona made {{a sudden}} turn, sprang <b>up</b> the steps <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and out upon the lobby, Euphemia and I close <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b> Around {{and down the}} steps we swept, from lobby to lobby, amazing the cloak-keepers and attendants, but {{stopping}} for nothing; down the grand staircase like an avalanche, almost {{into the arms of}} the astonished military sentinels, who, startled from their soldier-like propriety, sprang, muskets in hand, toward us. It was only then that I was able to speak to Pomona, and breathlessly ask her where she was going.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had come}} <b>up</b> so quietly <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> {{that she had}} not heard his approach, and he was leaning forward now, with an odd {{suggestion}} of crouching in his attitude, like a beast about to spring. Yet his gaze riveted hers as with a fascination. And so, while she looked, his lips moved, and from them, in that same voice of her dreams, came from this man who had no French, the words: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{inclined}} my head, {{without knowing}} what she meant; and she said, 'Come here!' again; and returned, followed by the respectable Mr. Littimer, who, with undiminished respectability, made me a bow, and took <b>up</b> his position <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b> The air of wicked grace: of triumph, in which, strange to say, there was yet something feminine and alluring: with which she reclined upon the seat between us, and looked at me, was worthy of a cruel Princess in a Legend.|$|R
60|$|They {{scattered}} at once, {{and ran up}} {{the rigging}} like cats, {{and for a few}} moments the girl held the deck; then the mate crept <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and with the air of a man whose job exactly suited him, clasped her tightly round the waist, while one of the seamen disarmed her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, he wasn't {{there at}} all,' said Mr. Dick, 'until he came <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and whispered. Then she turned round and fainted, and I stood still {{and looked at}} him, and he walked away; but {{that he should have}} been hiding ever since (in the ground or somewhere), is the most {{extraordinary}} thing!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mamma,--if you please." [...] Then {{she paused}} a moment. [...] "But I think that I had rather you did not. Perhaps {{he did not}} mean me to shew it." [...] The mother did not urge her request, but {{contented}} herself with coming <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> child and kissing her. The reader, however, shall have the privilege which was denied to Mrs. O'Hara.|$|E
60|$|Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch <b>up</b> {{and walk}} <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> {{if she went}} slowly, <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> moving hams. Pleasant to see {{first thing in the}} morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood outside the shop in {{sunlight}} and sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the wood.|$|R
5000|$|At Wulfgar's safe-house, ATAC finds {{detailed}} information on the individual team members and Irene. Wulfgar breaks into Irene's home, tracking her into the kitchen as she does dishes. As he sneaks <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> to kill <b>her,</b> [...] "Irene" [...] suddenly turns to face Wulfgar, revealing DaSilva in disguise. As DaSilva aims his revolver at Wulfgar, Wulfgar lunges at him; DaSilva fires twice at the terrorist, sending his body crashing into the street. DaSilva {{walks out of the}} house and sits beside Wulfgar on the front steps of Irene's house.|$|R
6000|$|FANNY. Oh, {{they thought}} they were doing their duty. [He is seated. She comes <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him, puts <b>her</b> hands on his shoulders.] I want you to take them all back again. I want to feel I have made as little commotion in your life as possible. It was just a little mistake. And {{everybody}} will say how fortunate it was that she took herself off so soon with that--[She was about to say [...] "that theatrical Johnny," [...] thinking of Newte. She checks herself.] And you will marry somebody belonging to your own class. And those are the only sensible marriages there are.|$|R
60|$|Not {{far from}} the mouth of the cave the ravine forked into two branches, the smaller fork ending at the {{distance}} of quarter of a mile in a cul de sac, or blind pocket. Not knowing she was making any mistake, she entered this fork and kept on running, expecting each instant to find Pawnee Brown coming <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|When he went in, Sylvia {{was just}} placing the white azalea {{in the window}} of the drawing-room; and {{stealing}} <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> he clasped the little necklet round her throat. She turned round and clung to him. He could feel that she was greatly moved. And remorse stirred and stirred in him that he was betraying her with his kiss.|$|E
6000|$|A loud [...] "hem!" [...] from Pigott, arresting her attention, stopped all further {{consideration}} of the matter. That good lady, who, in honour of the occasion, {{was dressed in a}} black gown of a formidable character and a many-ribboned cap, was standing <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> chair waiting to be introduced to the visitor. Angela proceeded to go through the ceremony which Pigott's straight-up-and-down attitude rendered rather trying.|$|E
60|$|There was {{an irony}} in that siege on which her fancy fastened. By coming thus in arms against her Gian Maria sought {{to win her}} for his wife; yet all that he had {{accomplished}} was to place her {{in the arms of}} the one man whom she had learnt to love by virtue of this very siege. The mellow warmth of the night, the ambient perfume of the fields were well-sorted to her mood, and the faint breeze that breathed caressingly upon her cheek seemed to re-echo the melodies her heart was giving forth. In that hour those old grey walls of Roccaleone seemed to enclose for her a very paradise, and the snatch of an old love song stole softly from her parted lips. But like a paradise--alas!--it had its snake that crept <b>up</b> unheard <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and was presently hissing in her ear. And its voice was the voice of Romeo Gonzaga.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of a woman landing a calico bass from a fishing boat, ca. 1930. A woman, with a fierce expression on her face, is holding up a fishing rod in one hand over a rail and a calico bass, hanging from the stringer, in the other. She is wearing {{what seems to be}} a captain's cap with a buttoned shirt, with its sleeves folded <b>up,</b> over trousers. <b>Behind</b> <b>her,</b> the back view of men with rods is visible and the back of another one, located directly in front of her, is observable wearing a cap and a sweater with a scarf around his neck. Water covers the right area and fills in the backdrop...|$|R

Wife to Igor and mother of two children with him. His disappearance six months earlier causes her to buy Pierre's letters from Frédérique; these refer to the disappearance. Despite Sarah's admonitions, she plans to send photocopies of the letters to newspapers in order to discover what is going on; however, Iris winds <b>up</b> burning them <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> back. Leaves for Obade, where she confesses her love for Colin and Igor to Sarah. Igor calls her not long after and tells her to meet him in Paris. She leaves with Lili. See Pauline.|$|R
