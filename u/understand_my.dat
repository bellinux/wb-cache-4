500|$|During his year-long {{absence from}} the screen, Khan {{actively}} looked to play different parts, saying: [...] "These are smarter movies, the interaction with them is deeply rewarding...I think I am finally beginning to <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> sense of style as an actor. I am developing my craft, understanding what acting and communication is." [...] He found the role in his second collaboration with director Vishal Bhardwaj, Rangoon (2017), an epic romance set during World War II. Cast alongside Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut, Khan drew inspirations from the mannerisms of his grandfather and the character Darth Vader to portray filmmaker Rustom [...] "Rusi" [...] Billimoria. Rajeev Masand termed the film [...] "overlong, indulgent {{to the point of}} exhaustion", but praised Khan for [...] "imbu Russi with the swagger and the arrogance of an aristocrat from the forties".|$|E

Sometimes I use 40 tracks of audio just on one vocal track. Each has a different level and treatment, and then I do a composite. I couldn't do this with a normal analog studio setup.

With Madonna, the first time she heard it, she loved it. She had a chemical reaction to it. She listened to it and she said, 'Okay, let's do it.' It's because of this that I love to work with her. You don't have to spend six months explaining things." ...|$|E
500|$|Years later, {{reflecting}} on his tenure with the Royals, Affeldt said, [...] "I was pretty frustrated. I wanted to quit. I didn't {{want to go}} to the ballpark. I was just failing a lot. I was getting hurt. I didn't <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> role. I bounced around and I just didn't enjoy the game." [...] At the trade deadline on July 31, Affeldt was traded along with Denny Bautista to the Colorado Rockies for Ryan Shealy and Scott Dohmann. [...] Affeldt recalled, [...] "When [...] traded me, he said, 'I feel like I need to give you a fresh start. You can learn to enjoy the game again.' [...] I have a lot of respect for him now because he saw that. It was a move that had to be made for me to be able to continue playing baseball. I'm very thankful for it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, ellipses, ridiculous {{imagery and}} {{nonsensical}} verdicts. Tzara {{was aware that}} the public could {{find it difficult to}} follow his intentions, and, in a piece titled Le géant blanc lépreux du paysage ("The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape") even alluded to the [...] "skinny, idiotic, dirty" [...] reader who [...] "does not <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> poetry." [...] He called some of his own poems lampisteries, from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures. The Lettrist poet Isidore Isou included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by Charles Baudelaire with the [...] "destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became [...] "destruction of the word for nothing". According to American literary historian Mary Ann Caws, Tzara's poems may be seen as having an [...] "internal order", and read as [...] "a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1973, The Village Voice writer Terry Guerin said Cosby {{was past}} his prime. Among the reasons, [...] "making {{spokesman}} commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He {{has evolved into}} a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader Sammy Davis has always been". [...] "The Noble Cos," [...] a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for The Nation, was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, [...] "So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke does do business in South Africa... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?' My buddy didn't <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> commercials improve race relations. Y'see, by showing that a black man can be just as money-hungry as a white man... I'm proving that all men are brothers." ...|$|E
500|$|Lin {{sent his}} résumé and a DVD of {{highlights}} {{of his high}} school basketball career to all of the Ivy League schools; the University of California, Berkeley; and his dream schools, Stanford University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> game, they have to watch me more than once, because I'm {{not going to do anything}} that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E
500|$|Nageswara Rao {{played the}} role of a 90-year-old man. His {{character}} enters the film just before the interval and remains until {{the very end of the}} film. All the members of the principal cast except Nageswara Rao played dual roles in the film. Nagarjuna said in an interview that he would be seen in the 1920s, 1980s and 2013 and would play a zamindar in 1920. Saran revealed that every character in the film would have a specific aspect; Nagarjuna's character loves cars. Regarding her role, Saran said that she would be seen as a poor but content farmer in the flashback sequences and a doctor in the present day. She added [...] "My character goes back to 1930s and comes back in the present era. I can't tell how it happens though. It's a fun character and you will find me stammering a lot. Suddenly, I'm talking normally and suddenly I start stammering, that's how you <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> character." [...] She added that apart from Nagarjuna, she has more scenes with Nageswara Rao and only a couple of scenes with Chaitanya in the film.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot on March 15, 2010 in the deserts of Lancaster, California, {{directed}} by Hype Williams. When talking to 'MTV News' about the video Minaj stated, [...] "I didn't want to shoot the typical new-artist vision. Thank God I have a wonderful label that stands behind me and my vision. I met Hype in a freakin' airport...and {{it happened to be}} a week before I wanted to shoot a video. I told him the idea. Of course, I had to let Baby and Slim know and hope they would <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> expensive taste. It all came together." [...] It's just beautiful — the clothes, everything. The ambiance..It's for all the girls that like to play dress-up. They're gonna love this one...we get on the walkie-talkie, like, 'Mayday! Mayday!' It's really fashion and beauty shots, and we're acting like we're doing something important. We wanted to make it pretty in the dirt. We wanted to have a very crazy contrast. I didn't want to do everything clean. I like the dirt. All that pink stuff looks even prettier in the dirt." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schoenberg viewed his {{development}} as a natural progression, {{and he did not}} deprecate his earlier works when he ventured into serialism. In 1923 he wrote to the Swiss philanthropist Werner Reinhart: For the present, it matters more to me if people <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> older works ... They are the natural forerunners of my later works, and only those who understand and comprehend these will be able to gain an understanding of the later works that goes beyond a fashionable bare minimum. I do not attach so much importance to being a musical bogey-man as to being a natural continuer of properly-understood good old tradition! ( [...] ; quoted in [...] ) ...|$|E

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, {{a former member}} of Girls Aloud and judge on The X Factor, has a Geordie accent, she says that she's [...] "proud to be Geordie!" [...] as does Joe McElderry the winner of the sixth series of The X Factor. In May 2011, while named Cheryl Cole, she was let go from the American version of The X Factor because its [...] "producers feared the American audience would not understand her Geordie accent." [...] While hosting during a May 2011 taping of Britain's Got Talent, Declan Donnelly (of Ant & Dec) made an apparent attempt to stand up for Cole by asking co-producer and judge Simon Cowell on the show, [...] "Can you <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> accent?".|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2015, Nakata {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} with Kee Club in Hong Kong to open Koko, a Hong Kong-based restaurant that serves sakes created by Nakata himself. He has developed his own line of sake as well as creating his own mobile educational app, [...] "Sakenomy". Expressing interest in educating the public about sake, Nakata stated, [...] "People recognise brands of wine but not usually brands of sake. There {{is a lack of}} information and branding when it comes to sake. That’s why I thought I needed to create a brand that people can recognise and <b>understand.</b> <b>My</b> purpose is to expand the market for all sake not just my own. You can pair any type of cuisine with sake. It can go with French, Italian, even Chinese food, not just Japanese cuisine." ...|$|E

[...] However other celebrity chefs such as Wolfgang Puck, [...] and Albert Roux [...] are {{against the use of}} foie gras. Roux has argued that foie gras should come with a warning so that [...] "people know what's being done to the animals." [...] He states that [...] "More humane methods should be used that allow the animal to gorge themselves naturally." [...] Chicago chef Charlie Trotter maintained that the production of foie gras is [...] "too cruel to be served." [...] However, Trotter refused to be associated with animal rights groups stating [...] "These people are idiots. <b>Understand</b> <b>my</b> position: I {{have nothing to do with}} a group like that.

I shall try to <b>understand</b> <b>my</b> people and do my best to share the responsibilities which history has placed upon all of us." [...] He later wrote to a friend from childhood: [...] "I should have been born into the German-speaking Jewish community of Prague in 1922 and died in a gas chamber some 20 years later. How I came to be born in the Bronx Hospital, I'll never quite understand."
