25|$|The {{invention}} of new synthetic pigments in the 18th and 19th centuries considerably brightened and expanded the palette of painters. J.M.W. Turner experimented {{with the new}} cobalt blue, and of the twenty colours most used by the Impressionists, twelve were new and synthetic colours, including cobalt <b>blue,</b> <b>ultramarine</b> and cerulean <b>blue.</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} factor in the increased prestige of the colour blue in the 12th century was the veneration of the Virgin Mary, and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing. In earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black, grey, violet, dark green or dark blue. In the 12th century the Roma Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with the new most expensive pigment imported from Asia; <b>ultramarine.</b> <b>Blue</b> became associated with holiness, humility and virtue.|$|E
25|$|Separate {{numbered}} TO {{companies have}} guidons with their numerical designation under the branch insignia, e.g. the guidon of the 380th Quartermaster Company is buff with the insignia of the Quartermaster Corps over the numerals “380” in <b>ultramarine</b> <b>blue,</b> these being the named {{colors of the}} branch. Headquarters companies of groups, brigades, divisions and corps have guidons of a design corresponding to that of their Organizational Flag, e.g. the guidon of a headquarters battery of a Field Artillery Brigade or Fires Brigade would be vertically divided, scarlet and yellow, with the brigade's shoulder sleeve insignia centered.|$|E
25|$|The Audience Chamber, {{also known}} as the Chamber of Petitions (Arz Odası), is right behind the Gate of Felicity. This square {{building}} is an Ottoman kiosk, surrounded by a colonnade of 22 columns supporting the large roof with hanging eaves. The building dates from the 15th century. The ceiling of the chamber was painted in <b>ultramarine</b> <b>blue</b> and studded with golden stars. The walls were lined with blue, white and turquoise tiles. The chamber was further decorated with precious carpets and pillows. The chamber was renovated in 1723 by Sultan Ahmed III. It was destroyed in the fire of 1856 and rebuilt during the reign of Abülmecid I.|$|E

The lobby was modern, featuring curved walls, understated gumwood doors, and simple semi-circular light fixtures.

(For a more {{complete}} list see the List of colours).|$|R
25|$|Mineral {{pigments}} {{were also}} traded over long distances. The {{only way to}} achieve a deep rich blue was by using a semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli, to produce a pigment known as ultramarine, and the best sources of lapis were remote. Flemish painter Jan van Eyck, working in the 15th century, did not ordinarily include blue in his paintings. To have one's portrait commissioned and painted with <b>ultramarine</b> <b>blue</b> was considered a great luxury. If a patron wanted blue, they were obliged to pay extra. When Van Eyck used lapis, he never blended it with other colors. Instead he applied it in pure form, almost as a decorative glaze. The prohibitive price of lapis lazuli forced artists to seek less expensive replacement pigments, both mineral (azurite, smalt) and biological (indigo).|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} of the Army measures 80 × 120cm, white with the Army {{coat of arms}} in the centre, trimmed with gold fringe. The name of the service is inscribed in gold letters on a green scroll beneath the shield. Above the shield is a knight's helmet with red and sky blue mantling. The staff is topped by a nickel-plated lance-head finial, 32cm high. Below the lance-head, there is a cravat (laço militar) divided lengthwise, sky blue and red, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow and fastened with a cockade of blue with the Southern Cross in white stars, red, and blue. Ten red streamers with campaign honours inscribed in sky blue letters are also attached below the lance-head. The staff is 212cm long, not including the lance-head, and 3.5cm in diameter. It is covered in sky blue velvet with a red spiral strip. The colour belt is 10cm in width, covered with sky blue velvet with red velvet stripes. The Navy's flag uses dark blue colours, the Air Force flag <b>ultramarine</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following {{a journey}} to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, van Meegeren painted The Supper at Emmaus using the <b>ultramarine</b> <b>blues</b> and yellows {{preferred}} by Johannes Vermeer and other Dutch Golden Age painters. The experts assumed that Vermeer had studied in Italy, so van Meegeren used [...] by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio located at Italy’s Pinacoteca di Brera as a model. He {{had always wanted to}} walk in the steps of the masters, and he felt that his forgery was a fine work in its own right. He gave it to his friend, attorney C. A. Boon, telling him that it was a genuine Vermeer, and asked him to show it to Dr. Abraham Bredius in Monaco. Bredius examined the forgery in September 1937 and he accepted it as a genuine Vermeer and praised it highly.|$|R

50|$|In 1879, Fritz Henkel {{was entered}} {{as the sole}} owner in the {{register}} of companies. Sales of Henkel's Bleaching Soda increased so rapidly that within just one year the rented factory on the Schützenstraße in Düsseldorf was unable to meet the demand. Fritz Henkel decided to build his own factory with a railway link. In 1883, to improve liquidity and make better use of the company's travelling sales staff, Fritz Henkel decided to sell merchandise {{in addition to his}} detergents. Sales started in 1884. The range included the colorant <b>ultramarine</b> <b>bluing</b> agent, gloss starch, a liquid cleaning agent, a pomade for cleaning, beef extract, and a hair pomade. Very soon Henkel developed its international presence—in 1886, Henkel opened its first international sales office in Austria. Carl Pathe had gone to Vienna as a representative the year before. In 1893, Henkel established its first business links with England and Italy.|$|R

SeaWorld can adjust several features of the splash effect, including its duration and the train's speed when it enters the area.

40|$|The {{materials}} and working method {{of a painting}} can reveal important information about our cultural history, as well as lend the conservator the necessary knowledge for treatment options. The removal of a cross-section sample reveals the three-dimensional (3 d) structure of the painting {{and can be used}} to identify materials. However, cross-section samples are destructive and provide only local information. Nonlinear optical ultrafast pump-probe microscopy, originally developed for biomedical imaging, can provide high resolution 3 d images with chemical contrast. In this dissertation, I adapt pump-probe microscopy to multiple {{materials and}} applications in cultural heritage research. Pump-probe dynamics were found {{to be sensitive to the}} ratio of the two chromophores present in the precious blue pigment lapis lazuli and its synthetic analogs, <b>ultramarines</b> <b>blue</b> and violet. Virtual pump-probe cross-sections were combined with nonlinear fluorescence contrast to study differences between the interactions of paper supports with inorganic crystalline pigments and organic dyes. Multiple early Italian paintings (The Crucifixion by Puccio Capanna, The Martyrdom of St. Alexander and The Body of Christ Supported by Angels attributed to Lorenzo Lotto) were imaged in-situ, in conjunction with traditional conservation science methods, as a part of a technical case study. Thus, pump-probe microscopy offers an important new tool for gaining fundamental insights into our cultural heritage. Dissertatio...|$|R
