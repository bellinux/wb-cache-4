The average Brandt’s vole density of 18 different plots in the Eej Khad study area was 441. 6 ind/ha. In the desert steppe, the density was zero during the same period of time. Growth-bar width of nest-lings was significantly different and wider in vole-rich areas than in areas lacking voles (3. 9 vs. 2. 24 mm/ 24 -h period). Similarly, {{there was a significant difference}} in the number of fault bars; the average was 2. 2 in vole-rich areas and 0. 5 in areas with no voles.

25|$|Other raptors, {{large and}} small, are often {{outright}} dominated by golden eagles. In Eurasia, the relative paucity of mid-sized Buteo species {{is thought to}} be due to the radiation of large Aquila eagles that already occupied the large raptor niche and outcompeted them. In North America, where there are no Aquila eagles other than the golden eagle, Buteo species are more diverse with at least 3 large hawks (the red-tailed, Swainson's (Buteo swainsoni) and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis)) that occur in similar habitats and sometimes eat similar prey as both each other and golden eagles. On occasion, golden eagles will kleptoparasitize or even predate these three Buteos. Other small to medium-sized diurnal raptors are known to occasionally be hunted by golden eagles, including ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), black kite (Milvus migrans), hen harriers (Circus cyaneus), Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), Cooper's hawks (Accipter cooperii), northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), common buzzards (Buteo buteo), long-legged <b>buzzards</b> (Buteo rufinus), <b>upland</b> <b>buzzards</b> (Buteo hemilasius), rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), American kestrels (Falco sparverius), merlins (Falco columbarius), prairie falcons and gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus). Occasionally, golden eagles may even boldly predate these smaller species during migration in mid-flight, as was recorded at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary with a red-shouldered hawk. It is thought that on rare occasions, more nimble, smaller raptors like rough-legged buzzards and harriers can kleptoparatisize golden eagles. Interestingly, northern goshawks in Scandinavia rely on grouse to about the same extent as golden eagles there and even hunt in similar forest edge habitats there. However, the goshawks primarily hunt neonatal and fledgling grouse (30% and 53% of their take of grouse) rather than adult grouse (17% of their prey) in late summer when grouse dominate other birds in their diet, whereas the eagles seem to mainly adult grouse and hunt them aseasonally. Similarly, hen harriers may become somewhat specialized at taking young red grouse, whereas the eagles are more likely to take adults.|$|R

Weight varies in the species relatively restricted breeding range. In the southern reaches of the species breeding range, i.e. Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, males average 1050 g and females average 1231 g.

50|$|Buteos {{are fairly}} large birds. Total length {{can vary from}} 30 to 71 cm and {{wingspan}} can range from 67 to 161 cm. The lightest known species is the roadside hawk, {{at an average of}} 269 g although the lesser known white-rumped and Ridgway's hawks are similarly small in average wingspan around 75 cm, and average length around 35 cm and in standard measurements. The largest species in length and wingspan is the <b>upland</b> <b>buzzard,</b> which averages around 65 cm in length and 152 cm in wingspan. The upland is rivaled in weight and outsized in foot measurements and bill size by the ferruginous hawk. In both of these largest buteos, adults typically weigh over 1200 g, and in mature females, can exceed a mass of 2000 g. All buteos may be noted for their broad wings and sturdy builds. They frequently soar on thermals at midday over openings and are most frequently seen while doing this. The flight style varies based on the body type and wing shape and surface size. Some long-winged species, such as rough-legged buzzards and Swainson's hawks, have a floppy, buoyant flight style, while others, such as red-tailed hawks and rufous-tailed hawks, tend to be relatively shorter-winged, soaring more slowly and flying with more labored, deeper flaps. Most small and some medium-sized species, from the roadside hawk to the red-shouldered hawk, often fly with an alternation of soaring and flapping, thus may be reminiscent of an Accipiter hawk in flight, but are still relatively larger-winged, shorter-tailed, and soar more extensively in open areas than Accipiter species do. Buteos inhabit a wide range of habitats across the world, but tend to prefer some access to both clearings, which provide ideal hunting grounds, and trees, which can provide nesting locations and security.|$|E

Open-country owls that tend to nest in open-access nesting sites like short-eared owls and little owls may be somewhat more vulnerable at the nest. The great numbers of long-eared owls taken, since it often nest in dense, protective thickets, are probably adult or immature owls attempting to hunt. In Europe, Eurasian eagle-owls are generally the only owls to regularly nest in rocky habitats. This is not the case in arid desert-like regions, where limited nesting options frequently force diverse owls to use rocky areas as nesting sites. However, the cliffs and other rocky areas preferred by Eurasian eagle-owls are also utilized by several species of diurnal raptor in Eurasia. In Spain, golden eagles, Bonelli's eagles and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) most often nest on cliffs. Large scavenging birds such as cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus), bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), Eurasian griffons (Gyps fulvus), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and common ravens also often nests on the same Iberian cliffs.

40|$|A High-intensity Acoustic Bird Dispersion System (HIABDS), {{invented by}} Professor Xi Baoshu, {{is a new}} nonlethal device for {{dispersing}} birds from airports and other locations. The device employs a unique electro-pneumatic loudspeaker which can amplify recorded wildlife vocalizations or artificial sounds of varying frequencies to high power levels and project them over long distances. The sound pressure reaches 135 dB at 10 -m distance. In China, HIABDS is being used at Lanzhou Airport to disperse <b>upland</b> <b>buzzards</b> (Buteo hemilasius), whose numbers declined by 80 % after 1 year of deployment. During 2001 - 2002, HIABDS was used at Tianjin Binhai International Airport to keep over 1, 000 crows outside of runway area and at Beijing Capital International Airport during a visit by President George W. Bush. In the USA, field evaluations of HIABDS were conducted in Ohio at Burke Lakefront Airport and other sites in 2001. We recorded the response of various bird species to 6 sounds (synthetic and recorded distress calls) broadcast from the HIABDS. Turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) exposed to sounds from the HIABDS at 200 m dispersed from a nighttime roost, but 12 of 13 vulture groups were unaffected while soaring or perched during the day. In contrast to vultures, red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) dispersed in 18 of 24 exposures to sound from the HIABDS. All 15 flocks of gulls (Larus spp.) within 300 m of the HIABDS dispersed whereas none of 11 flocks beyond 300 m dispersed. For Canada geese (Branta canadensis), 3 of 5 tests with a goose distress call caused dispersal whereas none of 8 tests with other sounds generated any reaction, even at 75 m. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) showed no reaction to any of 4 sounds in 14 of 15 tests within 300 m. European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) showed a strong dispersal response to a synthetic clicking sound when broadcast within 300 m of the flock. Caspian terns (Sterna caspia) ignored the 4 sounds evaluated. In conclusion, sounds broadcast from the HIABDS were effective in dispersing certain species, depending on the sound used and distance of birds, whereas other species were generally unresponsive to any sounds at any distance. These findings point out the complexity of dispersing birds depending on species, behavior, and time of year. Our findings indicate that the HIABDS {{can be used to}} disperse certain birds and that such a system might be useful as part of an integrated wildlife hazard management program for airports. We recommend that a HIABDS-equipped vehicle be provided to one or more airports in North America for evaluation by the airport’s wildlife control officers. This will allow for a practical evaluation of the HIABDS under field conditions and further assess the performance of the system...|$|R
