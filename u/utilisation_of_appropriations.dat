40|$|This thesis {{serves as}} a written {{companion}} for two artistic-based research products built upon the concept <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> as connecting bridge between music technology and the classical tradition of music composition. The first artistic work {{is a set of}} 9 pieces called "Collages Vol 2 ", a continuation of a first release meant to be an exploratory work for the present research. The second work is the sound interaction design, and the creation of two compositions for the Network of Intelligent Sound Agents, or "NOISA", built at the Sound and Physical Interaction Research Group from the Department of Media, Aalto University. After providing context and a short survey of influences on music appropriation, I made a comprehensive documentation of each of the pieces created for this thesis, describing form, content, compositional approach and sound processing in a systematic way. I investigated on the diverse forms <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> as a technique for electroacoustic music composition. The most influential references for my work are documented in this written work: From the historical approach <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> to borrowing in music of the XX century and recent times; including a description of the first volume of my original Collages. Later on, I described my second collection of Collages and the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> theories in the context of NOISA, a music interface for live performance. Finally, there is a section dedicated to a discussion featuring a commentary of a number of reviews of "Collages” preceding a closing segment with conclusions and further plans to expand this research in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{energetic}} <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. It was used a qualitative research and document analysis of articles. The first part deals with the theoretical framework, therefore definitions and possibilities <b>of</b> biomass <b>utilisation.</b> The second part contains methodology, follows research and its evaluation. The first aim of this thesis is to summarize the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass as renewable energy and to distinguish positive and negative impacts <b>of</b> the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> this source and evaluate its economic efficiency. There are several possibilities <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass, but {{it is necessary to}} select the suitable process and its utilisation. Based on the large number of examples from life it can be stated that it is economically efficient. The second aim is to identify main misconceptions related to <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. The main misconception is comparing the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> solar energy, which has not left positive attitude of people to renewable energy, with <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. There are few examples of comparing photovoltaic with <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass on the same level. In regard of the basic principles <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass, those two sources cannot be compared at all, they are not similar. Another misconception is apprehension <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> land used for growing energy [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The present research, {{grounded}} in an illustrative {{case study on}} Tiananmen Square, conceptualises the notion of contested place {{with regard to the}} years 1919, 1949, and 1989. Exploring the perceptual meaning of the site, the study offers a perspective on the physical, practical and metaphysical dimensions of contestation, as these arguably expose the processual dynamics of meaning making. Interpreting the symbolism of Tiananmen Square together with the publics and the government's interaction and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> the Square, the project proposes a repetitive scheme where the site is alternated by means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> and domination. Ultimately, as we work with a constructivist approach, the end reaches no factual conclusion, but rather, offers up a new perspective on the means of interpreting how contestation manifests itself in and around space...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined. Here, appropriation is recognized as another source of lyric expression, critical innovation, and conceptual development in contemporary poetry. This thesis encourages a new perspective on the purpose and processes <b>of</b> poetic <b>appropriation</b> and the consequences of its declarative potential for both poet and poem...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R
40|$|Malawi {{is among}} the five sub-sahara Africa {{presenting}} with very high maternal mortality rates, 984 per 100, 000 live. Inadequate access to and under-utilisation of quality maternal health care services {{was identified as a}} major reasons for poor health of the women in Malawi. As a response to this situation, the Malawi government initiated the implementation of skilled attendance approach to delivery of maternal health care in 2006. The main objectives {{of the study was to}} identify the patterns and determinants <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled attendace for maternal health care services in the catchment areas of two rural health centres in the northern part of Malawi. This study used methodological triangulation methods, quantitative study using a descriptive cross sectional survey and qualitative; semistructured interviews and observations. Results shows that, <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> maternal health care services at the study sites has improved compared to the 2004 demographic health survey reports on maternal health care service utilisation in Malawi. <b>Utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care for child birth was much higher than of the other components of maternal health care services. Maternal health services at Bolero health centre seemed to be more accessible and available than at kande. Hence <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> most components of care were high at Bolero health centre. Higher odds for <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care at birth was associated with women who made atleast 4 antenatal care visit, who lived within 5 km from the health centre. Low <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> maternal health care was associated with womens’ low autonomy; women with lower levels of education, younger, married, had lower rates <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> most components of maternal health care. The malawian strategy of implementing skilled attendance achieved is unique as it aims apromoting total <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care, some lessons can be learnt on how the implementation is done at Bolero health centre. However, provision of quality of care remains a challenge for Malawi. There is need for strengthening supportive supervision and human resource management systems...|$|R
