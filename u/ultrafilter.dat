5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The <b>ultrafilter</b> lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
25|$|Any {{family of}} sets that {{satisfies}} (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an <b>ultrafilter</b> (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an <b>ultrafilter</b> is the {{family of sets}} containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any <b>ultrafilter</b> containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an <b>ultrafilter,</b> but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial <b>ultrafilter</b> (the <b>ultrafilter</b> lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E

We use G-invariant partitions and colorings to define G-selective and G-Ramsey <b>ultrafilters</b> on X.

25|$|In {{the other}} direction, there may exist many {{homomorphism}}s from a Boolean algebra B to 2. Any such homomorphism partitions B into those elements mapped to 1 and those to 0. The subset of B {{consisting of the}} former is called an <b>ultrafilter</b> of B. When B is finite its ultrafilters pair up with its atoms; one atom is mapped to 1 and the rest to 0. Each <b>ultrafilter</b> of B thus consists of an atom of B and all the elements above it; hence exactly half the elements of B are in the <b>ultrafilter,</b> and there as many ultrafilters as atoms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study Tukey {{types of}} <b>ultrafilters</b> on ω, {{focusing}} {{on the question of}} when Tukey reducibility is equivalent to Rudin-Keisler reducibility.

25|$|The {{easiest way}} to see this is {{isomorphic}} to βN {{is to show that}} it satisfies the universal property. For f: N → K with K compact Hausdorff and F an <b>ultrafilter</b> on N we have an <b>ultrafilter</b> f(F) on K, the pushforward of F. This has a unique limit, say x, because K is compact Hausdorff, and we define βf(F) = x. This may readily be verified to be a continuous extension.|$|E

25|$|We {{have seen}} that forcing can be done using Boolean-valued models, by {{constructing}} a Boolean algebra with <b>ultrafilter</b> from a poset with a generic subset. It is also possible to go back the other way: given a Boolean algebra B, we can form a poset P of all the nonzero elements of B, and a generic <b>ultrafilter</b> on B restricts to a generic set on P. So the techniques of forcing and Boolean-valued models are essentially equivalent.|$|E

25|$|The hyperreals can be {{developed}} either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods.
