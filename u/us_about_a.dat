25|$|In 1967 Moravia visited China, Japan and Korea. In 1971 he {{published}} the novel Io e lui (I and He or The Two of <b>Us)</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> screenwriter, his independent penis and the situations {{to which he}} thrusts them and the essay Poesia e romanzo (Poetry and Novel). In 1972 he went to Africa, which inspired his work A quale tribù appartieni? (Which Tribe Do You Belong To?), published in the same year. His 1982 trip to Japan, including a visit to Hiroshima, inspired {{a series of articles}} for L'Espresso magazine about the atomic bomb. The same theme is in the novel L'Uomo che Guarda (The Man Who Looks, 1985) and the essay L'Inverno Nucleare (The Nuclear Winter), including interviews with some contemporary principal scientists and politicians.|$|E
25|$|Mainly {{known for}} his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times {{architecture}} was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as technical architecture. Frontinus mentions him {{in connection with the}} standard sizes of pipes. He is often credited as father of architectural acoustics for describing the technique of echeas placement in theaters. The only building, however, that we know Vitruvius to have worked on is one he tells <b>us</b> <b>about,</b> <b>a</b> basilica completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The Basilica di Fano (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various {{attempts have been made to}} visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman basilicae (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the basilica may be incorporated into the cathedral located in Fano.|$|E
500|$|Fraser Nelson, {{editor of}} The Spectator, {{suggested}} the programme had highlighted {{a section of}} society who have been forgotten by the politicians: [...] "These people are people who otherwise don’t have a voice. They don’t vote, so for many years they have just not mattered". Nelson's comments were echoed by Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: [...] "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it tells <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> welfare system that abandons thousands of people – {{through no fault of}} their own – to a life without hope or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State." [...] Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been [...] "broadly sympathetic" [...] to those it portrays. In the Daily Mirror, entrepreneur John Bird, founder of The Big Issue, wrote that although Benefits Street did not fully represent the spectrum of people who claim benefits, it did show what could happen to those forgotten by the system [...] "who get caught in a kind of social suicide".|$|E

[...] "Rather than to look at what a neglected cemetery might tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> community’s relationship to its past or reconsider the disregard shown to its once-distinguished cultural icons," [...] Adler Peckerar wrote.

6000|$|He broke off, and {{sat still}} awhile as one dreaming. [...] "I can't put things together, {{but at last}} we came south, Jake and I, and struck the Kamtchadales again.

60|$|There is {{something}} peculiarly sweet to <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> certain mystical dreaminess and obscurity in these wild wood tribes, which we never {{wish to have}} brought out into the daylight of absolute knowledge. Every {{one of them was}} a self-discovered treasure of our childhood, as much our own as if God had made it on purpose and presented it; and it was ever a part of the joy to think we had found something that no one else knew, and so musing on them, we gave them names in our heart.|$|E

I may be partial, but the {{conversation}} of intelligent barristers amuses me more than that of other professional persons. There is more of real life in it, with which, in all its phases, people of business get so well acquainted. Mr. Adolphus is a man of varied information, and very amusing. He told me a gipsy told him of the success he should have in life, and how it would be endangered by his own heat of temper, alluding, I believe, to a quarrel betwixt him and a brother barrister.|$|E
