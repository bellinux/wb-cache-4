5000|$|In {{membrane}} {{science and}} technology, concentration polarization {{refers to the}} emergence of concentration gradients at a membrane/solution interface resulted from selective transfer of some species through the membrane under the effect of transmembrane driving forces. Generally, the cause of concentration polarization is the ability of a membrane to transport some species more readily than the other(s) (which is the membrane permselectivity): the retained species are concentrated at the <b>upstream</b> <b>membrane</b> surface while the concentration of transported species decreases. Thus, concentration polarization phenomenon is inherent to all types of membrane separation processes. In the cases of gas separations, pervaporation, membrane distillation, reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration separations, the concentration profile has a higher level of solute nearest to the <b>upstream</b> <b>membrane</b> surface compared with the more or less well mixed bulk fluid far from the membrane surface. In the case of dialysis and electrodialysis, the concentrations of selectively transported dissolved species are reduced at the <b>upstream</b> <b>membrane</b> surface compared to the bulk solution. The emergence of concentration gradients is illustrated in Figs. 1a and 1b. Fig. 1a shows the concentration profile near and within a membrane when an external driving force is just applied to an initially equilibrium system. Concentration gradients have not yet formed. If the membrane is selectively permeable to species 1, its flux (...) within the membrane is higher than that in the solution (...) [...] Higher flux in the membrane causes a decrease in the concentration at the <b>upstream</b> <b>membrane</b> surface (...) and an increase at the downstream surface (...) , Fig. 1b. Thus, the upstream solution becomes depleted and the downstream solution becomes enriched in regard to species 1. The concentration gradients cause additional diffusion fluxes, which contribute to an increase of the total flux in the solutions and to a decrease of the flux in the membrane. As a result, the system reaches a steady state where [...] The greater the external force applied, the lower [...] In electrodialysis, when [...] becomes much lower than the bulk concentration, the resistance of the depleted solution becomes quite elevated. The current density related to this state is known as the limiting current density.|$|E
40|$|Polarized {{exocytosis}} {{is important}} for morphogenesis and cell growth. The exocyst is a multiprotein complex implicated in tethering secretory vesicles at specific sites of the plasma membrane for exocytosis. In the budding yeast, the exocyst is localized to sites of bud emergence or the tips of small daughter cells, where it mediates secretion and cell surface expansion. To understand how exocytosis is spatially controlled, we systematically analyzed the localization of Sec 15 p, {{a member of the}} exocyst complex and downstream effector of the rab protein Sec 4 p, in various mutants. We found that the polarized localization of Sec 15 p relies on functional <b>upstream</b> <b>membrane</b> traffic, activated rab protein Sec 4 p, and its guanine exchange factor Sec 2 p. The initial targeting of both Sec 4 p and Sec 15 p to the bud tip depends on polarized actin cable. However, different recycling mechanisms for rab and Sec 15 p may account for the different kinetics of polarization for these two proteins. We also found that Sec 3 p and Sec 15 p, though both members of the exocyst complex, rely on distinctive targeting mechanisms for their localization. The assembly of the exocyst may integrate various cellular signals to ensure that exocytosis is tightly controlled. Key regulators of cell polarity such as Cdc 42 p are important for the recruitment of the exocyst to the budding site. Conversely, we found that the proper localization of these cell polarity regulators themselves also requires a functional exocytosis pathway. We further report that Bem 1 p, a protein essential for the recruitment of signaling molecules for the establishment of cell polarity, interacts with the exocyst complex. We propose that a cyclical regulatory network contributes to the establishment and maintenance of polarized cell growth in yeast...|$|E

Depletion of both JNK 1 and JNK 2 expression using siRNA transfection, protected against apoptosis, as detected by decreased nuclear fragmentation and caspase- 3 activity, {{as well as}} reduced translocation of Bax to mitochondria. Moreover, release of cathepsin B and D from lysosomes to the cytosol was reduced when JNK expression was suppressed by siRNA, demonstrating a JNK dependent regulation of lysosomal membrane permeabilization. In unirradiated control melanocytes, coimmunoprecipitation showed that Bim was sequestered by Mcl- 1, which had a pro-survival function. After UVB irradiation, {{a significant decrease in}} Mcl- 1 protein level was found, which was prevented by addition of a proteasome inhibitor. The interaction between Bim and Mcl- 1 was reduced in response to UVB irradiation and Bim was phosphorylated in a JNK dependent manner. In conclusion, these findings Suggest JNK to have an important pro-apoptotic function following UVB irradiation in human melanocytes, by acting <b>upstream</b> of lysosomal <b>membrane</b> permeabilization and Bim phosphorylation.

40|$|Despite the {{progress}} in understanding nuclear envelope (NE) reformation after mitosis, {{it has remained}} unclear what drives the required membrane fusion and how exactly this is coordinated with nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly. Here, we show that, like other intracellular fusion reactions, NE fusion in Xenopus laevis egg extracts is mediated by SNARE proteins that require activation by NSF. Antibodies against Xenopus NSF, depletion of NSF or the dominant-negative NSF(E 329 Q) variant specifically inhibited NE formation. Staging experiments further revealed that NSF was required until sealing of the envelope was completed. Moreover, excess exogenous alpha-SNAP that blocks SNARE function prevented membrane fusion and caused accumulation of non-flattened vesicles on the chromatin surface. Under these conditions, the nucleoporins Nup 107 and gp 210 were fully recruited, whereas assembly of FxFG-repeat-containing nucleoporins was blocked. Together, we define NSF- and SNARE-mediated membrane fusion events as essential steps during NE formation downstream of Nup 107 recruitment, and <b>upstream</b> of <b>membrane</b> flattening and completion of NPC assembly...|$|R

The olive oil industry in its current status, composed of little and dispersed factories, cannot stand such high costs. Moreover, these treatments {{are not able to}} abate the high concentration of dissolved inorganic matter present in these highly polluted effluents. In the present work, a review on the actual state of the art concerning the treatment and disposal of OMW by membranes is addressed, comprising microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO), as well as membrane bioreactors (MBR) and non-conventional membrane processes such as vacuum distillation (VD), osmotic distillation (OD) and forward osmosis (FO).

The electrical efficiency, capture efficiency, required membrane surface area and cost of CO 2 avoided are presented for power plants integrated with membrane reformers as well as membrane water gas shift reactors. For applications in CO 2 capture, membrane water-gas-shift is more suited than membrane reforming. The lower hydrogen partial pressure in a membrane reformer compared to membrane WGS causes high investment costs, because the membrane area is high and compression of the hydrogen fuel before entering the gas turbine is necessary. A significant increase in operating temperature, possibly combined with a higher feed pressure could improve the performance of membrane reformers.

40|$|Membrane fusion with vacuoles, the {{lysosome}} {{equivalent of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is among the best understood membrane fusion events. Our precise understanding of this fusion machinery stems from powerful genetics and elegant in vitro reconstitution assays. Central to vacuolar membrane fusion is the multi-subunit tether the HO motypic fusion and Protein Sorting (HOPS) complex, a complex of proteins that organizes other necessary components of the fusion machinery. We lack a similarly detailed molecular understanding of membrane fusion with lysosomes or lysosome-related organelles in metazoans. However, {{it is likely that}} fundamental principles of how rabs, SNAREs and HOPS tethers work to fuse membranes with lysosomes and related organelles are conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans.

The raw wastewater was processed by a pH-temperature (T) flocculation process formerly studied at lab scale in previous work. In the present paper, modelization and optimization of the pretreatment process are addressed at pilot scale. Statistical multifactorial analysis showed both pH and T remarkably influence the suspended solids concentration removal efficiency (p-value practically equal to zero), confirming a statistically significant relationship between the variables considered at 95 % confidence level. Moreover, the pH exhibits a deeper influence than the T, according to the p-values withdrawn from the analysis, and the squared effects are significant too, but more significant {{in the case of}} the pH. Contour plots and response surface support the previous results, and the optimized parameters were 21. 4 °C and pH equal to 2. 2, yielding 98. 4 − 98. 6 % TSS reduction and 90. 5 % v/v recovery of clarified water.

40|$|The p 53 {{protein is}} an {{important}} transcription factor and tumor suppressor that is induced in response to many forms of cellular stress. UVA irradiation of human melanocytes caused generation of reactive oxygen species, which altered the intracellular redox balance and was accompanied by translocation of p 53 to mitochondria. In contrast, UVB {{did not affect the}} redox status and p 53 was translocated to the nucleus. Although different intracellular location of p 53, UVA/B induced apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway detected as translocation of Bax to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases. These events were all prevented by inhibition of p 53 with pifithrin-α. Furthermore, inhibition of p 53 prevented lysosomal membrane permeabilization, detected as translocation of cathepsins to the cytosol, after UVB exposure, whereas UVA-induced lysosomal release was unaffected by inhibition of p 53. In control cells, p 53 coimmunoprecipitated with the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL and upon UVA exposure the interaction was replaced by binding to the proapoptotic proteins Bax, Noxa, and Puma.

40|$|Studies {{were done}} {{for the removal of}} organic solutes under aqueous medium through micellar {{enhanced}} ultrafiltration (MEUF). The organic solutes selected for experiments consisted of an ionic compound (phenol) and a non-ionic compound (aniline); whereas cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC), a counter-ionic surfactant was used for the formation of micelles under aqueous medium. UF was carried out under both stirred and unstirred conditions using batch cells. The effect of important operating parameters (applied pressure, solutes and surfactant bulk concentra-tions) on the extent of separation of the organic solutes were observed and studied. Solubilization of these solutes in CPC micelles were also experimentally ascertained. A mathematical model developed in this study was used to describe the separation of organic solutes by MEUF and predict permeate solute concentrations under varying operating conditions. The effect of pressure and feed CPC concentration on the behaviour of permeate flux was explained {{as a consequence of the}} formation of concentration polarized layer of CPC, <b>upstream</b> of the <b>membrane</b> surface. The removal of organic solutes (phenol and aniline) were observed to increase with increase in feed CPC concentration; however, upto about 150 mM, beyond which it was more or less constant.

40|$|The human {{lymphocyte}} toxins granzyme B (hGrzB) and perforin cooperatively induce apoptosis of virus-infected or transformed cells: perforin pores enable entry of the serine protease hGrzB into the cytosol, where it processes Bid to selectively activate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Truncated Bid (tBid) induces Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeability {{and the release}} of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo. To identify cellular proteins that regulate perforin/hGrzB-mediated Bid cleavage and subsequent apoptosis, we performed a gene-knockdown (KD) screen using a lentiviral pool of short hairpin RNAs embedded within a miR 30 backbone (shRNAmiR). We transduced HeLa cells with a lentiviral pool expressing shRNAmiRs that target 1213 genes known to be involved in cell death signaling and selected cells with acquired resistance to perforin/hGrzB-mediated apoptosis. Twenty-two shRNAmiRs were identified in the positive-selection screen including two, PCAF and ADA 3, whose gene products are known to reside in the same epigenetic regulatory complexes. Small interfering (si) RNA-mediated gene-KD of PCAF or ADA 3 also conferred resistance to perforin/hGrzB-mediated apoptosis providing independent validation of the screen results. Mechanistically, PCAF and ADA 3 exerted their pro-apoptotic effect <b>upstream</b> of mitochondrial <b>membrane</b> permeabilization, as indicated by reduced cytochrome c release in PCAF-KD cells exposed to perforin/hGrzB. While overall levels of Bid were unaltered, perforin/hGrzB-mediated cleavage of Bid was reduced in PCAF-KD or ADA 3 -KD cells. We discovered that PCAF-KD or ADA 3 -KD resulted in reduced expression of PACS 2, a protein implicated in Bid trafficking to mitochondria and importantly, targeted PACS 2 -KD phenocopied the effect of PCAF-KD or ADA 3 -KD.

For instance, deficiency of P. putida ColRS system results in lowered phenol tolerance, hindrance of transposition of Tn 4652 and lysis of a subpopulation of glucose-grown bacteria. In order to discover molecular mechanisms behind these phenotypes, we focused here on identification of downstream components of ColRS signal transduction pathway. Results First, highly similar ColR binding sites were mapped <b>upstream</b> of outer <b>membrane</b> protein-encoding oprQ and a putative methyltransferase-encoding PP 0903. These two ColR binding sequences were used as an input in computational genome-wide screening for new potential ColR recognition boxes upstream of different genes in P. putida. Biological relevance {{of a set of}} in silico predicted ColR-binding sites was analysed in vivo by studying the effect of ColR on transcription from promoters carrying these sites. This analysis disclosed seven novel genes of which six were positively and one negatively regulated by ColR. Interestingly, all promoters tested responded more significantly to the over-expression than to the absence of ColR suggesting that either ColR is limiting or ColS-activating signal is low under the conditions applied. The binding sites of ColR in the promoters analysed were validated by gel mobility shift and/or DNase I footprinting assays. ColR binding consensus was defined according to seven ColR binding motifs mapped by DNase I protection assay and this consensus was used to predict minimal regulon of ColRS system. Conclusion Combined usage of experimental and computational approach enabled us to define the binding consensus for response regulator ColR and to discover several new ColR-regulated genes. For instance, genes of outer membrane lipid A 3 -O-deacylase PagL and cytoplasmic membrane diacylglycerol kinase DgkA are the members of ColR regulon. Furthermore, over 40 genes were predicted to be putatively controlled by ColRS two-component system in P. putida. It is notable that many of ColR-regulated genes encode membrane-related products thus confirming the previously proposed role of ColRS system in regulation of membrane functionality. </p...|$|R

We have examined two specific molecules in the regulated exocytotic pathway, Munc 18 c and Rab 27 a, at sites of SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion in tissues {{integral to the}} controlled maintenance of blood glucose, adipocytes and pancreatic β-cells. We have hypothesized that Munc 18 c regulates the progression of GLUT 4 storage vesicle (GSV) trafficking and fusion via the insulin-induced alteration of its binding to the t-SNARE syntaxin 4. Our results indicate that Munc 18 c interaction with a conformationally folded syntaxin 4 acts as a negative regulator GSV docking. By comparison, syntaxin 4 mutants that promote a SNARE complex-forming conformation demonstrate {{a shift in the}} state of Munc 18 c interaction that is sufficient for GSV docking, and is likely to mimic insulin activation of GSV trafficking, resulting in increased GLUT 4 at the plasma <b>membrane.</b> <b>Upstream</b> of SM proteins, Rab GTPases and their effector proteins assist with the transport to and docking of vesicles at the plasma membrane, where they are believed to interact directly with the Munc 18 /syntaxin complex. We focused on identifying sites of Rab 27 a action in the insulin secretory pathways using membrane capacitance measurements of pancreatic β-cells isolated from Rab 27 a-null (ashen) mice. We demonstrate that Rab 27 a exerts dual roles in insulin granule exocytosis, facilitating the glucose-induced refilling of releasable granule pools while also limiting release from these pools. In summary, the investigations of this dissertation support a role for Munc 18 c and Rab 27 a in controlling both the timing and magnitude of vesicle docking and priming (i. e., SNARE complex formation) at the plasma membrane, thereby acting as crucial regulators in the regulated exocytotic pathways in glucose regulatory tissues...|$|R

To this purpose, human luteinizing GC were cultured in serum-free conditions for 24 h and subsequently submitted to increasing concentrations (2 - 8 nmol/l) of recombinant non-glycosylated or partially glycosylated IGF-BP- 3 for 48 h, in {{the presence or absence of}} IGF-I, des(1 - 3) IGF-I- a truncated analog of human IGF-I with markedly reduced binding ability to IGFBPs - and FSH (5 - 20 mIU/ml). The results demonstrate that human GC release IGFBP- 1 - 2 and - 3 into the medium, and that FSH is able to inhibit this release, while GH is clearly inhibitory on IGFBP- 1 and stimulatory on IGFBP- 3. Both IGF-I and des(1 - 3) IGF-I significantly (p < 0. 001) stimulate E 2 production by human GC in culture in a manner comparable to that of FSH in the dose range used. Preincubation for 2 h at 22 C with IGFBP- 3, to allow the formation of the IGF-IGFBP complex, drastically reduced the stimulatory effect of IGF-I but not that of des(1 - 3) IGF-I. IGFBP- 3 was also able to inhibit the stimulatory effect of FSH.

The upstream pressure was l 0 ^- 3 mbar for most measurements whereas the downstream side was evacuated. The asymmetry factor A ≡ (2 σk_r) _u / (2 σk_r) _d of the membrane is then about one and independent of P at high temperatures. lt increases strongly when T is lowered from 300 to 100 °C where it reaches a value 10 ^ 3. lt depends more weakly on T below 100 °C. The value A depends on P in the intermediate T domain where, moreover, ∅_p varies non monotonously with time after changes of P : the permeation flux density increases rapidly with a characteristic permeation time of 1 sec. when the pressure is increased, then it decreases slowly (characteristic time : 1 hour) because this pressure increase leads also to the increase of A. The exposure of the membrane to a current I_e of electrons with an energy E ≳ 10 eV upstream leads, below 300 °C, to a slow decrease of A towards a new steady state value. Increases of I_e at a given E or of E at a given I_e lower this value of A. The time to reach steady state is shorter than after simple pressure variations; it decreases when I_e increases...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. This {{research}} {{work has been}} carried out to enhance the performance of the membrane unit of an Autothermal Reforming (ATR) plant. The plant in question refers to the ATR plant of one of the leading petrochemical industries in South Africa. The membrane is used to separate hydrogen from a feed of hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixture (reformed gas) containing gases such as carbon dioxide and small amounts of methane, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, water, ammonia and hydrogen cyanide. The exit streams from the membrane are permeate (hydrogen gas) and non-permeate (synthesis gas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) with trace quantities of the other aforementioned gases. This dissertation investigated into the causes of decreasing membrane hydrogen (permeate) purity and insufficient membrane capacity to achieve the required synthesis gas (non-permeate) ratio. High differential pressure across the membranes as well the presence of ammonia and water in the feed gas to the membrane fibres were some of the causes of the membranes' low performance. Others include high speed of the membrane feed gas, the presence of strongly adsorbed gas - methane and insufficient heating of the feed gas by the preheaters. These led to broken and twisted membrane fibres. As a result, carbon monoxide and other constituents of the feed slipped into the permeate stream. From the {{research work}}, ways of enhancing the performance of the membrane unit were proffered. They include integrating a Pressure Swing Adsorption unit (<b>upstream)</b> with the <b>membrane</b> unit, recycling the permeate back to the feed stream, increasing the temperature of the feed gas and lowering the differential pressure across the membranes. Furthermore, the condensate should be prevented from getting to the membrane fibres by installing a drying unit, a demister unit or drains in the membrane feed gas header. In addition, periodic maintenance and backwashing should be carried out on the membranes. However, recommendations were made on further study regarding the cost impacts of implementing the ways of optimizing the membrane unit and simulation of the membrane unit's operation. The latter was suggested in order to obtain the process variables and parameters for improving the performance of the unit in question. Master...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design, operation and control of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) systems, employing state of the art system engineering tools. A detailed mathematical model is developed which captures the hydrodynamic, mass transfer and equilibrium effects in detail to represent the real PSA operation. The first detailed case study presented in this work deals with the design of an explicit/multi-parametric model predictive controller for the operation of a PSA system comprising four adsorbent beds undergoing nine process steps, separating 70 % H 2, 30 % CH 4 mixture into high purity hydrogen. The key controller objective is to fast track H 2 purity to a set point value of 99. 99 %, manipulating time duration of the adsorption step, under the effect of process disturbances. To perform the task, a rigorous and systematic framework is employed comprising four main steps of model development, system identification, the mp-MPC formulation, and in-silico closed loop validation, respectively. Detailed comparison studies of the derived explicit MPC controller are also performed with the conventional PID controllers, for a multitude of disturbance scenarios. Following the controller design, a detailed design and control optimization study is presented which incorporates the design, operational and control aspects of PSA operation simultaneously, with the objective of improving real time operability. This is in complete contrast to the traditional approach for the design of process systems, which employs a two step sequential method of first design and then control. A systematic and rigorous methodology is employed towards this purpose and is applied to a two-bed, six-step PSA system represented by a rigorous mathematical model, where the key optimization objective is to maximize the expected H 2 recovery while achieving a closed loop product H 2 purity of 99. 99 %, for separating 70 % H 2, 30 % CH 4 feed. Furthermore, two detailed comparative studies are also conducted. In the first study, the optimal design and control configuration obtained from the simultaneous and sequential approaches are compared in detail. In the second study, an mp-MPC controller is designed to investigate any further improvements in the closed loop response of the optimal PSA system. The final area of research work is related to the development of an industrial scale, integrated PSA-membrane separation system. Here, the key objective is to enhance the overall recovery of "fuel cell ready" 99. 99 % pure hydrogen, produced from the steam methane reforming route, where PSA is usually employed as the purification system. In the first stage, the stand-alone PSA and membrane configurations are optimized performing dynamic simulations on the mathematical model. During this procedure, both <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>membrane</b> configuration are investigated in detail. For the hybrid configuration, membrane area and PSA cycle time are chosen as the key design parameters. Furthermore, life cycle analysis studies are performed on the hybrid system to evaluate its environmental impact in comparison to the stand-alone PSA system.
