25|$|A {{capacitor}} labeled or {{designated as}} 473K 330V has a capacitance of 47 × 103pF = 47nF (±10%) {{with a maximum}} working voltage of 330V. The working voltage of a capacitor is nominally the highest voltage that may be applied across it without <b>undue</b> <b>risk</b> of breaking down the dielectric layer.|$|E

25|$|Approximately one {{in three}} {{donations}} in the US, UK, and Israel is now from a live donor. Potential donors are carefully evaluated on medical and psychological grounds. This ensures that the donor is fit for surgery and has no disease which brings <b>undue</b> <b>risk</b> or likelihood of a poor outcome for either the donor or recipient. The psychological assessment is to ensure the donor gives informed consent and is not coerced. In countries where paying for organs is illegal, the authorities may also seek {{to ensure that a}} donation has not resulted from a financial transaction.|$|E

2500|$|On April 11, 1987, SMU {{formally}} {{canceled the}} 1988 season. Acting president William Stallcup said {{that under the}} circumstances, SMU could not possibly field a competitive team in 1988. [...] The only way SMU could have returned that year, Stallcup said, was with [...] "walk-ons and {{only a handful of}} scholarship athletes and continuing players." [...] Under these circumstances, Stallcup and other officials felt the players would have faced [...] "an <b>undue</b> <b>risk</b> of serious injury." [...] By this time, {{more than half of the}} Mustangs' scholarship players had transferred to other schools. [...] Also, according to Southwest Conference commissioner Fred Jacoby, there would not have been nearly enough time to find a coach, and the school still did not have a permanent replacement for Hitch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} apply force {{selectively}} and flexibly {{will become increasingly}} important in maintaining the morale and will {{of the free world}} to resist aggression. As the fear of nuclear war grows, the United States and its allies must never allow themselves to get into the position where they must choose between (a) not responding to local aggression and (b) applying force in a way which our own people or our allies would consider entails <b>undue</b> <b>risk</b> of nuclear devastation. However, the United States cannot afford to preclude itself from using nuclear weapons even in a local situation, if such use[...] [...] will best advance U.S. security interests. In the last analysis, if confronted by the choice of (a) acquiescing in Communist aggression or (b) taking measures risking either general war or loss of allied support, the United States must be prepared to take these risks if necessary for its security.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} {{constraint on}} new categories of health manpower {{is the absence}} of statutory legitimation of their roles. Licensure has been evolved as an effort to assure high-quality health care, but recently it has been a barrier to effective and innovative use of manpower. Medical and Nurse Practice Acts generally define the practices of medicine and nursing, but they do not define clearly the scope of these practices. Thus, these acts subject physicians to <b>undue</b> <b>risks</b> in delegating responsibilities and Type A assistants (nurses or non-nurses with special training) to <b>undue</b> <b>risks</b> in accepting those functions. Furthermore, only vague guidelines are provided to protect the public and to assure adequate quality control. To date, 35 States have enacted legislation to provide statutory legitimation of Type A assisants and to permit physicians to delegate appropriate responsibilities to new types of health manpower. It is hoped that this legislation will diminish barriers to effective use of health manpower...|$|R

30|$|Naturally, {{financial}} markets are one channel through which inflation might restrict investment productivity and hence real growth 3. The financial liberalization theory sentences that inflationary finance retards {{the development of}} financial systems, thereby provoking lower levels of investment and reduced capital productivity, unless governments introduce measures to liberate {{financial markets}} and promote free-market competition (Shaw 1973; McKinnon 1973; Roubini and Sala-i-Martin 1992). In an inflationary environment, private agents usually avoid longer-term contracts because of possible cost raises related to interest rate uncertainty. In addition, financial intermediaries would prefer to keep liquid portfolios to avert <b>undue</b> <b>risks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Critics of bad banks {{argue that}} the {{prospect}} that the state will take over non-performing loans encourages banks to take <b>undue</b> <b>risks,</b> which they otherwise would not, i.e. a moral hazard in risk-taking. Another criticism is that the option of handing the loan over to the bad bank becomes essentially a subsidy on corporate bankruptcy. Instead of developing {{a company that is}} temporarily unable to pay, the bondholder is given an incentive to sue for bankruptcy immediately, which makes it eligible for sale to a bad bank. Thus, it can become a subsidy for banks on the expense of small businesses.|$|R
