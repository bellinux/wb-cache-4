5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E
5|$|Estimated {{numbers of}} Calusa at the {{beginning}} of the Spanish occupation ranged from 4,000 to 7,000. The society declined in power and population; by 1697 their number was estimated to be about 1,000. In the early 18th century, the Calusa came <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> the Yamasee to the north. They asked the Spanish for refuge in Cuba, where almost 200 died of illness. Soon they were relocated again to the Florida Keys.|$|E
5|$|Having been forewarned {{about the}} attack, the Portuguese {{commander}} {{had been able}} to begin preparations for the assault; however, he had planned on receiving a frontal assault and when the force came <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> the rear he was completely surprised.

5|$|The novel interweaves {{two major}} plots into a fictional world called the Four Lands. One follows the protagonist Shea Ohmsford on {{his quest to}} obtain the Sword of Shannara {{and use it to}} confront the Warlock Lord (the antagonist). The other plot shadows Prince Balinor Buckhannah's attempt to oust his insane brother Palance from the throne of Callahorn while the country and its capital (Tyrsis) come <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> {{overwhelming}} armies of the Warlock Lord. Throughout the novel, underlying themes appear of mundane heroism and nuclear holocaust.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangle}} {{was already}} <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> two sides by Lieutenant General George Patton's Third Army and Lieutenant General Alexander Patch's Seventh Army. The German position soon crumbled and Hitler reluctantly sanctioned a withdrawal. The First and Seventh Armies suffered heavy losses: around 113,000 Germans casualties {{at the cost}} of 17,000 on the Allied side. Nonetheless, they had avoided encirclement and managed to conduct a skilful delaying action, evacuating the last troops to the east bank of the Rhine on 25 March 1945.|$|E

During the summer of 1944, elements of the division were tasked with guarding Hungarian Jewish forced labourers building fortifications in Tuzla. While guarding the labourers, they subjected them to cruel treatment, and shot 22 who were unable to continue working.|$|E

50|$|Other historians {{doubt the}} historicity of this legend. According to A. K. Majumdar, {{the king of}} Naddula was a {{relatively}} insignificant ruler, {{and it is hard}} to believe that so many major rulers left their kingdoms to attend his ceremony at a time when northern India was <b>under</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> Mahmud of Ghazni. Moreover, it is unlikely that Durlabharaja would have been able to defeat a confederacy of all these powerful kings.|$|R
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new factory in Karis, a location considered less likely than Helsinki to come <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E

The Tomaras continued to rule for a few more decades, but as vassals of the Chahamanas.|$|R
5|$|In January 1099 on {{the journey}} to Jerusalem during the First Crusade, the company of Raymond IV of Toulouse came <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> the {{garrison}} of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond's foragers. The following day Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February {{of the same year}} but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.|$|E

MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at a distance and witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship. He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed to damage the ships. Most of the Hurricanes that took off from the Argus fell into the water out of fuel. The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had come <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines.|$|E

5|$|The British Empire {{had been}} in {{transition}} since the 1920s, and the pace accelerated {{in the wake of}} the Second World War. More and more member states demanded independence, and a series of crises erupted during the 1950s, including the 1952 Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya and the Suez Crisis of 1956. During the same period immigration into Britain from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean was on the increase, causing some resentment among elements of the native population. At the time Kneale was working on his scripts black communities in Nottingham and London came <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> mobs of white Britons; Kneale became keen to develop the serial as an allegory for the emerging racial tensions that culminated in the Notting Hill race riots of August and September 1958.|$|E
5|$|The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, {{also known}} as The Destroying Angel and Daemons Inflicting Divine Vengeance on the Wicked and Intemperate and The Destruction of the Temple of Vice, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832. Etty had become famous for nude paintings, and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency {{and a lack of}} creativity. With The Destroying Angel he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8cm by 101.9cm (50in by 40in) and depicts a classical temple <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> a destroying angel and a group of daemons. Some of the human occupants are dead or unconscious, others flee in terror or struggle helplessly against the daemons.|$|E
