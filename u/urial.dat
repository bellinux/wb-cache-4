5|$|The <b>urial</b> (O. vignei) {{was once}} {{thought to have been}} a forebear of {{domestic}} sheep, as they occasionally interbreed with mouflon in the Iranian part of their range. However, the <b>urial,</b> argali (O. ammon), and snow sheep (O. nivicola) have a different number of chromosomes than other Ovis species, making a direct relationship implausible, and phylogenetic studies show no evidence of <b>urial</b> ancestry. Further studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep showed significant genetic differences between the two. Two explanations for this phenomenon have been posited. The first explanation is that a currently unknown species or subspecies of wild sheep that contributed to the formation of domestic sheep. The second explanation is that this variation is the result of multiple waves of capture from wild mouflon, similar to the known development of other livestock.|$|E

50|$|The mouflon (Ovis orientalis orientalis group) is a {{subspecies}} {{group of}} the wild sheep (Ovis orientalis). Populations of O. orientalis can be partitioned into the mouflons (orientalis group) and the <b>urials</b> (vignei group). The mouflon {{is thought to be}} one of the two ancestors for all modern domestic sheep breeds.|$|R
50|$|Current {{taxonomy}} in {{some sources}} such as MSW and ITIS treats the mouflons and <b>urials</b> as subspecies of the domestic sheep, Ovis aries Linn. 1758.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} expansion projects under Bigalke's directorship of the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa {{was the creation of}} the mountain area exhibits {{to the north of the}} zoo. These habitats today house Bengal tigers, lions, <b>urials</b> and Nubian ibex. It has been remarked that the establishment of these large enclosures marked the beginning of the end of small cages for zoo animals.|$|R

25|$|The bharal or blue sheep is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mountain ungulate in the Ladakh region, {{although it is not}} found in some parts of Zangskar and Sham areas. The Asiatic ibex is a very elegant mountain goat that is distributed {{in the western part of}} Ladakh. It is the second most abundant mountain ungulate in the region with a population of about 6000 individuals. It is adapted to rugged areas where it easily climbs when threatened. The Ladakhi <b>Urial</b> is another unique mountain sheep that inhabits the mountains of Ladakh. The population is declining, however, and there are not more than 3000 individuals left in Ladakh. The <b>urial</b> is endemic to Ladakh, where it is distributed only along two major river valleys: the Indus and Shayok. The animal is often persecuted by farmers whose crops are allegedly damaged by it. Its population declined precipitously in the last century due to indiscriminate shooting by hunters along the Leh-Srinagar highway. The Tibetan argali or Nyan is the largest wild sheep in the world, standing 3.5 to 4 feet at the shoulder with the horn measuring 90–100cm. It is distributed on the Tibetan plateau and its marginal mountains encompassing a total area of 2.5 million km2. There is only a small population of about 400 animals in Ladakh. The animal prefers open and rolling terrain as it runs, unlike wild goats that climb into steep cliffs, to escape from predators. The endangered Tibetan antelope, known as chiru in Indian English, or Ladakhi tsos, has traditionally been hunted for its wool (shahtoosh) which is a natural fiber of the finest quality and thus valued for its light weight and warmth and as a status symbol. The wool of chiru must be pulled out by hand, a process done after the animal is killed. The fiber is smuggled into Kashmir and woven into exquisite shawls by Kashmiri workers. Ladakh is also home to the Tibetan gazelle, which inhabits the vast rangelands in eastern Ladakh bordering Tibet.|$|E

50|$|The {{area was}} one of the last strongholds of the Caspian tiger, whose tracks were seen in the reserve for the last time in 1953. As of today, Tigrovaya Balka is still home to the {{original}} main prey of the tiger, the rare Bactrian deer. Other larger species of the reserve include striped hyenas, golden jackals, swamp cats, wild boars, goitered gazelles, porcupines, the introduced nutrias, gray wolves, red foxes and in hills also <b>urials.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kirthar National Park کيرٿرنيشنل پارڪ is {{situated}} in the Kirthar Mountains in Karachi and Jamshoro District in Sindh, Pakistan. It was founded in 1974 and stretches over 3,087 km2, making it the second largest national park in Pakistan after Hingol National Park. The fauna comprises Indian leopards, striped hyenas, Indian wolves, ratels, <b>urials,</b> chinkara gazelles and rare Sind wild goats. Blackbuck antelopes are kept in enclosures for a reintroduction project at Kirthar National Park. Most large predators have been killed with the last leopard shot in 1977.|$|R
25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on bharals (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex and argali, a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as markhors and <b>urials),</b> other goat-like ruminants such as Himalayan tahr and gorals, plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists of marmots, woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such as the snow cock and chukar.|$|R
50|$|The {{conservation}} {{status of the}} <b>urial</b> is threatened as their habitat is perfectly suitable for human development; however the <b>urial</b> population has been recovering in recent years.|$|E
50|$|The {{local people}} do not have any right of grazing, lopping or {{firewood}} collection as the ownership lies with the provincial government. The park area falls in the natural habitat of <b>urial</b> and chinkara, and also provides suitable habitat to hog deer. The <b>urial</b> is associated with scrub forest of Olea species and Accassia species. <b>Urial</b> were once abundant in the area but due to continuous habitat destruction these were disappeared from the area in the near past. The natural habitat of <b>urial</b> and chinkara lies in close proximity of human habitation.|$|E

40|$|Sheep {{are thought}} to {{have been one of the}} first {{livestock}} to be domesticated in the Near East, thus playing an important role in human history. The current whole mitochondrial genome phylogeny for the genus Ovis is based on: the five main domestic haplogroups occurring among sheep (O. aries), along with molecular data from two wild European mou-flons, three <b>urials,</b> and one argali. With the aim to shed some further light on the phyloge-netic relationship within this genus, the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a Cypriot mouflon (O. gmelini ophion) is here reported. Phylogenetic analyses were per-formed using a dataset of wholeOvismitogenomes as well as D-loop sequences. The concatenated sequence of 28 mitochondrial genes of one Cypriot mouflon, and the D-loop sequence of three Cypriot mouflons were compared to sequences obtained from samples representatives of the five domestic sheep haplogroups along with samples of the extant wild and feral sheep. The sample included also individuals from the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica hosting remnants of the first wave of domestication that likely went then back to feral life.

5000|$|The {{biosphere}} reserve {{is home to}} the largest area of juniper forest (Juniperus excelsa) in Pakistan, covering about 110,000 hectares. It is believed that the forest is the second largest {{of its kind in the}} world. The juniper species found there are of global significance because of their advanced age and slow growth rate. In fact, the junipers of Ziarat are among the oldest living trees in the world. Although no dendrological study has yet been conducted, according to one estimate, the age of a mature tree in Ziarat can exceed 5,000 years. Local people refer to the trees as [...] "living fossils". Their remarkable longevity allows research on past weather conditions in the region, making the species of particular significance for studies on climate change and ecology.The juniper forest ecosystem of Ziarat provides a habitat for endangered wildlife species and supports a rich variety of plant species. Because of the ecosystem's biodiversity, various parts of it have been designated protected areas, including wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves. The mountain ranges, including the Khilafat Hills, consist of a core habitat that reportedly hosts several globally important wild species, among them markhors, <b>urials,</b> black bears and wolves. The forest also serves as a habitat for a number of other animals: Afghan pikas, foxes, jackals and several species of migratory birds. However, anthropological factors such as illegal hunting, human habitations and livestock grazing have encroached on the wildlife habitats, leading to their fragmentation. The human population, distributed across various sub-tribes and clans, is concentrated in valleys, although small settlements are visible on mountain slopes. There are over 100,000 people living within or in close proximity to the {{biosphere reserve}}, most of whom are agropastoralists. Almost 40 percent of the population migrates for three to four months during the winter to abodes in Harnai.Livestock was formerly the primary source of livelihood in the reserve. Today, it has been displaced by the development of agriculture and, in particular, the promotion of horticultural crops such as apple and cherry orchards.|$|R
