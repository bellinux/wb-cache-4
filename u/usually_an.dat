5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> {{acute and}} {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> anthracycline. Care {{must be taken to}} prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
25|$|Ligand binding assay when <b>a</b> ligand (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> small molecule) binds <b>a</b> {{receptor}} (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> large protein).|$|R
50|$|The ODB {{is led by}} <b>an</b> 18A, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> major, who is {{the company}} {{commander}} (CO). The CO is assisted by his company executive officer (XO), another 18A, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> captain. The XO is himself assisted by a company technician, a 180A, generally a chief warrant officer three, who assists {{in the direction of}} the organization, training, intelligence, counter-intelligence, and operations for the company and its detachments. The company commander is assisted by the company sergeant major, <b>an</b> 18Z, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> Sergeant Major. A second 18Z acts as the operations sergeant, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> Master Sergeant, who assists the XO and technician in their operational duties. He has an 18F assistant operations sergeant, who is <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> Sergeant First Class. The company's support comes from an 18D medical sergeant, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> Sergeant First Class, and two 18E communications sergeants, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> Sergeant First Class and a Staff Sergeant.|$|R
50|$|Police Authorities were <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> {{board of}} members {{consisting}} of local councillors and independent members appointed directly {{to serve in}} that role. At least one was <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> Magistrate.|$|R
5|$|The {{absolute}} {{minimum requirement}} of any body of Freemasons {{is that the}} candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character. There is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying assumption is that the candidate should be a mature adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} are generally {{performed by a}} traditional circumciser (cutter or exciseuse) in the girls' homes, with or without anaesthesia. The cutter is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> older woman, but in communities where the male barber has {{assumed the role of}} health worker he will perform FGM too.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of Qadi was <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> one-year role, and {{was appointed by}} the central Ottoman government, whilst the muftis were <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> member for a notable family in the town.|$|R
50|$|The second-in-command of a {{battalion}} or regiment is <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> major. The second-in-command of a company, squadron, or artillery battery (in {{which he or}} she is called the battery captain) is <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> captain (although infantry company second-in-commands were usually lieutenants until after the Second World War), the second-in-command of a platoon or troop is the platoon or troop sergeant, and the second-in-command of <b>a</b> section is <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> lance corporal.|$|R
25|$|Theme {{camps are}} <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> {{collective}} of people representing themselves {{under a single}} identity. Villages are <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> collection of smaller theme camps which have banded together in order to share resources and vie for better placement.|$|R
5|$|During {{the final}} stages, {{the patient is}} {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this position is widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> equivalent to corrector.|$|E
5|$|Selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with {{temperature}} changes, depending somewhat on {{the rate}} of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50°C and converts to gray selenium at 180°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.|$|E
50|$|Karagöz can be deceitful, lewd, {{and even}} violent. Other {{characters}} in these plays are the drunkard Tuzsuz Deli Bekir with his wine bottle, the long-necked Uzun Efe, the opium addict Kanbur Tiryaki with his pipe, Altı Kariş Beberuhi (an eccentric dwarf), the half-wit Denyo, the spendthrift Civan, and Nigâr, a flirtatious woman. There {{may also be}} dancers and djinns, and various portrayals of non-Turks: an Arab who knows no Turkish (typically a beggar or sweet-seller), a black servant woman, a Circassian servant girl, an Albanian security guard, <b>a</b> Greek (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> doctor), <b>an</b> Armenian (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> footman or money-changer), <b>a</b> Jew (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> goldsmith or scrap-dealer), <b>a</b> Laz (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> boatman), or an Iranian (who recites poetry with an Azeri accent).|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> QA implementation, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> {{computer}} program, may construct its answers by querying {{a structured}} database of knowledge or information, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> knowledge base. More commonly, QA systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents.|$|R

5|$|The Mana series {{features}} several recurring {{characters and}} beings, including Final Fantasy creatures such as Chocobos in Final Fantasy Adventure and Legend of Mana, {{as well as}} Moogles in Secret of Mana and as a status ailment in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Sword of Mana. Watts is a dwarf blacksmith wearing a horned helmet who upgrades the player's weaponry. <b>Usually,</b> <b>an</b> anthropomorphic cat merchant is found outside of town areas and allows a player to save the game and buy supplies at high prices. This role is played by Neko in Secret of Mana, and Niccolo in Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana. In the Japanese games these merchants share the name Nikita.|$|E
5|$|The Persians {{found the}} Ionians {{difficult}} to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus {{was able to}} identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects – such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, {{and have to be}} replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.|$|E
5|$|The {{curriculum}} emphasizes writing; {{students are}} required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and are required to complete a research paper during their third year. All students must pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually in their area of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis is required of all students. <b>Usually</b> <b>an</b> analytic or expository essay, it may also be a piece of original fiction, poetry, a performance or work of visual art. Students are encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public is invited to the presentations.|$|E
50|$|A {{synchronous}} orbit is an orbit in which <b>an</b> orbiting body (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> satellite) has a period {{equal to the}} average rotational period of the body being orbited (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> planet), {{and in the same}} direction of rotation as that body.|$|R
50|$|Each tintype is <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> camera original, so {{the image}} is <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> mirror image, {{reversed}} left to right from reality. Sometimes the camera was fitted with a mirror or right-angle prism so that the end result would be right-reading.|$|R
25|$|Carnatic {{music is}} <b>usually</b> {{performed}} by <b>a</b> small ensemble of musicians, consisting of <b>a</b> principal performer (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> vocalist), <b>a</b> melodic accompaniment (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> violin), <b>a</b> rhythm accompaniment (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> mridangam), and a tambura, which {{acts as a}} drone throughout the performance. Other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena. The most outstanding performances, and the greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians, {{are to be found}} in the city of Chennai. Various festivals are held throughout India and abroad which mainly consist of Carnatic music performances, such as the Madras Music Season, which has been considered to be one of the world's largest cultural events.|$|R
5|$|The {{fusion of}} two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> {{exothermic}} process that releases {{more energy than}} is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{secondary}} motive for men, especially young males, for learning the agung: the ability to interact with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to or related to by blood) and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection. Among the Maguindanao, the rhythmic modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried women on the kulintang. Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, {{could also be used}} but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> older woman.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{animated}} theatrical films {{based on}} the One Piece series have been released in Japan. The films are typically released in March {{in accordance with the}} spring vacation of Japanese schools. The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.|$|E
5000|$|In old Abyssinia or Ethiopia, Hakim <b>usually</b> meant <b>a</b> learned person, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> physician. Hence a Hakim-Bejt was a doctor's {{house or}} {{hospital}} ...|$|R
50|$|The landau's {{center section}} might contain a fixed full-height glazed door, or more <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> low half-door. There would <b>usually</b> be <b>a</b> {{separate}} raised open driver's upholstered bench-seat, but a landau could be postilion-driven, {{and there was}} <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> separate groom's seat, sprung above and behind the rear axle, saving the groom from having to stand on a running board.|$|R
50|$|In the Barbagia {{region on}} the island of Sardinia, there are two {{different}} styles of polyphonic singing:cuncordu, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> form of sacred music, sung with regular voices, and tenore, <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> form of profane music, marked by the use of overtone singing.|$|R
5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of aphthous stomatitis, {{accounting}} for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration (MiAU), or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10mm in diameter (usually about 2–3mm), and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and buccal mucosa, lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of ulceration, there is <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> ulcer-free period of variable length.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|Breeding occurs {{from late}} August through to January, though heavy rain in August may delay this. The nest is {{built by the}} female; it is a round or domed {{structure}} made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side {{close to the ground}} and well-concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation, such as Acacia pulchella or a species of Hakea. One or two broods may be laid during the breeding season. A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 × 16mm (½×⅝in), are laid. Incubation takes about two weeks. The female incubates the eggs for 14 or 15days; after hatching, nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10–13days, by which time they are fledged. Young birds remain in the family group as helpers {{for a year or more}} before moving to another group, <b>usually</b> <b>an</b> adjacent one, or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods.|$|E
50|$|The letters S (Start) and F (Finish) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} {{the first and last}} paid days. For example, a cast member's first paid day (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> rehearsal day) appears as SR; the last paid day (<b>usually</b> <b>a</b> work day) appears as WF.|$|R
