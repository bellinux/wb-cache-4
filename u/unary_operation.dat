25|$|While we {{have not}} shown the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box and a dark box, neither one containing a circle. However we could put a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a <b>unary</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Now {{what is an}} atom? Conventionally an atom {{is either}} a {{constant}} (0 or 1) or a variable x'i where 0 ≤ i < n. For the proof technique here it is convenient to define atoms instead to be n-ary operations n'f'i, which although treated here as atoms nevertheless mean the same as ordinary terms of the exact form n'f'i(x0,...,x'n-1) (exact in that the variables must listed in the order shown without repetition or omission). This is not a restriction because atoms of this form include all the ordinary atoms, namely the constants 0 and 1, which arise here as the n-ary operations n'f0 and n'f−1 for each n (abbreviating 22n−1 to −1), and the variables x0,...,x'n-1 {{as can be seen}} from the truth tables where x0 appears as both the <b>unary</b> <b>operation</b> 1f2 and the binary operation 2f10 while x1 appears as 2f12.|$|E
25|$|Given a lattice with {{a bottom}} element 0 {{and a top}} element 1, a pair x,y of {{elements}} is called complementary when x∧y= 0 and x∨y= 1, and we then say that y is a complement of x and vice versa. Any element x of a distributive lattice with top and bottom can have at most one complement. When every element of a lattice has a complement the lattice is called complemented. It follows that in a complemented distributive lattice, the complement of an element always exists and is unique, making complement a <b>unary</b> <b>operation.</b> Furthermore, every complemented distributive lattice forms a Boolean algebra, and conversely every Boolean algebra forms a complemented distributive lattice. This provides an alternative definition of a Boolean algebra, namely as any complemented distributive lattice. Each of these three properties can be axiomatized with finitely many equations, whence these equations taken together constitute a finite axiomatization of the equational theory of Boolean algebras.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that the {{congruence}} lattice ConA of an algebra A is uniquely determined by the <b>unary</b> polynomial <b>operations</b> of A (see e. g. [K. Denecke, S. L. Wismath, Universal Algebra and Applications in Theoretical Computer Science, Chapman & Hall, CRC Press, Boca Raton, London, New York, Washington DC, 2002 [2]]). Let A be a finite algebra with |A|=n. If Imf=A or |Imf|= 1 for every <b>unary</b> polynomial <b>operation</b> f of A, then A is called a permutation algebra. Permutation algebras {{play an important role in}} tame congruence theory [D. Hobby, R. McKenzie, The structure of finite algebras, Contemporary Mathematics, vol. 76, Providence, Rhode Island, 1988 [3]]. If f:A→A is not a permutation then A⊃Imf and there is a least natural number λ(f) with Imfλ(f) =Imfλ(f) + 1. We consider <b>unary</b> <b>operations</b> with λ(f) =n- 1 for n⩾ 2 and λ(f) =n- 2 for n⩾ 3 and look for equivalence relations on A which are invariant with respect to such <b>unary</b> <b>operations.</b> As application we show that every finite group which has a <b>unary</b> polynomial <b>operation</b> with one of these properties is simple or has only normal subgroups of index 2...|$|R
500|$|The sum a + b can be {{interpreted}} as a binary operation that combines a and b, in an algebraic sense, or it can {{be interpreted}} as the addition of b more units to a. Under the latter interpretation, the parts of a sum [...] play asymmetric roles, and the operation [...] is viewed as applying the <b>unary</b> <b>operation</b> +b to a. Instead of calling both a and b addends, it is more appropriate to call a the augend in this case, since a plays a passive role. The unary view is also useful when discussing subtraction, because each unary addition operation has an inverse unary subtraction operation, and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} the {{complement}} is unique, we write [...] and equivalently, [...] A bounded lattice for which every element has a complement {{is called a}} complemented lattice. The corresponding <b>unary</b> <b>operation</b> over L, called complementation, introduces an analogue of logical negation into lattice theory. The complement is not necessarily unique, nor {{does it have a}} special status among all possible unary operations over L. A complemented lattice that is also distributive is a Boolean algebra. For a distributive lattice, the complement of x, when it exists, is unique.|$|E

Further, this function is linear, and thus is a linear operator on the vector space of sequences, denoted Σ. The inverse operator is the finite difference operator, Δ. These behave as discrete analogs of integration and differentiation, only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable.
