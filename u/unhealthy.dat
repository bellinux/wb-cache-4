5|$|An acute {{shortage}} of housing {{after the fall}} of the Communist regime in 1990 led some Albanians to set up home in abandoned bunkers, though the lack of running water and sanitation meant that the area around inhabited bunkers soon became contaminated and <b>unhealthy.</b> A few bunkers have found more creative uses.

5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and <b>unhealthy</b> eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, over-sized products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger six-pack, the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line. These new offerings, and others like them, have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of <b>unhealthy</b> fats and trans-fats in these items. Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives.|$|E

He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the <b>unhealthy</b> living environments and treatments of men in prisons so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{discrete}} choice experiment with real economic incentives, this paper studies {{one of the}} most well-known governmental mechanisms of nudging consumers towards a healthier way of eating, namely food fiscal policies. The experimental design varies food prices of healthier and <b>unhealthier</b> alternatives of food products for children as part of specific food fiscal policies. We also examine the interplay of children’s pestering power as well as information about the fiscal policies. Results from our lab experiment suggest that (a) implementing a fat tax and a subsidy simultaneously can nudge parents to choose healthier food products, (b) that providing information regarding the food fiscal policies in place can further increase the impact of the intervention, and (c) kid’s pestering power is one of the causes of the policies’ moderate effectiveness as it strongly affects parents in making <b>unhealthier</b> choices. ...|$|R

5|$|Young Gaudí {{suffered}} from poor health, including rheumatism, {{which may have}} contributed to his reticent and reserved character. These health concerns and the hygienist theories of Dr. Kneipp contributed to Gaudí's decision to adopt vegetarianism early in his life. His religious faith and strict vegetarianism led him to undertake several lengthy and severe fasts. These fasts were often <b>unhealthy</b> and occasionally, as in 1894, led to life-threatening illness.|$|E
5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both of scoring {{and setting up}} goals, due to his passing accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, balance, and excellent dribbling skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat opponents, and withstand physical challenges. Despite his talent, he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour and aggression on the pitch. His turbulent and often <b>unhealthy</b> lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to have affected his career.|$|E
40|$|In general, {{inhabitants}} of low socio-economic areas are <b>unhealthier</b> than {{inhabitants of}} high socio-economic areas, but some areas are {{an exception to}} this rule. These exceptions imply that other factors besides the socio-economic level of an area contribute {{to the health of}} the inhabitants of an area, e. g. environmental factors. In our study we concentrate on areas within the Netherlands that are healthier or <b>unhealthier</b> than could be expected based on their socio-economic level. This study first identifies these areas and secondly determines which area characteristics distinguish these areas from those areas where the level of health is in agreement with their socio-economic level. We used nation-wide data on neighbourhood differences in population composition (gender, age, marital status and ethnicity), urbanisation and two health indicators: mortality and hospitalisation rates. In the Netherlands, many areas are healthier or <b>unhealthier</b> than could be expected based on their income level alone. Areas with higher mortality rates than expected are mainly urban areas with high percentages of elderly people and persons living alone. Similar but opposite associations are observed for areas with lower mortality rates than expected, which are further characterised by a low percentage of non-western immigrants. Areas with lower hospitalisation rates than expected are mainly rural areas with few non-western immigrants. From these results, we conclude that urbanisation and residential segregation based on age, ethnicity and marital status might be important contributors to geographical health inequalitie...|$|R

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to obtain main cognitive dimensions, and MCA was used to detect and explore relationships between cognitive, clinical, physical, and lifestyle variables. Two PCA dimensions were identified (general cognition/executive function and memory), and two MCA dimensions were retained. Poorer cognitive performance was associated with older age, less school years, <b>unhealthier</b> lifestyle indicators, and presence of pathology. The first MCA dimension indicated the clustering of general/executive function and lifestyle indicators and education, while the second association was between memory and clinical parameters and age. The clustering analysis with object scores method was used to identify groups sharing similar characteristics. The weaker cognitive clusters in terms of memory and executive function comprised individuals with characteristics contributing to a higher MCA dimensional mean score (age, less education, and presence of indicators of <b>unhealthier</b> lifestyle habits and/or clinical pathologies) ...|$|R
