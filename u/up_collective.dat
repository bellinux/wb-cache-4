50|$|In forward flight, a helicopter's flight {{controls}} behave more {{like those in}} a fixed-wing aircraft. Moving the cyclic forward makes the nose pitch down, thus losing altitude and increasing airspeed. Moving the cyclic back makes the nose pitch up, slowing the helicopter and making it climb. Increasing collective (power) while maintaining a constant airspeed induces a climb, while decreasing collective (power) makes the helicopter descend. Coordinating these two inputs, down collective plus aft (back) cyclic or <b>up</b> <b>collective</b> plus forward cyclic causes airspeed changes while maintaining a constant altitude.

50|$|Prior to 1986, {{there was}} no {{structured}} reception for asylum seekers in Belgium. The federal government considered the Public Social Welfare Centres responsible for this and paid for their support services. In 1986, Belgium saw a steep {{rise in the number}} of asylum requests, owing in part to conflicts in Eastern Europe, Iraq and Iran, Ethiopia and Eritrea, which were displacing great waves of refugees. The federal government therefore decided to set <b>up</b> <b>collective</b> reception locations. The first to open, in November 1986, was the ‘Petit Château’, a former military barracks in Brussels, but by the end of 1992, it was no longer able to accommodate the flow of refugees. A total of almost 27,000 asylum seekers arrived in Belgium in 1993, which led the federal government to open multiple centres across the country. Over the years, Fedasil has needed to expand or reduce its reception capacity depending on the number of asylum seekers on Belgian soil. In the years 1999 and 2000, for example, Belgium saw a steep {{rise in the number of}} asylum requests. The year 2000, which also saw the one-off regularisation campaign, broke all records with 42,691 requests.|$|E
5000|$|However, the Popular Front {{strategy}} was adopted and, in the 1936 election, the coalition became majority and, {{for the first}} time, the SFIO obtained more votes and seats than the Radical Party. In this, Léon Blum became France's first Socialist President of the Council in 1936, while the PCF supported - without participation - his government. A general strike applauded the socialists' victory, while Marceau Pivert cried [...] "Tout est possible!" [...] ("Everything is possible!"). Pivert would later split and create the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (PSOP); historian Daniel Guérin was {{also a member of}} the latter. Trotsky advised the GBL to break with the SFIO, leading to a confused departure by the Trotskyists from the Socialist Party in early 1936, which drew only about six hundred people from the party. The 1936 Matignon Accords set <b>up</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining, and removed all obstacles to union organisation. The terms included a blanket 7-12 percent wage increase, and allowed for paid vacation (2 weeks) and a 40-hour work week — the eight-hour day had been established following the 1914-18 war of attrition and its mobilisation of industrial capacities.|$|E

50|$|While it {{is widely}} {{believed}} that top communist leaders initiated reforms since 1986, it is also argued that villagers brought changes in national politics, resulting in the demise of collective farming. Farmers in the north resisted collective farming as the state enlarged it following the reunification. Means by which they were opposed included criticizing leaders in public, stealing grains, and showing laziness about working on collective fields and attempting to earn as much as outside the collective farming with diligent farming and more fertilizer. With cooperative situations worsening, the state conducted investigations; the Communist Party’s Agriculture Committee acknowledged the stagnation of agricultural and livestock production. Moreover, officials working at a research institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Committee emphasized that material incentives and more opportunities to do family farming be given to farmers, which was backed by some of high-ranking party and government officials. Changes in the government stance toward collective farming led to the adaptation of Directive 100 (product contract) in January 1981. The product contract arrangement initially brought positive impact on production; nevertheless, villagers continued to express their frustration with the system, particularly high quotas and corruption. Furthermore, cooperatives were not able to conduct assigned work under the product contract arrangement. As family farming increasingly took place of the contract arrangement, National leaders gave <b>up</b> <b>collective</b> farming completely with Land Law in 1987 and resolution 10 in 1988.|$|E

40|$|Imagination is now {{understood}} to be playing a more prominent role {{in the production of}} cultural identities in ‘new times’, as groups seek to build and shore <b>up</b> <b>collective</b> identities in the shifting flows and conditions of globalization. This paper documents the institutional work of cultural imagination in the preparatory curricula designed to manage the cultural difference of international students studying on-campus in Australian universities. These Foundation and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) curricula construct an idealised version of the ‘Western student’, ‘Western lecturer’ and of the social code governing the relationship between lecturers, students, and disciplinary knowledge in the Western academy. This paper analyses the versions of imagined, ‘authentic’ Western pedagogy constructed in teacher interviews, and produced in videotaped classroom activities in these courses. In particular, the analysis focuses on forms of student oral participation in this imagined pedagogy of the West, and teachers’ attempts to simulate the ‘real’ Western university for their students. These ‘authentic’ versions are theorised as nostalgic in that they fail to acknowledge the transformation of Australian universities in globalizing times and globalized markets, and work to re-centre pedagogic identities in slippery conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{integration}} {{and development of}} sustainable chains has lately gained much attention in the academia debates. In particular, how to manage integration in the bio-energy chains is discussed. Integration {{is a process of}} progressive dependence among different actors willing to coordinate processes of innovation. This dynamic is generated by the interaction of individuals willing to start <b>up</b> <b>collective</b> action. The effectiveness of a collective action depends on the number of formal norms developed by collective contracts. This paper tackles these issues considering the specific case study of a collective action in a bio-energy chain. It focuses on the decision-making process of farmers on whether to join or not a collective action, analysing their trade-offs over the attributes of collective contracts. The empirical study was conducted in an area in Southern Italy, most affected by soil erosion problems. A stated preference model was implemented where respondents were asked to choose between alternative collective contracts with varying attribute levels to start biomass cultivation. Two hundreds face-to-face questionnaires were administered to farmers in September-October 2013. First results show that participation is mainly influenced by minimum price guaranteed, contract length, and re-negotiation before the end of a contract...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} in the Sustainable Consumption Research Group at Nottingham Trent University. Community-level innovation or action for sustainability is an important strand for sustainable development. As such, researchers investigated grassroots innovations, community-driven development or bottom-up approach. Many {{studies have focused on}} expert-led poverty alleviation projects, market-led social enterprises, or activists-led social movements for sustainable development. Relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} rather spontaneous, unorganised, citizen’s collective actions. This paper, therefore, aims to analyse one such example in the UK from the perspective of Design for Sustainable Behaviour; and to suggest how behavioural insights could feed into the development of strategies for scaling <b>up</b> <b>collective</b> actions towards sustainability. The selected action (or behaviour) is individual upcycling—creation or modification of any product from used materials for a product of higher quality or value than the original. Interviews with 23 British residents with practical upcycling experiences were analysed to identify some characteristics in individual upcycling behaviour. The results expand current understanding of individual upcycling in terms of the variance in behaviour, behavioural context and potential group differences based on demographic attributes. The paper further links the analytic insights to the ideas of scaling-up...|$|E
