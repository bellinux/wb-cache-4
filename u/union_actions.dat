40|$|Italian union’s and {{occupational}} medicine’s traditions about {{safety and health}} in work situations are compared with the study programs upon which a joint research by Franco Mosca, unionist, and Maria Angela Breveglieri, occupational physician, is based. This research, which concerns the intermediate organizational processes between production and distribution of agricultural products, stimulates reflections and interventions about both the logic of production and the workers’ needs for prevention and well-being. The introduction to the book that illustrates the research (Lavoro organizzato, salute e azione sindacale in un comparto agricolo - Organized Labour, Health and <b>Union</b> <b>Action</b> in an Agricultural Sector, Torino, 1994) discusses the possible encounter between organizational analysis, biomedical <b>action</b> and <b>union</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R
40|$|Transnational trade <b>union</b> <b>action</b> has {{expanded}} significantly {{over the last}} few decades and has taken a variety of shapes and trajectories. This book is concerned with understanding the spatial extension of trade <b>union</b> <b>action,</b> and in particular the development of new forms of collective mobilization, network-building, and forms of regulation that bridge local and transnational issues. Through the work of leading international specialists, this collection of essays examines the process and dynamic of transnational trade <b>union</b> <b>action</b> and provides analytical and conceptual tools to understand these developments. The research presented here emphasizes that the direction of transnational solidarity remains contested, subject to experimentation and negotiation, and includes studies of often overlooked developments in transition and developing countries with original analyses from the European Union and NAFTA areas. Providing a fresh examination of transnational solidarity, this volume offers neither a romantic or overly optimistic narrative of a borderless unionism, nor does it fall into a fatalistic or pessimistic account of international union solidarity. Through original research conducted at different levels, this book disentangles the processes and dynamics of institution building and challenges the conventional national based forms of unionism that prevailed {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century...|$|R

50|$|While other unions (such as the CIO) adopted {{form and}} tactics—notably, {{industrial}} unionism and the sitdown strike—which were developed or pioneered by the IWW, labor laws passed by legislatures {{have sought to}} steadily erode the range and diversity of methods employed by all labor organizations. Confronted with such obstacles, militant IWW members tend to believe in {{a return to a}} union philosophy that was common a century ago, in which unjust labor laws are challenged directly by <b>union</b> <b>actions,</b> rather than accepted as a framework within which the union must operate.|$|E

50|$|Seymour's {{preparations}} at Hilton Head had {{concerned the}} Confederate command {{in the key}} port city of Charleston, South Carolina. General P. G. T. Beauregard, correctly guessing Seymour's objective was Florida, felt these <b>Union</b> <b>actions</b> posed enough of a threat for him to detach reinforcements under Georgian Alfred H. Colquitt to bolster Florida's defenses and stop Seymour. Colquitt arrived in time to reinforce Florida troops {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Joseph Finnegan. As Colquitt's troops began arriving, Seymour, without Gillmore's knowledge, began a new drive across north Florida with the capture of Tallahassee as a possible objective.|$|E
50|$|Though {{numerous}} small skirmishes {{occurred in}} Florida—including the battles of Natural Bridge, Gainesville, Marianna, Vernon and Fort Brooke—the only major engagement was at Olustee near Lake City. Union forces under General Truman Seymour were repulsed by Florida and Georgia troops and retreated to their fortifications around Jacksonville. Seymour's relatively high losses caused Northern lawmakers and citizens {{to question the}} necessity of any further <b>Union</b> <b>actions</b> in militarily insignificant Florida. Many of the Federal troops were withdrawn and sent elsewhere. Throughout the balance of 1864 and into the following spring, the 2nd Florida Cavalry repeatedly thwarted Federal raiding parties into the Confederate-held northern and central portions of the state.|$|E
50|$|The {{political}} momentum behind the <b>Union</b> <b>actions</b> against Port Hudson {{came from the}} elections of November 1862. The Republican base, centered in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, had been shaken by embarrassing Democratic victories. A dramatic letter from Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton to Lincoln claimed “The fate of the North-West is trembling in the balance.” His implication was that unless the independent trade of Union states along the Ohio River was restored by Union control of the entire Mississippi, further breakup of the Union was possible. Morton believed the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois {{were in danger of}} breaking away from the Northeast to join the Confederacy, which was increasingly becoming the more lucrative opportunity.|$|E
