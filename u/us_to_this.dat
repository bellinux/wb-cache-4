Most of the town's settlers were originally from Taunton in Somerset, England, which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, [...] "in honour and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, {{in the midst of}} the heathen, for a possession for ourselves and for our posterity after us."

2500|$|Gas {{particles}} are widely separated from one another, and consequently, have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids. These intermolecular forces result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles. Like-charged areas of different gas particles repel, while oppositely charged regions of different gas particles attract one another; gases that contain permanently charged ions {{are known as}} plasmas. Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds contain permanent charge imbalances and so experience relatively strong intermolecular forces, although the molecule while the compound's net charge remains neutral. [...] Transient, randomly induced charges exist across non-polar covalent bonds of molecules and electrostatic interactions caused by them {{are referred to as}} Van der Waals forces. The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within a substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas. A comparison of boiling points for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> conclusion. The drifting smoke particles in the image provides some insight into low-pressure gas behavior.|$|E

2500|$|The Spartan {{enters the}} arena, where he meets Ares, who tells him {{he is the}} son of one of Aphrodite's handmaidens. The handmaiden had {{revealed}} Ares' affair with Aphrodite to her husband, Hephaestus. Ares killed the handmaiden, but was banished by the other gods. Knowing Ares would want to kill the handmaiden's son out of spite, the gods decided to hide him among the humans. He was thus left in Sparta as a baby and granted superhuman powers so as to protect himself should Ares ever locate him. Unable to find the child, Ares manipulated Tiberius and orchestrated the Roman invasion of Greece, knowing the war would bring the child to the fore because of his abilities. The death of The Spartan is the revenge which Ares seeks. Ares and The Spartan fight, with The Spartan killing the god. Castor and Electra then arrive, and Castor, now King of Sparta, states; [...] "It was over.

2500|$|As The Shooting {{was never}} {{released}} theatrically, and had sparse television showings, it initially {{had a very}} limited core of fans. Those critics who did manage to view the film were extremely enthusiastic, and generally found it superior to Hellman's companion western, Ride in the Whirlwind. Danny Peary in Cult Movies (1981), after admitting that he had difficulties with the [...] "puzzling" [...] climax, noted [...] "But while the end may ask more questions than it answers, the exciting journey that brings <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point {{is one of the}} most rewarding sequences in the history of westerns." [...] Leonard Maltin said it was an [...] "...ultimately powerful film with an offbeat performance by Nicholson as a hired gun... and an incredible, unexpected finale." [...] David Pirie in Time Out wrote, [...] "Probably the first Western which really deserves to be called existential... Hellman builds remorselessly on the atmosphere and implications of the 'quest' until it assumes a terrifying importance in itself... What Hellman has done is to take the basic tools of the Western, and use them, without in anyway diluting or destroying their power, as the basis for a Kafkaesque drama." [...] Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: The Western notes that [...] "Hellman's calculated style, replete with disorientating close-ups and strange moments... confirm the detached fatalism of his story. This is a marvelous film." [...] James Monaco's The Movie Guide described the film as [...] "ighly effective, playing with various levels of character and ideas... it is a fine western stylization that should not be missed." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum has referred to the film as the first acid western, and cited it as an inspiration for Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man. The Shooting has a 100% favorable rating on the [...] "Critical Tomatometer" [...] at the Rotten Tomatoes website.|$|E
