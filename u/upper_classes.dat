5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> but because lower classes {{want to look like}} the <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} {{it is not clear that}} this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E

A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city's <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>class</b> {{encompasses}} {{the top end}} of the income spectrum relative members of society as a whole. Since they have more wealth and privacy, the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> has more personal autonomy {{than the rest of}} the population. <b>Upper</b> <b>class</b> values include higher education, and for the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth, the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks. Children of the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> are typically schooled on how to manage this power and channel this privilege in different forms. It is in large part by accessing various edifices of information, associates, procedures and auspices that the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations. Usually, people of the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> participate as partisans in elections and have more political power than those of lower classes due to their abundance of resources and influence.|$|R
25|$|Marriage between <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> Han Chinese and Hui Muslims was uncommon, since <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> Han men both {{refused to}} marry Muslims and forbade their daughters from marrying Muslims, since {{they did not}} want to convert and lose their <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> status. Only low status Han would convert to marry a Hui woman. Ming law allowed Han men and women to marry each other.|$|R
5|$|Most historians thus concur that chattel {{slaves were}} indeed {{used in the}} Greek {{city-state}} of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only among the <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b> As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), often {{with a view of}} the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with the}} skills and {{inclination}} to write Welsh recipes, the <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> conformed to English styles and therefore would not have run their houses with traditional Welsh cuisine. Upper-class households would take on any English fashions, even adopting English names. The traditional cookery of Wales originates from the daily meals of peasant folk, unlike other cultures where meals often started in the kitchens of the gentry and would be adapted.|$|E
50|$|The African-American <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> {{consists}} of African-American engineers, lawyers, accountants, doctors, politicians, business executives, venture capitalists, CEOs, celebrities, entertainers, entrepreneurs and heirs who have incomes amounting to $200,000 or more. This class, {{sometimes referred to}} as the black <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> the African-American <b>upper</b> middle <b>class</b> or black elite, represents less than 1 percent of the total black population in the United States. This group of African Americans has a history of organizations and activities that distinguish it from other classes within the black community {{as well as from the}} white <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> Many of these traditions, which have persisted for several generations, are discussed in Lawrence Otis Graham’s 2000 book, Our Kind of People: Inside America’s Black <b>Upper</b> <b>Class.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Philadelphia <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> {{engaged in}} fox hunting, race horse breeding, {{attending}} balls and lavishly entertaining in their townhouses or mansions. The elite also joined exclusive clubs {{such as the}} State in Schuylkill and the Philadelphia Union League. The <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> started with mansions in Old City, but through the 18th and 19th centuries <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> gradually moved west through Center City {{until the end of}} the 19th century when much of the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> moved to large mansions along the Pennsylvania Main Line. The Philadelphia aristocracy lasted well into the 20th century but by the end of the century the old rich families were overwhelmed by the new rich. By the late 20th century, membership in the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> was defined less by ancestry, and organizations such as the Union League began to accept limited numbers of Jews, Catholics, and African Americans.|$|R

5|$|Medical {{science of}} the Middle Ages had a {{considerable}} influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious among the <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b> One's lifestyle—including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies—was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person's health. All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century.|$|E

A life-sized waxwork of Lambert was displayed in London, where it became extremely popular. Daniel Lambert soon became a popular subject with cartoonists, who often depicted him as John Bull. He mixed well with the <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> and on one occasion met King GeorgeIII. The King's and Lambert's reactions to this meeting are not recorded.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil society values {{education}} highly, for its {{own sake}} {{as well as for the}} opportunities it provides. The kings of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were historically patrons of literature and education. Temple schools and traditional gurukulam classes on verandahs (known as Thinnai Pallikoodam in Tamil) spread basic education in religion and in languages such as Tamil and Sanskrit to the <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b> The Portuguese introduced western-style education after their conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619. The Jesuits opened churches and seminaries, but the Dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to Dutch Reformed churches when they took over Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{clamping}} down on {{the protests}} was a loss of legitimacy, {{and the emergence of}} Amin al-Hafiz as the first Ba'athist military strongman. The traditional elite, consisting of the <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, felt threatened by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, and it felt threatened by the party's secular nature. Akram al-Hawrani and his supporters and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one-party system which the Ba'ath Party was establishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{letters and}} diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen {{generally}} demonstrate {{support for the}} King, while those from the middle and <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> tend to express indignation and distaste. The Times, The Morning Post, Daily Herald, and newspapers owned by Lord Kemsley, such as The Daily Telegraph, opposed the marriage. On the other hand, the Express and Mail newspapers, owned by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere, respectively, appeared to support a morganatic marriage. The King estimated that the newspapers in favour had a circulation of 12.5million, and those against had 8.5million.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{important}} feature of the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> is that of inherited privilege. While most Americans, including those in the upper-middle class need to actively maintain their status, some <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> persons {{do not need to}} work in order to maintain their status. Status tends to be passed on from generation to generation without each generation having to re-certify its status. Overall, the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> is financially the best compensated {{and one of the most}} influential socio-economic classes in American society.|$|R

The Duke of Cumberland (an uncle of King George III) was reported to have bet thousands of pounds on Jack Broughton, who was the English champion for 18years.|$|E
5|$|The street {{became popular}} with entertainers {{including}} bear-baiters, theatres and public houses. However, {{it was not}} attractive to the middle and <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> due to the nearby Tyburn gallows and St Giles, then a notorious rookery, or slum. The gallows were removed in 1783, {{and by the end}} of the century, Oxford Street was built up from St Giles Circus to Park Lane, containing a mix of residential houses and entertainment. The Princess's Theatre opened in 1840, and is now the site of Oxford Walk shopping area.|$|E
5|$|Under Louis, {{only between}} 20 and 50 prisoners were usually {{held at the}} Bastille at any one time, {{although}} as many as 111 were held {{for a short period}} in 1703. These prisoners were mainly from the <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> and those who could afford to pay for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, wearing their own clothes, living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls. By the late 17th century, there was a rather disorganised library for the use of inmates in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.|$|E

Many sociologists and commentators make a distinction between the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> (in the sense of those in the families of inherited wealth) and the corporate elite.
