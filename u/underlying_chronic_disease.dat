40|$|Background: Older {{adults and}} {{individuals}} with <b>underlying</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{at increased risk}} of developing influenza-related complications and are target groups for seasonal influenza vaccination in many countries. In Germany, an annual national information campaign is conducted to increase influenza vaccination uptake in the target groups. However, data are lacking on knowledge and attitudes toward influenza vaccination among older adults and those with <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases.</b> The present study aimed to (i) estimate influenza vaccination uptake for the 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 seasons, (ii) assess knowledge and attitudes about influenza vaccination, and (iii) identify factors associated with vaccination uptake in two risk groups. Methods: Between March and June 2014, we conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey in adults (≥ 18 years) living in Germany using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. We calculated weighted vaccination coverage rates in two at-risk groups. Group 1 comprised participants aged 18 – 59 years with <b>underlying</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Group 2 comprised participants aged 60 +, irrespective of underlying disease. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify associations between influenza vaccination uptake and sociodemographic characteristics, and to evaluate attitudes and knowledge. Results: In total, 1, 519 interviews were conducted. Seasonal influenza vaccination uptake in people with <b>underlying</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> aged 18 – 59 years was 24 % in 2012 / 2013 and 23 % in 2013 / 2014. In older adults, uptake was 50 % and 49 % in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 respectively. There were considerable vaccination-related knowledge gaps among respondents. For example, about half of the participants who aged ≥ 60 years and/or suffered from <b>underlying</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> believed that influenza vaccination could cause influenza. The most commonly stated reasons for not being immunized were mistrust of the vaccination (22 %) and the perception that influenza is not dangerous (21 %). For both groups, vaccination uptake was independently associated with sex, perceived severity of influenza, perceived vaccination effectiveness, and the perceived likelihood or severity of vaccination side effects. For older adults, additional factors influencing vaccination uptake were age, <b>underlying</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases,</b> and recent advice through physician consultation. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination coverage rates in Germany remain low. Individual perceptions regarding harms and benefits are crucial in the decision-making process. Communication strategies should focus on improving understanding and perception of personal risks arising from the disease and the vaccination...|$|R

We analysed data relative to the paediatric cerebral thrombotic events of the R. I. T. I. which occurred between January 2007 and June 2012. In the study period, 79 arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) events (49 in males) and 91 cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) events (65 in males) were enrolled in the R. I. T. I. Mean age at onset was 4. 5 years in AIS, and 7. 1 years in CSVT. Most common modes of presentation were hemiparesis, seizures and speech disturbances in AIS, and headache, seizures and lethargy in CSVT. Most common etiologies were <b>underlying</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases,</b> vasculopathy and cardiopathy in AIS, and <b>underlying</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and infection in CSVT.

The study-population response rate was 78 %. Of these, 66 % (5, 120 persons) had been given at least one influenza vaccination during the 3 -year study period (1998 - 2000), 50 % (3, 780) had received one pneumococcal vaccination and 78 % had received both vaccines during the period. The vaccination rate was lower in the age group 65 - 69 years (60 %), compared with elderly cohorts aged over 70 years (67 - 72 %, P < 0. 001). Elderly persons living in nursing homes or institutions had higher vaccination rates than persons living in their own households (72 vs. 67 %).
