Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 <b>until</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program {{was an attempt to}} carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{had allowed}} 69 steals against them through September 8, while they had stolen only 32. Yadier Molina {{is not at}} fault {{as much as the}} {{pitchers}} letting the runners get good jumps, instead of holding them closer to first base. Since his debut in 2004, the team has never allowed more than 64 steals <b>until</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> Molina's pop time—defined as the time elapsed from the moment the pitch hits the catcher's mitt to the moment the intended fielder receives the throw—is {{the same as it was}} last year (1.92 seconds), when he allowed 37 stolen bases and ranked third in the National League with a caught-stealing percentage of 41. That pop time ranks seventh best among all catchers in 2016.|$|E

The reason for this as quoted by Barker is [...] "Not a comeback, But more like a grave you visit to bring flowers." [...] Since the band's [...] "final" [...] shows in Netcong and Hoboken, they have played a few dates every year (in Northern New Jersey, <b>until</b> <b>this</b> <b>year's</b> show in Philadelphia). They have covered Lanemeyer songs and taken requests at these shows as a thank you to longtime fans.|$|R
2500|$|In 1901 [...] Harry C.

He immediately began to turn up the soil of the hilly, unprofitable land and sow seeds in order to secure permanent pasture, and when these made their appearance he set apart about 1,000 acres, enclosed with an 8-foot wire fence, and placed there seventy deer and several buffaloes and elk.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Carl C. Taylor, {{also the}} Texas track coach, assumed {{basketball}} head coaching responsibilities for the 1913 season. Taylor {{arranged for the}} rental of the theater of the Ben Hur Temple and its conversion into a miniature basketball court and arena so that his team would have an indoor venue for home games and practice, with UT paying the Shriners and Scottish Rite Freemasons a sum of $75 for the season. Taylor came to UT with a strong reputation for basketball expertise, acquired during his years at Drake University. His Texas team finished with an overall record of 8–4 and, beginning with a 70–7 rout of Southwestern in San Marcos, contributed the first three victories to what would become a national-record winning streak. At {{the conclusion of the}} 1912–13 academic year, the UT's Cactus yearbook declared, [...] "Basketball is no longer a minor sport at the University of Texas. It always has been so considered <b>until</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> Prof. Carl Taylor took charge of the work and infused new life into it." ...|$|E

This one, on the Avenue, had a giant in a long blue livery coat who opened their carriage door, and a hall in yellow and black onyx, and maids and valets. After breakfast, when Honora sat down to write to Aunt Mary, she described the suite of rooms in which they lived,--the brass beds, the electric night lamps, the mahogany French furniture, the heavy carpets, and even the white-tiled bathroom. There was a marvellous arrangement in the walls with which Edith was never tired of playing, a circular plate covered with legends of every conceivable want, from a newspaper to a needle and thread and a Scotch whiskey highball.|$|E
60|$|Suppose {{then we were}} to ask, {{whether the}} King has been richer than his {{predecessors}} in accumulated wealth, since {{the establishment of the}} plan of Favouritism? I believe it will be found that the picture of royal indigence which our Court has presented <b>until</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> has been truly humiliating. Nor has it been relieved from this unseemly distress, but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people, and shaken their confidence in Parliament. If the public treasures had been exhausted in magnificence and splendour, this distress would have been accounted for, and in some measure justified. Nothing would be more unworthy of this nation, than with a mean and mechanical rule, to mete out the splendour of the Crown. Indeed, I have found very few persons disposed to so ungenerous a procedure. But the generality of people, it must be confessed, do feel a good deal mortified, when they compare the wants of the Court with its expenses. They do not behold the cause of this distress in any part of the apparatus of Royal magnificence. In all this, they see nothing but the operations of parsimony, attended with all the consequences of profusion. Nothing expended, nothing saved. Their wonder is increased by their knowledge, that besides the revenue settled on his Majesty's Civil List to the amount of 800,000 pounds a year, he has a farther aid, from a large pension list, near 90,000 pounds a year, in Ireland; from the produce of the Duchy of Lancaster (which we are told has been greatly improved); from the revenue of the Duchy of Cornwall; from the American quit-rents; from the four and a half per cent. duty in the Leeward Islands; this last worth to be sure considerably more than 40,000 pounds a year. The whole is certainly not much short of a million annually.|$|E
