50|$|One of the {{principles}} of public broadcasting is to provide coverage of interests for which there are missing or small markets. Public broadcasting attempts to supply topics of social benefit that are otherwise not provided by commercial broadcasters. Typically, such <b>underprovision</b> is argued to exist when the benefits to viewers are relatively high in comparison to the benefits to advertisers from contacting viewers. This frequently is the case in undeveloped countries that normally have low benefits to advertising.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{economic}} theory typically points to social gains from competition as {{a rationale for}} the use of markets. Thus, Smith described the “invisible hand,” whereby the mechanism of the market converts individuals’ self-interested activity into gains for society. This insight is formalized in the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. However, economic theory also points to market failures, including the <b>underprovision</b> of public goods by markets and the failure of self-interested individuals to internalize externalities. Because of these factors, purely self-interested behaviour often detracts from the common good.|$|E
50|$|In economics, the {{free-rider}} problem {{occurs when}} those who benefit from resources, goods, or services {{do not pay}} for them, which results in an <b>underprovision</b> of those goods or services. For example, a free-rider may frequently ask for available parking lots (public goods) from {{the ones who have}} already paid for them, in order to benefit from free parking. At the end of the day, one may see that the free-rider have used the parking even more than the others without paying a single penny. The free-rider problem is {{the question of how to}} limit free riding and its negative effects in these situations. The free-rider problem may occur when property rights are not clearly defined and imposed.|$|E

A major challenge for such services is the inter-overlay bandwidth competition problem, {{which is to}} find an upload bandwidth allocation between the overlays each peer has subscribed to. So far, no solution has been proposed in the literature for the important case where the overall system is <b>underprovisioned,</b> that is, when peers {{do not have enough}} upload bandwidth to ensure a distribution of videos at full quality. We show that an allocation of upload resources that minimizes the wastage of resources (i. e., minimizes the upload bandwidth allocated to overprovisioned overlays) can be computed in polynomial time. Then we present a generic model that allows the design of different strategies for the management of the resource deficit in <b>underprovisioned</b> systems. Finally, we provide relevant simulation results to demonstrate the gains in video quality resulting from the implementation of our solutions...|$|R

If only the source-based tax is available, then relative <b>underprovision</b> of the public production factor may occur even if the public consumption good is undersupplied in absolute terms.

40|$|Cloud {{providers}} {{have made}} significant strides {{in reducing the}} cooling capital and operational costs of their datacenters, for example, by leveraging outside air (“free”) cooling where possible. Despite these advances, cooling costs still repre-sent a significant expense mainly because cloud providers typically provision their cooling infrastructure for the worst-case scenario (i. e., very high load and outside temperature at the same time). Thus, in this paper, we propose to reduce cooling costs by <b>underprovisioning</b> the cooling infrastruc-ture. When the cooling is <b>underprovisioned,</b> there might be (rare) periods when the cooling infrastructure cannot cool down the IT equipment enough. During these periods, we can either (1) reduce the processing capacity and potentially degrade the quality of service, or (2) let the IT equipment temperature increase {{in exchange for a}} controlled degra-dation in reliability. To determine the ideal amount of un-derprovisioning, we introduce CoolProvision, an optimiza-tion and simulation framework for selecting the cheapest provisioning within performance constraints defined by the provider. CoolProvision leverages an abstract trace of the ex-pected workload, as well as cooling, performance, power, reliability, and cost models to explore the space of potential provisionings. Using data from a real small free-cooled data-center, our results suggest that CoolProvision can reduce the cost of cooling by up to 55 %. We extrapolate our experience and results to larger cloud datacenters as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} environments provide on-demand resource provisioning, allowing {{applications to}} elastically scale. However, application benchmarks currently {{being used to}} test cloud management systems are not designed for this purpose. This results in resource <b>underprovisioning</b> and quality-of-service (QoS) violations when systems tested using these benchmarks are deployed in production environments. We present C-MART, a benchmark designed to emulate a modern web application running in a cloud computing environment. It is designed using the cloud computing paradigm of elastic scalability at every application tier and utilizes modern web-based technologies such as HTML 5, AJAX, jQuery, and SQLite. C-MART consists of a web application, client emulator, deployment server, and scaling API. The deployment server automatically deploys and configures the test environment in orders of magnitude less time than current benchmarks. The scaling API allows users to define and provision their own customized datacenter. The client emulator generates the web workload for the application by emulating complex and varied client behaviors, including decisions based on page content and prior history. We show that C-MART can detect problems in management systems that previous benchmarks fail to identify, such as an increase from 4. 4 to 50 percent error in predicting server CPU utilization and resource <b>underprovisioning</b> in 22 percent of QoS measurements.

We find that the 'fixed preferences" hypothesis leads to the systematic undervaluation of environmental services and the <b>underprovisioning</b> of environmental goods. ...|$|R

Rate-adaptive streaming technologies, {{such as the}} Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard, reinforces this problem in the core CDN infrastructure since delivering one video means delivering multiple representations for an aggregated bit-rate that is commonly over 10 Mbps. In this paper, we explore better trade-offs between CDN infrastructure cost and Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end-users for live broadcast video streaming applications. We consider in particular <b>underprovisioned</b> CDN networks, our goal being to maximize the QoE for the population of heterogeneous end-users {{despite the lack of}} resources in the intermediate CDN equipments. We show that previous theoretical models based on elastic bit-rates do not fit for this context. We propose a user-centric discretized streaming model where the satisfaction of end-users is related to the context and where a stream has to be either delivered in its entirety, or not delivered at all. We first formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that achieves the optimal delivery through a multi-tree delivery overlay. The evaluation of the ILP shows the benefits of this model. We then design a practical system by revisiting the three main algorithms implemented in CDN: user- to-server assignment, content placement and content delivery. At last, we use a realistic trace-driven large-scale simulator to study the performances of our system.
