40|$|One of the {{challenges}} confronting cities innon-industrialised countries today {{is the fact that}} cities aregrowing at unprecedented rates, sizes and densities. Growthtrends in these cities are largely unregulated. In thesecountries, cities have changed in at least four major ways:their size, spatial organisation or morphology, the quality anddistribution of public services and infrastructure and theiremployment base. While this situation can be attributed toglobal urbanisation trends, the general poor knowledge on howthese cities develop, densify and acquire certain physicalcharacteristics has limited effective urban planning andmanagement. At times, the pervasive knowledge gap has beenassociated with the lack of relevant theories and concepts toexplain the evolution, growth and prevailing spatial qualities. However, the limited research in this field has alsocontributed to this problem. The other problem that confrontsthe rapidly urbanising city is continued sprawl that has beenmanifested in externalities of inadequate infrastructureprovision and under-utilisation of scarce resourcesparticularly land. This thesis is an attempt to contribute towards addressingthese two problem areas. The main field of study is on urbantypes within a rapidly urbanising city context. Dar es Salaamcity was selected a case study area. The study exploresthetheoretical framework for classification and analysis ofsettlements. The relevance of this framework in the studycontext is examined. At low scale level, the study provides ananalysis of house forms, density, plot characteristics, spacesand space uses in formal and informal settlements. The analysis shows that urbanisation under poverty andlow-density <b>urban</b> <b>types</b> greatly influence the sprawlingcharacter of the city. The increasing market-led housingdevelopment and ineffective planning responses are contributingfactors to the observed unguided densification anddeteriorating spatial qualities. It has also been shown thatwhile theoretical frameworks developed from most industrialisedcountries can be adapted to analyse <b>urban</b> <b>types</b> innon-industrialised countries, these theories are limited incomprehending fully the growth and character of rapidlyurbanising cities.

40|$|With {{the use of}} cluster {{analysis}} a sample of 1018 residents of the San Francisco Bay Area was classified into eleven <b>types</b> of <b>urban</b> residents {{on the basis of}} overall similarity of personal and environmental characteristics, and independently into nine types of travel behavior. The relations between the two typologies, and the comparative travel behavior of the <b>types</b> of <b>urban</b> resident were investigated in an attempt to gain insight into the determinants of urban travel. The probability of the correct assignment of a travel behaviour <b>type</b> to an <b>urban</b> resident <b>type</b> was of the order of 0. 30. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to test empirically whether the value of a given travel behavior characteristic for a given <b>urban</b> resident <b>type</b> can be assumed to be higher (or lower) than the value in the general population, thus testing the predictability of the travel behavior of the various <b>urban</b> resident <b>types.</b> Conversely, the prediction of the urban traveler's personal characteristics given his travel behavior type was also evaluated. This typological approach made the prediction of the usage of the San Francisco Bay Area rapid transit system (for going to work, for going to shop, for going out for leisure, or for some other purpose) possible, in about 15 % of the cases, from the knowledge of the <b>urban</b> resident <b>type</b> and, in about 25 % of the cases, from the knowledge of the travel behavior type. ...|$|R

40|$|Urbanization {{is arguably}} the most {{dramatic}} form of irreversible land transformation. Though urbanization is a worldwide phenomenon, it is especially prevalent in India, where urban areas have experienced an unprecedented rate of growth over the last 30 years. In this uncontrolled situation, city planners lack tools to measure, monitor, and understand urban sprawl processes. Multitemporal remote sensing has become an important data-gathering tool for analysing these changes. By using time-series of Landsat data, we classify urban footprints since the 1970 s. This lets us detect temporal and spatial urban sprawl, redensification and urban development in the tremendously growing 12 largest Indian urban agglomerations. A multi-scale analysis aims to identify spatiotemporal <b>urban</b> <b>types.</b> At city level, the combination of absolute parameters (e. g. areal growth or built-up density) and landscape metrics (e. g. SHAPE index) quantitatively characterise the spatial pattern of the cities. Spider charts can display the spatial <b>urban</b> <b>types</b> at three time stages, showing temporal development and helping the reader compare all cities based on normalized scales. In addition, gradient analysis provides insight into location-based spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization. Therefore, we analyse zones defining the urban core versus the urban edges. The study aims to detect similarities and differences in spatial growth in the large Indian urban agglomerations. These cities in the same cultural area range from 2. 5 million inhabitants to 20 million (in the metropolitan region of Mumbai). The results paint a characteristic picture of spatial pattern, gradients and landscape metrics, and thus illustrate spatial growth and future modelling of urban development in India. ...|$|R

Results demonstrate that these capture morphological relationships between cities, and reveal correlations between these and a city’s geographical location.

Discussions revealed that there were as many interests on land as there were as many types of occupants. In particular there is an evolving nature of land speculation and politics surrounding land in which the absentee urban landlords, local politicians, the remaining few large village farmers and the land-grabbers play a dominant role in land use decisions (e.g. industries, <b>urban</b> <b>types</b> of housing development). Prevalence of these multiple socio-spatial settlements dynamics holds back in achieving any common consensus towards cooperative farming, utilizing shared farming technologies or protection of the agricultural land.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{non-native}} species invasions on community diversity and biotic homogenization {{have been described}} for various taxa in urban environments, but not for land snails. Here we relate the diversity of native and non-native land-snail urban faunas to <b>urban</b> habitat <b>types</b> and macroclimate, and analyse homogenization effects of non-native species across cities and within the main <b>urban</b> habitat <b>types.</b> Land-snail species were recorded in seven 1 -ha plots in 32 cities of ten countries of Central Europe and Benelux (224 plots in total). Each plot represented one <b>urban</b> habitat <b>type</b> characterized by different management and a specific disturbance regime. For each plot, we obtained January, July and mean annual temperature and annual precipitation. Snail species were classified into either native or non-native. The effects of habitat type and macroclimate {{on the number of}} native and non-native species were analysed using generalized estimating equations; the homogenization effect of non-native species based on the Jaccard similarity index and homogenization index. We recorded 67 native and 20 non-native species. Besides being more numerous, native species also had much higher beta diversity than non-natives. There were significant differences between the studied habitat types in the numbers of native and non-native species, both of which decreased from less to heavily urbanized habitats. Macroclimate was more important for the number of non-native than native species; however in both cases the effect of climate on diversity was overridden by the effect of <b>urban</b> habitat <b>type.</b> This is the first study on urban land snails documenting that non-native land-snail species significantly contribute to homogenization among whole cities, but both the homogenization and diversification effects occur when individual habitat types are compared among cities. This indicates that the spread of non-native snail species may cause biotic homogenization, but it depends on scale and habitat type...|$|R
