5|$|After 1147, {{however, the}} {{relations}} between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|Baylor's passing offense {{had been}} strong all year. This {{was the first}} time they had been held below 21points in their last seven conference games and they had two wide {{receivers}} with over 50catches each. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bears, their starting quarterback Shawn Bell suffered a season-ending injury against Texas A on October 28.|$|E
5|$|However, on 7 October 2014, McKinlay was {{replaced}} as Watford head coach by ex-Chelsea defensive-midfielder Slaviša Jokanović. On 25 April 2015, Watford gained promotion to the Premier League after defeating Brighton 2–0 and other results going their way. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hornets, however, {{they failed to}} win their {{final game of the}} season against Sheffield Wednesday, thus gifting the Championship title to AFC Bournemouth in a dramatic season finale.|$|E

5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again the}} Byzantines' {{military}} power was depleted and Andronicus III {{was forced into}} diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; {{in return for the}} safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would be paid to the Ottomans. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire, this did not stop the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.|$|E
5|$|In 1052, Domnall's {{aforesaid}} grandfather {{conquered the}} Kingdom of Dublin from Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1064/1065), {{and soon after}} appointed Murchad as King of Dublin. About a decade later, Murchad appears to have driven Echmarcach from Mann, after which he gained the kingship of the Isles. Diarmait's deep-rooted authority in Norse-Gaelic Dublin lasted for two decades, and was a remarkable achievement that no other Irish king had ever accomplished. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Uí Chennselaig, two of Diarmait's sonsMurchad and Glún Iairnunexpectedly predeceased their father in 1070, and Diarmait himself fell in battle two years later.|$|E

5|$|In {{their first}} and second games of the season, the Cardinals lived up to that expectation. At in-state rival Kentucky, Louisville earned a 31–24 victory to win the Governor's Cup. This was {{followed}} the next week by a 63–27 victory over non-conference opponent Oregon State. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals, their first Big East conference game of the season—and of school history—did not go as well. At South Florida, the ninth-ranked Cardinals were outscored 45–14, {{the first time in}} 13 games Louisville's offense was held to less than 30 points.|$|E
5|$|Lampugnano, <b>unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Guelphs, was {{considered}} a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse {{by the fact that}} the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Louisville, meanwhile, {{returned}} to its winning ways. The Cardinals, following their loss to the Mountaineers, won their first Big East game in school history the next week, over the Cincinnati Bearcats, 46–22. The rout of Cincinnati sparked a five-game winning streak, which concluded on December 3 with a 30–20 victory over the University of Connecticut Huskies. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals, starting quarterback Brian Brohm, who had the sixth-best season (in terms of passing yards) in Louisville history, suffered a season-ending knee injury. With West Virginia having won the Big East championship and an automatic Bowl Championship Series game bid, Big East second-place Louisville was selected by the Gator Bowl even before the victory over Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska widened {{its lead}} with a 33-yard {{touchdown}} run six {{minutes into the}} second half, but Tech answered right back with a 33-yard touchdown pass on its subsequent possession. The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hokies, that score was the closest they would get to a lead as Nebraska's offense began to wear down the Tech defense. Nebraska scored another touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}}, then racked up 10points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Nebraska won, 41–21.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Germans {{security}} was breached within weeks. On 1 January 1945, after participating in Operation Bodenplatte {{to support the}} German Ardennes Offensive, a Ju 88 (code D5+PT) flown by Unteroffizier (Corporal) Lattoch belonging to 9./NJG 3 landed in Luxembourg in error. Lattoch had been present at the briefing on 1 December 1944 and was taken prisoner of war. He was soon {{handed over to the}} intelligence branch of the US Ninth Air Force. He divulged the details of the meeting and this information was passed to the Air Ministry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Germans, {{the bulk}} of the British Army escaped from the port of Dunkirk. The German Army {{eventually}} won the ensuing Battle of Dunkirk, forcing the Allied Armies to leave behind large amounts of equipment, but failed, through controversial circumstances, to eliminate the British manpower trapped in the pocket. The encirclement destroyed the best units of the French Army, including a prisoner of war total of 40,000, but significant forces did escape (139,732 British and 139,037 French). Some French forces would return to France and participate in the battles of June 1940, before surrendering {{along with the rest of}} the French armed forces on 25 June 1940, when the Armistice of 22 June took effect.|$|E

5|$|<b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> West India Company, {{the infant}} colony of New Netherland languished, the {{cautious}} Dutch people having very little inclination to emigrate to wild and uncultivated lands {{in which no}} substantial inducements were present. While the economic situation of the colony in the late 1620s {{could be considered a}} relatively good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness, its slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company. Within a few years, the Company realized that special measures which would afford a stimulus to colonization were indispensable.|$|E
5|$|After {{overturning}} a two-goal {{deficit to}} beat Woolwich Arsenal 4–3 {{in a friendly}} at Plumstead, Small Heath took on Aston Villa in their last match of the season, {{the final of the}} Birmingham Charity Cup. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> charities, the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw an exciting game. Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside of the bar, then Bob Chatt equalised from a free kick and Charlie Athersmith outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line. Mobley tied the scores with a long shot, but in the second half with the wind behind them, Villa scored three times to Jack Hallam's one to take the match 5–3.|$|E
5|$|An {{adaptation}} is an observable {{structure or}} other feature of an organism (for example, an enzyme) generated {{by natural selection}} to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the hypothesis that feathers are adaptations for bird flight. That would require three things: that the trait of having feathers is heritable; that the trait does serve the function of flight; and that the trait increases the fitness of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living birds. However, {{there is also a}} historical question, namely, did the trait arise {{at the same time as}} bird flight? <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis, this seems not to be so: theropod dinosaurs had feathers, but many of them did not fly. Feathers can be described as an exaptation, having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as insulation. Biologists may describe both the co-option and the earlier adaptation in teleological language.|$|E

5|$|Before {{resorting to}} killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets {{had tried to}} poison him (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot {{on his way to}} work (this proved {{impossible}} as the Afghans had improved their security measures). They even tried to poison Amin just hours before the assault on the Presidential Palace. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri's return from Moscow. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but <b>unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. Mikhail Talybov, a KGB agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.|$|E
5|$|Due to the war, the SAFA {{suspended}} its {{competition from}} 1916 through to 1918. Despite this official suspension, {{a group of}} South Australian clubs decided to form their own league in 1916 and the money generated would be put toward the war effort. The Railways Football Club {{was one of the}} clubs that participated in this competition and managed to attract Harold Oliver to be the clubs captain. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Railways, Oliver would only play one game for the Railways, and would instead return to Berri to focus on his farm. Later in the season, Oliver returned to Port Adelaide to play a few games for the club who was also partaking in the Patriotic League. Port Adelaide would end up winning the 1916 South Australian Patriotic League Grand Final defeating West Torrens 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19). Harold Oliver played for Port Adelaide during the game and kicked a goal.|$|E
5|$|Following the post-field goal kickoff, the Virginia Tech offense {{attempted}} to answer Auburn's quick score. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hokies, their second drive fared {{even worse than}} the first. Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, suffered an eight-yard loss on a play, then had a Bryan Randall pass intercepted by Auburn safety Junior Rosegreen. Rosegreen returned the ball 31 yards, and put Auburn's offense into good field position for its second drive of the game. Auburn also suffered an early penalty in its drive, but moved the ball with another long play—a 23-yard pass to Courtney Taylor—to recover. Again, however, the Virginia Tech defense recovered to force Auburn into a fourth down and a field goal attempt. Vaughn returned to the field and kicked a 19-yard field goal, giving Auburn a 6–0 lead with 1:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
