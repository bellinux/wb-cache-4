5|$|The slug-like larva of Phoronis ovalis swims {{for about}} 4 days, creeps on the sea-bed for 3 to 4 days, then bores into a {{carbonate}} floor. Nothing {{is known about}} three species. The remaining species develop free-swimming actinotroch larvae, which feed on plankton. The actinotroch is an upright cylinder with the anus {{at the bottom and}} fringed with cilia. At the top is a lobe or hood, under which are: a ganglion, connected to a patch of cilia outside the apex of the hood; a pair of protonephridia (smaller and simpler than the metanephridia in the adult); the mouth; and feeding tentacles that encircle the mouth. After swimming for about 20 days, the actinotroch settles on the seabed and undergoes a catastrophic metamorphosis (radical change) in 30minutes: the hood and larval tentacles are absorbed and the adult lophophore is created round the mouth, and both now points upward; the gut develops a <b>U-bend</b> so that the anus is just under and outside the lophophore. Finally the adult phoronid builds a tube.|$|E

25|$|Small trout {{caught on}} a barb-less hook can be {{released}} simply by: grasping the eyelet of the fly, and rotating the eyelet toward the bend (the <b>U-bend).</b> This pulls the point backwards, back through the way it entered. Push the eyelet directly toward the bend until the point {{is removed from the}} fish. Large trout can be grasped gently and forceps can be used to grip the bend and push backwards, away from the direction the hook currently points. If necessary, squirming trout can be held on their backs. This often subdues the fish and provides enough time to remove the hook.|$|E
25|$|The 'slide', {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} trombone (cf. valve trombone), allows the player to extend {{the length of the}} air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the Renaissance, and these stockings were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (<b>U-bend).</b> The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a ferrule to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the computation of turbulent flow and heat transfer in <b>U-bends</b> of strong curvature. Following the earlier studies within the authors' group on flows through round-ended <b>U-bends,</b> here attention is turned to flows through square-ended <b>U-bends.</b> Flows at two Reynolds numbers have been computed, one at 100, 000 and the other at 36, 000. In the heat transfer analysis, the Prandtl number was either 0. 72 (air) or, in a further departure from our earlier studies, 5. 9 (water). The turbulence modelling approaches examined, include a two-layer and a low-Re k-ε. model, a two-layer and a low-Re version of the basic differential stress model (DSM) and a more recently developed, realisable version of the differential stress model that is free of wall-parameters. For the low-Re effective viscosity model (EVM) and DSMs, an alternative, recently proposed length-scale correction term, independent of wall distance has also been tested. Even the simplest model employed - two-layer EVM - reproduces the mean flow development with reasonable accuracy, suggesting that the mean flow development is mainly influenced by mean pressure rather than the turbulence field. The heat transfer parameters, on the other hand, show that only the low-Re DSMs produce reliable Nusselt number predictions for both Prandtl numbers examined...|$|R

The length of Opabinia regalis from head to tail ranged between [...] and [...] The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was {{about one-third of the}} body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was [...] like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close {{to the middle of the}} head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is [...] "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a <b>U-bend</b> on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{design of}} saxophone is a straight conical tube, and the sopranino and soprano saxophones are usually of this design. However, as the lower-pitched instruments would be unacceptably long, they usually incorporate a <b>U-bend</b> ("bow") at or slightly above the third-lowest tone hole. As this {{would cause the}} bell to point almost directly upward, {{the end of the}} instrument is either beveled or tilted slightly forward. This U-shape has become a distinctive feature of the saxophone family, to the extent that soprano and even sopranino saxes are sometimes made in the curved style. By contrast, tenors and even baritones have occasionally been made in the straight style. Most commonly, however, the alto and tenor saxophones incorporate a detachable, curved [...] "neck" [...] above the highest tone hole directing the mouthpiece to the player's mouth while the instrument is held in a playing stance.

This paper studied the mechanical performance of four bioresorbable PLLA stents, i. e., Absorb, Elixir, Igaki-Tamai and RevaMedical, during crimping and expansion using the finite element method. Abaqus CAE was used to create the geometrical models for the four stents. A tri-folded balloon was created using NX software. For the stents, elastic-plastic behaviour was used, with hardening implemented by considering the increase of yield stress with the plastic strain. The tri-folded balloon was treated as linear elastic. To simulate the crimping of stents, a set of 12 rigid plates were generated around the stents with a radially enforced displacement. During crimping, the stents were compressed from a diameter of 3 mm to 1. 2 mm, with the maximum stress developed at both inner and outer sides of the <b>U-bends.</b> During expansion, the stent inner diameter increased to 3 mm at the peak pressure and then recoiled to different final diameters after balloon deflation due to different stent designs. The maximum stress was found again at the <b>U-bends</b> of stents. Diameter change, recoiling effect and radial strength/stiffness were also compared for the four stents to assess the effect of design variation on stent performance. The effect of loading rate on stent deformation was also simulated by considering the time-dependent plastic behaviour of polymeric material...|$|R

50|$|In this method, {{the bottom}} V-die is {{replaced}} by a flat pad of urethane or rubber. As the punch forms the part, the urethane deflects and allows the material to form around the punch. This bending method has a number of advantages. The urethane will wrap the material around the punch and the end bend radius will be very close to the actual radius on the punch. It provides a non-marring bend and is suitable for pre-painted or sensitive materials. Using a special punch called a radius ruler with relieved areas on the urethane <b>U-bends</b> greater than 180° can be achieved in \ne hit, something that is not possible with conventional press tooling.

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{degradation}} modes {{can affect the}} integrity of both heat exchanger (HX) and balance of plant tubing, resulting in expensive repairs, tube plugging or replacement of tube bundles. One key component for ensuring tube integrity is inspection and monitoring for detection and characterization of the degradation. Inservice inspection of HX and balance of plant tubing is usually carried out using eddy current (EC) bobbin coils, which are adequate {{for the detection of}} volumetric degradations. However, detection and quantification of additional modes of degradation such as pitting, intergranular attack (IGA), axial cracking and circumferential cracking require specialized probes. The need for timely, reliable detection and characterization of these modes of degradation is especially critical in Nuclear Generating Stations. Transmit-receive single-pass array probes, developed by AECL, offer high defect detectability in conjunction with fast and reliable inspection capabilities. They have strong directional properties, permitting probe optimization for circumferential or axial crack detection. Compared to impedance probes, they offer improved performance in the presence of variable lift-off. This EC technology can help resolve critical detection issues at susceptible areas, such as the rolled-joint transitions at the tubesheet, <b>U-bends</b> and tube-support intersections. This paper provides an overview of the operating principles and the capabilities of advanced ET inspection technology available for HX tube inspection.

40|$|The {{springback}} {{phenomenon is}} defined as elastic recovery of the stresses produced during the forming of a material. An accurate prediction of the springback puts high demands on the material modeling during the forming simulation, as well as during the unloading simulation. In classic plasticity theory, the unloading of a material after plastic deformation {{is assumed to be}} linearly elastic with the stiffness equal to Young's modulus. However, several experimental investigations have revealed that this is an incorrect assumption. The unloading and reloading stress-strain curves are in fact not even linear, but slightly curved, and the secant modulus of this nonlinear curve deviates from the initial Young's modulus. More precisely, the secant modulus is degraded with increased plastic straining of the material. The main purpose of the present work has been to formulate a constitutive model that can accurately predict the unloading of a material. The new model is based on the classic elastic-plastic framework, and works together with any yield criterion and hardening evolution law. To determine the parameters of the new model, two different tests have been performed: unloading/reloading tests of uniaxially stretched specimens, and vibrometric tests of prestrained sheet strips. The performance of the model has been evaluated in simulations of the springback of simple <b>U-bends</b> and a drawbead example.
