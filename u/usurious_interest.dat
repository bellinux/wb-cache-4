25|$|Small landholders and sharecroppers {{were still}} {{required}} to pay rent and taxes and pay off their debts, which were characterised by <b>usurious</b> rates of <b>interest.</b> Any poor harvest thus exacted a heavy toll, given their lack of legally defined security. The accumulation of consumer debt, seasonal loans, and crisis loans began a cycle of spiraling, perpetual indebtedness. This dynamic was reinforced by laws, originally designed to alleviate usury, that restricted access to credit and discouraged or prevented the practice of using farmlands as collateral for loans. This had the unintended effect of making creditors less willing to accept farmlands as a pledge against a debt, {{and more likely to}} simply wait until their debtors were unable to repay their loans. Then it was relatively easy for the jotedars to use litigation to force debtors to sell all or part of their landholdings at a low price or forfeit them at auction. Debtors then became landless or land-poor sharecroppers and labourers, usually working the same fields they had once owned. The credit-driven slide into poverty converted farmers from smallholders into dwarfholders, and from dwarfholders into sharecroppers or agricultural labourers. The accumulation of household debt to a single, local, informal creditor (who also held power over land and sometimes grain or jute) also bound the debtor nearly inescapably to the creditor/landlord; it became nearly impossible to settle the debt after a good harvest and simply walk away. In this way, the jotedars effectively dominated and impoverished the lowest tier of economic classes in several districts of Bengal.|$|R

Though they meet the credit requirements of a section of the society, who are not served by the formal financial institutions, their unbridled growth, unlawful activities and links with other institutions may pose threats to the stability of financial system and makes the monetary policy less effective. Furthermore, they create social problems when they charge <b>usurious</b> rates of <b>interest</b> and resort to unethical practices for recovery of loans, which in turn, leads to suicides committed by indebted farmers. In this context, the study attempts to analyse the working of money lenders in Kerala. Based on a sample survey, the paper has estimated the volume of deposits and credits of money lenders in Kerala and brought out the undesirable aspects of their working {{and its impact on the}} society. The paper finds that the existing legal provisions and regulatory and supervisory mechanisms are inadequate to protect the interests of both depositors and creditors. The paper calls for strengthening the Kerala Money Lenders Act by passing an Act for the protection of depositors and creating a separate wing for their registration, monitoring and supervision by the State Government. In the long-term, the strategy for financial inclusion, strengthening of co-operatives and promotion of self help groups will be helpful in bringing down the role of moneylenders...|$|R

60|$|Perhaps {{there is}} already an earnest of that future crop in the {{existence}} of Heinrich Heine, a German born with the present century, who, to Teutonic imagination, sensibility, and humor, adds an amount of esprit that would make him brilliant among the most brilliant of Frenchmen. True, this unique German wit is half a Hebrew; but he and his ancestors spent their youth in German air, and were reared on Wurst and Sauerkraut, so that he is as much a German as a pheasant is an English bird, or a potato an Irish vegetable. But whatever else he may be, Heine {{is one of the most}} remarkable men of this age: no echo, but a real voice, and therefore, like all genuine things in this world, worth studying; a surpassing lyric poet, who has uttered our feelings for us in delicious song; a humorist, who touches leaden folly with the magic wand of his fancy, and transmutes it into the fine gold of art—who sheds his sunny smile on human tears, and makes them a beauteous rainbow on the cloudy background of life; a wit, who holds in his mighty hand the most scorching lightnings of satire; an artist in prose literature, who has shown even more completely than Goethe the possibilities of German prose; and—in spite of all charges against him, true as well as false—a lover of freedom, who has spoken wise and brave words on behalf of his fellow-men. He is, moreover, a suffering man, who, with all the highly-wrought sensibility of genius, has to endure terrible physical ills; and as such he calls forth more than an intellectual interest. It is true, alas! that there is a heavy weight in the other scale—that Heine’s magnificent powers have often served only to give electric force to the expression of debased feeling, so that his works are no Phidian statue of gold, and ivory, and gems, but have not a little brass, and iron, and miry clay mingled with the precious metal. The audacity of his occasional coarseness and personality is unparalleled in contemporary literature, and has hardly been exceeded by the license of former days. Hence, before his volumes are put within the reach of immature minds, there is need of a friendly penknife to exercise a strict censorship. Yet, when all coarseness, all scurrility, all Mephistophelean contempt for the reverent feelings of other men, is removed, there will be a plenteous remainder of exquisite poetry, of wit, humor, and just thought. It is apparently too often a congenial task to write severe words about the transgressions committed by men of genius, especially when the censor has the advantage of being himself a man of no genius, so that those transgressions seem to him quite gratuitous; he, forsooth, never lacerated any one by his wit, or gave irresistible piquancy to a coarse allusion, and his indignation is not mitigated by any knowledge of the temptation that lies in transcendent power. We are also apt to measure what a gifted man has done by our arbitrary conception of what he might have done, rather than by a comparison of his actual doings with our own or those of other ordinary men. We make ourselves overzealous agents of heaven, and demand that our brother should bring <b>usurious</b> <b>interest</b> for his five Talents, forgetting that it is less easy to manage five Talents than two. Whatever benefit there may be in denouncing the evil, it is after all more edifying, and certainly more cheering, to appreciate the good. Hence, in endeavoring to give our readers some account of Heine and his works, we shall not dwell lengthily on his failings; we shall not hold the candle up to dusty, vermin-haunted corners, but let the light fall as much as possible on the nobler and more attractive details. Our sketch of Heine’s life, which has been drawn from various sources, will be free from everything like intrusive gossip, and will derive its coloring chiefly from the autobiographical hints and descriptions scattered through his own writings. Those of our readers who happen to know nothing of Heine will in this way be making their acquaintance with the writer while they are learning the outline of his career.|$|E

That {{the said}} Warren Hastings did proceed unto the said {{province}} of Oude under color {{of providing a}} remedy for the disorders described to be existing in the same, and for {{the recovery of the}} Company's pretended debt. And the said Warren Hastings, who had thought fit to recall the Company's Resident, appointed to that office by the Court of Directors, and to suspend his office, did, notwithstanding, of his own choice and selection, and on his own mere authority, take with him in his progress a large retinue, [...] "and a numerous society of English gentlemen to compose his family," [...] which he represents as necessary, although, in a letter from that very place to which he took that very numerous society, he informs the Court of Directors [...] "that his own consequence and that of the nation he represents are independent of show." [...] And after his arrival there, he, the said Warren Hastings, did write from Lucknow, the capital of that province, a letter, dated the 30th of April, 1784, to the Court of Directors, in which are several particulars to the following purport or tenor, and which he points out to the Directors [...] "to be circumstances of no trivial information," [...] namely,--"that he had found that the lands in that province, as well as in some parts more immediately under the Company, have suffered in a grievous manner, being completely exhausted of their natural moisture by the total failure of one entire season of the periodical rains," [...] with a few exceptions, which were produced only [...] "by the uncommon labor of the husbandman." [...] And in a letter to Edward Wheler, Esquire, a member of the Council-General, from Benares, the 20th of September, 1784, he says, that [...] "the public revenues had declined with the failure of the cultivation in three successive years; and all the stores of grain which the providence of the husbandmen, (as he was informed is their custom,) in defiance of the vigilance of the aumils [collectors], clandestinely reserved for their own use, were of course exhausted, in which state no person would accept of the charge of the collections on a positive engagement; nor did the rain fall till the 10th of July." [...] And in another letter, dated from Benares, the 1st of October following, he repeats the same accounts, and that the [...] "country could not bear further additions of expense: that it had no inlets of trade to supply the issues that were made from it" [...] (the exceptions stated there being inconsiderable); [...] "therefore every rupee which is drawn into your treasury [the Company's] from its circulation will accelerate the period at which its ability must cease to pay even the stipulated subsidy." [...] Notwithstanding this state of the country, of which he was well apprised before he left Calcutta, and the poverty and distress of the prince having been frequently, but in vain, represented to him, in order to induce him to forbear his oppressive exactions, he did, in order to furnish the Council with a color for permitting him to recall the Company's Resident, and to exercise the whole powers of the Company in his own person, without any check whatsoever, or witness of his proceedings, except the persons of his own private choice, make the express and positive engagement aforesaid, which, if understood of a real and substantial discharge of debt for the relief of the total of the Company's finances, was grossly fallacious: because at the very time he must have been perfectly sensible, that, in the then state of the revenues and country of Oude, (which are in effect the Company's revenues and the Company's country,) the debt or pretended debt aforesaid, asserted to be about five hundred thousand pounds, or thereabouts, could not be paid without contracting another debt at an <b>usurious</b> <b>interest,</b> without encroaching on the necessary establishments or on private property or on the pay of the army, or without grievous oppression of the country, or all these together. And it doth appear that one hundred thousand pounds towards the said payment of debts was borrowed at Calcutta by the Nabob's agent there, but at what interest is not known; it appears also that other sums were borrowed for arrear of the interest, on which forty thousand pounds sterling appears in the Company's claims for the current year, and that various deductions were made from the jaghires restored to the Begums, as well as other parts of the Nabob's family; and it did and doth appear that an arrear is still due to the old and new brigade,--but whether the same be growing or not doth not appear: yet he hath not hesitated to assert that he had [...] "provided for the complete discharge, in one year, of a debt contracted by the accumulation of many, and from a country whose resources have been wasted and dissipated by three successive years of drought and one of anarchy." [...] But the said Hastings never did even realize the payments {{to be made in the}} first year, (as he confesses in the said letter,) except by an anticipation of the second; and though he states in his letter aforesaid the following facts and engagements, that is to say, [...] "that a recovery of so large a part of your property [the Company's] will afford a seasonable and substantial relief to the necessities of your government, and enable it (for such is my confident hope) to begin on the reduction of your debt at interest before the conclusion of this year (I mean the year of this computation)." [...] Whereas the said Warren Hastings did apply the whole produce of the revenue to the mere pay of some part of the British army in Oude; and did not mention in his correspondence that he had remitted any money whatsoever to Calcutta, nor to any other place, (except the fifty thousand pounds taken from Almas Ali Khân, and said to be remitted to Surat,) for the said [...] "substantial relief," [...] in consequence of the said pretended [...] "recovery of property,"--admitting that it had been suggested to him, and not by him denied, that he had [...] "disappointed the popular expectation by not adopting the policy which he had, on the conception of better grounds, rejected; nor did he begin the reduction of the interest debt" [...] at the time stated, nor at any time; but the whole (he well knowing the state of the country from whence the resources aforesaid were by him promised) was a premeditated deceit and imposition on the Board of Council, his colleagues, and on the Court of Directors, his masters.|$|E

The action finished with the withdrawal of all city debts and the condemnation of Meyer to death. The councilmen were in debt to Meyer, and the archbishop kept the confiscated property of the condemned person. In addition, the archbishop had also debts with Meyer and could cancel them in the same way.|$|E
5000|$|I take {{under my}} {{protection}} the Jews of the aljamas {{in general and}} to each one in particular, {{as well as to}} his people and their goods; I protect them against any attack, be it of the nature that is ...; I forbid that they attack, mate or hiera; I also prohibit a passive attitude if attacked, killed or injured.Hence even the Catholic Kings until 1492 were reputed to be favorable to the Jews. This is what the German traveler, Nicolas de Popielovo says, for example, after his visit in 1484-1485:His subjects of Catalonia and Aragon speak publicly and the same things I have heard say to many in Spain that the Queen is protector of the Jews and daughter of a Jewish woman But the Catholic Monarchs could not do away with all the vexations and discrimination suffered by the Jews, encouraged on many occasions by the preaching of the friars of the mendicant orders. They then made the decision to segregate the Jews to end the conflict. Already in the Cortes of Madrigal of 1476 the kings had protested by the breach of the provisions in the Order of 1412 on the Jews - prohibition to wear luxury dresses; Obligation to wear a red slice on the right shoulder; prohibition to hold positions with authority over Christians, to have Christian servants, to lend money at <b>usurious</b> <b>interest,</b> etc. - but in the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 they decided to go much further to fulfill these norms: to force the Jews to live In separate quarters, from where they could not leave except during the day to carry out their professional occupations. Until then the Jewish quarters-where the Jews used to live and where they had their synagogues, butchers, etc.-had not formed a separate world in the cities and there were also Christians living in them and Jews living outside them. From 1480 onwards, the Jewish quarters were converted into ghettos surrounded by walls and the Jews were confined in them to avoid confusion and damage of our holy faith. A process for which a term of two years was established, but which lasted for more than ten years, and which was not exempt from problems and abuses by Christians.|$|E
5000|$|RALs {{began in}} 1985 when Ronald Smith, an Accountant in Virginia Beach, VA started the {{practice}} of Refund Advance Loans at his accounting firm, Action Accounting & Taxes located at 5441 Virginia Beach Blvd. This service of Loans On Tax Refunds was advertised widely through WYAH, TV and on Cox Cable in the Hampton Roads area by Action Accounting & Taxes in 1985, 1986 and 1987. The Advance Refund Loans became a huge business success from the start and a sensation {{in the area in}} 1986 and 1987 and was the first and only firm in the United States that was offering that service according to the IRS. In 1986 a salesman from Charlie Falk's Auto on Virginia Beach Blvd, where today Town Centre now exits, asked Mr. Smith if they could make an arrangement where Action Accounting & Taxes could prepare taxes for customers seeking to purchase cars in order to supplement their down payments on used or new car purchases. Mr. Smith agreed to this idea and {{that was the beginning of}} Loans on Tax Refunds being used in conjunction with car financing and that practice then quickly spread throughout the area and then throughout the entire United States. Mr. Smith was the first one to invent, organize and pioneer the process of Tax Refund Loans in this way and went on to make millions in this business. The financing was originally fully handled by Joel S. Coplon and Company, a small private financing company closely connected with Mr. Smith at the time. Action Accounting and Taxes, the firm that Mr. Smith owned, was one mile from where John Hewitt was just starting a new business venture. Mr. Hewitt had just recently purchased Mel Jackson's Tax Service which was a run down group of offices throughout the Hampton Road's area. Mr. Hewitt began to offer Refund Anticipation Loans in 1988 and built a national franchise out of the idea which funded and built Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Then in 1989 H & R Block joined in the industry and it became a billion dollar industry across the United States being coopted into thousands of different accounting firms and tax practices across the United States and abroad. It was reported in 1989 that H & R Block had doubled it's business at over 4,000 locations due to the introduction of this new Refund Loan Service. It later spread to Canada as well through Liberty Tax Service and in time this company moved into the United States market as well offering the same service. The proliferation of this tax loan practice coincided with the introduction of electronic filing which IRS introduced electronic filing as a way to decrease its cost of operation. Previous to this time refunds would take on average two to three months to come back from the IRS which is why the Loan on Tax Refund also known as Refund Anticipations Loan business flourished. In 1988, Mr. Smith as well as Mr. Coplon were jointly sued by the Attorney General of Virginia in a Richmond State Court for charging <b>usurious</b> <b>interest.</b> Mr. Smith was eventually dismissed from the case and it was reported by the State's Attorney at the time that the reason for his dismissal from the case was that Mr. Smith was [...] "not culpable".|$|E
40|$|Microfinance {{is often}} {{assumed to be}} an {{ethically}} progressive industry, {{but in recent years}} it has been the target of much ethical criticism. Microfinance institutions have been accused of using exploitative lending techniques and charging <b>usurious</b> <b>interest</b> rates; and critics even question the ability of microfinance to alleviate poverty. This article reviews recent research on the microfinance sector that addresses these ethical issues. We show how this research is relevant to a number of theoretical issues, such as how to define poverty, how to understand exploitation, and how to balance financial and social goals in commercial organizations. We conclude by identifying a critical agenda for future research. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
