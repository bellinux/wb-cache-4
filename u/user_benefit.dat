40|$|Abstract. Applications in {{ubiquitous}} environments need {{to adapt}} to a range of fluid factors, like user preferences, context, and various system configurations. In this paper, we address the problem of system adaptation in order to continuously achieve high <b>user</b> <b>benefit</b> while keeping reconfiguration costs low. To this end, the presented approach leverages not only the immediate context but also future transitions. In contrast to existing approaches that either maximize benefit or minimize reconfiguration costs, our proposed decision support mechanism achieves a trade-off between those factors. Considering user preferences, deployment constraints, and probabilistic context state transitions, we propose a multi-objective utility function to determine the best reconfiguration choices. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves high <b>user</b> <b>benefit</b> while keeping reconfigurations costs low. ...|$|E
40|$|Assessing users’ {{benefit in}} a {{transport}} policy implementation {{has been studied}} by many researchers using theoretical or empirical measures. However, few of them measure users’ benefit {{in a different way}} from the consumer surplus. Therefore, this paper aims to assess a new measure of <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> by weighting consumer surplus in order to include equity assessment for different transport policies simulated in a dynamic middle-term LUTI model adapted to the case study of Madrid. Three different transport policies, including road pricing, parking charge and public transport improvement have been simulated through the Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator, MARS, the LUTI calibrated model for Madrid). A social welfare function (WF) is defined using a cost benefit analysis function that includes mainly costs and <b>benefits</b> of <b>users</b> and operators of the transport system. Particularly, the part of welfare function concerning the users, (i. e. consumer surplus), is modified by a compensating weight (CW) which represents the inverse of household income level. Based on the modified social welfare function, the effects on the measure of <b>users</b> <b>benefits</b> are estimated and compared with the old WF ́s results as well. The result of the analysis shows that road pricing leads a negative effect on the <b>users</b> <b>benefits</b> specially on the low income users. Actually, the road pricing and parking charge implementation results like a regressive policy especially at long term. Public transport improvement scenario brings more positive effects on low income <b>user</b> <b>benefits.</b> The integrated (road pricing and increasing public services) policy scenario is the one which receive the most <b>user</b> <b>benefits.</b> The results of this research could be a key issue to understanding the relationship between transport systems policies and <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> distribution in a metropolitan context...|$|R

In this paper, the MNL model is used for the travel demand analysis. To evaluate the two approaches, the empirical comparison is conducted by applying the two benefit calculation methods to a simple numerical simulation and a railway project in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area.

40|$|Abstract: This paper aims {{to analyze}} empirically {{the impact of}} {{selecting}} travel demand forecast techniques on estimation of <b>user’s</b> <b>benefit</b> stemming from transportation investment. Three techniques {{are discussed in the}} paper: the multinominal logit (MNL), user equilibrium (UE) and all-or-nothing (AON). These three techniques are compared in the empirical analysis of the urban railway project in Tokyo based on the same data set. Consequently, it is found that the <b>user’s</b> <b>benefit</b> estimated by the MNL is largest, whereas the benefit by the UE is smaller than the benefit estimated by the MNL by about 10 % and the benefit estimated by the AON is smaller than the MNL by about 20 %. Finally, some policy implications related to choosing the travel demand forecast techniques in transportation planning are discussed.

40|$|AbstractSeeking {{the upper}} bound of the {{efficiency}} loss in traffic assignment has attracted many scholars’ attentions {{in the last}} decade. The existing researches mainly focus on traffic assignment with fixed demand, few on user equilibrium (UE) assignment with elastic demand focus on single user. In this paper, the authors investigate the efficiency loss of multiclass traffic equilibrium assignment (MTEA) with elastic demand. Two decision making criteria are used in this traffic assignment problem, namely, time-based and monetary-based. The variational inequality (VI) models for MTEA under time-based decision criterion and monetary-based decision criterion are formulated. The efficiency loss caused by this two decision criterion is analytically derived and the relations to some network parameters are discussed. It is shown that the upper bound of efficiency loss caused by the time-based assignment depends {{on the type of}} link travel time function, the ratio of <b>user</b> <b>benefit</b> and the total social surplus under time-based at traffic equilibrium assignment state. The upper bound of efficiency loss caused by monetary-based assignment depends on the type of link travel time function, the value of time (VOT) of user classes, the ratio of <b>user</b> <b>benefit</b> and the total social surplus under monetary-based at traffic equilibrium assignment state, the ratio of <b>user</b> <b>benefit</b> at system optimum (SO) and the total social surplus at traffic equilibrium state under monetary –based.

40|$|This paper derives and {{illustrates}} {{measures for}} the {{ex ante evaluation}} of <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> associated with improvements in the transport system. In contrast with conventional analyses, we assume that awareness among travelers of changes in the transport system is limited and grows over time. Specifically, we postulate that each day (trip) provides travelers with an opportunity to learn about changes that occurred recently in the transport system. This learning process may involve learning through direct experience and indirect learning through for example social networks or information provision. Our measure of <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> incorporates the conventional logsum-measure as a special case (when full awareness is assumed) and has a closed form solution under reasonable error term assumptions. A numerical illustration provides a first sign of face validity. We derive and discuss a number of practical implications, and discuss possible model extensions.

40|$|Should one {{calculate}} <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> from {{changes in}} door-to-door journeys or from {{changes in the}} use of separate links of the network? Quite often, the second approach is deemed wrong, as consumers are supposed to demand journeys, not parts of journeys. However, we show that for a quite general economic model and under fairly general assumptions regarding the network, both approaches are equivalent. The cost-benefit analysis practitioner can exploit this result. The links approach reveals on what part of the networks <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> and/or losses are generated.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} realise {{sustainable}} urban transport, {{it is necessary}} to combine different kinds of decision-making, including vision-led, plan-led and consensus-led approaches. In this paper, a cross-assessment model that supports both vision-led and consensus-led approaches is proposed as an analytical tool for developing sustainable urban transport and land use strategies for a low-carbon society. It is applied to an impact analysis of public transport and land use strategies in 2030 for all of Japan's 269 urban areas, with outcomes – including the financial balance of public transport operation, <b>user</b> <b>benefits,</b> and CO 2 emissions reduction – compared by strategy and urban area. The analytical results show that three value factors related to efficiency, equity and the environment do not necessarily conflict with each other. In particular, it is clarified that CO 2 emissions reduction targets can contribute to the improvement of financial balance and <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> at the national level. In addition, the results of comparative analysis among the LUTI (land use and transport integration) scenarios demonstrate that a combination of urban transport strategies with land use control in the form of ‘corridors and multi-centres’ provides greater emissions reduction and increased <b>user</b> <b>benefits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Transport <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> are {{of great}} {{importance}} in cost benefit analysis when appraising transport projects. Generally they have {{the greatest impact on}} the results of cost-benefit analyses. It is common to adopt the consumer surplus for calculating transport <b>user</b> <b>benefits.</b> The consumer surplus measure is based on the underlying demand model and follows from the integration of the demand curve. If the popular logit model is used for forecasting travel demand, consumer surplus measure takes a closed form (the “logsum”) that is easy to calculate. Furthermore, in cost-benefit analyses the change in consumer surplus between an initial and final state is needed, which can be easily derived by the difference of the logsums of the two states. This logsum approach is proven and correct for travel demand models based on the logit model without multiple constraints. However, for travel demand models dealing with two or more sets of constraints the logsum approach fails. In this paper we describe a mathematical approach for a transport <b>user</b> <b>benefits</b> measure that corresponds to the consumer surplus and is universal for all travel demand models with constraints. We exemplarily derive the measure for a doubly constrained trip distribution. The applicability of the derived approach is shown by a small example...|$|R
