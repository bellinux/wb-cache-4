Groups in the alt.* hierarchy tend to be more specialized or specific—for example, there might be a newsgroup <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Eight which contains discussions about children's books, but a group in the alt hierarchy may be dedicated to one specific author of children's books. Binaries are posted in alt.binaries.*, making it the largest of all the hierarchies.|$|E
