5|$|Madonna's {{look and}} style of dressing, her performances, and her music videos {{influenced}} young girls and women. Her style {{became one of the}} female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair. Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the <b>US.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E
25|$|How {{this city}} marches northward! The {{progress}} of 1835 and 1836 {{was nothing to}} the luxuriant rank growth of this year. Streets are springing up, whole strata of sandstone have transferred themselves from their ancient resting places to look down on bustling thoroughfares for long years to come. Wealth is rushing in upon <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> freshet.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave <b>us,</b> <b>like,</b> <b>a</b> {{million bucks}} last year, and {{we built a}} {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E

The programme included primitivist verse, simultaneous poetry recitals by Baader and Hausmann, and Hausmann's [...] "Dada-Trot (Sixty-One Step)" [...] described as 'a truly splendid send-up of the most modern exotic-erotic social dances that have befallen <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> plague...' ...|$|E
2500|$|Daud was {{involved}} in the narcotics trade and used his post as head of counternarcotics police to provide safe passage to smugglers. [...] One drug courier from Helmand was caught with a letter of safe passage signed by the head of Afghanistan's counternarcotics police, Lt. Gen. Mohammad Daud Daud. A convicted heroin trafficker, Izzatullah Wasifi, was appointed by Karzai as the head of an anti-corruption agency. [...] "Karzai was playing <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fiddle," [...] wrote Schweich, the U.S. counternarcotics official.|$|E
2500|$|French composers {{including}} Hector Berlioz {{struggled in}} vain against {{the tide of}} Italian operas. Berlioz succeeded in getting his opera [...] Benvenuto Cellini [...] staged at the Royal Academy in 1838, but it closed after just three performances, and was not staged again in France during his lifetime. [...] Berlioz complained in the Journal des Debats that there were six operas by Donizetti in Paris playing in one year. [...] "Monsieur Donizetti has the air to treat <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> conquered country," [...] he wrote, [...] "it is a veritable war of invasion. We can no longer call them the lyric theaters of Paris, just the lyric theaters of Monsieur Donizetti." ...|$|E

60|$|Soon, as {{we turned}} a headland, we {{encountered}} another canoe, paddling with might and main in an opposite direction; the strangers shouting to each other, {{and a tall}} fellow in the bow dancing up and down <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crazy man.

60|$|I took {{a double}} turn around his elbows, and Darius {{ordered him to}} step into our canoe, which he did without hesitation, but once there, seated on the {{flooring}} of the boat with {{his back against the}} old man's knees, he glowered at <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> angry cat.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2011, {{with the}} {{approach}} of Nakba Day, Im Tirtzu launched a campaign accompanied by a 70-page booklet titled [...] "Nakba Harta" [...] in Hebrew (נכבה חרטא), translated by The Jerusalem Post as [...] "Nakba BS", and titled [...] "Nakba Nonsense" [...] in English. The booklet describes the 1948 Palestinian exodus, called Nakba by Palestinians, as [...] "a lie that threatens to drown <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tsunami" [...] and attempts to discredit what Im Tirtzu regards as [...] "a narrative of myths and lies dealing with {{the teaching of the}} founding of the State of Israel". On 15 May 2011, dozens of Im Tirtzu activists gathered outside the offices of UNRWA in Jerusalem holding signs and chanting, [...] "They expelled, they attacked, they lost." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was young}} and tall of stature, clad in a garment of deep blue, ... Her dress was covered with {{brilliant}} gold stars. The sleeves were ample and long. She wore slippers of the same blue as the dress, ornamented with gold bows. On the head was a black veil half covering the forehead, concealing the hair and ears, and falling over the shoulders. Above this was a crown resembling a diadem, higher in front than elsewhere, and widening out at the sides. A red line encircled the crown at the middle. Her hands were small and extended toward us as in the 'miraculous medal.' Her face had the most exquisite delicacy and a smile of ineffable sweetness. The eyes, of unutterable tenderness, were fixed on <b>us.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> true mother, she seemed happier in looking at us than we in contemplating.|$|E
2500|$|The PCE persecuted Communists {{in northwestern}} Spain during those years. In 2008 Victor Garcia {{found the body}} of his father {{partially}} buried in a wooded area of O Deza (Pontevedra). He {{had been shot in}} the head. Garcia's father had not fled Spain after the defeat of 1939; he stayed behind and helped to organize a guerrilla force of 947 fighters in Galicia. Around the year 1944 the central committee of the PCE, then living in France and headed by Ibárruri and Carrillo ordered his execution. After it was carried out in 1948, the regional PCE liaison wrote, [...] "At last we have hunted him down. This riffraff withstood <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> leech. We managed to catch him in Lalin from where he directed certain adventurous, uncontrolled groups. He is a provocateur who has given us many troubles; though belatedly we have eliminated him." ...|$|E

60|$|The bus-mate {{climbed in}} and out, {{coming in to}} sit near <b>us.</b> He was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dove which has at last found an olive bough to nest in.

2500|$|Darrow {{entered the}} racially charged {{atmosphere}} as {{the lawyer for}} the defendants. Darrow reconstructed the case as a justified honor killing by Thomas Massie. Considered by The New York Times to be one of Darrow's three most compelling trials (along with the Scopes Trial and the Leopold and Loeb case), the case captivated the nation and most of white America strongly supported the honor killing defense. In fact, the final defense arguments were transmitted to the mainland through a special radio hookup. In the end, the jury came back with a unanimous verdict of guilty, but on the lesser crime of manslaughter. As to Darrow's closing, one juror commented, [...] "e talked to <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bunch of farmers. That stuff may go over big in the Middle West, but not here." [...] Governor Lawrence Judd later commuted the sentences to one hour in his office. Years later Deacon admitted to shooting Kahahawai; Massie was found [...] "not Guilty" [...] in a posthumous trial.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} the three Dublin car bombs went off at about 17:28 on Parnell Street, near the {{intersection}} with Marlborough Street. It was in a parking bay outside the Welcome Inn pub and Barry's supermarket at 93 and 91 Parnell Street respectively, and near petrol pumps. Shop fronts were blown out, cars were destroyed, and people were thrown in all directions. A brown Mini that had been parked behind the bomb was hurled onto the pavement at a right angle. One survivor described [...] "a big ball of flame coming straight towards <b>us,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great nuclear mushroom cloud whooshing up everything in its path". The bomb car was a metallic green 1970 model Hillman Avenger, registration number DIA 4063. It had been facing toward O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare. This car, like the other two bomb cars, had its original registration plates. It had been hijacked in Belfast that morning.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{columnist}} David Brooks {{concludes that}} Interstellar explores {{the relationships among}} [...] "science and faith and science and the humanities" [...] and [...] "illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms." [...] Wai Chee Dimock, in the Los Angeles Review of Books, wrote that Nolan's films are [...] "rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees," [...] and that [...] "although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-sci-fi film, holding out hope {{that the end of}} the planet is not the end of everything, it reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short, when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see. In those moments, it suddenly dawns upon us that the ocean that rises up 90 degrees and comes at <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wall is not just a special effect on some faraway planet, but a scenario all too close to home." [...] Novelist and short story writer George R. R. Martin called Interstellar [...] "the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick's 2001." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 6 August 2001, Mac issued {{his debut}} solo album, 3000 Feet High, which peaked in the top30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, felt {{the album was}} an [...] "emotional journey" [...] where [...] "hroughout, the {{dancefloor}} taunts <b>us</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> temptress, determined to lure us into her arms, but we're torn between her charms and the inner us which the dance beats may drown out". The lead single, [...] "Just the Thing" [...] (June 2001), reached No.17 on the ARIA Singles Chart and featured lead vocals by Peta Morris. In December 2001 he performed at Homebake on the Big Top stage. At the APRA Music Awards of 2002 [...] "Just the Thing" [...] won 'Most Performed Dance Work' and was nominated for 'Most Performed Australian Work'. In January 2002, and again in 2006, Mac appeared at Splendour in the Grass. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 Mac won 'Best Dance Release' for 3000 Feet High and was nominated for 'Best Male Artist' and 'Engineer of the Year'.|$|E
