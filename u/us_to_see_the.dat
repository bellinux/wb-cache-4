25|$|But by 1820 {{faith in}} the {{efficacy}} of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect {{on the level of}} crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes. In response, New York developed the Auburn system in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at Auburn State Prison and Sing Sing at Ossining. The aim of this was rehabilitative: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving {{as a model for the}} family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> prisons included de Tocqueville who wrote Democracy in America as a result of his visit.|$|E

The vibrant yellow background creates a warm glow around mother and baby, like a very large halo. [...] Of his use of color, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have before my eyes, I use color... to express myself more forcibly."

[...] He concluded [...] "it does so many things right that it genuinely pains <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> experience get bogged down by a handful of major annoyances.

2500|$|In nature, a {{light source}} emits {{a ray of}} light which travels, eventually, to a surface that {{interrupts}} its progress. [...] One can think of this [...] "ray" [...] as a stream of photons traveling along the same path. [...] In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line (ignoring relativistic effects). Any combination of four things might happen with this light ray: [...] absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence. [...] A surface may absorb part of the light ray, resulting {{in a loss of}} intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light. [...] It might also reflect {{all or part of the}} light ray, in one or more directions. If the surface has any transparent or translucent properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the spectrum (and possibly altering the color). Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more. [...] A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of [...] the incoming rays. [...] Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.|$|E
