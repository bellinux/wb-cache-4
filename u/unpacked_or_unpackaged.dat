To prevent product loss from both static and dynamic forces encountered in distribution, corporations are turning in increasing numbers to services of package engineering. This work evaluates the application of Bond Graphs Based Object-Oriented Approach to Determination of Natural Frequencies of Packaging System Elements. Using the Bond Graph, a model of the Package-product system under testing was developed to closely simulate the real testing model and conditions. The testing model equipment and packaging system were developed using the Bond Graph computer assisted modeling approach. Using simulation, vibrations characteristics of the packaging model were obtained, i. e., natural frequencies and other relevant properties of the system (model). An analysis of the frequency characteristics was conducted by application of physical modeling using a suitable visual computer development platform. The results obtained by simulation, and those obtained on the vibration table (32, 9 Hz vs. 26, 777 Hz) are close to each other, they are very encouraging, and they open further possibilities. This work has proved that the Bond Graphs based approach has its place in a computer aided total Packaging Distribution Design process. It should also enable one to shorten the entire design/testing process, to insure that those expensive parts (products) are not destroyed during the testing process, and that the finished package design meets the design objectives.

40|$|We {{know that}} {{planetary}} systems {{are just as}} common around white dwarfs as around main sequence stars. However, self-consistently linking a planetary system across these two phases of stellar evolution through the violent giant branch poses computational challenges, and previous studies restricted architectures to equal-mass planets. Here, we remove this constraint and perform over 450 numerical integrations over a Hubble time (14 Gyr) of packed planetary systems with unequal-mass planets. We characterize the resulting trends {{as a function of}} planet order and mass. We find that intrusive radial incursions {{in the vicinity of the}} white dwarf become less likely as the dispersion amongst planet masses increases. The orbital meandering which may sustain a sufficiently dynamic environment around a white dwarf to explain observations is more dependent on the presence of terrestrial-mass planets than any variation in planetary mass. Triggering <b>unpacking</b> <b>or</b> instability during the white dwarf phase is comparably easy for systems of unequal-mass planets and systems of equal-mass planets; instabilities during the giant branch phase remain rare and require fine-tuning of initial conditions.

40|$|This paper proposes several novel methods, {{based on}} machine learning, to detect malware in {{executable}} files without {{any need for}} preprocessing, such as <b>unpacking</b> <b>or</b> disassembling. The basic method (Mal-ID) is a new static (form-based) analysis methodology that uses common segment analysis in order to detect malware files. By using common segment analysis, Mal-ID is able to discard malware parts that originate from benign code. In addition, Mal-ID uses {{a new kind of}} feature, termed meta-feature, to better capture the properties of the analyzed segments. Rather than using the entire file, as is usually the case with machine learning based techniques, the new approach detects malware on the segment level. This study also introduces two Mal-ID extensions that improve the Mal-ID basic method in various aspects. We rigorously evaluated Mal-ID and its two extensions with more than ten performance measures, and compared them to the highly rated boosted decision tree method under identical settings. The evaluation demonstrated that Mal-ID and the two Mal-ID extensions outperformed the boosted decision tree method in almost all respects. In addition, the results indicated that by extracting meaningful features, it is sufficient to employ one simple detection rule for classifying executable files...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the recent}} trends adopted by malware authors is to use packers or {{software}} tools that instigate code obfuscation in order to evade detection by antivirus scanners. With evasion techniques such as polymorphism and metamorphism malware is able to fool current detection techniques. Thus, security researchers and the anti-virus industry are facing a herculean task in extracting payloads hidden within packed executables. It is a common practice to use manual <b>unpacking</b> <b>or</b> static <b>unpacking</b> using some software tools and analyse the application programming interface (API) calls for malware detection. However, extracting these features from the unpacked executables for reverse obfuscation is labour intensive and requires deep knowledge of low-level programming that includes kernel and assembly language.

While some research has been conducted in arriving at file birthmarks using API call features and the like, there is a scarcity of work that relates to features in malcodes. To address this gap, we attempt to automatically analyse and classify the behavior of API function calls based on the malicious intent hidden within any packed program. This paper uses four-step methodology for developing a fully automated system to arrive at six main categories of suspicious behavior of API call features. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Circular {{permutation}} (CP) {{refers to}} {{situations in which}} the termini of a protein are relocated to other positions in the structure. CP occurs naturally and has been artificially created to study protein function, stability and folding. Recently CP is increasingly applied to engineer enzyme structure and function, and to create bifunctional fusion proteins unachievable by tandem fusion. CP is a complicated and expensive technique. An intrinsic difficulty in its application {{lies in the fact}} that not every position in a protein is amenable for creating a viable permutant. To examine the preferences of CP and develop CP viability prediction methods, we carried out comprehensive analyses of the sequence, structural, and dynamical properties of known CP sites using a variety of statistics and simulation methods, such as the bootstrap aggregating, permutation test and molecular dynamics simulations. CP particularly favors Gly, Pro, Asp and Asn. Positions preferred by CP lie within coils, loops, turns, and at residues that are exposed to solvent, weakly hydrogen-bonded, environmentally <b>unpacked,</b> <b>or</b> flexible. Disfavored positions include Cys, bulky hydrophobic residues, and residues located within helices or near the protein’s core. These results fostered the development of an effective viable CP site prediction system, which combined four machine learning methods, e. g., artificial neural networks, the support vector machine, a random forest, and a hierarchical feature integration procedure developed in this work. As assessed by using the hydrofolate reductase dataset as the independent evaluation dataset, this prediction system achieved an AUC of 0. 9.

40|$|Recently {{researchers}} have proposed using deep learning-based systems for malware detection. Unfortunately, all deep learning classification systems {{are vulnerable to}} adversarial attacks. Previous work has studied adversarial attacks against static analysis-based malware classifiers which only classify {{the content of the}} unknown file without execution. However, since the majority of malware is either packed or encrypted, malware classification based on static analysis often fails to detect these types of files. To overcome this limitation, anti-malware companies typically perform dynamic analysis by emulating each file in the anti-malware engine or performing in-depth scanning in a virtual machine. These strategies allow the analysis of the malware after <b>unpacking</b> <b>or</b> decryption. In this work, we study different strategies of crafting adversarial samples for dynamic analysis. These strategies operate on sparse, binary inputs in contrast to continuous inputs such as pixels in images. We then study the effects of two, previously proposed defensive mechanisms against crafted adversarial samples including the distillation and ensemble defenses. We also propose and evaluate the weight decay defense. Experiments show that with these three defensive strategies, the number of successfully crafted adversarial samples is reduced compared to a standard baseline system without any defenses. In particular, the ensemble defense is the most resilient to adversarial attacks. Importantly, none of the defenses significantly reduce the classification accuracy for detecting malware. Finally, we demonstrate that while adding additional hidden layers to neural models does not significantly improve the malware classification accuracy, it does significantly increase the classifier's robustness to adversarial attacks...|$|R

40|$|Malware {{remains a}} serious problem for corporations, {{government}} agencies, and individuals, as attackers continue {{to use it as}} a tool to effect frequent and costly network intrusions. Machine learning holds the promise of automating the work required to detect newly discovered malware families, and could potentially learn generalizations about malware and benign software that support the detection of entirely new, unknown malware families. Unfortunately, few proposed machine learning based malware detection methods have achieved the low false positive rates required to deliver deployable detectors. In this paper we a deep neural network malware classifier that achieves a usable detection rate at an extremely low false positive rate and scales to real world training example volumes on commodity hardware. Specifically, we show that our system achieves a 95 % detection rate at 0. 1 % false positive rate (FPR), based on more than 400, 000 software binaries sourced directly from our customers and internal malware databases. We achieve these results by directly learning on all binaries, without any filtering, <b>unpacking,</b> <b>or</b> manually separating binary files into categories. Further, we confirm our false positive rates directly on a live stream of files coming in from Invincea's deployed endpoint solution, provide an estimate of how many new binary files we expected to see a day on an enterprise network, and describe how that relates to the false positive rate and translates into an intuitive threat score. Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to quickly train and deploy a low resource, highly accurate machine learning classification model, with false positive rates that approach traditional labor intensive signature based methods, while also detecting previously unseen malware...|$|R

Despite their increased computational power and range of applications, the security implications of GPUs have not been carefully studied. It has been assumed {{that the use of}} a GPU as a coprocessor with physically separate memory space, minimal support for multi-user programming, and limited I/O capability inherently guarantees security. This research challenges this assumption by demonstrating multiple security vulnerabilities in the current GPU computing infrastructure. Specifically, it focuses on the following three areas: 1. Denial-of-Service by overwhelming the capabilities of the GPU so it is unable to provide responsiveness to the host operating system. 2. Information leakage due to the way that modern GPUs fail to randomize pointers and zero out memory. 3.
