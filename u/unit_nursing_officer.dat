40|$|This project {{examined}} if transformational nurse {{managers were}} perceived by their nursing staff as more effective leaders than transactional or passive/avoidant leaders using the Transformational Theory of Leadership through {{administration of the}} Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Form 5 X) to <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers and staff nurses. 80 staff <b>nurses</b> and seven <b>unit</b> <b>nurse</b> managers participated in the study. <b>Unit</b> <b>nurse</b> managers completed the MLQ (Form 5 X) about themselves and nursing staff completed the MLQ (Form 5 X) about their <b>unit</b> <b>nurse</b> manager. Using descriptive statistics <b>unit</b> <b>nurse</b> manager results were compared with nursing staff results. The goal was for <b>unit</b> <b>nurse</b> managers to describe their perceived leadership style as compared to staff 2 ̆ 7 s perceived leadership style of their <b>unit</b> <b>nurse</b> manager. <b>Unit</b> <b>nurse</b> managers 2 ̆ 7 Outcomes of Leadership were also determined {{with the assumption that}} the higher the scores, the more transformational the leader. Four <b>unit</b> <b>nurse</b> managers rated themselves as primarily transformational with transactional and passive/avoidant qualities and three unit managers rated themselves as having stronger passive/avoidant qualities than transformational or transactional leadership qualities. None of the <b>unit</b> <b>nurse</b> managers were rated by their staff as overwhelmingly one leadership style over the other. <b>Unit</b> <b>nurse</b> managers were rated as using all three leadership styles - transformational, transactional and passive/avoidant - equally with minor individual variances among the <b>unit</b> <b>nurse</b> managers. Therefore, {{it was not possible to}} reach an accurate conclusion to the project hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|A major {{objective}} of the Report of die committee on senior nursing staff structure (Salmon Report) was to clarify the role of middle-management nurses. This paper analyses the views of 170 nurses in two general, one psychiatric, and one mental subnormality hospital, about <b>nursing</b> <b>officers.</b> A <b>nursing</b> <b>officer</b> was mentioned as the person with most say or influence over them by more nurses of all grades in the two non-general than in the two general hospitals, a difference {{explained in terms of}} the greater role of the medical model, and hence the sister consultant relationship in the latter. There were, however, also marked differences between the responses received from staff in the two general and between the two non-general hospitals in the perceived influence of the <b>nursing</b> <b>officer</b> which could not be explained in this way. Analysis of repertory grids suggested more problems in relations with senior nurses overall in the general hospitals. Nurses' descriptions of relationships with superiors suggested that <b>nursing</b> <b>officer</b> superiors were seen more as 'socio-emotional' whilst sisters and charge nurses were seen as 'instrumental' leaders. Asked to choose a person who had annoyed them at work, nurses chose a <b>nursing</b> <b>officer</b> more frequently than other grades of nurse, particularly in the non-general hospitals. Reasons for annoyance with a <b>nursing</b> <b>officer</b> included unwarranted interference, destructive criticism, and lack of specialized knowledge...|$|R
