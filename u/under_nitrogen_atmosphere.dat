50|$|Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) {{nanoparticles}} {{are generally}} synthesized at low temperature; However, {{the tendency of}} Co3O4 to grow into complex microstructure made the addition of organic surfactant necessary. Organic surfactant is both expensive and pollutant. Using organometallic molecular as a precursor to synthesize Co3O4 under high temperature can ensure purity, composition, phase purity, and microstructure. Using organometallic chemistry, Co3O4 is synthesized by heating 0.01 mol of bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediiminecobalt(II, known as Co-(salen), to 500 °C in the air. The synthesis of the organometallic molecular precursor Co-(salen) is prepared by first making the bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine crystal. By dissolving salicylaldehyde in methanol with drops of 1,2- ethylenediamine, 92% of bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine crystal could be purified via reflux and filtration. Bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediirninccobalt(II) is then prepared by adding cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate in propanol and warmed to 50 °C <b>under</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> followed by adding bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine and purification through reflux and recrystallization.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} (in this case, of carbon-14-labelled material) {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1. In the first step, o-nitroaniline (compound 1) is purified through dissolution in hot water-ethanol mixture in relation 2:1. carbon is added and the result is filtrated for clarifying. The filtrate is chilled while kept in movement to generate crystals, usually at 4 °C, but if needed it can also be cooled to -10 °C. The crystals are then collected, washed and dried. If it is pure enough it is used for the following steps, which take place at 0 till 5 °C. To produce o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C (compound 2), the first component o-nitroaniline and (concentrated reagent grade) hydrochloric acid are put together with ice and water. Sodium nitride, dissolved in water, is added to this thin slurry. After the formation of a pale-yellow solution, which indicates the completion of the diazotization reaction, the pH should be adjusted to 6. After this, the solution is introduced to a mixture of cuprous cyanide and toluene. At room temperature the toluene layer is removed. The aqueous layer is washed and dried and the purified product is isolated by crystallization. The third product is Anthranilamide-14C (compound 3). It is formed out of o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C, which is first solved in ethanol and hydrazine hydrate. The solvent is heated subsequently, treated in a well-ventilated hood with small periodic charges, smaller than 10 mg, of Raney nickel. <b>Under</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>atmosphere</b> the ethanolic solution is clarified and dried. The next step is to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C (compound 4). In water dissolved sodium nitrite is added to anthranilamide and hydrochloric acid in ice water. Because this is a diazotization reaction, the product is pale-yellow again. After this the pH is adjusted to 8,5. This causes the ring closure to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C. This results in a sodium salt slurry that can be treated with hydrochloric acid, what lowers the pH down to 2 till 4. The 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C is collected, washed and dried. In the following step 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C has to be formed. Therefore, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C and paraformaldehyde are added to ethylene dichloride and heated to 40 °C. Then thionyl chloride is added and the whole solvent is further heated to 65 °C. After four hours of heating the solution is cooled down to room temperature. Water is added and the solution is neutralized. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed and put together with the result of the washed aqueous layer. The solvent was filtered and dried. The last step is the actual synthesis of Azinphos methyl. Ethylene dichloride is added to the compound resulting from the fifth step, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C. This mixture is heated to 50 °C and sodium bicarbonate and O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate sodium salt in water are added. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed, reextracted with ethylene dichloride and purified by filtration. The pure filtrate is dried. This product is once again purified by recrystallization from methanol. What is left is pure azinphos-methyl in form of white crystals.|$|E
