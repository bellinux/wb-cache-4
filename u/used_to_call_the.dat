5|$|Further {{down the}} hill, along the Military Road, is a two-story house, known as The Stewards House or as Killakee House (not to be {{confused}} with the now-demolished Killakee House that served as the residence of the Massy family who owned the adjacent Killakee Estate). It was built around 1765 by the Conolly family as a hunting lodge. Over the years, it has served as a dower house and as a residence for the agent who managed the Killakee Estate. To the rear is a belfry; this was once a common feature of large farmhouses and was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> workers for meals. The Hell Fire Club held meetings here for a time following the fire that damaged Mount Pelier lodge. The house has a reputation for being haunted, particularly by a large black cat. Stories regarding the origin of this spectre either connect it with the account of the priest who exorcised a cat at the Hell Fire Club or with a cat that was doused in whiskey and set alight by members of the Hell Fire Club before escaping across the mountains with its fur aflame.|$|E

2500|$|Popular desserts are payasam and halwa. The Hindu community's payasams, {{especially}} those made at temples, like the [...] Ambalappuzha temple, {{are famous for}} their rich taste.

2500|$|In 1972, Eno and Robert Fripp (from King Crimson) {{developed}} the [...] "Frippertronics" [...] tape delay system; a year later, the pair released the proto-ambient album (No Pussyfooting) (1973). The technique involved two Revox tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling {{from the first}} deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled. [...] This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with {{the distance between the}} two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). The technique was borrowed from minimalist composer Terry Riley, whose similar tape-delay feedback system with a pair of Revox tape recorders (a setup Riley <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Time Lag Accumulator") was first used on Riley's album Music for The Gift (1963). In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, Evening Star, and played several live shows in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{approach}} {{that can be}} used with some languages involves having different data structures, but all have the initial fields, including the next (and prev if double linked list) references in the same location. [...] After defining separate structures for each type of data, a generic structure can be defined that contains the minimum amount of data shared by all the other structures and contained at the top (beginning) of the structures. [...] Then generic routines can be created that use the minimal structure to perform linked list type operations, but separate routines can then handle the specific data. [...] This approach is often used in message parsing routines, where several types of messages are received, but all start with the same set of fields, usually including a field for message type. [...] The generic routines are used to add new messages to a queue when they are received, and remove them from the queue in order to process the message. [...] The message type field is then <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> correct routine to process the specific type of message.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{theories}} {{regarding the}} origin of the name Chimborazo exist. In many dialects of Quichua or Quechua, [...] "chimba" [...] means [...] "on the other side" [...] as in [...] "on {{the other side of the}} river" [...] or [...] "on the opposite bank." [...] Other dialects pronounce this word [...] "chimpa." [...] Also, [...] "razu" [...] means [...] "ice" [...] or [...] "snow." [...] Local Quichua speakers will say that Chimborazo is a Hispanicized pronunciation of [...] "chimbarazu," [...] meaning [...] "the snow on the other side." [...] Another theory suggests it is a combination of the Cayapa Schingbu for Women and the Colorado/Quichua Razo for Ice/Snow resulting in Women of Ice. According to another, Chimbo is Jívaro for Throne of Master/God resulting in Icethrone of God. The locals also <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> mountain Urcurazu, with the Quichua Urcu for Mountain resulting in Mountain of Ice. In local indigenous mysticism, Chimborazo represents Taita (Father) whereas neighbouring Tungurahua is seen as Mama, hence Taita Chimborazo and Mama Tungurahua.|$|E
2500|$|These pseudepigraphic texts aside, {{some authors}} did draw {{on a few}} {{genuinely}} Zoroastrian ideas. The Oracles of Hystaspes, by [...] "Hystaspes", another prominent magian pseudo-author, {{is a set of}} prophecies distinguished from other Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha in that it draws on real Zoroastrian sources. Some allusions are more difficult to assess: in the same text that attributes the invention of magic to Zoroaster, Pliny states that Zoroaster laughed on the day of his birth, although in an earlier place, Pliny had sworn in the name of Hercules that no child had ever done so before the 40th day from his birth. This notion of Zoroaster's laughter (like that of [...] "two million verses") also appears in the 9th– to 11th-century texts of genuine Zoroastrian tradition, and for a time it was assumed} that the origin of those myths lay with indigenous sources. Pliny also records that Zoroaster's head had pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid upon it, a presage of his future wisdom.} The Iranians were however just as familiar with the Greek writers, and the provenance of other descriptions are clear. For instance, Plutarch's description of its dualistic theologies reads thus: [...] "Others call the better of these a god and his rival a daemon, as, for example, Zoroaster the Magus, who lived, so they record, five thousand years before the siege of Troy. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> one Horomazes and the other Areimanius".|$|E
