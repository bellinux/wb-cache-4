5|$|Wary of Skanderbeg, Venice {{no longer}} openly {{challenged}} him. Another treaty {{was signed in}} 1463, when Venice went to war with the Turks. However, no peace was made between the Ottomans and Skanderbeg until 1463, before the Ottoman-Venetian war was of the same year, who retreated to Macedonia and prepared for another invasion of Albania after their defeat at Oronichea. During the Albanian-Venetian war, they had taken Svetigrad after several months of siege. Thence, they could cross into Albania <b>uninhibited.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and <b>uninhibited.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{favorable}} conditions {{allowed for}} the <b>uninhibited</b> growth of Iselle early in its development, moderate wind shear briefly impacted the hurricane on August2, preventing thunderstorms from intensifying and causing the storm to become slightly malformed vertically. However, these conditions abated shortly afterwards, allowing Iselle to resume strengthening and reach Category2hurricane status late that same day. With wind shear no longer impinging on the organization of Iselle, the tropical cyclone gradually became more symmetric, allowing for the hurricane's once ragged eye to clear itself of cloud cover and the storm to intensify to major hurricane status on August3. Attaining some annular tropical cyclone characteristics, Iselle reaching Category4 strength at 12:00UTC on August4. Consequently, Iselle reached peak intensity at 18:00UTC with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). At the same time, the hurricane exhibited an 30mi (45km) eye across.|$|E
5|$|Cher {{starred in}} three films in 1987. In Suspect, {{she played a}} public defender who is both helped and romanced {{by one of the}} jurors in the {{homicide}} case she is handling. Along with Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, she starred as one of three divorcees involved with a mysterious and wealthy visitor from hell who comes to a small New England town in the comedy horror The Witches of Eastwick. In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy Moonstruck, she played an Italian widow in love with her fiancé's younger brother. The two latter films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively. For her performance in Moonstruck, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. By 1988, Cher had {{become one of the most}} bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1million per film. That year, she released the fragrance <b>Uninhibited,</b> which earned about $15million in its first year sales.|$|E
5|$|Dog pups show {{unrestrained}} {{fighting with}} their siblings from 2 weeks of age, with injury avoided only {{due to their}} undeveloped jaw muscles. This fighting gives way to play-chasing {{with the development of}} running skills at 4–5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more-developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age, when they first show signs of play-fighting with their siblings; serious fighting occurs during 4–6 weeks of age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4–6 weeks, when play-fighting frequently escalates into <b>uninhibited</b> biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10–12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Once the lactation period concludes, the female drives off the pups. Pups born late remain with their mother until early autumn, at which time they leave either singly or in groups of two to four individuals. Females reach sexual maturity after 10–11 months and males at 21–22 months.|$|E
5|$|In Norway {{the three}} {{synoptic}} histories, Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium, Historia Norwegie and Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum (ca. 1190), all give a short {{account of the}} battle. The Icelandic kings' sagas offer a much more extensive treatment, starting with Oddr Snorrason's Saga of Olaf Tryggvason (ca. 1190). Working from skaldic poetry, oral history, learned European examples and an <b>uninhibited</b> imagination, Oddr constructed an elaborate account of the battle. This was {{taken up by the}} later Icelandic sagas, Fagrskinna and Heimskringla (ca. 1220), both of which add quotations of skaldic verse. Three Icelandic poems from around 1200 also have some historical interest: Nóregs konungatal, Rekstefja and Óláfs drápa Tryggvasonar. The immense Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta (ca. 1300) combines several of the above sources to form the last, longest and least reliable saga account.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 1723, {{six days}} before his death, Cosimo III {{distributed}} a final proclamation commanding that Tuscany shall stay independent; Anna Maria Luisa shall succeed <b>uninhibited</b> after Gian Gastone; the Grand Duke reserves {{the right to choose}} his successor. Unfortunately for Cosimo, Europe completely ignored it. Gian Gastone, now the Grand Duke, and Anna Maria Luisa were not on good terms. He despised the Electress for engineering his unhappy marriage with Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, while she detested his liberal policies: he repealed all of his father's anti-Semitic statutes and revelled in upsetting her. Consequently, the Electress was compelled to abandon her apartment in the left wing of the royal palace, the Pitti, for the Villa La Quiete. She refurbished La Quiete's house and gardens with the assistance of Sebastiano Rapi, the gardener of the Boboli Gardens, and the architects Giovanni Battista Foggini and Paolo Giovanozzi. In the period 1722–1725, the Electress embellished the villa further by commissioning twelve statues of various religious figures.|$|E
5|$|Under his uncle's guidance, O'Neill {{joined the}} St George Cricket Club, in the Sydney Grade competition. He {{steadily}} moved {{up through the}} grades and broke into the first grade side {{at the age of}} 16. Sensing his potential, the club's selectors informed him that regardless of form, he would play the full season, which allowed him to be <b>uninhibited</b> in his batting. He made 108 in seven innings. The next season, he was out 12 times leg before wicket in 15 innings, and run out in the other three. O'Neill attributed his failures to over-aggressiveness and resolved to improve his patience. In the second match of the new season, the 17-year-old O'Neill made his first century. With all five state selectors onlooking, he made 28 in the next match and was called into the state squad.|$|E
5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and <b>uninhibited.</b> He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is <b>uninhibited,</b> whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the male employees a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, <b>uninhibited</b> parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a wicket in each innings. He was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 32 with Johnston, scoring 19runs, his best at Test level to date in just 18minutes. Toshack's best Test performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured, including the wickets of Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, captain Yardley and Alec Coxon. During this performance, he employed two short legs and a silly mid-off. He had a moderately successful Third Test, taking figures of 3/101 in the only Test that Australia did not win. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test after taking an ineffective 1/112 in the first innings, {{he was unable to}} bowl in the second innings of an Australian win. He made a recovery and it was hoped that {{he would be able to}} play in the Fifth Test, but he injured again himself in the lead-up match against Lancashire. He was taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in first-class fixtures, Toshack managed a Test average of 51 on the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in an <b>uninhibited</b> tenth-wicket stand with Johnston. Due to the fragility of his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour. Toshack totalled 50 wickets at the average of 21.12 for the tour.|$|E

25|$|Social psychologists study group-related (collective) {{phenomena}} such as {{the behavior}} of crowds. An important concept {{in this area is}} deindividuation, a reduced state of self-awareness that can be caused by feelings of anonymity.

25|$|It {{has been}} speculated that {{the choice of the}} college as a {{beneficiary}} by the two later Henrys was a political one, with Henry VII in particular concerned to legitimate a new, post-civil war Tudor regime by demonstrating patronage of what was by definition the King's College. Later building work on the chapel is marked by an <b>uninhibited</b> branding with the Tudor rose and other symbols of the new establishment, quite against the precise instructions of the Founder's Will.|$|E
25|$|Early in his {{international}} career, Waugh was a natural, <b>uninhibited</b> strokeplayer {{who liked}} to drive off the back foot. He could score quickly, but was inconsistent at Test level and seemed better suited to ODI cricket. In the shorter game, he often accelerated the scoring in the later overs of the innings. As a bowler, he employed a carefully disguised slower ball bowled {{from the back of}} the hand, and regularly sent down the final overs, when this change of pace was difficult to score from.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{scientific}} thought, certain refined {{emotions are}} considered a complex neural trait innate {{in a variety of}} domesticated and non-domesticated mammals. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that <b>uninhibited</b> acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} season in 1999, Bayern won the league title, but undeniably the {{highlight}} was the unforgettable Champions League Final in Barcelona. Bayern led early after a Mario Basler free-kick and controlled most of the match, but Manchester United sensationally turned the match around in stoppage time. Inside 90 seconds, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær transformed an excellent performance from Bayern into the sight of <b>uninhibited</b> tears by Samuel Kuffour and company. Adding insult to injury, Bayern lost in a penalty shootout in the national cup final against Werder Bremen two weeks later. For Lothar Matthäus, {{it was the second}} time that he missed a decisive penalty in a cup final.|$|E
25|$|For Newcastle United, the FA Cup final {{was their}} {{final game of}} the season, meaning that they were <b>uninhibited</b> in their squad {{selection}} for the match. The biggest selection dilemma for manager Ruud Gullit was who to pick to play up front alongside captain Alan Shearer: Scottish forward Duncan Ferguson, who was due for an operation on his groin two days later, or Georgian Temur Ketsbaia. Ketsbaia ultimately got the job, with Ferguson named as a substitute. After marking David Ginola out of the game in their semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, 20-year-old full-back Andy Griffin was selected {{on the right side of}} Newcastle's defence to perform a similar task against Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs.|$|E
25|$|Berlin's nightlife {{has been}} celebrated {{as one of}} the most diverse and vibrant of its kind. In the 1970s and 80s the SO36 in Kreuzberg was a centre for punk music and culture. The SOUND and the Dschungel gained notoriety. Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from all over the world, {{particularly}} those in Western and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city centre of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and counterculture gatherings. The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the Watergate, Tresor, E-Werk and Berghain.

25|$|There {{have long}} been {{allegations}} that volunteer DMOZ editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition. Such allegations are fielded by ODP's staff and meta editors, who {{have the authority to}} take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices. In 2003, DMOZ introduced a new Public Abuse Report System that allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form. <b>Uninhibited</b> discussion of DMOZ's purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream Webmaster discussion forums.

25|$|IL-17 {{interaction}} with IL-17RA receptors, abundant on the keratinocyte cell surface, incite epidermal cells to increase expression of IL-6, antimicrobial peptides, IL-8 and CCL20. Increased concentration of IL-6 alters the epidermal environment by decreasing {{the ability of}} T regulatory cells to control the behavior of Th17 cells. Reduced regulation allows <b>uninhibited</b> proliferation of Th17 cells and production of IL-17 in psoriatic lesions, augmenting IL-17 signaling. Antimicrobial peptides and IL-8 attract neutrophils {{to the site of}} injury where these cells remove damaged and inflamed keratinocyte cells. New immature DCs are also recruited by CCL20 via chemotaxis where their activation restarts and amplifies the cycle of inflammation. IL-17 and additional cytokines released from the influx of neutrophils, T and dendritic cells mediate effects on localized leukocytes and keratinocytes that supports the progression of psoriasis by inciting chronic inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Shevardnadze {{had allowed}} the {{development}} of NGOs before the Rose Revolution, and numerous large and relatively <b>uninhibited</b> NGOs were able to operate in Georgia prior to the 2003 parliamentary elections. Georgia's weak economy allowed these NGOs, who were often partially foreign funded, to pay decent salaries {{that would not have}} been available in working for the Georgian state. As early as the Summer of 2002, there was great concern amongst the leaders of Georgia's most influential NGOs that Shevardnadze was not prepared to relinquish power voluntarily, and that other ways to remove him from power might be necessary. Some of these leaders hoped to make the 'Serbian scenario' a reality in Georgia, in the sense that they wanted to promote non-violent protests to force the resignation of an authoritarian leader. Before the Rose Revolution, a large network of NGOs with foreign financial support already existed in the country that could later coordinate protest.|$|E
