This thesis {{emphasizes the importance of}} the transient behavior as well as robust stability of a system and takes it into account in the design of adaptive control laws. The basic idea is to search for compensators in the direction of minimizing a quadratic performance index, and then analyze the stability and robustness of the selected compensators in the presence of bounded disturbances, sensor noises, and <b>unmodelled</b> <b>dynamics.</b> With this idea, centralized and decentralized adaptive control schemes are proposed for rigid-joint manipulators. Stability bounds for disturbances, control and adaptation gains, and desired trajectories and their time-derivatives are derived for the proposed schemes. These bounds are sufficient conditions for robust stability of the proposed schemes in the presence of <b>unmodelled</b> <b>dynamics</b> such as feedback delays in the digital control systems and the coupled dynamics in the decentralized scheme. A flexibility compensator is designed to treat the problem of joint flexibility. With the flexibility compensator, a manipulator having flexible joints is transformed to that having rigid joints with high-frequency dynamics of joint couplings representing <b>unmodelled</b> <b>dynamics.</b> In this way, control of flexible-joint manipulators is converted to that of the corresponding rigid-joint manipulators. Accordingly, the robust adaptive control schemes proposed for rigid-joint manipulators are applied. Then, through stability analysis, stability bounds for disturbances, control and adaptation gains, and desired trajectories and their time-derivatives are derived for the scheme with the flexibility compensator, {{in the presence of the}} <b>unmodelled</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Under the constraint of these bounds, the proposed adaptive scheme is not only almost independent of the gear-reduction ratios, flexibilities of joint couplings, and characteristics of actuators, but also free from the requirements of measuring angular accelerations and jerks of links...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Residual errors (deviations between {{measurements}} and system models) {{can be caused}} by several reasons: observation/process noise, nonlinear products, system transients, <b>unmodelled</b> <b>dynamics,</b> etc. The first two cannot be explained by linear models, the latter two can.

This paper analyses components of the residual errors, and suggests a simple automatic method to effectively suppress system transients and <b>unmodelled</b> <b>dynamics</b> during variance analysis. This allows robust noise analysis, and then reliable model validation. The method is based on different properties of the error sequences in the frequency domain, without the need of separate observation noise analysis or of “full-blown ” nonlinear analysis.
