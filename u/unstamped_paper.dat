60|$|In {{the year}} ended June 30, 1861, the gross revenue of the post- office of the States was, as I have stated, 1,700,000l. In the same year its {{expenditure}} was in round figures 2,720,000l.; consequently there was an actual loss, to be made up out of general taxation, amounting to 1,020,000l. In the accounts of the American officers this is lessened by 140,000l. That sum having been arbitrarily fixed by the government as the amount earned by the post-office in carrying free mail matter. We have a similar system in computing {{the value of the}} service rendered by our post-office to the government in carrying government dispatches; but with us the amount named as the compensation depends on the actual weight carried. If the matter so carried be carried solely on the government service, as is, I believe, the case with us, any such claim on behalf of the post-office is apparently unnecessary. The Crown works for the Crown, as the right hand works for the left. The post-office pays no rates or taxes, contributes nothing to the poor, runs its mails on turnpike roads free of toll, and gives receipts on <b>unstamped</b> <b>paper.</b> With us no payment is in truth made, though the post-office in its accounts presumes itself to have received the money; but in the States the sum named is handed over by the State Treasury to the Post-office Treasury. Any such statement of credit does not in effect alter the real fact that over a million sterling is required as a subsidy by the American post-office, in order that it may be enabled to pay its way. In estimating the expenditure of the office the department at Washington debits itself with the sums paid for the ocean transit of its mails, amounting to something over one hundred and fifty thousand pounds. We also now do the same, with the much greater sum paid by us for such service, which now amounts to 949,228l., or nearly a million sterling. Till lately this was not paid out of the post-office moneys, and the post-office revenue was not debited with the amount.|$|E
50|$|He married Eleanor Byerley, on 3 June 1834, and {{two months}} later was arrested and imprisoned for six months for having {{circulated}} Hetherington's <b>unstamped</b> <b>paper,</b> ironically entitled The Conservative. He had come under the observation of the government {{as a leader of}} the meeting of trade unions in April of that, in favour of the action of the Dorchester labourers. This was his last imprisonment, though he continued to issue books banned by the government.|$|E
5000|$|Stamp {{duty was}} levied on newspapers, {{and the first}} phase of the {{campaign}} was the distribution of newspapers that were unstamped, and therefore illegal. A central figure of this [...] "war of the unstamped" [...] was Henry Hetherington. His <b>unstamped</b> <b>paper,</b> The Poor Man's Guardian, was launched in 1831. It tested the boundaries of the government's willingness to enforce the duty, recruiting hundreds of paper sellers and flaunting its illegal status. The National Union of the Working Classes took up the attack on [...] "taxes on knowledge"; it had an Owenite background, with the British Association for Promoting Co-operative Knowledge founded in 1829.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main issue}} was {{constitutional}} rights of Englishmen, so the French in Quebec did not react. [...] Some English-speaking merchants were opposed, but were in a fairly small minority. The Quebec Gazette ceased publication until the act was repealed, apparently over the unwillingness to use stamped paper. [...] In neighboring Nova Scotia a number of former New England residents objected, but recent British immigrants and London-oriented business interests based in Halifax, the provincial capital were more influential. [...] The only major public protest was the hanging in effigy of the stamp distributor and Lord Bute. [...] The act was implemented in both provinces, but Nova Scotia's stamp distributor resigned in January 1766, beset by ungrounded fears for his safety. [...] Authorities there were ordered to allow ships bearing <b>unstamped</b> <b>papers</b> to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps. [...] The Act occasioned some protests in Newfoundland, and the drafting of petitions opposing not only the Stamp Act, but {{the existence of the}} customhouse at St. John's, based on legislation dating back to the reign of Edward VI forbidding any sort of duties on the importation of goods related to its fisheries.|$|R
50|$|Chapps Mill was a {{fulling mill}} until 1790, when Charles Ward of Doncombe Mill took {{over from the}} Drewett family, clothiers of Colerne and Batheaston. Charles Ward and partner William Duckett {{converted}} the mill to paper. In 1805, Charles Ward {{was found guilty of}} producing <b>unstamped</b> <b>paper</b> and the sheriff confiscated all his goods. By 1818, the mill had been converted to cloth and the paper machinery was put up for sale. By 1827 the mill was back to paper making, until it was closed under W J Dowding in 1994. The Bybrook approaching the mill is man made at a high level and wider than the natural brook to provide a reservoir of water.|$|E
5000|$|Holt openly {{challenged}} the Stamp Act of 1765 while being {{the publisher of}} the New-York Gazette and Weekly Post-Boy. He was the favorite printer of the Sons of Liberty. Holt almost stopped the publication of this newspaper because of the heavy tax he would have to pay the English for stamped paper. The Sons of Liberty, with a threat of bodily harm, persuaded Holt to continue the newspaper in defiance of the tax. Holt then continued the newspaper on <b>unstamped</b> <b>paper</b> and even published for meetings of groups against the Stamp Act. He added to the heading of his newspaper the words [...] "The united voice of all his Majesty's free and loyal subjects in America - Liberty and property and no stamps." ...|$|E
