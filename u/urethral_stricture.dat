25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, {{and other diseases}} of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, <b>urethral</b> <b>stricture,</b> urethral calculi (stones), chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Neurogenic bladder can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms {{similar to those of}} BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation. Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and alcohol-induced nerve damage. Individuals affected by heart failure often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.|$|E

We evaluated this "cause-effect" relationship highlighting {{the significance of the}} etiology on the overall prognosis of <b>urethral</b> <b>strictures.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 302 males with <b>urethral</b> <b>strictures</b> were assessed (both retrospectively and prospectively) over a period of ten years. The preoperative evaluation was performed by retrograde urethrogram, urethrosonogram, and uroflowmetry and categorized, based on etiology: a) as post traumatic, b) post infective, c) iatrogenic or d) unknown. Traumatic strictures were subjected to pelvic X-ray and sub-categorized into grades A, B and C, following the TILE classification. Patients were operated; with tunica albuginea urethroplasty for anterior strictures and U shape prostato-bulbar anastomosis for posterior strictures. RESULTS: Traumatic strictures accounted for 54 % of cases. 127 of the 302 patients were treated using Tunica Albuginea Urethroplasty, while U shaped Prostatobulbar Anastomosis was performed on others. Post traumatic strictures had best outcome whereas post infective strictures had the worse outcome.

40|$|Background: <b>Urethral</b> <b>strictures</b> {{are one of}} {{the common}} {{problems}} encountered by the urologist and affect one in 10, 000 males. The aetiology can be secondary to inammation, trauma or can be idiopathic. The time honoured management of strictures by dilatation was associated with high recurrence rates. Currently various techniques of urethroplasty are used in the management of strictures. We herein describe our early experience with a combined technique of non transecting urethroplasty with buccal mucosal augmentat ion for the management of segmental <b>urethral</b> <b>strictures.</b> Objective: To report our early experience for the treatment of segmental <b>urethral</b> <b>strictures</b> with combined non transecting anastomotic urethroplasty and buccal mucosal augmentation. Material and Methods: A total of three patients underwent non transecting anastomotic urethroplasty with buccal mucosal augmentation between January 2010 and December 2013 with a minimum follow up of one year. Results: At one year follow up all patients were free of obstructive symptoms and, none of the patients developed recurrence. No patient developed erectile dysfunction during the course of follow up. Conclus ion: Non t ransec t ing anas tomot ic urethroplasty with buccal mucosal augmentation is a viable option for long segment strictures with diverticulum and segmental <b>urethral</b> <b>strictures.</b> This method helps in reducing the length of buccal graft required. Due to the non-transecting nature of the surgery, blood supply to urethra is maintained, there is good graft uptake and the incidence of erectile dysfunction is reduce...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionUrethral strictures {{remain a}} {{reconstructive}} dilemma {{due to high}} incidence of recurrence and unsatisfactory outcomes. Pelvic trauma remains the foremost etiology leading to morbidity. We evaluated this “cause-effect” relationship of pelvic trauma to stricture outcome, to replenish our understanding of contemporary <b>urethral</b> <b>strictures</b> and highlight significance of type, degree and influence of primary management of pelvic trauma on the overall prognosis of <b>urethral</b> <b>strictures.</b> Materials and method 163 male patients with <b>urethral</b> <b>strictures,</b> primary etiology being pelvic trauma, were assessed preoperatively followed by retrograde urethrogram, urethrosonogram, uroflowmetry, and then subjected to pelvic radiographs to identify presence and type of pelvic fracture, and further sub-categorize them into grades A, B and C, of TILE classification. Thereafter, 6 weeks later, these patients underwent urethroplasty. ResultsOf 163 patients having pelvic trauma, 80 fell under category A of TILE grading, whereas 55 were under TILE B and 28 under TILE C. Most common stricture location was membranous urethra. Success rates were 96 – 98 % till 1 year follow up, but after two years, they declined to 93 %. TILE A and B had a better post operative course as compared to TILE C.
