40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the history of}} the English law doctrine according to which the mistake of law (error iuris) is a bar for restitution. The author seeks to analyze the premises of mistake that led to recovery of the payment. Since the adjudication of the leading case Bilbie v. Lumley (1802) it was settled by the courts that he who had paid while operating under mistake of fact could demand restitution. On the other hand the one who acted under mistake of law could not. Over the last two centuries, until the ground-breaking decision in Kleinwort Benson Ltd v. Lincoln City Council (1999), the distinction into mistake of law and mistake of fact was very important in cases of <b>undue</b> <b>payment.</b> The author ventures whether there are any foundations for the promotion of the thesis that the aforementioned distinction might be an example of the reception of continental doctrines by the English legal system...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{rendition of}} Belgian {{law does not}} list disgorgement as a remedy. In reality, however, disgorgement is ordered in certain circumstances, but it is generally not recognized as such. For example, case law on personality rights and intellectual property rights contains examples where courts, {{under the banner of}} loss compensation, in fact set damages at a level higher than the actual losses to force the wrongdoer to hand over his profits. Also, non-compliance penalties are set at a level to provide an incentive to obey a court order, requiring the amount to be equal to the profits that can be made by ignoring the order. On the other hand, some instances of primary proprietary rights to profits can alternatively be understood as examples of disgorgement as a remedy for infringements of rights. Examples are the right of an owner to the fruits a male fide possessor realizes from his property and the right of the solvens to the income the bad faith accipiens has earned from an <b>undue</b> <b>payment.</b> In the view of the national reporter, Belgian private law apparently includes a (hidden) general principle that gives the holder of a subjective right a claim for disgorgement of profits realized by another person who in bad faith infringed the exclusive authority of the rightholder. This general principle has not (yet) been explicitly recognized by the courts, but it helps to understand what courts are actually doing in cases that cannot be explained under standard rules of civil liability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Brazil, despite {{there being}} {{specific}} legislation regulating forced tax collection proceedings, these are still largely influenced by case law of national courts. We are {{now living in}} the third decade of Federal Law No. 6, 830, promulgated in 1980, which aimed to guarantee greater privileges to the treasury {{in the course of}} the debt collection saga. However, the many loopholes and lacunae gaping throughout the text have left all stakeholders – government, taxpayers and judges – somewhat exasperated. Part II of this Paper analyzes the main features of forced tax collection proceedings: registration of the tax liability, presumption of liquidity and certainty; definition of “responsible” persons in terms of the law; collateralization and challenges to the debt; and the tax liability vis-à-vis other debts. A brief look is given to other pieces of procedural legislation related to tax disputes, most importantly the suits for a writ of mandamus; actions for restoration of <b>undue</b> <b>payments,</b> and actions for annulment. Finally, summaries of case law of the Superior Court of Justice are considered. These form an essential part of Brazilian sources of case law, most especially in tax proceedings...|$|R

A safra esperada pode ser segurada por meio de um agente financeiro (banco) com carteira agrícola. Quando um agricultor acredita que teve perdas na safra, recorre ao banco solicitando pagamento de seguro agrícola. O banco então emite um Comunicado de Ocorrência de Perda – COP para o Banco Central. Em geral eles são pagos sem averiguação. Se o agricultor alegou perdas e solicitou o pagamento do seguro agrícola, no laudo emitido após a colheita, constará a informação da emissão de COP. Essa pesquisa propõe um método automático que viabilize analisar um maior número de COP, contribuindo para minimizar os custos do pagamento de COP indevidas, sem ser necessário ampliar os atuais recursos humanos disponíveis na SEAF. O método proposto é baseado na construção de modelos com técnica de inteligência {{artificial}} para inferir se há evidências de que pode ocorrer COP, a partir dos dados dos laudos obtidos pelo MDA para as safras de agricultura familiar dos anos de 2006 a 2010, totalizando 11. 743 registros. Com a aplicação de técnicas estatísticas foram selecionados 19 atributos dentre os 311 atributos coletados por meio dos laudos. A partir desses 19 atributos foram construídas regras de associação e classificadores para COP. As regras de associação foram obtidas com o algoritmo “Apriori” e os modelos de classificação foram baseados na construção de classificadores probabilísticos (Naive Bayes e árvore de inferência condicional), árvore de decisão (C 4. 5) e máquina de vetores de suporte (SVM). Os classificadores construídos foram considerados isoladamente e em comitês, constituídos multiclassificadores com as técnicas de votação, boosting e bagging. Foram propostas novas abordagens para construção de multiclassificadores baseados em disjunção, ponderação pelos índices de desempenho e cascata. Todos os classificadores foram avaliados com as métricas de sensibilidade, especificidade, acurácia e F-measure, além da análise de curva ROC. Os resultados obtidos dão suporte experimental para se concluir que os multiclassificadores propostos – disjunção, ponderação e cascata – apresentam melhor desempenho para esse tipo de problema do que os obtidos com a abordagem tradicional, tendo alcançado o índice de 0, 944 para AUC. ______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe Ministry of Agrarian Development in Brazil (MDA), {{through the}} Secretariat for Family Agriculture (SEAF), has structure and methodology to monitor family farmers through the government program known as National Program for the Strengthening of Family Agriculture (PRONAF). The SEAF is responsible by PRONAF. The expected crop can be insured by a commercial bank with agricultural portfolio. When a farmer believes {{that has a}} loss of crop, he can request the bank the payment of the crop insurance. The bank issues a Communication of Occurrence of Losses - COP to the Central Bank of Brazil. If the farmer claimed losses and sought payment of the crop insurance, the technical report issued after the harvest, contains the information of COP. This research proposes an automatic method that allows the analyses of {{a larger number of}} occurrences of COP, contributing to minimize the costs of <b>undue</b> <b>payment</b> of COPs, without the need to expand the current technical staff of SEAF. The proposed method is based on building models which uses artificial intelligence techniques in order to conclude if there are enough evidence that COPs can occurs. Those models are built based on data extracted from technical reports about the family farm harvests in the years from 2006 to 2010. The results obtained in this research were based on 11, 743 of these technical reports available in the MDA. With the application of statistical analysis the 19 attributes more relevant, among the 311 attributes available, were identified. Based on the 19 more relevant attributes, association rules and classifiers were built to identify the possibility of occurrence of COP. The association rules were obtained with the Apriori algorithm and the models for classification were built with probabilistic classifiers (Naive Bayes), decision tree (C 4. 5), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classifiers were considered alone and in committees. A classifier formed by a committee of classifiers was called multi- classifier. The last one used the techniques of vote, boosting and bagging. New proposals have been made for the construction of multi-classifiers based on disjunction of simple classifiers, the weighting of individual performance indicators, and on making a cascade of a set of simple classifiers. Both the classifiers and the multi-classifiers were evaluated with the metrics of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-measure, and analysis of ROC curve. The results achieved provide experimental support for concluding that our multi-classifiers proposed have had better performance on this task than those obtained with the traditional approach. The better performance index achieved by our best multi-classifier was 0. 944 for AUC...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Thesis in Law The defence of passing-on and Indirect Purchaser Standing as Components of Private Enforcement of EU Antitrust Rules Summaries The present work {{investigated}} one of {{the most}} complex and controversial issues in the field of private enforcement of antitrust rules, the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing. The research question that guided us throughout this work was: how should the passing-on defence be designed in order to (i) guarantee full compensation to both the direct and indirect purchasers; (ii) to prevent that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant is unjustly enriched; and (iii) to prevent the multiple liability and over-deterrence of the defendant? This work attempted to answer these questions. In doing so, it explored the US private antitrust enforcement policy, the Supreme Courts case law, State law and court practice, the legislative proposals regarding the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing, and academic literature. In antitrust cases the assistance of economists to help to overcome {{one of the}} complex issues in designing private enforcement, i. e. quantifying damages and calculating the degree of passing-on, is inevitable. This research provided therefore an overview of the degree of complexity of the methods which can be used to calculate the passing-on by relying on conclusions and statements of economists. Against this, the current situation of private enforcement of private enforcement in Europe is analyzed. It explored first the antitrust enforcement policy. Then an overview and analysis of the ECJs long standing case law on the development of EU law principles, rights and remedies is provided. These developments are the milestones in the course of horizontal liability and the right to claim damages from other individuals under EU law. After this analysis, it then sought to explore the ECJs case law on the extra-contractual liability of the EU and Member States and horizontal liability of individuals for damages. Consequently, the ECJs case law, selected Member States (Germany, England, Belgium and the Netherlands) on tort law has been investigated. Then, the Member States restitution law based on unjust enrichment and <b>undue</b> <b>payment</b> is considered. Subsequently, the Commissions Green, White and Draft Directive on the issues of passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing are analyzed. Finally, general conclusions and additional proposed options are provided. PART I Passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing in the United States of America The stated purpose of this part was to explore the problem of passing-on by relying on the US Supreme Courts case law, state law and conclusions and statement of economists. Chapter 1 focused primarily on private antitrust enforcement policy in the US. It revealed that the US courts and antitrust agencies, as part of their interpretation and enforcement of federal antitrust laws adopted an optimal deterrence and efficiency-oriented approaches. In order to achieve these aims, not only the legislator but also the Supreme Court and the lower courts have imposed limitations on standing and to recover damages for antitrust infringements as embodied in Article 4 of the Clayton and Article 1 of the Sherman Acts. The most radical limitation is the rejection of passing-on defence in Hanover Shoe and the indirect purchaser standing in Illinois Brick. These two seminal decisions have received phenomenal attention and led to a split between Federal and State courts. Chapter 2 focused exclusively on passing-on defence. This chapter started with defining the passing-on defence and explaining its purpose, operation and effect. This chapter had further two aims. First, it aimed to explain why the defence gives rise to controversy, divided the academics and court and why the Supreme Court eventually rejected the defence. Second, it aimed to analyze the Supreme Courts Hanover Shoe decision and the academic response and criticism to the Courts decision. The Supreme Courts reasoning behind the rejecting the defence was that the task of establishing passing-on would require convincing proof of virtually unascertainable figure, prove insurmountable and render the already complex antitrust damages actions completely unmanageable. As stated by the Supreme Court: we are not impressed with the argument that sound laws of economics require recognizing this passing-on defence. The Supreme Courts analysis rests on three, well grounded, premises, (i) it is difficult to establish that the buyer has raised his price in response to the overcharge. Second, it is an insurmountable task to proof that the first buyer could not or would not have raised its prices or maintained supra-competitive prices had the alleged overcharges ceased. Finally, the same difficulty applies in proving that that the first purchaser did not lose sales or profit margin thereafter. Chapter 3 focused exclusively on the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick case where it rejected the indirect purchaser standing. This chapter aimed to explain the Courts reasoning in rejecting the indirect purchaser standing and its exceptions to the indirect purchaser rule. It revealed that the Court barred also indirect purchasers from bringing pass-on antitrust claims under the federal antitrust claims. The Supreme Court rejected standing in Illinois Brick on three grounds: (i) symmetry with Hanover Shoe; (ii) considerations of efficiency and (iii) effectiveness. The Court feared for multiple liability of the defendant. Presumably, the difficulties of proof apply also for the offensive use of passing-on. The Supreme Court also found that indirect purchasers are less likely than direct purchasers to institute actions to recover illegal overcharges. The Court feared further that, even in case if procedural devices are introduced to bring all potential claimants in one single action: the difficulties likely to be encountered in management of [such] a class action would make the procedure equally inadequate. The Court feared, further that apportioning the recoveries among all of the potential will add whole new dimensions of complexity to treble-damage suits and seriously undermine their effectiveness. Chapter 4 was concerned with deciphering the legislative response to the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick decision. This chapter revealed that the Courts decision received a lot of criticism. The force of the criticism has driven the legislator to intervene by proposing legislation to overturn these decisions. In 1978, 1983 and 1990 - 1991 the Congress attempted to overturn the decision but failed to do so. The First Task Force, which has been constituted by the American Bar Association, proposed combining all the claims arising from a violation in one single forum (under one jurisdiction). They argued that this is the only practical alternative to avoid the concerns of the Supreme Court in Illinois Brick. An opt-in regime, aggregating and allocating damages for the whole class in one single forum is proposed. The minority, however, did not agree with these proposals which resulted in a minority report. They argued for an opt-out regime. They argued that, otherwise the claims of all injured persons will be subjected to any favourable or adverse judgment on liability. Instead, the minority proposed a bifurcated procedure as a solution. Under this procedure, the defendants violation and aggregate total damages will be determined first, following which defendants would be dismissed from the case. The minority describes the second stage as follows: If an award was made, the various claimant groups would then litigate between themselves their respective rights to share in the aggregate total and any sums remaining undistributed {{at the conclusion of the}} proceedings would be given to the state governments in the geographic areas affected. However, this procedure is criticized for being too revolutionary. The minority proposed further a class-wide damages assessment. The calculation of damages consists of a two-step procedure of first determining the aggregate damages to the class and then distributing the damage award proportionally among class member. The Congress new attempt to overturn the decision also failed in 1983. The Task Force criticized the proposed legislation because it failed to deal with the fundamental conflict in policy which the Supreme Court has twice resolved, first in Hanover Shoe and then in Illinois Brick. However, the Supreme Court also recognized, as a practical matter, that compensation objectives must sometimes give way to manageability and fairness. In other words, the decisions in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick rest at bottom on the inescapable and very real practical problems which are likely to arise in indirect purchaser suits: (i) tracing overcharges; (ii) over-complexity; (iii) possible double recovery; (iv) inconsistent judgments and (v) dilution of interest in enforcing antitrust claims. The Task Force is convinced that the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick decision to bar indirect purchaser claims was founded on valid concerns. Chapter 5 presents itself as another important cornerstone of this thesis. This chapter provided an extensive analysis of the state responses to the Illinois Brick decision. The problems surrounding the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing not only divided the academics but also the courts. Some state courts (and the legislator) have clearly accepted vis-à-vis the Supreme Court, the indirect purchaser standing and the defence of passing-on. Others state courts (and legislator) rejected the passing-on defence but allowed the indirect purchaser standing through Illinois Brick repealers. These states have one common feature: the courts in these states have showed that the Supreme Courts overstated concerns are not a reason to reject the indirect purchaser standing and passing-on defence. Here, the courts managed to overcome the Supreme Courts concerns for rejecting both the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing. Chapter 6 is finally concerned with the current dual system of antitrust enforcement of the US. The objective of this chapter is to provide a clear understanding of two conflicting views of the US Supreme and state courts regarding the indirect purchaser standing and passing-on defence. Dual enforcement system as currently exists in the US has not only led to inconsistent judgments and uncoordinated litigations in multiple forums. Duplicative federal direct purchaser and state indirect purchaser litigation imposes undue burdens on the judicial system and the parties, wastes resources, increases the risk of duplicative recoveries, skews the parties incentives to settle and hinders efficient global settlements. The Task Force argues that concerns about inconsistent judgments and uncoordinated litigation in multiple forums might be addressed by consolidating in a single court all direct and indirect purchaser actions arising out of the same anticompetitive conduct. However, the Task Force stresses that consolidation alone will not avoid multiple liability. Therefore, the Task Force urges the Congress to provide a mechanism to apportion damages among direct and indirect purchasers. They argue that in the absence of such legislation, consolidation may simply complicate direct purchaser litigation and thereby impair deterrence. PART II Passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing in Europe Having established the US law on private enforcement, which undoubtedly constitutes a valuable source of inspiration for Europe, the second part focuses on EU and Member State law. Part II considers whether the defence of passing-on and intrinsically linked to it the indirect purchaser standing do or should form part of the EU and national Member States law (Germany, England, Belgium, England and the Netherlands). The focus of chapter 1 is on the antitrust enforcement policy in the EU. The dilemma that emerges, as a policy matter, with regard to the allowance or rejection of passing-on defence andindirect purchaser standing leads to the next question: which objectives, that is deterrence, compensation, efficiency, effectiveness and fairness are most valuated in Europe? The basis of this discussion is that unless a deterrence approach is adopted, the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing forms part of EU law. This chapter revealed that both the ECJ and the Commission regard full compensation of all the victims of antitrust infringements as the primary objective of private enforcement. In Europe, as opposed to US, it is generally accepted that any damages award to the victim of any tort should provide for equitable restitution and should not serve as a source of enrichment. Full compensation of all the victims implies further that there can be no a priori as to the standing of all the victims to claim for damages. The ECJ opened the door in Courage and Manfredi to any individual to claim for damages as long as the conditions for tort liability are fulfilled, i. e. proof of infringement, harm and causal link. Chapter 2 provided an extensive analysis of the ECJs long standing case law on the development of EU law principles, rights and remedies. These developments are the milestones in the course of horizontal liability and the right to claim damages from other individuals under EU law. Analysis of the EU right to damages continues in Chapter 3. This chapter focused exclusively on the ECJs twin judgments, i. e. Courage and Manfredi, where it held that there is an EU right to damages for breach of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, which national Member States must respect. This chapter revealed that it is by all means certain that indirect purchasers do have standing but passing-on defence is an unsolved issue under EU law. Chapter 4 explored the ECJs case law on extra-contractual liability of the EU and Member States. The intention was to draw a general picture of the principles, as established by the ECJ, which also may be used as precedents in the field of private enforcement. Chapter 5 was concerned with the conditions which must be fulfilled to establish horizontal liability for breach of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. This chapter focused, in particular, on national laws of the Member States in order to analyze how the conditions for horizontal liability (e. g. heads of damages, causation) are applied and whether the national laws offers an effective protection of EU law and comply with the EU principles of effectiveness and equivalence. Chapter 6 formed another vital building block for this work. This chapter is divided in four parts and had a twofold purpose. These four parts discussed what the law (in Germany, England, Belgium and the Netherlands) in relation to the defence of passing-on and indirect purchaser is or should be. The view (passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing allowed) formed in chapters 1, 2, 3 and reiterated here is that the defence is valid and forms part of the law of tort. The second purpose was to find out whether there is any law (case law) on the legal treatment of these issues in these Member States. Chapter 7 and 8 focused on the ECJs response to the passing-on defence in restitution cases. The ECJ dealt here with the passing-on defence in the context of extra-contractual liability of the EU and monetary liability of the Member States. The ECJ recognized the defence but did not demand it. The focus of chapter 9 was on the essence of passing-on defence in the law of restitution based on unjust enrichment. This chapter is divided in three major parts, i. e. English, Belgian and Dutch law. The intention was to show that the defence of passing-on forms an integral part of the law of restitution based on unjust enrichment. One common feature of these Member States is that unjust enrichment law is compensatory in character. This feature has important consequences for the defence for two reasons. First, the plaintiff should only be entitled to restitution of the defendants enrichment where the claimant has suffered loss. Second, restitution will be denied when the claimant has made good his loss by passing it on. An additional objective of this chapter is to show that the defence of passing-on does not play a role in the <b>undue</b> <b>payment</b> cases. Chapter 10 discussed the European Commissions initiatives, Green, White and Draft Directive. Finally, general conclusions and proposed options are provided. status: publishe...|$|E
