Repertory Grid analysis {{was used as the}} tool to build the inventory of these meanings and expressions. Tourist marketplaces in Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia were selected as the key sites for the intensive interviews. Sixty six domestic and international tourists visiting marketplaces in the three countries were shown images of a stratified selection of 15 marketplaces. Using the approach of comparing triads, the tourists offered their descriptions of the similarities and differences among the viewed locations. The approach revealed a rich but consistent set of constructs that tourists use when they depict and compare marketplaces.

40|$|Library jargon is {{a barrier}} to users in their {{interactions}} with library staff and systems. Comprehension testing has shown that many students do not understand common library jargon. Usability testing and preference testing have successfully sought user feedback {{in order to develop}} more user-friendly interfaces. In this study into language preferences, a questionnaire was based on 20 concepts taken from New Zealand university library websites. Participants were asked to label these concepts with terms of their own choosing. New Zealand university summer school coordinators were asked to forward a URL for the web-based questionnaire to students in their classes. Fifty valid responses were received. Concepts that were central to students' library experiences were labelled with as few as 4 different terms, while less central concepts were labelled with more than 30. Library jargon was an important influence on students' choice of terminology. For many concepts, however, students used terms that had not been found on library websites.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{developments}} of land, such as complex high-rises, put enormous pressure on current land administration {{systems that have}} ad hoc approaches to 3 D property management. These approaches are unable to support effective 3 D storage, analysis and visualisation of property information. Effective visualisation {{is one of the}} essential components in realisation of a truly 3 D cadastre. Currently, several 3 D visualisation applications and cadastral prototypes have been developed around the world. However, they do not effectively represent ownership information in 3 D because they have not been developed based on 3 D cadastral visualisation requirements. After candidate 3 D visualisation solutions were compared with <b>user-derived</b> visualisation criteria, a web-based 3 D visualisation prototype was designed and developed. The functionality, usability and efficiency of the prototype were evaluated by potential users involved in the registration and management of property. While there was a high level of enthusiasm for the features of the prototype, the results also suggest further directions for development of 3 D cadastral visualisation. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

40|$|Defining {{types of}} {{seafloor}} substrate and relating {{them to the}} distribution of fish and invertebrates is an important but difficult goal. An examination of the processing steps of a commercial acoustics analyzing software program, {{as well as the}} data values produced by the proprietary first echo measurements, revealed potential benef its and drawbacks for distinguishing acoustically distinct seafloor substrates. The positive aspects were convenient processing steps such as gain adjustment, accurate bottom picking, ease of bad data exclusion, and the ability to average across successive pings in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. A noteworthy drawback with the processing was the potential for accidental inclusion of a second echo as if it were part of the first echo. Detailed examination of the echogram measurements quantified the amount of collinearity, revealed the lack of standardization (subtraction of mean, division by standard deviation) before principal components analysis (PCA), and showed correlations of individual echogram measurements with depth and seafloor slope. Despite the facility of the software, these previously unknown processing pitfalls and echogram measurement characteristics may have created data artifacts that generated <b>user-derived</b> substrate classifications, rather than actual seafloor substrate types...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{experiences}} {{have shown that}} involving users in the software design cycle is a cost-effective way of improving both the quality and the acceptability of tool products. In this paper, we {{address the issue of}} whether users also should be involved in the research activities that lay the foundation for parallel tool design. Integrating users changes the basic nature of the software process in several ways, as illustrated with examples from recent Parallel Tools Consortium projects. Tool designers must invest additional time in activities such as preparing example scenarios or prototypes for user discussions, identifying alternatives that can serve as points of departure for <b>user-derived</b> metaphors or models, and analyzing user responses. Our experiences, however, indicate that user suggestions — if identified consistently throughout the design process — are relatively easy to obtain and can actually streamline the development time for research prototypes. Further, when users see evidence that their feedback has influenced design decisions, they may become spontaneous supporters of the project, devoting time and energy to devise other improvements and to promote the tool among their colleagues. Tool researchers may be doing themselves a disservice in overestimating the time and difficulty of working with users. A relatively small amount of user involvement can, in fact, yield substantial benefits in terms of improved usability, broader dissemination, and ne...|$|E
40|$|This report {{consists}} of six chapters. Chapter 1 explains {{the choice of}} specific SROs for the Phase 2 focussed evaluations, and the methodology we adopt (as in the Inception Report). We set the examples against {{a common set of}} criteria, and selected and tabulated against these criteria. The substantive Chapters 2 - 5 contain case studies arranged by four categories: infrastructure and critical resources (Chapter 2); issues affecting content rating (Chapter 3), Internet filtering and reporting of illegal content (Chapter 4); issues that are emerging (Chapter 5). This provides the basis for examination of standards, infrastructure, ISP self-regulation, mass media content, and <b>user-derived</b> content. It also provides the framework to examine personal Internet security, DRM and e-commerce standards. Finally, Chapter 6 details the comparative analysis across case studies, in order to develop patterns, especially with regard to the dynamic evolution of case studies identified in the study period June-September 2007. Further gap analysis bridges the Phase 1 mapping exercise, and Phase 2 detailed examination of a representative and strategically chosen universe of case studies, is to identify the continually emerging environment for new topics and/or sectoral areas of regulatory and/or legislative interest. This concise gap analysis provides the background for the final report explanation of potential areas for further research.

40|$|For {{users of}} climate services, {{the ability to}} quickly {{determine}} the datasets that best fit one's needs would be invaluable. The volume, variety and complexity of climate data makes this judgment difficult. The ambition of CHARMe ("Characterization of metadata to enable high-quality climate services") is to give a wider interdisciplinary community access {{to a range of}} supporting information, such as journal articles, technical reports or feedback on previous applications of the data. The capture and discovery of this "commentary" information, often created by data users rather than data providers, and currently not linked to the data themselves, has not been significantly addressed previously. CHARMe applies the principles of Linked Data and open web standards to associate, record, search and publish <b>user-derived</b> annotations in a way that can be read both by users and automated systems. Tools have been developed within the CHARMe project that enable annotation capability for data delivery systems already in wide use for discovering climate data. In addition, the project has developed advanced tools for exploring data and commentary in innovative ways, including an interactive data explorer and comparator ("CHARMe Maps") and a tool for correlating climate time series with external "significant events" (e. g. instrument failures or large volcanic eruptions) that affect the data quality. Although the project focuses on climate science, the concepts are general and could be applied to other fields.

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, online vendors began selling {{an array of}} {{so-called}} “legal highs”—apparently organic produce made from exotic herbs. Simultaneously, members of online drug discussion forums began to debate the alleged effects of the new drugs, creating an enormous base of <b>user-derived</b> information based on personal experiences. This study combines the historical data spanning a seven-year period derived from a Norwegian drug discussion forum about synthetic cannabinoids and interviews with 14 male forum members who all had experience with the drug. By combining the two sources, this study reveals not only the evolving discourse on synthetic cannabinoid use but also how forum members related to the online information that they gathered and co-produced. Analysis of the evolving online discourse revealed three distinct phases. The first was an enthusiastic phase, with users embracing the new drugs. The second was a phase characterized by growing ambivalence and scepticism towards use of the drugs. The third was one in which {{members of the community}} rejected the new drugs based on negative reviews from users. The analysis displays the communal process whereby members co-operate in the exchange of an extensive body of knowledge accumulated about synthetic cannabinoids, {{and the way in which}} this evolving discourse influences members of the forum in their views and representations of the drugs. Paradoxically, the online discussions of synthetic cannabinoids, which had great significance for their proliferation when they were initially introduced to the market, now seem to be a deterrent. The role of online drug communities in the development of new drug trends should receive renewed attention...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Recent {{changes in}} duty hour {{allowances}} and economic constraints are forcing {{a paradigm shift}} in graduate medical education in the United States. Internet-based learning is a rapidly growing component of postgraduate medical education, includ-ing the field of critical care medicine. Here, we define the key concepts of Internet-based learning, summarize the current liter-ature, and describe how Internet-based learning may be uniquely suited for the critical care provider. Methods: A MEDLINE/ PubMed search from January 2000 to July 2011 using the search terms: ‘‘e-learning,’ ’ ‘‘Web-based learning,’ ’ ‘‘computer-aided instruction,’ ’ ‘‘adult learning,’ ’ ‘‘knowledge retention,’ ’ ‘‘intensive care,’ ’ and ‘‘critical care. ’ ’ Results: The growth of the Internet is marked {{by the development of}} new technologies, including more <b>user-derived</b> tools. Nonmedical fields have embraced Internet-based learning as a valuable teaching tool. A recent meta-analysis described Internet-based learning in the medical field as being more effective than no intervention and likely as efficacious as traditional teaching methods. Web sites containing inter-active features are aptly suited for the adult learner, complementing the paradigm shift to more learner-centered education. Interactive cases, simulators, and games may allow for improvement in clinical care. The total time spent utilizing Internet-based resources, as well as the frequency of returning to those sites, may influence educational gains. Conclusion: Internet-based learning may provide an opportunity for assistance in the transformation of medical education. Many features of Web-based learning, including interactivity, make it advantageous for the adult medical learner, especially in the field of critical care medicine, and further work is necessary to develop a robust learning platform incorporating a variety of learning modalities for critical care providers...|$|E
40|$|Background An online health-promoting {{community}} (OHPC) has {{the potential}} to promote health and advance new means of dialogue between public health representatives and the general public. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine what aspects of an OHPC that are critical for satisfying the needs of the user community and public health goals and service capabilities. Methods Community-based participatory research methods were used for data collection and analysis, and participatory design principles to develop a case study OHPC for adolescents. Qualitative data from adolescents on health appraisals and perspectives on health information were collected in a Swedish health service region and classified into categories of user health information exchange needs. A composite design rationale for the OHPC was completed by linking the identified user needs, <b>user-derived</b> requirements, and technical and organizational systems solutions. Conflicts between end-user requirements and organizational goals and resources were identified. Results The most prominent health information needs were associated to food, exercise, and well-being. The assessment of the design rationale document and prototype in light of the regional public health goals and service capabilities showed that compromises were needed to resolve conflicts involving the management of organizational resources and responsibilities. The users wanted to discuss health issues with health experts having little time to set aside to the OHPC and it was unclear who should set the norms for the online discussions. Conclusions OHPCs can be designed to satisfy both the needs of user communities and public health goals and service capabilities. Compromises are needed to resolve conflicts between users’ needs to discuss health issues with domain experts and the management of resources and responsibilities in public health organizations...|$|E
40|$|The {{continued}} {{success of}} protein therapeutics {{has put a}} strain on industry's ability to meet the large demand. Creating a more productive expression host for the manufacture of these proteins is a potential solution. Although heterologous proteins are frequently made in organisms as disparate as E. coli and bovines, the single-celled organism S. cerevisiae {{has emerged as a}} well-qualified candidate due to its approachable genetic and fermentation attributes as well as its ability to stably fold disulfide bonded and multi domain proteins. Because S. cerevisiae screens for enhanced protein secretion have traditionally utilized low-throughput and often plate-based methods, a high-throughput, liquid phase assay could offer a real advantage in secretory selection. In this thesis, yeast surface display is investigated as a potential proxy for heterologous protein secretion. Although ultimately unsuitable as a screening proxy, the surface display experiments did show a novel method of improving protein secretion by co-expressing a more stably folded protein with the protein of interest. In these studies the secretion of an scFv-Aga 2 p fusion was stimulated 1 0 -fold by the concomitant surface expression of BPTI. (cont.) BPTI surface expression also stimulated the secretion of secreted scFv three-fold suggesting a niche for protein coexpression as well as secretion by way of Aga 2 p fusions. A new screening method was developed that involves the capture of secreted protein {{on the surface of the}} cell where it can be labeled and sorted by FACS. This new method was verified to achieve thirty-five fold enrichment per pass for a three-fold enhanced protein secretor making it easily suitable for screening. The new screening methodology, the Cell Surface Secretion Assay (CeSSA), was also modeled and verified with time course data that enabled optimization of sort parameters and predicted sort outcomes based on <b>user-derived</b> selection parameters. The CeSSA was used to screen a library of mutant yeast alpha mating factor leader sequences for improved secretion of the scFv 4 m 5. 3. The improved leaders imparted up to a twenty-fold improvement in scFv secretion per cell and up to thirty-fold improvement after expression tuning. These engineered leader sequences also conferred improved secretion on other scFv's and proteins including whole IgG. Moreover, the leader sequence mutants give indications of where the important residues in secretory leaders lie and the aberrations in protein traffic that result in reduced secretion. by James A.
