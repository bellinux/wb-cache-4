5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight <b>unmounted,</b> the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his <b>unmounted</b> opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack. The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy combatant.|$|E
25|$|At {{some time}} before 200, the local warlord Sun Ce, who was a strict Confucian, wanted to kill Zuo Ci and chased him on horseback. Zuo Ci, <b>unmounted,</b> still managed to escape by {{seemingly}} walking slowly.|$|E

25|$|Various other {{guns are}} mounted or <b>unmounted</b> in Bermuda, with some lying outside of Fort St Catherine, having been rolled out when made {{obsolete}} (the guns actually mounted on display there {{were taken from}} other forts, notably Fort Albert), and a number having been found buried in the moat of Fort Cunningham (the two mounted at Fort George are the RML 11 inch 25 ton gun). At least one has been erected on a display stand at Fort Hamilton, though the original mount is missing, and another at Alexandia Battery.|$|E
25|$|Compared with {{a regular}} {{installation}}, a Wubi installation faces some limitations. Hibernation is not supported and the filesystem is more vulnerable to hard reboots. Also, if the Windows drive is <b>unmounted</b> uncleanly (Windows crash, power failure, etc.), Ubuntu {{will not be able}} to repair, re-mount, and boot from the Windows NTFS drive until Microsoft Windows has successfully booted, repaired the drive, and then shut down cleanly. If the Windows system could not be booted after the corruption to repair the filesystem, the user would also not be able to boot Ubuntu.|$|E
25|$|The Thetford Hoard (also {{known as}} the Thetford Treasure) is a hoard of Romano-British {{metalwork}} found by Arthur and Greta Brooks at Gallows Hill, near Thetford in Norfolk, England, in November 1979, and now in the British Museum. Dating from the mid- to late-4th century AD, this hoard {{is a collection of}} thirty-three silver spoons and three silver strainers, twenty-two gold finger rings, four gold bracelets, four necklace pendants, five gold chain necklaces and two pairs of necklace-clasps, a gold amulet designed as a pendant, an <b>unmounted</b> engraved gem, four beads (one emerald and three of glass), and a gold belt-buckle decorated with a dancing satyr. A small cylindrical lidded box made from shale also belonged to the hoard.|$|E
50|$|Modern Linux systems use udev as an automounter {{to handle}} the hot {{swapping}} of devices (such as MP3 players or digital cameras) instead of relying on fstab. Programs such as pmount allow ordinary users to mount and <b>unmount</b> filesystems without a corresponding fstab entry; traditional Unix has always allowed privileged users (the root user and users in the wheel group) to mount or <b>unmount</b> devices without an fstab entry.|$|R
5000|$|Mounting and <b>unmounting</b> filesystems is prohibited. Jails cannot access files {{above their}} root {{directory}} (i.e. a jail is chroot'ed).|$|R
5000|$|Timeouts {{can cause}} the <b>unmounting</b> of mounted {{directories}} (which situation can later result in mount delays upon the next attempted access).|$|R
25|$|The sector's {{data may}} be {{outdated}} and {{not reflect the}} current media contents, because not all operating systems update or use this sector, {{and even if they}} do, the contents is not valid when the medium has been ejected without properly unmounting the volume or after a power-failure. Therefore, operating systems should first inspect a volume's optional shutdown status bitflags residing in the FAT entry of cluster 1 or the FAT32 EBPB at offset 0x041 and ignore the data stored in the FS information sector, if these bitflags indicate that the volume was not properly <b>unmounted</b> before. This does not cause any problems other than a possible speed penalty for the first free space query or data cluster allocation; see fragmentation.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{supporters}} of fox hunting {{regard it as}} a distinctive part of British culture generally, the basis of traditional crafts and {{a key part of}} social life in rural areas, an activity and spectacle enjoyed not only by the riders but also by others such as the <b>unmounted</b> pack which may follow along on foot, bicycle or 4x4. They see the social aspects of hunting as reflecting the demographics of the area; the Home Counties packs, for example, are very different from those in North Wales and Cumbria, where the hunts are very much the activity of farmers and the working class. The Banwen Miners Hunt is such a working class club founded in a small Welsh mining village, although its membership now is by no means limited to miners, with a cosmopolitan make up.|$|E
25|$|The Nor’Wester’s {{offers of}} free passage soon had the desired effect. Coupled with the harsh living {{conditions}} in the region, disgruntled settlers began leaving the colony. Archibald Macdonald, then {{in command of the}} colony while Gov. Macdonell was temporarily away, threatened to use the colony’s cannons to prevent their leaving. As a result, on April 3 a party of disgruntled settlers led by George Campbell detained the officers in the mess room of Fort Douglas, broke into the colony’s warehouses and stole a number of artillery pieces, weapons and tools, carrying them off on horse-drawn sleighs while the imprisoned officers watched through the mess-room windows. The colonists then met with Duncan Cameron and a party of NWC voyageurs to whom they gave the stolen guns. The <b>unmounted</b> guns were conveyed by canoes to Fort Gibraltar where field carriages were made for them. When Governor Macdonell returned, NWC officer Severight attempted to arrest him, but Macdonell resisted stating a legally appointed governor cannot be arrested and taken from his post. Macdonnel detained Severight for several hours and then released him.|$|E

25|$|The {{crossbow}} {{was particularly}} prominent in European warfare from {{the battle of}} Hastings (1066) until about 1525. In the armies of Europe, mounted and <b>unmounted</b> crossbowmen, often mixed with slingers, javeliners and archers, occupied a central position in battle formations. Usually they engaged the enemy in offensive skirmishes before an assault of mounted knights. Crossbowmen were also valuable in counterattacks to protect their infantry. Crossbowmen were held in high esteem as professional soldiers, often commanding higher rates of pay than other foot soldiers. The rank of commanding officer of the crossbowmen corps {{was one of the}} highest positions in many medieval armies, including those of Spain, France, and Italy. Crossbowmen were held in such high regard in Spain that they were granted status on par with the knightly class. Along with polearm weapons made from farming equipment, the crossbow was also a weapon of choice for insurgent peasants such as the Taborites. Genoese crossbowmen were famous mercenaries hired throughout medieval Europe, while the crossbow also {{played an important role in}} anti-personnel defense of ships. Mounted knights armed with lances proved ineffective against formations of pikemen combined with crossbowmen whose weapons could penetrate most knights' armor. The invention of pushlever and ratchet drawing mechanisms enabled the use of crossbows on horseback, leading to the development of new cavalry tactics. Knights and mercenaries deployed in triangular formations, with the most heavily armored knights at the front. Some of these riders would carry small, powerful all-metal crossbows of their own.|$|E
25|$|Diamond {{color is}} graded by {{comparing}} a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone {{is known to}} exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where {{in the range of}} color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards. When color grading is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of color. Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as <b>unmounted</b> diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.|$|E

[...] The collection includes all these types, with both <b>unmounted</b> plaques and caskets fitted with plaques. The jolly grotesques illustrated at right are on the reverse of a large dish whose main face shows a brightly-coloured depiction of the Destruction of Pharaoh's army in the Red Sea.

500|$|A few mounted militiamen on {{the road}} would dismount, fire muskets at the {{approaching}} regulars, then remount and gallop ahead to repeat the tactic.

[...] When it moved out of range, those units would move around and forward to re-engage the column further down the road. [...] Heath sent messengers out to intercept arriving militia units, directing them to appropriate places along the road to engage the regulars. [...] Some towns sent supply wagons to assist in feeding and rearming the militia. [...] Heath and Warren did lead skirmishers in small actions into battle themselves, but it was the presence of effective leadership that probably had the greatest impact on the success of these tactics. [...] Percy wrote of the colonial tactics, [...] "The rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance and resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body. [...] Indeed, they knew too well what was proper, to do so. [...] Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken." ...|$|E
