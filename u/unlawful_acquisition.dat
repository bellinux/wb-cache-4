50|$|The Federal Trade Commission {{announced}} April 2008 that it {{issued a}} complaint challenging {{a series of}} acquisitions by TALX Corporation that substantially lessened competition in the markets for outsourced unemployment compensation management (UCM) and verification of income and employment (VOIE) services. The Commission and TALX have reached an agreement settling the Commission's challenge. “TALX acted illegally,” says Jeffrey Schmidt, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, “by acquiring virtually all of its competition {{in a series of}} transactions. While each transaction individually may not have been problematic, the FTC looked at the cumulative effect of the acquisitions. This case sends a message that firms can’t get away with <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisitions</b> just because they take place in relatively small increments.” The complaint alleges that TALX's acquisitions have enhanced its ability to increase prices unilaterally and to decrease the quality of services in the relevant markets. In addition, the complaint notes, TALX has alliance partners, including Automated Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Convergys, Inc., and Ceridian, Inc., which have agreements with TALX to outsource to TALX {{some or all of the}} UCM services they provide for their clients.|$|R

40|$|International law {{prohibits the}} {{acquisition}} of territory by force. Even so, states have struggled to identify a judicial or arbitral procedure to protect their rights following an <b>unlawful</b> attempted <b>acquisition.</b> With reference to the annexation of Crimea, but {{with a view to}} the wider possibilities for judicial or arbitral settlement of territorial questions, the present Article considers three mechanisms [...] the European Convention on Human Rights (European Convention), the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute), and bilateral investment treaties. Recent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) suggest that its inter-state procedure holds some promise in such a situation. By comparison, attempts by a state to protect its territorial rights before the ICJ [...] for example, by Georgia against Russia [...] have encountered serious obstacles. This Article starts by considering the ECHR. It then turns to the ICJ, the jurisdiction of which has extended to territorial questions in some of its best-known cases but, in others, may be of limited use to a state seeking to defend its territorial rights directly. The Article then turns to investment treaties and asks, though they have not been used to address territorial disputes so far, what role they might play...|$|R

40|$|Trade secrets have {{traditionally}} been protected in various ways by national laws in the European Union. The international intellectual property treaties offered only a limited common core. From this starting point {{this article examines the}} new EU draft directive on trade secrets. The aim is not to put in place a comprehensive EU regime for the protection of trade secrets. There will only be a partial harmonisation of the national laws of the Member States, focussing on the <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition,</b> disclosure and use of trade secrets, and that harmonization will be of a minimalist nature in the sense that Member States may provide, in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty, for more far-reaching protection against the <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition,</b> use or disclosure of trade secrets than that required in the Directive...|$|E
40|$|The case of Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng, {{convicted in}} China on August 2014 {{on charges of}} <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition</b> of citizens’ {{personal}} information, raises important issues about Chinese law. A narrow but important issue is how Chinese law draws the line between lawful and <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition</b> of information, a practice routinely carried out by businesses and individuals. This article examines the trial transcript and judgment in the Humphrey/Yu case and finds that it sheds regrettably little light on what remains a murky question. A broader issue is whether the Chinese legal system {{can be counted on}} to operate in a fair and impartial manner. This article presents the results of a study of all reported cases in Shanghai (ninety-two cases) involving the same provision of the Criminal Law that was the basis of the Humphrey/Yu conviction. It finds that the Humphrey/Yu sentences are outliers relative to other cases with comparable facts. In particular, Humphrey’s sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment was by far the heaviest sentence ever meted out by Shanghai courts, even though the circumstances seem conspicuously less serious than those of many other cases where lesser sentences were imposed...|$|E

40|$|In November 2013 the European Commission {{issued the}} “Proposal for a Directive on the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council on the {{protection}} of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition,</b> use and disclosure” (referred to as “TSD”). The TSD offers minimum harmonisation and aims at promoting sharing of knowledge, and the exploitation of innovations on the Internal Market. The European Parliament adopted the TSD on April 14, 2016 and the EU Member States will have two years to implement it. The TSD includes a harmonised definition of a trade secret that builds on the definition provided in Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement. Moreover, it also ensures the freedom of expression and information {{and the protection of}} whistle-blowers. Appropriate means of actions and remedies against <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition,</b> use and disclosure of trade secrets are also included, such as provisional and pecuniary measures, injunctions and corrective measures or allocation of damages. This study examines the protection of trade secrets in the course of litigation regulated in Article 9 of the TSD. Currently, the protection of trade secrets within the EU is fragmented especially in this regard, which makes companies reluctant to resort to litigation when a trade secret has unlawfully been misappropriated or it is suspected that a trade secret is being misused. The regulations in Article 9 expand only to the hearing in court. Such protection is welcomed and {{a step in the right}} direction. However, in my study I have found that in order for the protection to be sufficient there is a need to further establish measures to protect trade secrets during the entire process, from the filing of the claim to the end when the judgement is given. Consequently, I also discuss different measures that could be used to strengthen the protection of trade secrets before the hearing in court, as evidence are gathered...|$|E
40|$|URL] {{many years}} {{strengthening}} {{the level of}} trade secret protections has been a goal of legislators both in the EU and the US. Last year, finally, the long lasting negotiations brought some results. Two important documents have been signed {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. First, on May 11, 2016, President Obama signed the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA). The same month, on May 27, the European Council approved the text of the Directive (EU) 2016 / 943 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition,</b> use and disclosure (Directive). Those two legislative acts were seen as important steps forward to stronger protection and a more ‘harmonized’ understanding of (among other important aspects) what trade secrets are and how trade secret protection can be established. Those changes were considered important for companies involved in international business and frequent exchange of know-how with foreign companies. In particular, it is indicated in the Directive that open innovation is ‘an important lever for the creation of new knowledge, and underpins the emergence of new and innovative business models based on the use of co-created knowledge’ and that ‘collaborative research, including cross-border cooperation, is particularly important in increasing the levels of business research and development within the internal market. ’ The relevant question that arises is, whether companies, following these new legislative improvements, will feel more secure to provide access to their trade secrets to third parties. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{provenance}} {{research into}} books {{and other objects}} acquired by the University Library in Graz during the Nazi regime and still in the library’s holdings began with four years of research on a doctoral thesis between the years 2006 and 2010. In addition {{to dealing with the}} history and development of the Library in Graz during the Nazi period, the chief task was to examine each and every acquisition made in the years 1938 to 1945 for signs of previous ownership and thus determine the provenance of the objects. Such references to the probable source of the books were then documented. Then these objects were divided into two categories, namely books which had clearly been stolen from their owners and those which were merely suspicious. The findings of this project can now provide a solid basis for further research. Indeed, it was determined, for example, that some 1, 800 printed works acquired by the Library during the above-mentioned time period could be confirmed as having been appropriated or else there were justifiable suspicions about their provenance. In addition to tracking down the rightful owners or their heirs in as yet open cases and returning the books or objects to them in cases where <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition</b> has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the Graz University Library will continue the project in the coming years and devote its time and energy to various questions raised during the initial project. Thus there are plans to extend the time frame under consideration to include the years 1945 to 1955 and also expand the scope to include the holdings of the libraries run by individual university departments, i. e. those outside the main university library...|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of nuclear weapons}} is a great threat to world peace and stability. The question of strengthening the nonproliferation regime has been open {{for a long period}} of time. In 1997 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors (BOG) adopted the Additional Safeguards Protocol. The purpose of the protocol is to enhance the IAEA?s ability to detect undeclared production of fissile materials in member states. However, the IAEA does not always have sufficient human and financial resources to accomplish this task. Developed here is a concept for making use of human and technical resources available in academia that could be used to enhance the IAEA?s mission. The objective of this research was to study the feasibility of an academic community using commercially or publicly available sources of information and products for the purpose of detecting covert facilities and activities intended for the <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition</b> of fissile materials or production of nuclear weapons. In this study, the availability and use of commercial satellite imagery systems, commercial computer codes for satellite imagery analysis, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) verification International Monitoring System (IMS), publicly available information sources such as watchdog groups and press reports, and Customs Services information were explored. A system for integrating these data sources to form conclusions was also developed. The results proved that publicly and commercially available sources of information and data analysis can be a powerful tool in tracking violations in the international nuclear nonproliferation regime and a framework for implementing these tools in academic community was developed. As a result of this study a formation of an International Nonproliferation Monitoring Academic Community (INMAC) is proposed. This would be an independent organization consisting of academics (faculty, staff and students) from both nuclear weapon states (NWS) and non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS). This community analyzes all types of unclassified publicly and commercially available information to aid in detection of violations of the non-proliferation regime. INMAC shares all of this information with the IAEA and the public. Since INMAC is composed solely by members of the academic community, this organization would not demonstrate any biases in its investigations or reporting...|$|E
40|$|Diplomsko delo obsega obravnavo instituta pridobitve lastninske pravice od razpolagalno nesposobne osebe in pregled sodne prakse. V našem pravnem redu je razpolagalna sposobnost eden od temeljnih pogojev za prenos lastninske pravice. Vendar pa tudi naša stvarnopravna zakonodaja, podobno kot večina evropskih, na premičninskem področju omogoča tudi pridobitev lastninske pravice od nelastnika, torej nekoga ki nima razpolagalne sposobnosti, predvsem s ciljem, da se čim bolj varuje pravni promet in s tem dobroverni pridobitelji. Možnost pridobitve lastninske pravice od razpolagalno nesposobne osebe, je predvidena v 64. členu Stvarnopravnega zakonika, pod naslovom »Posebni primeri pridobitve«. Vendar pa je pomembno poudariti, da je mogoče pridobiti lastninsko pravico kljub dejstvu, da ni izpolnjena predpostavka razpolagalne sposobnosti le, če so izpolnjeni vsi kumulativno postavljeni pogoji, kot jih določa zakon. V diplomskem delu so razčlenjeni vsi pogoji za pridobitev lastninske pravice od razpolagalno nesposobne osebe, vključena je tudi sodna praksa, ki v je skozi sodne odločbe vzpostavila merila za presojo izpolnjevanja zakonskih pogojev za pridobitev lastninske pravice od razpolagalno nesposobne osebe. Predvsem so se sodišča skozi sodne odločbe ukvarjala s presojo dobrovernosti pridobitelja lastninske pravice, nekaj sodnih odločb se nanaša tudi na druge zakonske pogoje. V zaključku diplomskega dela, je na kratko predstavljena problematika protipravno prilaščenih vozil in uporaba instituta pridobitve lastninske pravice od razpolagalno nesposobne osebe v postopkih zasega takih vozil s strani državnih organov ter postopkih vračanja le teh. Na kratko so predstavljeni tudi pogoji za odškodninsko odgovornost v primeru protipravnih zasegov oziroma morebitnih nepravilnosti pri vračanju zaseženih vozil njihovim lastnikom. The diploma thesis {{encompasses}} {{the treatment of}} the institute of the acquisition of property right from a disposition incapacitated person, and an overview of relevant case law. In our legal system the disposition ability represents one of the fundamental prerequisites for the transfer of property right. However, our In Rem legislation, {{as is the case in}} most European countries, in the field of property also allows for the acquisition of property right from the non-owner, meaning someone who does not have the disposition ability, in particular with the aim to protect to the greatest extent the legal transactions and thus bona fide acquirers. The possibility of the acquisition of property right from a disposition incapacitated person is provided in the Article 64 of the Property Code, under the heading “Specific cases of acquisition”. However, it is important to emphasize that it is possible to obtain property right despite of the fact that the assumption of disposition ability is not fulfilled, only in cases when all of the cumulative conditions are met as required by the law. In the diploma thesis all the legal conditions for the acquisition of property right from a disposition incapacitated person are discussed, including the judicial practice, which has through court decisions established criteria for assessment of compliance with the legal requirements for the acquisition of property right from a disposition incapacitated person. The majority of the court decisions considered deal with the assessment of the good faith of the acquirer of the property right, whereas a number of court decisions also refer to other legal conditions. In the conclusion of the diploma thesis, I briefly present the problematics of <b>unlawful</b> <b>acquisition</b> of vehicles and the application of the institute of acquisition of property right from the disposition incapacitated person in proceedings of seizure of such vehicles by public authorities, and their subsequent return to their lawful owners. I briefly present the conditions for the liability for damages in cases of unlawful seizures, as well as in cases of possible irregularities concerning the return of seized vehicles to their lawful owners...|$|E
