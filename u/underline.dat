Such was the concern another brawl would take place, Greater Manchester Police officers spoke to Riley to <b>underline</b> the need for players to behave themselves.|$|E
5|$|Brussels {{also has}} better {{transport}} links than Strasbourg, with lower pay for civil servants which reduce costs. Some commentators further <b>underline</b> that night-life in Strasbourg is comparatively lacklustre and that MEPs who'd wish to relax {{after a long}} and hard working day aren't offered many opportunities to do so. The position of Strasbourg suffered a minor blow in 2006, when allegations surfaced over charges {{by the city of}} Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament was renting. The controversy died down when the European Parliament decided to officially buy the buildings on 24 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|The overweighting of the {{stressed}} syllables {{strengthens the}} humour of the lines. Busch also uses dactyls, where one accented syllable {{is followed by}} two unaccented syllables, as in his Plisch und Plum, where they <b>underline</b> the pedantic and solemn words with which teacher Bokelmann educates his pupils. They create tension in the Sourdough chapter from Adventures of a Bachelor, through the alternation of trochees and dactyls. Busch often synchronizes format and content in his poems, as in Fips the Monkey, where he uses the epic hexameter in a speech about wisdom.|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{moments of}} all charmed baryons {{belonging to the}} totally symmetric 20 (<b>underlined)</b> representation, the mixed symmetry 20 prime (<b>underlined)</b> and the totally antisymmetric 4 (<b>underlined)</b> representation have been compared under U(4) symmetry, assuming that the magnetic-moment operator {{is proportional to the}} charge operator. The magnetic moments of all charmed particles have been expressed in terms of the moments of proton, neutron and delta particles in the case of U(4) symmetry. Then assuming that the magnetic moment operator is a tensor transforming as the (15, 3) members of a 63 (<b>underlined)</b> representation of U(8) or SU(8), the magnetic moments of all the baryons belonging to the 120 (<b>underlined)</b> representation are compared...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to <b>underline</b> the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E
5|$|As-Salih Ayyub {{returned}} to Damascus {{to keep an}} eye on developments in northern Syria. Al-Ashraf Musa of Homs had ceded the important stronghold of Salamiyah to as-Salih Ayyub the previous winter, perhaps to <b>underline</b> their patron-client relationship. This troubled the Ayyubids of Aleppo who feared it would be used as a base for a military take-over of their city. An-Nasir Yusuf found this intolerable and decided to annex Homs in the winter of 1248. The city surrendered in August and an-Nasir Yusuf's terms forced al-Ashraf Musa to hand over Homs, but he was allowed to retain nearby Palmyra and Tell Bashir in the Syrian Desert. As-Salih Ayyub sent Fakhr ad-Din to recapture Homs, but Aleppo countered by sending an army to Kafr Tab, south of the city. An-Nasir Dawud left Karak for Aleppo to support an-Nasir Yusuf, but in his absence, his brothers al-Amjad Hasan and az-Zahir Shadhi detained his heir al-Mu'azzam Isa and then personally went to as-Salih Ayyub's camp at al-Mansourah in Egypt to offer him control of Karak in return for holdings in Egypt. As-Salih Ayyub agreed and sent the eunuch Badr al-Din Sawabi to act as his governor in Karak.|$|E

50|$|The subject-predicate {{relationship}} is clearly {{present in the}} <b>underlined</b> strings. The expression {{on the right is}} a predication over the noun phrase immediately to its left. While the subject-predicate {{relationship is}} indisputably present, the <b>underlined</b> strings do not behave as single constituents, a fact that undermines their status as clauses. Hence one can debate whether the <b>underlined</b> strings in these examples should qualify as clauses. The layered structures of the chomskyan tradition are again likely to view the <b>underlined</b> strings as clauses, whereas the schools of syntax that posit flatter structures are likely to reject clause status for them.|$|R

40|$|In {{a typical}} speech {{dictation}} interface, the recognizer’s bestguess is displayed as normal, unannotated text. This ignores potentially useful {{information about the}} recognizer’s confidence in its recognition hypothesis. Using a confidence measure (which itself may sometimes be inaccurate), we investigated providing visual feedback about low-confidence portions of the recognition using shaded, red <b>underlining.</b> An evaluation showed, compared to a baseline without <b>underlining,</b> <b>underlining</b> lowconfidence areas did not increase user’s speed or accuracy in detecting errors. However, we found that when recognition errors were correctly <b>underlined,</b> they were discovered significantly more often than baseline. Conversely, when errors failed to be <b>underlined,</b> they were discovered less often. Our results indicate confidence visualization can be effective – {{but only if the}} confidence measure has high accuracy. Further, since our results show that users tend to trust confidence visualization, designers should be careful in its application if a high accuracy confidence measure is not available.
