2500|$|The third platoon and its towed {{anti-tank}} {{guns were}} tasked with demolishing German emplacements and defensive works. The lead vehicle was an M20 armored <b>utility</b> <b>car</b> containing Lieutenant Charles L. Thomas, {{the commander of}} the tank destroyer platoon; as it travelled up the narrow road, it was hit by heavy enemy fire and knocked out. Thomas was wounded when evacuating the vehicle, but stayed to organize the deployment of his anti-tank guns which were to provide a base of fire allowing the infantry and tanks to flank the enemy positions. The 3rd platoon remained in action for four hours, with the gun crews sometimes reduced to two out of ten men. Two of the company's guns were quickly knocked out by German artillery, then a third, but the fourth gun kept firing until it was nearly out of ammunition. A single truck driver, T/5 Robert W. Harris, knowing the remaining gun was running out of ammunition, drove his truck to the rear for a new load and upon his return, disregarded the warning from the TF Commander that it was too dangerous to proceed. Driving to within 25 yards of the gun positions, where the truck became stuck in the mud, he unloaded and uncrated the 3" [...] rounds and began carrying them to the remaining gun. The remaining members of the platoon joined him and made numerous trips carrying the ammunition, all the while under heavy enemy fire.|$|E

5000|$|The M20 armored <b>utility</b> <b>car,</b> {{also known}} as the M20 scout car, was a Greyhound with the turret {{replaced}} with a low, armored open-topped superstructure and an anti-aircraft ring mount for a [...]50 cal. M2 heavy machine gun. A bazooka was provided for the crew to compensate for its lack of anti-armor weaponry. The M20 was primarily used as a command vehicle and for forward reconnaissance, but many vehicles also served as armored personnel carriers and cargo carriers. It offered high speed and excellent mobility, along with a degree of protection against small arms fire and shrapnel. When employed in the command and control role, the M20 was fitted with additional radio equipment. Originally designated the M10 armored <b>utility</b> <b>car,</b> it was redesignated M20 to avoid confusion with the M10 tank destroyer. A total of 3,680 M20s were built by Ford during its two years in production (1943-1944).|$|E

World War II shifted production to military vehicles, fire engines, other equipment and munitions. After the war the site produced the chassis for Leyland's trolleybus.|$|E

50|$|In 1920, Leyland Motors {{produced}} the Leyland 8 luxury touring car, a development {{of which was}} driven by J.G. Parry-Thomas at Brooklands.

5000|$|The Trojan <b>Utility</b> <b>Car</b> went {{onto the}} market at £230, which was reduced to £125 in 1925, {{the same as a}} Model T Ford. Nothing was conventional.

The 1527-cc engine to the ingenious Hounsfield design was started by pulling a lever on the right of the driver. To prove how economical the car was to run, the company ran the slogan [...] "Can you afford to walk?" [...] and calculated that over 200 mi it would cost more in shoes and socks than to cover the distance by Trojan car.|$|E
50|$|The M3 and M3A1 {{first saw}} combat with the Philippine Army and Philippine Constabulary in the Philippines in 1941 to 1960s, {{and was also}} used by the cavalry units of the US Army in the North African Campaign and the {{invasion}} of Sicily. It was used in traditional cavalry roles, such as scouting and screening; also as an armored command vehicle. By mid-1943, the drawbacks of the design - its open top, poor off-road mobility, and poor armament - were evident. During 1943, most US Army units replaced the M3A1 with the M8 armored car and similar M20 <b>Utility</b> <b>Car.</b> A small number of M3A1s were retained and employed in Normandy. A few M3A1s were used by the US Marine Corps in the Pacific theater, but none saw combat.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the ending}} of the Leyland partnership, Leslie Hounsfield took over {{production}} himself back in Croydon but at new premises with Leyland continuing to supply some parts until the early 1930s. [...] In spite of new body styles, sales of the cars were falling and so a new model, the RE, or Rear Engine capable of 45 mph was announced in 1931. It still did without electric starter and had only rear-wheel braking, and was beginning to look very old fashioned, and although new modern bodies were fitted, only about 250 were sold. A final attempt was the Wayfarer of 1934 with the engine back in the middle, but now with three-speed gearbox and shaft drive, but only three were sold, and the 6-cylinder Mastra did no better, with only two produced. The original van continued to sell well, however, and the <b>Utility</b> <b>car</b> could still be ordered; the last one was delivered in 1937.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920 Trojan in Britain {{made its}} first series of six cars from a works in Croydon and the final revised {{production}} version was shown at the 1922 London Motor Show. An agreement was reached with Leyland Motors to produce the cars at their Kingston upon Thames factory where work on reconditioning ex RAF wartime trucks was running down. This arrangement would continue until 1928 when Leyland wanted factory space for truck production. During the nearly seven years of the agreement 11,000 cars and 6700 vans were made. The car known as the Trojan <b>Utility</b> <b>Car</b> went onto the market at £230, reducing to £125 in 1925, {{the same as a}} Model T Ford. Nothing was conventional. Rather than a chassis the car had a punt shaped tray which housed the engine and transmission below the seats. This is a similar idea to the chassis-less design of the contemporary 1922 Italian Lancia Lambda luxury car. The transmission used a chain to drive the solid tyre shod wheels. The 1527-cc engine to the ingenious Hounsfield design was started by pulling a lever on the right of the driver. To prove how economical the car was to run, the company ran the slogan [...] "Can you afford to walk?"

50|$|Car {{production}} at Lilpop started {{less than a}} year later, with a large portfolio of locally assembled cars. Among them were passenger cars of several brands: Buick (Buick 41 and Buick 90), Chevrolet (Chevrolet Master, Chevrolet Imperial and Chevrolet Sedan Taxi), Opel (Opel P4, Opel Kadett and Opel Olimpia). In addition, the company offered a number of <b>utility</b> <b>cars</b> and lorries, including Chevrolet 112 van, Chevrolet 121, 131 and Chevrolet 157 trucks and Chevrolet 183 bus. Between the world wars Poland was primarily an agricultural country, with an underdeveloped road network and high luxury taxes on cars. Because of that the overall volume of production remained low, with roughly 7000 cars and lorries assembled in Poland a year (data for 1938 and 1939). Most of those cars were assembled by Lilpop.|$|R
