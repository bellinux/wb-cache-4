At {{the beginning of the}} movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is [...] "Muntz's Theme", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70years later. [...] "Ellie's Theme" [...] is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that changes during a particular moment in the story.|publisher=Allmusic.

2500|$|The {{cover-up}} â€“ Covering <b>up</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) {{to avoid}} an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body.

2500|$|Straight <b>Up</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{third album}} by British rock band Badfinger, {{released}} in December 1971 in the United States and February 1972 in Britain. Issued on the Beatles' Apple record label, {{it includes the}} hit singles [...] "Day After Day" [...] and [...] "Baby Blue", and the similarly popular [...] "Name of the Game", {{all of which were}} written by singer and guitarist Pete Ham. The album marked a departure from the more rock-oriented sound of Badfinger's previous releases, {{partly as a result of}} intervention by Apple Records regarding the band's musical direction. Although Straight Up received a mixed response from critics on release, many reviewers now regard it as the band's best album. Rolling Stone critic David Fricke has referred to it as [...] "Badfinger's power-pop apex".|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{consensus}} reference standard for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. [...] A combination of described symptoms, clinical findings, and electrophysiological testing may be used. [...] CTS work <b>up</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most common referral to the electrodiagnostic lab. Historically, diagnosis has been made with {{the combination of a}} thorough history and physical examination in conjunction with the use of electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing for confirmation. Additionally, evolving technology has included the use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of CTS. However, it is well established that physical exam provocative maneuvers lack both sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, EDX cannot fully exclude the diagnosis of CTS {{due to the lack of}} sensitivity. A Joint report published by the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagostic Medicine (AANEM), the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM) and the American Academy of Neurology defines practice parameters, standards and guidelines for EDX studies of CTS based on an extensive critical literature review. This joint review concluded median and sensory nerve conduction studies are valid and reproducible in a clinical laboratory setting and a clinical diagnosis of CTS can be made with a sensitivity greater than 85% and specificity greater than 95%. Given the key role of electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of CTS, The American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine has issued evidence-based practice guidelines, both for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the group's {{previous}} records, Tangled Up is a [...] "non stop" [...] pop {{album that}} consistently incorporates elements of electropop, dance music, Europop and various EDM sub-genres. Regarding {{the sound and}} production, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that the material was [...] "witty, diverse" [...] and [...] "experimental", whilst Digital Spy contributor Nick Levine believed it to be [...] "their most danceable album to date". Tangled <b>Up</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> group's first record to not include cover songs and traditional ballads. Nadine Coyle said that the tracks from Tangled Up were [...] "all in the same vein," [...] contrary to their previous releases, of which she described the song selection as [...] "quite random". There are several themes discussed throughout the record, including melancholy, love, relationships, sex and femeninity. Girls Aloud co-wrote two of the twelve tracks on Tangled Up: [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] and [...] "Crocodile Tears". They also co-wrote and recorded a song titled [...] "Hoxton Heroes", which pokes fun at indie bands. The song was deemed too controversial for Tangled Up and therefore omitted from the album; however, the song was released as a B-Side to [...] "Can't Speak French". Cheryl stated that whilst they never intended to enter the industry as [...] "brilliant lyricists", they felt [...] "comfortable with writing bits and pieces".|$|E

Questlove has said that the band's instrumentation for the album is looser than on previous albums, with a jamming and [...] "grass-roots feel". Wake Up! contains lyrical themes concerning social awareness, engagement, and consciousness. The Roots' lead MC Black Thought is featured on few tracks, as the band mostly accompanies Legend's singing with live instrumentation. Other rappers featured on the album include Common, CL Smooth, and Malik Yusef.|$|E
2500|$|The male beetles {{will stay}} {{overnight}} in the spathe, eating and mating throughout the night due to the benefits provided by the spathe and spadix. Typically, five to 12 beetles will be within the spathe throughout the night. Rarely, cases of 200 beetles at a time have been observed and almost always the beetles are of the same species. Another interesting feature of this symbiotic relationship, less well understood, is the series of events in which the spadix begins to heat up prior to the spathe opening up for the beetles. This process is known as thermogenesis. By the time the spathe is open and the beetles have arrived, the spadix is usually quite hot; up to around 46Â°C in some species, but usually around 35Â°C. [...] The thermogenesis coincides {{with the arrival of}} the beetles and appears to increase their presence. The maximum temperature reached by the spadix remains about 20Â°C higher than the outside ambient temperature. The time dependence of the temperature can vary from species to species. In some species, the temperature of the spadix will peak on the arrival of the beetles, then decrease, and finally increase reaching a maximum once again when the philodendron is ready for the beetles to leave. Other species, though, only show a maximum temperature on the arrival of the beetles, which remains roughly constant for about a day, and then steadily decreases. A few species will show three peaks in temperature during the flowering. The increased temperature increases the metabolism of the beetles, causing them to move about more within the spathe and increasing the likelihood they will be sufficiently coated with pollen. A sticky resin is also produced in drops attached to the spadix which help to keep the pollen attached to the beetles. This resin producing quality is unique to Philodendron and Monstera, as other genera of Araceae do not produce it on their spadices. The resin is also found on the stems, leaves, and roots of philodendrons. Its color can be red, orange, yellow, or colorless when it is first produced. Yet, over time, it will turn brown as it is exposed to air. Also, some evidence suggests the thermogenesis triggers the beetles to mate. It also appears to distribute the pheromones into the air. The reason for the spadix being held at 45Â° relative to the spathe may be to maximize the heat's ability to waft the pheromones into the air. Oxidizing stored carbohydrates and lipids has been found to be the energy source for thermogenesis. The part of the spadix that heats <b>up</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sterile zone. As it heats up, carbohydrates are used, but once the spadix has reached its maximum temperature, lipids are oxidized. The lipids are not first converted to carbohydrates, but rather are directly oxidized. The thermogenic reaction is triggered when concentrations of acetosalicytic acid form in the sterile zone. The acid sets off the mitochondria in the cells that make up the sterile zone to switch to an electron transport chain called the cyanide-resistant pathway, which results in the production of heat. Philodendrons consume oxygen during thermogenesis. The rate at which oxygen is used is remarkably high, close to that of hummingbirds and sphinx moths. The spadix has been shown to generate infrared radiation. As the beetles home in on the inflorescence, they first move in a zig-zag pattern until they get reasonably close, when they switch to a straight-line path. [...] The beetles may be using scent to find the inflorescence when they are far away, but once within range, they find it by means of the infrared radiation. This would account for the two different types of paths the beetles follow.|$|E
