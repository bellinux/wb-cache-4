5|$|Although the Poitevin was not {{the only}} breed of horse used for the {{production}} of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide. They were in high demand in the United States from the late 19th century <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline. In the Deux-Sèvres region, especially in the district of Melle, near Luçon and Saint-Maixent, mule breeding began to be concentrated in ateliers (workshops), which were relatively expensive for breeders.|$|E

5|$|Fishing, {{being the}} {{traditional}} industry of the region, was always considered important, {{even though the}} volumes of production remained insignificant <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century.

5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters.

5|$|Angus Maddison {{estimates}} that the country's gross domestic product was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 United States dollars—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did not significantly change <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, confiscations, and price regulation schemes.|$|E
5|$|Before the Croatian War of Independence Velebit {{served with}} the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy {{entering}} service during the late 1980s.

In 1991, it was being overhauled in Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the war, when Croatian forces captured it. In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend to create space needed for the installation of a single MTU 105kW diesel generator, a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new steering system developed by BI was also installed.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{apparently}} {{retained its}} independence from Copán and continued to flourish <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 9th century.

However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá, although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre. After this, Quiriguá falls into silence, engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the Classic Maya collapse– it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.|$|E
