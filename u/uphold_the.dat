He defended their actions and noted she was bound to <b>uphold</b> <b>the</b> laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would be brought to justice.|$|E

5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to <b>uphold</b> <b>the</b> agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent.
