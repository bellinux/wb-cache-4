50|$|In some states, (North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia) {{the city}} and county of the adoptees birth is changed on the <b>amended</b> birth <b>certificate,</b> to where the adoptive parents were living at the time the {{adoption}} was finalized. Often, the states will not give the adoptee the correct location of their birth. Some adoptees have been denied passports for having incomplete birth certificates. The hospital may also be omitted on the <b>amended</b> birth <b>certificate,</b> especially if it primarily serves unwed mothers. In the United States, many such hospitals were run by the Salvation Army, and named after its founder, William Booth. By the mid-1970s, all of these hospitals had closed due to high costs and the reduced need for secrecy, as the social stigma of having a child out of wedlock in America had decreased.

The infant is then issued a second, <b>amended</b> <b>certificate,</b> sometimes stated to be a birth certificate, that states the adopting parents are the child's parents. This becomes the adopted person's permanent, legal [...] "birth" [...] certificate. In the post WWII era laws were enacted which prevented both the adopted person and adoptive family from accessing the original, and the information given to them can be quite limited (though this has varied somewhat over the years, and from one agency to another). Originally, the sealed record laws were meant to keep information private from everyone except the 'parties to the action' (adoptee, adoptive parent, birthparent and agency). Over time, the laws were reinterpreted or rewritten to seal the information even from the involved parties.|$|R
