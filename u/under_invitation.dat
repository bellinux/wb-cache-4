It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.|$|E

25|$|As Chairman of JSC, Hayashi {{took part}} in defense {{collaboration}} and exchanges with other counties. Since the Defense Agency attached much importance to {{the research and development}} of missiles soon after the founding of JSDF, he met Major-General Gerald D. Higgins, the US Chief of Military Assistance Advisory Group in Japan (MAAG-J), in August 1954, to exchange views on the possibility of sending JSDF personnel to the US to study countermeasures against missile attack. In September 1954, he visited the US <b>under</b> <b>invitation</b> of the US Department of Defense. In Washington, D.C., he met Charles Erwin Wilson, US Secretary of Defense, and Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among other top politicians and military officials. They held high-level strategic conferences, discussing issues on deployment of US troops to Japan and Korea, collective military actions, as well as the possibility of providing sufficient jet planes and destroyers to strengthen the power of the JSDF. When Japan and the US conducted their first joint military exercise at theater level in 1956, Hayashi was the chief official representing Japan, while his US counterpart was Lieutenant-General Arthur Trudeau, Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and Operations, Far East and UN Command.|$|E

6000|$|These mystic fountains {{broke out}} for me elsewhere, again and again, I rejoice to say--and perhaps more particularly, to be frank about it, where the ground about them was pressed with due {{emphasis}} of appeal by the firm wheels of the great winged car. I motored, <b>under</b> <b>invitation</b> and protection, repeatedly back into {{the sense of the}} other years, that sense of the [...] "old" [...] and comparatively idle Rome of my particular infatuated prime which I was living to see superseded, and this even when the fond vista bristled with innumerable [...] "signs of the times," [...] unmistakable features of the new era, that, by I scarce know what perverse law, succeeded in ministering to a happy effect.

We none of us had anything quite all to ourselves during an afternoon at Ostia, on a beautiful June Sunday; it was a different affair, rather, from the long, the comparatively slow and quite unpeopled drive that I was to remember having last taken early in the autumn thirty years before, and which occupied the day--with the aid of a hamper from once supreme old Spillman, the provider for picnics to a vanished world (since I suspect the antique ideal of [...] "a picnic in the Campagna," [...] the fondest conception of a happy day, has lost generally much of its glamour). Our idyllic afternoon, at any rate, left no chord of sensibility that could possibly have been in question untouched- -not even that of tea on the shore at Fiumincino, after we had spent an hour among the ruins of Ostia and seen our car ferried across the Tiber, almost saffron-coloured here and swirling towards its mouth, on a boat that {{was little more than a}} big rustic raft and that yet bravely resisted the prodigious weight. What shall I say, in the way of the particular, of the general felicity before me, for the sweetness of the hour to which the incident just named, with its strange and amusing juxtapositions of the patriarchally primitive and the insolently supersubtle, the earliest and the latest efforts of restless science, were almost immediately to succeed? ...|$|E

Jia had quite a few interviews with her probing these things. In 1980, an article was published on Battlefield．People’s Daily and Xinhua Digest, marking the initial joint publish of articles between him and Li Shuxian. Afterwards, Jia and Li Shuxian got ready to write The Later Half of the Last Emperor's Life <b>under</b> <b>invitation</b> from Zhou Lei, the then director of the editing department of Social Sciences Frontline. Jia went {{to a couple of}} hospitals and solicited the medical treatment records of Pu Yi and digested relevant content and wrote the outline and interview framework, altogether more than 50,000 Chinese characters. Unfortunately, his documents were taken away by a magazine reporter who came to him under an appointment, and that reporter published his own article using Jia's manuscripts. Several years later, Jia sued that reporter in a law court. The latter told the judges that Jia only had junior high school education and was not capable of writing articles or books independently. His words greatly injured Jia who from that day made up his mind to write out the story about the latter half life of Pu Yi. In the ensuing decade, Jia collected historic files over again. He interviewed more than 300 people who were associated with Pu Yi successively and had accumulated enormous first-hand documents. During this painstaking period of time, his footprints were seen in Changchun in the north, Guangdong in the south, Penglai in the east, and he even consulted historic files written by Johnston in the British Library during his visit to the United Kingdom.|$|E

Despite its recent centenary (1904 - 2004), the Ulster Literary Theatre (ULT) - and Northern Irish theatre more generally - remains relatively neglected by theatre criticism. This article seeks to go some way towards addressing this by examining the points of contact and conflict between the project of the Ulster Literary Theatre and its latter day counterparts the Ulster Group Theatre (1939 - 1972), the Arts Theatre (1947 -) and the Lyric Theatre (1951 -). At the centre of this enquiry {{is the issue of}} how ideology and material circumstance compete with or mutually elaborate one another to produce each theatre's sense of `place' and the implications of this for each theatre's developing cultural identity...|$|E
