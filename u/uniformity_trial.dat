40|$|It is {{postulated}} that the yields from field trials {{are composed of}} treatment effects, a geographic productivity trend function, and random errors. Using data from 34 uniformity field trLals, 13 of them randomly selected from a Catalogue of <b>Uniformity</b> <b>Trial</b> constructed from available information and from Cochran's catalogue, three mathematical forms for the trend function were studied. From these, the polynomial trend function {{was selected as the}} most suitable of the forms considered. A comparison was made between the effectiveness of polynomial trend functions and blocking in explaining variation in uniformity trials. A model based on selected orthogonal variables (where the full set of orthogonal variables was based on a full 8 th degree polynomial) was generally superior to models based on blocking. Only four uniformity trials showed superiority for blocks of size 10 to 20 or less, and even in these cases the shape of the blocks was unusual since they were very narrow and long. Using the above results and the results of publications, six methods other than blocking were proposed to compensate for the trend function in field trialso A theoretical study of some of these methods was made. A further study of the six proposed methods was accomplished by simulation on the IBM 360 / 75 computer. In thisstudy, data was generated by adding normal errors and treatment effects ii to <b>uniformity</b> <b>trial</b> data" The observations resulting were analyzed using the six proposed methods (which were based on a completely random design) and cwo randomized complete block designs (which involved blocks made up with lx 8 and 2 x 4 pl~c arrangements).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} efficiency of the Papadakis method on the quality evaluation of experiments with multiple-harvest oleraceous crops, and on the estimate of the covariate and the ideal plot size. Data from nine <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials</b> (five with bean pod, two with zucchini, and two with sweet pepper) and from one experiment with treatments (with sweet pepper) were used. Through the <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials,</b> the best way to calculate the covariate was defined and the optimal plot size was calculated. In the experiment with treatments, analyses of variance and covariance were performed, in which the covariate was calculated by the Papadakis method, and experimental precision was evaluated based on four statistics. The use of analysis of covariance with the covariate obtained by the Papadakis method increases the quality of experiments with multiple-harvest oleraceous crops and allows the use of smaller plot sizes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the sample size, in terms of number of plants, needed to estimate the average values of productive traits of the pigeon pea and to determine whether the sample size needed varies between traits and between crop years. Separate <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials</b> were conducted in 2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013. In each trial, 360 plants were demarcated, and the fresh and dry masses of roots, stems, and leaves and of shoots and the total plant were evaluated during blossoming for 10 productive traits. Descriptive statistics were calculated, normality and randomness were checked, and the sample size was calculated. There was variability in the sample size between the productive traits and crop years of the pigeon pea culture. To estimate the averages of the productive traits with a 20 % maximum estimation error and 95 % confidence level, 70 plants are sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the sophistication}} of {{contemporary}} growth chambers, growing conditions cannot be uniformly controlled during experiments. <b>Uniformity</b> <b>trials</b> with bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Spartan) and maize (Zea mays cv. Golden Bantam) in the McGill University Phytotron identified three significant sources of variability. First, not even two identically programmed chambers of the same model and from the same manufacturer provide identical growing environments. Second, programmed environmental conditions are not precisely maintained over time even in a single chamber. Third, the growing environment within a chamber has a consistent pattern of spatial variability with poor growth in the chamber corners and best growth in the center. The importance of these effects varies with species and with the parameters measured, but none can be entirely avoided. Good experimental design with replication of treatments across chambers and blocking within chambers can minimize {{the negative impact of}} these sources of uncontrolled experimental variability...|$|R

The following conclusions are drawn : a) when latin squares are chosen by a random process, as recommended by Fisher, the observed distribution of the variance ratio of "treatments" compared with error is i n agreement with that given by theory; b) the estimation of error variance is biased when systematic squares are employed. In agreement with Tedin, we find that the knight's move square furnishes an overestimate, and the diagonal square an underestimate of error variance.

The objective of this work was to define optimal size, convenient sizes and suitable shape for experimental plots of Eremanthus erythropappus, for evaluation of main dendrometric characteristics in experimental plantations. To attain that, a <b>uniformity</b> <b>trial</b> was used containing 400 plants, all of which had circumference, height and volume measured. 31 combinations of size/shape were simulated for experimental plots.

Two <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials,</b> without treatments, were conducted on Lilli cherry tomato plants in a plastic greenhouse during the 2014 spring/summer season, with the plants in two stems. Variables observed for each plant were mean fruit length, mean fruit width, mean fruit weight, number of bunches, number of fruits per bunch, total number of fruits, and total fruit weight; a Pearson's correlation matrix was used to estimate the relationship between the variables. Path analysis was then performed considering total fruit weight as the main variable and the remaining variables as explanatory. Due to the severe multicollinearity, the variable 'number of fruits per bunch' was eliminated. Pearson's correlation coefficients were significant between explanatory and main variables. Mean fruit weight has a low cause-and-effect relationship with the total weight of fruits produced. A low cause-and-effect relationship was also observed between number of fruits and number of bunches. Cherry tomato productivity is directly related to the number of fruits per plant...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{inception}} of experimentation with monozygotic twins the terms "her-itability " and "twin efficiency value " have been used widely. Heritability may {{be defined as the}} proportion of total variance in a population which is attributable to genetic differences between individuals. Twin efficiency value is defined as the number of pairs of unrelated animals in an experiment which one pair of monozygotic twins can replace without altering the statistical precision of the experiment (Bonnier, et al., 1946). The formula for calculating heritability from twin data has been given by Thoele and Hervey (1952) while formulae for twin efficiency values have been presented by Dick and Whittle (1951) and Carter (1951). It is apparent that the more highly heritable a trait is the more efficient monozygotic twins will be in relation to unrelated animals in experiments involving this trait. Therefore, the two terms must be related in some way but a scrutiny of the literature reveals no presentation of this relationship. In this paper, the relationships between the formulae for heritability (Thoele and Hervey, 1952) and twin efficiency values (Carter, 1951; Dick and Whittle, 1951) will be derived.

Each <b>uniformity</b> <b>trial</b> was divided into 24 basic experimental units (BEU) of 1 × 1 m (1 m 2) and the shoot fresh matter of plants in each BEU was weighed.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the <b>uniformity</b> <b>trial</b> size for estimating the optimum plot size in order to evaluate the fruit mass of tomato, snap-beans and zucchini. The mass of fruits was evaluated in uniformity trials with tomato grown in plastic tunnel in spring-summer and autumn-winter seasons, with snap-beans in plastic greenhouse in autumn-winter season and, with zucchini in plastic greenhouse in summer-autumn and winter-spring seasons. These data were used for planning different sizes of uniformity trials and resampling with replacement was used to estimate the optimum plot size by the method of maximum curvature of the coefficient of variation model. The size of uniformity trials influences the estimation of the optimum plot size for evaluating the mass of fruits of tomato, snap-beans and zucchini. Uniformity trials with tomato with 12 basic experimental units (12 plants) and with snap-beans with 21 basic experimental units (42 plants) are enough for estimating the optimum plot size for evaluating the mass of fruits in plastic tunnel with a confidence interval of 95 % minor or equal to two basic experimental units. Uniformity trials with snap-beans with 18 basic experimental units (36 plants) and with zucchini with ten basic experimental units (ten plants) in plastic greenhouse are enough for estimating the optimum plot size for evaluating the mass of fruits with a confidence interval of 95 % minor or equal to three basic experimental units...|$|E
40|$|English: Several estimators of {{response}} to a forest treatment are compared. All estimators are evaluated theoretically on a common basis. Even though {{they are based on}} different models, they appear to have a similar structure. Based on <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials,</b> they are also compared empirically by means of the mean square error. The unadjusted response estimator, that is the annual basal area growth (increment) difference between the treated and the control plots, has an annual root of mean square error of approximately 0. 1 m 2 Ihectare. The other estimators use preperiod increment difference to improve the response estimate. The easily calculated difference and ratio estimators are satisfactory, with root of mean square errors ≈ 0. 04 m 2 Ihectare initially, rising to about 0. 1 m 2 Ihectare about 20 years after the preperiod. Estimators using covariance, time series or regression adjustment do not improve upon this.

40|$|The successfulness of an {{experiment}} is largely determined by the precision of the results obtained. The precision and the efficiency with which work is done may often be increased by automation. At the present time all irrigation is done in rows across plots by the University of Nebraska corn research program. Planting and harvesting is done by hand because {{it is impossible to}} plant or combine across the rows by machine. The plots have been planted across the rows because it was assumed that there was more variation between streams of water than in the direction of irrigation within a replication. If no difference could be attributed to the direction of irrigation, plots could be oriented with the rows and machine harvesting and planting would be feasible. In order to evaluate the practicality of automation, each of the component parts of the program were analyzed in terms of cost functions. Uniformity trials may be used {{to determine the extent of}} plot to plot variability and soil heterogeneity. In addition, they may be used to construct contour maps of soil fertility, to estimate the effects of plot size and shape, to study the efficiencies of various experimental designs, and to adjust yields of subsequent experiments conducted on the same plots. Uniformity trials may be conducted using a single variety or by using several varieties and {{an experiment}}al design which is successful in removing genotypic effects. The success of a <b>uniformity</b> <b>trial</b> is greatly enhanced by the care with which uniform field husbandry is administered (LeClerg, 1962). Soil heterogeneity is an important feature which cannot be easily regulated but can significantly change results in field work. Plot size and shape are dependent on soil heterogeneity and are therefore important considerations in any research program using field plots. It is important to know in what way soil heterogeneity affects experimental results if the most precise data are to be obtained. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimum plot size and shape for corn yield trials conducted under irrigated conditions on the Red Clover field at Lincoln, Nebraska, and to determine if there was any detectable difference in performance caused by the direction of irrigation. A secondary aspect of the experiment was the comparison of different methods of determining optimum plot size. Advisors: Mumm, R. F. (Robert F.) and Compton, W. A...|$|E

The objectives of this study were to verify the spatial dependence of the fresh biomass of snap beans and to dimension the number of plants and harvests that are necessary to improve experimental accuracy in trials. The data of the fresh biomass of snap beans from <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials</b> carried out in a greenhouse and in the field with semivariograms were created with data transformed into indicators. Thus, they were combined on scenarios of plot size and harvest grouping, and they were adjusted to the spherical, exponential and Gaussian models. A response surface was also applied, with the variation coefficient as a dependent variable and the numbers of plants per plot and harvests as independent variables. The estimates of the semivariogram models parameters indicated a weak spatial dependence. The average of the fresh biomass of snap beans is distributed randomly in the trials, and it is not influenced by the number of plants per plot or by the number of grouped harvests. The best combinations between the number of plants per plot and harvest, for the smaller variation coefficients, are plots of 24 plants for plastic greenhouse and field, and 28 plants for plastic tunnel, in the autumn-winter, combined with the grouping of all harvests.

40|$|The paper {{shows how}} the Alpha-design (also known as {{generalised}} lattice) {{may be used for}} constructing incomplete split-plot designs and describes 4 different methods (A, B, C and D) of construction. Intra-block efficiency factors and theoretical considerations are used to compare the methods. Based on those considerations method B was considered to be the most appropriate method for trials where tests for interaction between the two factors were important and thus this method was used and most of the paper deals with trials based on this construction method. The incomplete split-plots were superior to traditional split-plots in most cases – and the increase in efficiency of the designs can be quite large – especially for comparisons involving the whole-plot treatment. The efficiency for the comparison of the main effect of the whole-plot treatment was in most cases larger for randomized complete block design than for the incomplete split-plot design, but for other comparisons the proposed designs were in most cases more efficient than a randomized complete block design. The efficiency of the designs was compared to traditional split-plot designs and randomized complete block designs using 3 types of data. The 3 types were simulated data with known covariance structure, data from <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials</b> and data from actual trials using incomplete split-plot designs for comparing cereal varieties under different growing conditions. It is concluded that the incomplete split-plot designs may be a good alternative to traditional split-plots and a good compromise between split-plots and randomised complete blocks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to fit Gompertz and Logistic nonlinear to descriptions of morphological traits of sunn hemp. Two <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials</b> were conducted and the crops received identical treatment in all experimental area. Sunn hemp seeds were sown in rows 0. 5 m apart with a plant density of 20 plants per row meter in a usable area of 52 m × 50 m. The following morphological traits were evaluated: plant height (PH), number of leaves (NL), stem diameter (SD), and root length (RL). These traits were assessed daily during two sowing periods—seeds were sown on October 22, 2014 (first period) and December 3, 2014 (second period). Four plants were randomly collected daily, beginning 7 days after first period and 13 days after for second period, totaling 94 and 76 evaluation days, respectively. For Gompertz models the equation was used y=a*e^((?-e?^((b-c*xi)) and Logistic models the equation was used yi= a/(1 +e^((-b-c*xi)). The inflection points of the Gompertz and Logistic models were calculated and the goodness of fit was quantified using the adjusted coefficient of determination, Akaike information criterion, standard deviation of residuals, mean absolute deviation, mean absolute percentage error, and mean prediction error. Differences were observed between the Gompertz and Logistic models and between the experimental periods in the parameter estimate for all morphological traits measured. Satisfactory growth curve fittings were achieved for plant height, number of leaves, and stem diameter in both models using the evaluation criteria: coefficient of determination (R²), Akaike information criterion (AIC), standard deviation of residuals (SDR), mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean prediction error (MPE) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the sample size (i. e., number of plants) required to accurately estimate the average of morphological traits of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) and to check for variability in sample size between evaluation periods and seasons. Two <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials</b> (i. e., experiments without treatment) were conducted for two growing seasons. In the first season (2011 / 2012), the seeds were sown by broadcast seeding, and in the second season (2012 / 2013), the seeds were sown in rows spaced 0. 50 m apart. The ground area in each experiment was 1, 848 m 2, and 360 plants were marked in the central area, in a 2 m × 2 m grid. Three morphological traits (e. g., number of nodes, plant height and stem diameter) were evaluated 13 times during the first season and 22 times in the second season. Measurements for all three morphological traits were normally distributed and confirmed through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Randomness was confirmed using the Run Test, and the descriptive statistics were calculated. For each trait, the sample size (n) was calculated for the semiamplitudes of the confidence interval (i. e., estimation error) equal to 2, 4, 6, [...] ., 20 % of the estimated mean with a confidence coefficient (1 -?) of 95 %. Subsequently, n was fixed at 360 plants, and the estimation error of the estimated percentage of the average for each trait was calculated. Variability of the sample size for the pigeonpea culture was observed between the morphological traits evaluated, among the evaluation periods and between seasons. Therefore, to assess with an accuracy of 6 % of the estimated average, at least 136 plants must be evaluated throughout the pigeonpea crop cycle to determine the sample size for the traits (e. g., number of nodes, plant height and stem diameter) in the different evaluation periods and between seasons.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Statistical and geostatistical {{methods are}} {{utilized}} to investigate soil variability. Methodology includes block kriging, cokriging and simulations of random fields. The ramifications {{of the variability}} are numerous, including the effect on soil water, soil fertility, evapotranspiration, and crop yields. Block kriging {{can be used to}} estimate crop yields and infiltration rates on a large scale using small scale or point data. Results based on variograms and geostatistics are compared to the classical relationship developed by Smith in 1938, that the variance is reduced from V₁ to V₁/nᵇ as the support area increases from 1 to n plots. These results establish a firm theoretical basis for the variance within a finite domain as a function of sample support size. Applications include not only <b>uniformity</b> <b>trials,</b> but also measurement theory. Based on 20 data sets, indices of soil heterogeneity are derived. With these indices, optimal sample sizes and shapes can be determined. The ordinary kriging and cokriging estimators are investigated in order to examine their utilization. Soil moisture content and soil water retained at 1. 5 MPa within the root zone are predicted by cokriging with surface moisture and texture as auxiliary variables. Compared with ordinary kriging, cokriging gave a significant improvement in terms of the average kriging variance and the sum of squared errors between the actual and the predicted values. With soil spectral properties and cokriging, soil texture is estimated successfully. Cokriging is also used for temporal variables and compared with a time invariant relationship. Recently-developed pseudo-cross variograms and cokriging are utilized to predict soil chemicals. The main advantage of this approach is that the computation of sample cross-variograms does not require that measured variables be sited at the same locations. Lastly, several simulation methods are studied. A new simulation procedure is developed and compared with other simulation methods, such as the Turning Bands Method. Conditional simulation is used to simulate random fields for soil water and reflectance...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{efficiently}} deliver a drug or gene to a tumor site {{is dependent on}} a wide range of factors including circulation time, interactions with the mononuclear phagocyte system, extravasation from circulation at the tumor site, targeting strategy, release from the delivery vehicle, and uptake in cancer cells. Nanotechnology provides the possibility of creating delivery systems where the design constraints are decoupled, allowing new approaches for reducing the unwanted side effects of systemic delivery, increasing tumor accumulation, and improving efficacy. The physico-chemical properties of nanoparticle-based delivery platforms introduce additional complexity associated with pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation. To assess the impact of nanoparticle-based delivery systems, we first review the design strategies and pharmacokinetics of FDA-approved nanomedicines. Next we review nanomedicines under development, summarizing the range of nanoparticle platforms, strategies for targeting, and pharmacokinetics. We show how the lack of <b>uniformity</b> in preclinical <b>trials</b> prevents systematic comparison and hence limits advances in the field...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a surge of {{interest}} in using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). While DBS has been regarded as an efficient and safe treatment for many conditions over the last 20 years, and although DBS research trials involving TRD patients show encouraging evidence of remission, recent DBS TRD follow-up studies have reported significant rates of postoperative suicidal ideation, as well as suicide attempts and deaths. Given the vulnerable nature of TRD patients with respect to suicide, if the postoperative DBS adjustment process contributes to an increased risk of suicidality among them, then there is a pressing need to investigate this problem. Based on current clinical trial follow-up data, does the suicidality risk-versus-remission benefit ratio favor the use of DBS in TRD patients? The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine whether adjusting enrollment criteria, such as excluding TRD patients with a history of suicide attempts or anger/impulsivity, could diminish DBS trial research suicidality, given the absence of <b>uniformity</b> in DBS <b>trial</b> eligibility protocols...|$|R

This includes some measure of determining whether the immunologic target is hit and how the treatment has impacted on the immune system in toto. While melanoma is leading the field towards these ends, there is some doubt that not all of the recent successes with immune therapies, for example, checkpoint inhibitors, will be effective for every cancer, and that the toxicities may also be different depending on the malignancy. This review serves to elucidate the current issues facing clinical investigators who perform immunologic trials targeted at patients with prostate cancer and discusses the challenges in assessing the right immunologic endpoints to demonstrate biologic/immunologic targeting leading to clinical benefit.

40|$|The {{statistical}} methods {{discussed in this}} paper are drawn from the area of machine learning or data mining {{as well as from}} descriptive statistics. These techniques are discussed with focus on their applicability to the results of observer trials in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} signature measures. Signature measures aim at the change of the apparent signature of an object, e. g. a vehicle. So signature measures can be camouflage against infrared sensory, or they can be used for deception reasons. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of signature measures, observer trials provide an efficient method. The department of Signatorics of Fraunhofer IOSB developed a software tool named CARPET (Computer Aided inteRactive Performance Evaluation Tool) for the realization of observer trials. The benefit of this system is the reproducibility and <b>uniformity</b> of <b>trials</b> for every observer. The results from this system consist of marks, that were placed at particular times, as well as computer mouse positions recorded for each human observer. Based on the information gathered from these marks together with the known target object positions the statistical treatment can be done. For the statistics it has to be known to which target object the marks belong. The first problem considered in this paper concentrates on the correct labeling of the marks according to the target objects. The labeling is done using an expectation maximization scheme with the k-means clustering algorithm. The next step involves a second labeling. In this step a linear discriminant is used to decide whether a mark should be considered a hit or miss for every particular target object. After these decisions, a receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis is performed in order to evaluate the detectability of each target object. Furthermore the sample mean and sample covariance formulas are used on the so called hit sets in order to approximate Gaussian distributions for every hit set. These Gaussians facilitate the evaluation of the accuracy and the precision of the hit sets. Accuracy and precision offer information about the quality of the marks set by the observers...|$|R
