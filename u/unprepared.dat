5|$|In 2002, {{columnist}} and highly decorated military veteran David Hackworth again criticized the 10th Mountain Division for being <b>unprepared</b> {{due to lack}} of training, low physical fitness, <b>unprepared</b> leadership and low morale. He said the division was no longer capable of mountain warfare.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after all}} Ostrom's work, several small blocks of lime-encased {{material}} remained <b>unprepared</b> in storage at the American Museum. These consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments, including the original matrix, or surrounding rock {{in which the}} specimens were initially buried. An examination of these <b>unprepared</b> blocks by Gerald Grellet-Tinner and Peter Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures that helped stiffen the tail of Deinonychus) turned out to actually represent gastralia (abdominal ribs). More significantly, {{a large number of}} previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix that had surrounded the original Deinonychus specimen.|$|E
5|$|Phase 1: On 16 August 636, Vahan {{decided in}} a council of war to launch his attack just before dawn, {{to catch the}} Muslim force <b>unprepared</b> as they {{conducted}} their morning prayers.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the eastern}} Caribbean, Hurricane Lenny damaged vital infrastructure, {{including}} roads and piers in the tourism-dependent islands. Most of the islands' tourism areas were on western-facing beaches, {{many of which}} were <b>unprepared</b> for the high waves and winds produced by Lenny.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{was caught}} <b>unprepared</b> by Campbell's request, and issued no {{response}} {{for over a}} week. In the meantime Campbell, whose retirement was due, was relieved by the Rhodesian government on 10 June. His replacement, Brigadier Andrew Skeen, took over Campbell's London office at Rhodesia House, 429 Strand six days later.|$|E
5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks were largely <b>unprepared</b> for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons.|$|E
5|$|Residents and {{tourists}} in southern Florida were <b>unprepared</b> for the unusual off-season storm. Winds {{of up to}} 65mph (105km/h) spread across the area, causing damage to windows and power lines. The storm dropped 2–4inches (50–100mm) of precipitation along its path; the combination of unseasonable rainfall and winds resulted in crop damage in Miami-Dade County.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after forming, gale {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Netherlands Antilles of the Leeward Islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla. Klaus {{was the first}} tropical cyclone on record to hit the Leeward Islands from the west, {{and as a result}} many were <b>unprepared</b> for the strong winds and rough seas from the southwest.|$|E
5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were <b>unprepared,</b> preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unprepared</b> for the Allied {{operation}} at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement. Mikawa, {{commander of the}} newly formed Japanese Eighth Fleet headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards Guadalcanal on August 7. However, when the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Navy {{went into}} a period of decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 ships and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads which made the U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy only had 48 ships in commission, 6,000 men, and the ships and shore {{facilities}} were decrepit but Congress saw no need to spend money to improve them. The Navy was <b>unprepared</b> to fight a major maritime war before 1897.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99typhoon bulletins, warning {{residents}} about Mireille. There were 236warnings {{related to}} storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents {{were aware of}} the approaching storm, about 70% of residents did not expect significant effects. In general, residents were <b>unprepared</b> for the storm, partly {{due to the lack of}} recent storms. Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000individuals, and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted. In Hokkaido, 207schools were closed due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally <b>unprepared</b> for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|As Ezri Tigan was {{the only}} unjoined Trill {{available}} on board, she agreed to be joined to the symbiont {{even though she was}} <b>unprepared</b> and did not previously seek to be joined to one. Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even <b>unprepared</b> fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E
5|$|By mid-December 1963, Indonesian {{had sent}} a {{commando}} unit consisting of 128 volunteers and 35 regular soldiers to Sebatik. Their aim was to take Kalabakan, then invade Tawau and Sandakan. On 29 December 1963, the Indonesian unit attacked the 3rd Royal Malay Regiment unit. The Indonesians managed to throw several grenades into the totally <b>unprepared</b> Malay Regiment's sleeping quarters. The attack resulted in eight Malay soldiers being killed and nineteen wounded. Malaysian armed police eventually drove the attackers north after a two-hour battle.|$|E
5|$|Claymore {{took place}} on 4 March 1941. The Germans were caught <b>unprepared</b> and the {{landings}} were unopposed. Within an hour No. 4 Commando had taken all its objectives. The raid was a success: 11 fish oil factories and storage tanks were destroyed, 10 ships sunk, 225 prisoners taken with {{an unknown number of}} German sailors killed on the sunken ships. An added bonus were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} {{to accept his}} election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely <b>unprepared</b> for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|Corbulo {{had placed}} {{a large number}} of his {{auxiliaries}} in a line of forts near the Armenian frontier under a former primus pilus, Paccius Orfitus. Disobeying Corbulo's orders, he used some newly arrived auxiliary cavalry alae to stage a raid against the Armenians, who appeared to be <b>unprepared.</b> In the event, his raid failed, and the retreating troops even spread their panic amongst the garrisons of the other forts. It was an inauspicious start for a campaign, and Corbulo severely punished the survivors and their commanders.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, in the 19th century, Kanaks were {{recruited}} or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were <b>unprepared</b> for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E
5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to do}} this effectively, and thus was <b>unprepared</b> when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E
5|$|Frederick III's war on Sweden gave Charles X Gustav {{a reason}} to abandon the Polish–Lithuanian {{deadlock}} and fight Denmark instead. After marching his army {{to the west and}} making a dangerous crossing of the frozen straits in the winter of 1657/58, he surprised the <b>unprepared</b> Frederick III on the Danish isles and forced him into surrender. In the Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark had to abandon all Danish provinces in what is now Southern Sweden. The anti-Swedish allies meanwhile neutralized the Transylvanian army and Polish forces ravaged Swedish Pomerania.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was <b>unprepared</b> for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught Constantinople <b>unprepared,</b> while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing Arab–Byzantine wars {{and unable to}} deal with the Rus' threat. After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, {{although}} the nature of this withdrawal, and indeed which side was victorious, is subject to debate. The event gave rise to a later Orthodox Christian tradition, which ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the Theotokos.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, Ismael {{produced}} {{waves of}} up to 30feet (9m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were <b>unprepared</b> for the hurricane, which was expected to move more slowly, {{and as a result}} 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26million in damage (1995USD, $ USD). The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000people homeless. Moisture from the storm extended into the United States, causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 25, 1950, ten {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was <b>unprepared</b> for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.|$|E
5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} education improved as well, though the extreme growth in the new boomtowns initially caused severe strain on school systems <b>unprepared</b> for the rapid influx of students. Even as money was rapidly flowing in the communities, obtaining tax revenue efficiently where it was needed was often complex. Communities dealt with these problems by establishing independent school districts, education districts formed independently of city or county government with their own independent taxing authority. This type of school district is still the standard in Texas today.|$|E
5|$|The Axioms {{passengers}} {{have become}} obese and feeble due to microgravity and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship {{under the control}} of the robotic autopilot, AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is <b>unprepared</b> for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. However, AUTO orders his robotic assistant GO-4 to steal the plant to prevent this from happening.|$|E
5|$|The Inchon {{landings}} were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean Army, catching it completely <b>unprepared</b> and breaking the already weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage and {{were not able to}} continue to pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full retreat from the Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|The Thirty Years' War period {{brought the}} Commonwealth a mixed legacy, rather more losses than gains, with the Polish–Lithuanian state {{retaining}} {{its status as}} one of the few great powers in central-eastern Europe. From 1635 the country enjoyed a period of peace, during which internal bickering and progressively dysfunctional legislative processes prevented any substantial reforms from taking place. The Commonwealth was <b>unprepared</b> to deal with grave challenges that materialized in the middle of the century.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, a {{newly formed}} unit {{consisting}} mostly of inexperienced new arrivals, {{was ordered to}} move to the South Korean village of Hadong to hold the pass there from advancing forces of the North Korean People's Army. <b>Unprepared</b> for combat, the American forces walked into an ambush in which most of the battalion's command staff was killed in the pass, leaving lower-ranking soldiers to mount a disorganized defence against North Korean troops occupying prepared positions on higher ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} immediately put 14,528 Avro employees, as well {{as nearly}} 15,000 other employees in the Avro supply chain of outside suppliers, out of work. Declassified records show Avro management was caught <b>unprepared</b> by the suddenness of the announcement by the government; while executives were aware that the program was in jeopardy, they expected it to continue until the March review. It was widely believed during this lead-up to the review, the first Arrow MkII, RL-206, would be prepared for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana's realm {{began with the}} capture of his brother Andrianavalonimerina's territory, which he ruled from Ambohitrabiby. The king led his brother {{to believe that they}} were on friendly terms and that they should work together to support one another. When the king launched a surprise attack on Ambohitrabiby, his brother was <b>unprepared</b> to deflect the offensive and Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana successfully seized control of the territory, which he incorporated into his own.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{originally}} intended to be laid down 1 September 1939, but they were delayed until November to allow improvements to the shipyards to be completed. A total of sixteen ships were planned in the August 1939 building program, but this was scaled back to four in July 1940 and two in October 1940 {{when it became clear}} just how <b>unprepared</b> the Soviets were for any large-scale naval construction program. Work on these ships ceased shortly after the German invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Inchon landings were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean army, catching them completely <b>unprepared</b> and breaking the already-weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage {{and would not be}} able to continue pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full retreat from Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Tidewater region, {{there were}} {{estimates}} {{of thousands of}} downed trees, and hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged. Of these, about 40 structures were declared uninhabitable. Debris was blown several blocks inland from the coast. Among the hardest hit locations was Sandbridge, where about 12 homes were severely damaged. It is reported that the state was <b>unprepared</b> for the damage, expecting a strike from a weakened tropical storm. About $15.3million (1998 USD) in damage was inflicted in the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas. Throughout the state, insured losses totaled $95million (1998 USD).|$|E
