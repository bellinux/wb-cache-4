50|$|To reduce unintentional {{ultraviolet}} (UV) exposure, and {{to contain}} hot bulb fragments {{in the event}} of explosive bulb failure, general-purpose lamps usually have a <b>UV-absorbing</b> <b>glass</b> filter over or around the bulb. Alternatively, lamp bulbs may be doped or coated to filter out the UV radiation. With adequate filtering, a halogen lamp exposes users to less UV than a standard incandescent lamp producing the same effective level of illumination without filtering.|$|E
40|$|Ray-trace {{simulation}} is used {{to quantify}} the optical losses of photovoltaic modules containing silicon cells. The simulations show that when the module’s encapsulant is silicone rather than ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), the module’s short-circuit current density under the AM 1 - 5 g spectrum is 0. 7 – 1. 1 % higher for screen-printed multi-cSi cells, 0. 5 – 1. 2 % higher for screen-printed mono-cSi cells, and 1. 0 – 1. 6 % higher for high-efficiency rear-contact cells, {{depending on the type}} of silicone. This increase is primarily due to the transmission of short-wavelength light (< 420 nm) and is therefore greatest when used with low <b>UV-absorbing</b> <b>glass</b> and cells of a high IQE at short wavelength. We also quantify absorption in the glass, EVA and silicone at longer wavelengths and describe the influence of an encapsulant’s refractive index on escape losses...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{assimilation}} {{is usually}} measured at fairly constant light intensities. Under natural condi-tions, however, planktonic algae are {{moved through the}} water column and experience light of fluc-tuating intensity and spectral composition. They may cope with strong UV for a short residence in the upper water layer. In order to estimate the effects of UV on primary production of phyto-plankton under conditions of turbulent mixing, we compared carbon assimilation and exudation of algae incubated in UV-transparent quartz and in <b>UV-absorbing</b> <b>glass</b> bottles which were moved through different water layers. Computer-controlled elevators were used to simulate mixing depths between 2 and 14 meters. Compared to the glass bottles, particulate C assimilation in the quartz bottles was reduced by 20 – 30 % at mixing depths between 2 and 10 m. There was no sig-nificant difference between both types of incubation bottles at a mixing depth of 14 m. Exudation was enhanced by UV near the water surface (mixing depth up to 4 m) {{but not in the}} deep-mixed samples. Our results indicate serious damage of planktonic algae by UV even under conditions of vertical mixing if the euphotic zone exceeds the mixing depth. Depression was low for circulation through the whole euphotic zone and may disappear at even deeper mixing. Our results indicat...|$|E
2500|$|Current-production burner {{categories}} are D1S, D1R, D2S, D2R, D3S, D3R, D4S, and D4R. The D stands for discharge, {{and the number}} is the type designator. The final letter describes the outer shield. The arc within an HID headlamp bulb generates considerable short-wave ultraviolet (UV) light, {{but none of it}} escapes the bulb, for a <b>UV-absorbing</b> hard <b>glass</b> shield is incorporated around the bulb's arc tube. This is important to prevent degradation of UV-sensitive components and materials in headlamps, such as polycarbonate lenses and reflector hardcoats. [...] "S" [...] burners – D1S, D2S, D3S, and D4S – have a plain glass shield and are primarily used in projector-type optics. [...] "R" [...] burners – D1R, D2R, D3R, and D4R – are designed for use in reflector-type headlamp optics. They have an opaque mask covering specific portions of the shield, which facilitates the optical creation of the light/dark boundary (cutoff) near the top of a low-beam light distribution. Automotive HID burners do emit considerable near-UV light, despite the shield.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Titanium {{in normal}} melting {{conditions}} in air atmosphere present as Ti 4 + ion in basic silicate glasses exhibited an ultra-violet cut-off in silicate glasses, viz. soda–magnesia–silica, soda–magnesia–lime– silica and soda–lime–silica glasses. This indicates that Ti 4 + ion {{can be a}} good replacement for Ce 4 + ion in pro-ducing <b>UV-absorbing</b> silicate <b>glasses</b> for commercial applications. The wavelength maxima at which the infi-nite absorption takes place in glasses was found to be around 310 nm against Ti-free blank glass in UV-region. The mechanism of electronic transition from O 2 – ligands to Ti 4 + ion was suggested as L ® M charge transfer. The low energy tails of the ultra-violet cut-off were found to obey Urbach’s rule in the optical range 360 – 500 nm. The fluorescence spectra of these glasses were also studied and based on the radiative fluorescent properties it was suggested that the soda–lime–silica glass containing Ti 4 + ion with greater emission cross-section would emit a better fluorescence than the corresponding oda–ma nesia–lime–silica and soda– magnesia–silica glasses. The shift of emission wavelengths maxima towards longer wavelength in titania introduced silicate glasses was observed on replacement of MgO by CaO which may be attributed due to an increase in basicity of the glass system...|$|R
