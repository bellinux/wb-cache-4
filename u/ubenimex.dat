50|$|An {{enkephalinase}} inhibitor {{is a type}} of {{enzyme inhibitor}} which inhibits one or more members of the enkephalinase class of enzymes that break down the endogenous enkephalin opioid peptides. Examples include racecadotril, <b>ubenimex</b> (bestatin), RB-101, and D-phenylalanine, as well as the endogenous opioid peptides opiorphin and spinorphin. Analgesic, anticraving, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antidiarrheal effects are common properties of enkephalinase inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of pseudoaldosteronism caused by {{combination}} treatment with itraconazole (Itrizol) and <b>ubenimex</b> (Bestatin). A 53 -year-old female with acute myelocytic leukemia developed multiple liver abscess due to Aspergillus infection during courses of chemotherapy despite achieving a complete remission. She was treated with intravenous administration of miconazole (Florid-F), and then with oral administration of itraconazole. Marked reduction of the liver abscess was observed by the antifungal treatment without any side effects. One hundred eight days after the initiation of itracon- azole administration, she was given <b>ubenimex</b> for maintenance therapy of leukemia. On the 6 th day after the addition of <b>ubenimex,</b> she suddenly complained of numbness of the extremities, polyuria and muscular weakness. She was diagnosed as having pseudoaldoster- onism by laboratory findings such as markedly decreased levels of serum potassium, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone. All the symptoms and abnormalities in laboratory findings disappeared within 25 days only by the discontinuance of <b>ubenimex</b> and itracon- azole. This is the first reported case of pseudoaldosteronism caused by combination treatment with itraconazole and <b>ubenimex.</b> Deep mycosis is commonly associated with immuno- suppresive situations such as leukemia. It is, therefore, supposed {{that there is a}} relatively high possibility of the simultaneous administration of itraconazole and <b>ubenimex.</b> The case reported here, however, gives notice that the development of pseudoaldosteronism needs to be taken into consideration in patients treated with a combination of itraconazole and <b>ubenimex...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Radiotherapy {{can be used}} {{to treat}} all stages of {{cervical}} cancer. For improving local control via radiotherapy, it is important to use additional antitumor agents. Aminopeptidase N (APN) /CD 13, a 150 -kDa metalloproteinase, is a multifunctional cell surface aminopeptidase with ubiquitous expression. Recent studies have suggested that APN/CD 13 {{plays an important role in}} tumor progression in several human malignancies. Methods We investigated whether the suppression of APN/CD 13 using <b>Ubenimex,</b> an inhibitor of APN/CD 13 activity, may affect tumor radiosensitivity in cervical cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cell surface APN/CD 13 activity in HeLa cells was calculated using alanine-p-nitroanilido as a substrate. For colony formation assays, single-dose radiation and/or <b>Ubenimex</b> were administered to each dish of HeLa cells, and these dishes were cultured for 14 days. Molecular changes of apoptosis were determined by Western blot. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin-V PI staining (flow cytometry analysis) and the Tunel method. Moreover, we investigated the effect of combining <b>Ubenimex</b> and low-dose radiation on tumor growth using nude mice. Results We demonstrated that <b>Ubenimex</b> enhanced the effectiveness of radiotherapy, acting as a radiosensitizer both in vitro and in vivo. In colony formation assays, a significant decline in clonogenic survival was observed in Ubenimex-treated cells. Mice treated with a combination of radiation and <b>Ubenimex</b> showed a significant prolongation of the tumor-doubling time compared with the control, <b>Ubenimex,</b> or radiation-alone groups. We also showed that <b>ubenimex</b> enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Although further studies are needed, this report suggests that Ubeniemx acts as a radiosensitizer in cervical cancer treatment, and that the inhibition of APN/CD 13 activity may represent a new approach for improving the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy for uterine cervical cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA ubenimex-sensitive {{aminopeptidase}} B-like enzyme was purified {{from the}} non-membrane-bound fraction of K 562 cells {{by a series}} of chromatographic procedures and slab-gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 73 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The aminopeptidase activity was activated by chloride ions and inhibited by Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Cd 2 +, and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid. <b>Ubenimex</b> was a potent inhibitor of this aminopeptidase in the nanomolar range. The sequence of the N-terminus of the protein was not determined. Partial amino acid sequencing revealed that the N-terminus of this aminopeptidase B-like enzyme was blocked by acylation. The partial sequences of the two fragments produced by CNBr cleavage and an acylamino acid-releasing reaction showed this enzyme to be a new aminopeptidase...|$|E
40|$|Enhancement of DNA vaccine {{immunogenicity}} is {{a current}} topic of high {{priority in the}} field of applied immunology, especially as a means of controlling HIV infection. The adjuvant effect of <b>Ubenimex</b> (UBX), an anti-cancer immunomodulator, on a DNA AIDS vaccine which we developed was examined in a murine model. UBX was formulated into a preparation containing DNA plasmids encoding env and rev genes of HIV- 1 strain IIIB, and was inoculated intramuscularly into BALB/c mice. The sera obtained with this mixture had 23 â€“ 25 times higher specific IgG titres than those obtained without the use of the adjuvant. UBX also elicited both a stronger HIV- 1 -specific DTH reaction, as measured by the footpad swelling test, and stronger cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, as assayed by the 51 Cr-release method, compared with responses using DNA alone. The cytokine secretion profile of restimulated immune lymphoid cells showed that UBX raised IL- 2 and interferon-gamma levels and decreased IL- 4 production. HIV- 1 -specific immunoglobulin subtype analysis demonstrated that UBX stimulated IgG 2 a production but suppressed synthesis of IgG 1 and IgE. These results indicate that activation of the T-helper type 1 subset was induced by UBX, suggesting a mechanism of immunomodulation mediated by this agent. We conclude that UBX acts as an immunologic adjuvant for DNA vaccination against HIV- 1. UBX may be a suitable adjuvant for clinical use because of its lack of antigenicity and low toxicity...|$|E
