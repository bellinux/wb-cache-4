5|$|In 2016, every {{councillor}} was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> following {{changes made}} by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. 2017 is a fallow year and therefore {{there will be no}} elections held.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{was also}} <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> as senator, in 2004. He {{defeated}} little-known Democratic schoolteacher Stuart Starky with his biggest margin of victory, garnering 77percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the common}} pleas court judges <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> were {{endorsed}} by both parties, but in the one contested race, Democrat John Morgan Davis defeated incumbent Republican Thomas Bluett. The Democrats also took eight of the fourteen magisterial district judge positions (a local court, the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court).|$|E
5000|$|Congressman Adam Kinzinger was {{considered}} a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate if Republican Senator Mark Kirk {{had decided not to}} run again. [...] However, Senator Kirk ended <b>up</b> filing <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> and Kinzinger remained running <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Hassan {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run again for office. He subsequently met with Somali groups in Columbus, Ohio to drum <b>up</b> support <b>for</b> his <b>re-election</b> bid. The ensuing conference was reportedly attended by {{many members of the}} Somali community, who greeted Hassan warmly and pledged to support his campaign.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, 21 Democrats were <b>up</b> <b>for</b> either <b>re-{{election}}</b> or {{election to}} complete the six-year term. In {{order to have a}} majority, the Republicans were required to attain at least 51 seats in the Senate. The Democrats {{would have been able to}} retain a majority with 48 seats (assuming the two Independents continued to caucus with them) because, in event of a tie vote, Vice President Joe Biden becomes the tie-breaker. Many of the incumbents were elected in the Democratic wave year of 2008 along with President Obama's first election.|$|R
5|$|The {{current system}} {{comprises}} a mayor and city treasurer elected in a citywide vote and twelve city council members who must reside in and are elected {{from one of}} six wards with each ward having two council members. All positions are nominally nonpartisan. Council members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms with council-member elections being staggered to allow only one member from each ward to <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b> There are no term limits for either position.|$|E
5|$|Brunner's term as Ohio Secretary of State ends in 2011 and was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 2010 {{along with}} other Ohio statewide offices. In January, rumors that were {{eventually}} confirmed began circulating that second term Republican United States Senator George Voinovich would not run for re-election in 2010. Brunner's name was mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for the seat. On January 23, 2009, Brunner and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher met to discuss the possibility that either of them would run, but did not confirm any decision or leanings to the media.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election,</b> and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
50|$|After {{retiring}} to Goa, Mello was not put <b>up</b> as candidate <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> {{through a}} political manoeuvre of the Salazar's single party regime. In 1950, when the Fifth International Congress of Microbiology {{was to take}} place in Petropolis, Brazil, Mello who had expected to be nominated as the delegate of Portugal, found out to his surprise that Salazar had instead appointed another delegation without him. When this came to be known, the Brazilian Government invited him, providing for his travel and stay.|$|R
5000|$|Marstrand {{remained}} a Swedish town, governed by Swedish law, but had almost complete local autonomy, and was {{ruled by a}} Council of Burghers (Swedish: Borgarråd) influenced by the republican standing of the Italian porto francos and chaired by a mayor. The Council was soon appointed by the inhabitants through elections, and it - in the role as the [...] "town elders" [...] - {{had the right to}} decide all ongoing affairs. It had twenty-four members, of which six were <b>up</b> <b>for</b> yearly <b>re-elections.</b> Eighteen of the Councillors had to be native Sweden, the rest could be foreigners on the condition that they possessed property worth at least 1,000 riksdaler and had resided in Marstrand for two years or more.|$|R
50|$|In 2015 10 Democrats and 23 Republicans are <b>up</b> <b>for</b> either <b>re-{{election}}</b> or {{election to}} complete the six-year term. In {{order to have a}} majority, the Democrats are required to attain at least 51 seats or 50 seats (and hold the Presidency) in the Senate. The Democrats would be able to gain a majority with 48 seats (assuming the two Independents continued to caucus with them) because, in event of a tie vote, the Vice President becomes the tie-breaker. Many of the incumbents were elected in the Republican wave year of 2010 midterm. The Democrats need to gain 4 seats as the Republicans currently hold the majority 54-46, with both independent candidates caucusing with the Democrats. Two-term Senator Jon Tester of Montana will chair the DSCC for this cycle.|$|R
5|$|Tydings {{resumed his}} legal career after {{he lost his}} Senate seat, {{entering}} into practice with a Washington law firm that included Giant Food President Joseph Danzansky. After several years out of politics, he began traveling the state in 1975 to gauge his chances for winning a rematch versus Beall, who was coming <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 1976. On January 10, 1976, Tydings announced his candidacy to retake the seat, which he argued was taken unfairly in 1970 due to an undisclosed $180,000 gift to the Beall campaign.|$|E
5|$|Douglas was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 1858, and Lincoln {{hoped to}} defeat the {{powerful}} Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator, many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party. Some eastern Republicans favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led {{the opposition to the}} Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. But many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 {{national}} {{convention of the}} Progress Party of Norway was held from 15 April to 17 April at the hotel Bolkesjø Turisthotell in Bolkesjø, Telemark. It was originally set {{up to be a}} normal convention with 157 delegates in a non-election year, but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction, it became clear some months before the conventions that personal positions could be at stake. The party leader seat, held by Carl I. Hagen since 1978, was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b> The deputy leaders Ellen Wibe and Hans J. Røsjorde was not up for election until 1995, but there were talks about forming a motion of no confidence against Wibe. The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions.|$|E
5000|$|Kennedy {{was again}} much talked {{about as a}} {{contender}} in the 1976 U.S. presidential election, with no strong front-runners among the other possible Democratic candidates. Kennedy's concerns about his family were strong, and Chappaquiddick {{was still in the}} news, with The Boston Globe, The New York Times Magazine, and Time magazine all reassessing the incident and raising doubts about Kennedy's version of events. In September 1974, Kennedy announced that for family reasons he would not run in the 1976 election, declaring that his decision was [...] "firm, final, and unconditional." [...] The eventual Democratic nominee, Jimmy Carter, built little by way of a relationship with Kennedy during his primary campaign, the convention, or the general election campaign. Kennedy was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> Senate <b>re-election</b> in 1976; he defeated a primary challenger angry at his support for school busing in Boston, then won the general election with 69 percent of the vote.|$|R
50|$|Three {{seats on}} the Arizona Corporation Commission were <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election. Republican Brenda Burns chose not to run <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> to a second term in office. Republican Gary Pierce was term-limited and ineligible to run <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> to a third term in office.|$|R
5000|$|Crane was {{a faculty}} member at Indiana University and at Bradley University in Peoria, a staff member for the Republican National Committee and a {{director}} of research for the 1964 Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. His brother Dan Crane served alongside him as the Congressman from another Illinois district for three terms. Another brother, David Crane, ran for Congress from Indiana a few times simultaneously with Phil and Dan. The brothers were dubbed [...] "the Kennedys of the Right". However, David never won a seat in Congress, and Dan ended <b>up</b> being defeated <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 1984 due, in part, to his having sexual relations with a 17-year-old girl. Philip began to battle alcoholism, which he publicly acknowledged after winning reelection in 2000.|$|R
25|$|<b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 2012, Johnson again hired Crosby {{to orchestrate}} his campaign.|$|E
25|$|All {{eight of}} the Dover school board members who were <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> on November 8, 2005, were {{defeated}} {{by a set of}} challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class. (The ninth member was not <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.)</b> The new school board president subsequently stated that the board did not intend to appeal the ruling.|$|E
25|$|The trust {{currently}} has four patrons: Andy Ritchie, Jimmy Frizzell, David Eyres and Joe Royle and thirteen directors. Directors come <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> every three years.|$|E

25|$|The {{mayor is}} elected {{directly}} by the city voters for a two-year term. Municipal elections are held every year, with half the city council members <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> each year.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 2006, at the 2006 South Australian state election, the Australian Democrats {{were reduced}} to 1.7 per cent of the Legislative Council (upper house) vote. Their sole {{councillor}} <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election,</b> Kate Reynolds, was defeated.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the term}} of U.S. Senator Dolliver would expire in March 1907, Dolliver was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> by the General Assembly in January 1907. All {{but one of the}} Democrats in the General Assembly voted for Porter rather than Dolliver, but their numbers were far too few to prevent Dolliver's re-election.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958, Kennedy was gearing <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his Senate <b>re-election</b> {{campaign}} and seized the issue. The Oxford English Dictionary lists the {{first use of}} the term [...] "missile gap" [...] on 14 August 1958, when he stated, [...] "Our Nation could have afforded, and can afford now, the steps necessary to close the missile gap." [...] According to Robert McNamara, Kennedy was leaked the inflated US Air Force estimates by Senator Stuart Symington, the former Secretary of the Air Force. Unaware that the report was misleading, Kennedy used the numbers in the document and based some of his 1960 election campaign platform on the Republicans being [...] "weak on defense." [...] The missile gap was a common theme.|$|R
50|$|All {{three of}} Nebraska's {{seats in the}} United States House of Representatives will be <b>up</b> <b>for</b> {{election}} in 2010. All three incumbents are Republican, and all three will be running <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of {{the three}} seats on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission are <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election. Incumbent Republican Commissioner Bob Anthony, the Chairman of the Commission, is {{eligible}} to run <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> to a sixth six-year term in office.|$|R
25|$|In {{accordance}} with the Polish Constitution, on the President's death his duties were taken on by the Marshal of the Sejm (speaker of the lower house of the parliament)—at the time Bronisław Komorowski, who thus became Acting President of Poland. Within two weeks he was obliged to announce {{the date of the}} popular presidential election, to be held within a further 60 days on a weekend. Kaczyński was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in late September or early October, before the end of his first five-year term.|$|E
25|$|The club's {{board of}} {{directors}} has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure {{of the terms of}} the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune {{to a lot of the}} in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.|$|E
25|$|The Greens {{increased}} their national vote by 1.38 points to 9.04% at the 2007 federal election, {{with a net}} increase of one senator {{to a total of}} five. Senators Bob Brown (Tas) and Kerry Nettle (NSW) were <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election,</b> Brown was re-elected, but Nettle was unsuccessful, becoming the only Australian Greens senator to lose their seat. Elected at the 2001 federal election on a primary vote of 4.36% in New South Wales with One Nation and micro-party preference flows, she failed to gain re-election in 2007 due to preferences, despite an increase in the New South Wales Green primary vote to 8.43%.|$|E
50|$|The Mississippi U.S. House {{elections}} {{took place}} on November 7, 2006. All 4 House seats <b>for</b> Mississippi were <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election with all incumbents (2 Republicans and 2 Democrats) running <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b> All incumbents succeeded in being re-elected.|$|R
50|$|All 39 {{seats in}} the Louisiana State Senate were <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election. The Republican party {{currently}} holds 26 seats, while the Democratic party holds the remaining 13. 7 of the current senators are term limited and could not run <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first MLA for Dunvegan was Joseph Scruggs, who {{narrowly}} {{picked the}} riding <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the governing Social Credit. He {{did not run}} <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 1963, but Ernest Lee held the riding for the government for two more terms.|$|R
