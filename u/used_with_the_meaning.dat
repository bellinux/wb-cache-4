25|$|The Croatian {{equivalent}} to comrade is drug {{for males and}} drugarica for females. In the period between World War II and Josip Broz Tito's death in socialist Yugoslavia it was applied to almost everybody: teachers, officials, etc. Today it is not used commonly. It may be <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of friend as in Serbian, but this use is far less frequent in Croatian. It is still used among far left organization members, and calling someone drug/drugarica may also be used ironically to denote someone's perceived radical leftism.|$|E
500|$|The causative mood (sometimes {{called the}} conjunctive) {{is used to}} {{construct}} subordinate clauses with the meaning [...] "because", [...] "since" [...] or [...] "when"; it is also sometimes <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "that". The causative is also used in main clauses to imply some underlying cause.|$|E
500|$|The first {{texts to}} use [...] "tefillin" [...] are the Targumim and Peshitta {{and it is}} also used in {{subsequent}} Talmudic literature, although the word [...] "ṭoṭafah" [...] was still current, being <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "frontlet." [...] "Tefillin" [...] may have derived from the Aramaic palal, [...] "to plead, pray," [...] a word closely related to the Hebrew tefillah, [...] "prayer." [...] Jacob ben Asher (14thcentury) suggests that [...] "tefillin" [...] is derived from the Hebrew pelilah, [...] "justice, evidence," [...] for tefillin act as a sign and proof of God's presence among the Jewish people.|$|E

500|$|Earth is {{the only}} planet whose name in English is not derived from Greco-Roman mythology. Because it was only {{generally}} accepted as a planet in the 17th century, there is no tradition of naming it after a god. (The same is true, in English at least, of the Sun and the Moon, though {{they are no longer}} generally considered planets.) The name originates from the 8th century Anglo-Saxon word erda, which means ground or soil and was first used in writing as the name of the sphere of Earth perhaps around 1300. As with its equivalents in the other Germanic languages, it derives ultimately from the Proto-Germanic word ertho, [...] "ground", {{as can be seen in}} the English earth, the German Erde, the Dutch aarde, and the Scandinavian jord. Many of the Romance languages retain the old Roman word terra (or some variation of it) that was <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "dry land" [...] as opposed to [...] "sea". The non-Romance languages use their own native words. The Greeks retain their original name, Γή (Ge).|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "avocado" [...] {{comes from}} the Spanish aguacate, which in turn {{comes from the}} Nahuatl word āhuacatl , which {{goes back to the}} proto-Aztecan *pa:wa which also meant [...] "avocado". Sometimes the Nahuatl word was <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> [...] "testicle", {{probably}} because of the likeness between the fruit and the body part.|$|E
5000|$|Hello may {{be derived}} from hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster {{dictionary}} describes as a [...] "chiefly British variant of hello," [...] and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in <b>use,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> hello.|$|R
5000|$|The first attested {{use of the}} {{expression}} in English was in 1572 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "fainting fit".

In modern usage, this term has generally been interpreted to describe the post-orgasmic state of unconsciousness {{that some people have}} after having some sexual experiences.|$|R

2500|$|Sometimes, {{particularly}} {{outside of}} Mexico, the word [...] "mestizo" [...] is <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of Mexican persons with mixed Indigenous and European blood. This usage does {{not conform to}} the Mexican social reality where a person of pure indigenous genetic heritage would be considered mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language, and {{a person with a}} very low or without any percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{first-class}} match, there {{are up to}} four innings with each team due to bat twice (in practice, {{this is not always}} the case). In a limited overs match, there are only two innings with each team batting once. The term is also <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "score" [...] for both the team and each individual batsman. For example, it may be said that [...] "he played an innings of 101", meaning that the player scored 101 in his innings. Similarly, it may be said that the team had a first innings (score) of 501.|$|E
2500|$|The nobility {{always played}} an {{important}} role in Armenian society. This inter alia is evidenced through the evolution of the term nakharar. Initially this term referred to the hereditary governors of the Armenian provinces and was <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "ruler" [...] and [...] "governor". The same title could mean a particularly honorable service (nakhararutyun, nakharardom) at the Armenian royal court. Examples of such heritable services or nakharardoms are aspetutyun (coronation, which traditionally belonged to the house of Bagratuni), sparapetutyun (commander-in-chief of the Armenian army, which traditionally belonged to the house of Mamikonean), hazarapetutyun (chancellery and taxation, which were inheritably managed by the houses of Gnuni and Amatuni), and malhazutyun (royal guard that was traditionally organized and headed to the house of Khorkhoruni). However, in the course of hereditary consolidation of gavars (provinces) or royal court services by noble houses, the term nakharar has changed its original meaning and gradually transformed into a generic equivalent of [...] "aristocrat", [...] "nobleman". Accordingly, the aristocratic families started to be called nakharar houses or nakharardoms. Along with this analysis, there is another interpretation of term nakharar, which is based on Armenian nakh and arar, i.e. [...] "the first created" [...] or [...] "the first borne".|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "fop" [...] {{is first}} {{recorded}} in 1440, {{and for several}} centuries just meant a fool of any kind; the Oxford English Dictionary notes first <b>use</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "one who is foolishly attentive to and vain of his appearance, dress, or manners; a dandy, an exquisite" [...] in 1672. An early example of the usage is in the restoration drama The Soldier's Fortune, {{in which a woman}} dismisses a potential suitor by saying [...] "Go, you are a fop." ...|$|R
5000|$|Slobodas ( [...] , sloboda; pl. , slobody)—historically, a {{settlement}} freed from taxes and levies for various reasons. The name is still currently in <b>use</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> basic <b>meaning</b> of [...] "village".|$|R
5000|$|The word {{continued}} to be <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dominant <b>meaning</b> of [...] "carefree", {{as evidenced by the}} title of The Gay Divorcee (1934), a musical film about a heterosexual couple.|$|R
2500|$|Sometimes, {{particularly}} {{outside of}} Mexico, the word [...] "mestizo" [...] is <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> {{of a person}} with mixed Indigenous and European blood. This usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where, like in Brazil, a person of mostly indigenous genetic heritage would be considered Mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language, and {{a person with a}} very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage. [...] Additionally the categories carry additional meanings having to do with social class so that the term indigena or the more pejorative [...] "indio" [...] (Indian) is connected with ideas of low social class, poverty, rural background, superstition, being dominated by traditional values as opposed to reason. Commonly, instead of the term Mestizo, which also has a somewhat pejorative usage, the term [...] "gente de razón" [...] ("people of reason") is used and contrasted with [...] "gente de costumbre" [...] ("people of tradition"), cementing the status of indigeneity being connected to superstition and backwardness. For example, it has been observed that upwards social mobility is generally correlated with [...] "whitening", if persons with indigenous biological and cultural roots rise to positions of power and prestige they tend to be viewed as more [...] "white" [...] than if they belonged to a lower social class.|$|E
