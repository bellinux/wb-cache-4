5|$|Acidic runoff {{disrupts}} aquatic ecosystems, {{and highly}} acidic soil contaminated by this runoff {{will not support}} vegetation, which is <b>unsightly,</b> {{and can lead to}} problems with soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|Belle is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991). Originally voiced by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara, Belle is the non-conforming {{daughter of an}} inventor. Belle yearns to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure. When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast, Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his <b>unsightly</b> outward appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} a strong {{commitment}} to renewable energy, ranking {{as one of the top}} 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be <b>unsightly.</b> The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E
5|$|To obtain enough protein, aphids need to suck {{large volumes}} of sap. The excess sugary fluid, honeydew, is {{secreted}} by the aphids. It adheres to plants where it promotes growth of sooty molds. These are <b>unsightly,</b> reduce the surface area of the plant available for photosynthesis and may reduce {{the value of the}} crop. These aphids are also the vectors of about thirty plant viruses, mostly of the nonpersistent variety. The aphids may not be the original source of infection but are instrumental in spreading the virus through the crop. Various chemical treatments are available to kill the aphids and organic growers can use a solution of soft soap.|$|E
5|$|Removing the {{original}} tablet {{to the victims}} of the East Ham Sewage Works accident had left an <b>unsightly</b> gap in {{the original}} row of tiles. In 1931, Mary Watts tracked down Fred Passenger, a former employee of DeMorgan who had, after the closure of the business, set up his own ceramics business using DeMorgan designs. Passenger was by this time working for a pottery business in Bushey Heath established by artist Ida Perrin, but Mary Watts persuaded him to produce a single panel in the style of DeMorgan to fit into the empty space. Herbert Maconoghu, a schoolboy who had died in 1882 attempting to rescue two friends from drowning, {{had been one of the}} names originally suggested by Watts, and Passenger produced a tablet to Maconoghu in the style of the original central row, which was installed in April 1931. Maconoghu was actually Herbert Moore McConaghey, the son of Matthew and Martha McConaghey, and he was born in Mynpoorie in Indian where Matthew was working as a settlement officer for the Imperial Civil Service.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} and protest from neighbouring residents who claim the billboard is <b>unsightly,</b> blocks view {{corridors of the}} mountains and even {{that it is a}} dangerous distraction to drivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{medical school}} and a temple housing priceless {{statutes}} of coral (Tsepame), mother-of-pearl (of Tujechempo) and turquoise (of Drolma) were completely demolished by PLA artillery in 1959 after the Lhasa uprising. It is now crowned by <b>unsightly</b> radio antennas.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{decreased}} use, hyphenation {{remains the}} norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see below). Hyphenation is also routinely used as part of syllabification in justified texts to avoid <b>unsightly</b> spacing (especially in columns with narrow measure, as when used with newspapers).|$|E
25|$|They {{found the}} people of the place {{modelled}} after so <b>unsightly</b> a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday's best.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} the {{shoreline}} of Buttle Lake was logged to accommodate the increase in water levels from the Elk Falls hydroelectric project in Campbell River in 1948 which also raised water levels in the Elk River. The variation in water levels in the lake periodically exposes lake bottom and stumps from this logging and is considered <b>unsightly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Litter : Litter of {{all kinds}} is both <b>unsightly</b> and can cause {{pollution}} and damage to livestock and wild animals. Broken glass is a danger to people and, by focusing the rays of the sun, a possible cause of fire, particularly in areas of moorland such as Exmoor, parts of the Peak District and the North York Moors.|$|E
25|$|Boats used in {{the lake}} {{may not be used}} in any other body of water, {{to prevent the spread of}} zebra mussels. This raised some local concern in 2005, since many were left on shore during the offseason and the town found them <b>unsightly</b> as it {{prepared}} to spend $2.3 million to spruce up the hamlet. DEP was able to get most of the owners to relocate them to storage areas out of sight of downtown.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} criticized by Thomas Adams, Regional Plan Association director, at the 1927 {{meeting of the}} Municipal Art Society. He disapproved of its ugliness and noise, and {{suggested}} simply clearing obstructions to the existing surface road to speed traffic. Adams instead supported a comprehensive regional plan for development in the Hudson Valley. The Fine Arts Federation also opposed the highway, saying that elevated structures were <b>unsightly,</b> and that if the existing street were cleared a new highway might not be required.|$|E
25|$|Downtown Schenectady {{includes}} Union College, {{which is}} a private 4-year college established in 1795. In July 1806, the college determined to acquire a large tract of land {{to the east of}} the main settlement in Schenectady, on a gentle slope up from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. This tract was not promisingly described by college president Eliphalet Nott some years later as “pasture grounds, scarred by deep ravines, rendered at once <b>unsightly</b> and difficult of access by an alternation of swamp and sand hill…”.|$|E
25|$|On August 13 of 1897 {{operating}} concessions {{were issued}} to the Société Anonyme des Railways Économiques de Liège-Seraing et Extensions (RELSE) and the Compagnie Générale des Railways à voie étroite (CGR). These companies merged on January 4, 1898 {{to form the}} SA des Tramways Electriques de Gand. The aim of this move was to replace horses by electric traction, {{as well as the}} further usage of the tram network. It was also decided to use battery-powered trams, since they did not require <b>unsightly</b> overhead lines.|$|E
25|$|Much of Dorado's geology {{consists}} of alluvial and coastal/estuarine sediments of Quaternary age and limestones of Tertiary age. The limestones are {{mostly in the}} south part of the municipality, in Espinosa, Maguayo and Rio Lajas Wards. These limestones exhibit mature karst topography of great beauty. It {{has been subjected to}} extensive quarrying, which have left <b>unsightly</b> scars in the landscape. Some local communities have gathered efforts to minimize quarrying and improve land management to protect the remaining karst topography and the fauna and flora that lives in it.|$|E
25|$|Erosion : Hill-walking and use {{of other}} public {{rights-of-way}} is an extremely popular use of all the national parks. Heavy use {{of the most popular}} paths leads to considerable erosion, but strengthening of paths can be <b>unsightly.</b> Particularly heavy wear is caused by sponsored walks, walks promoted by national books and magazines, by horse riding on unsurfaced bridleways, mountain biking {{and use of}} off-road vehicles on green lanes. Examples include Dovedale in the Peak District. Over-grazing, for example, by sheep on hill and moorland areas, can also reduce vegetation, leading to increased erosion.|$|E
25|$|Esperanto derivational {{morphology}} uses a {{large number}} of lexical and grammatical affixes (prefixes and suffixes). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of {{a relatively small number of}} basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root vid- (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, <b>unsightly,</b> glance, view, vista, panorama, observant etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.|$|E
25|$|Manhole covers in the {{sidewalks}} and streets nearby {{were made of}} bronze, to avoid <b>unsightly</b> rust stains from traditional iron manhole covers (the usual material). The interior elevator doors were also cast in bronze, and areas in the floors in suites, meeting rooms, and some public areas had removable panels and built-in tubing which allowed for the easy replacement or upgrading of electrical, telecommunications, and computer wiring. The cafeteria beneath the Dirksen Senate Office Building was doubled in size and extended beneath the Hart building, which allowed the public to use {{for the first time}} during lunch hours.|$|E
25|$|Derivation by affix greatly expands a speaker's vocabulary, {{sometimes}} {{beyond what}} they know in their native language. For instance, the English word ommatidium (a single lens of a compound eye) is rather obscure, but a child {{would be able to}} coin an Esperanto equivalent, okulero, from okulo 'an eye' (or perhaps, more precisely, okularero, by first coining okularo for 'a compound eye'). In this way the Esperanto root vid- (see) regularly corresponds to some two dozen English words: see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, <b>unsightly,</b> glance, view, vista, panorama, observant etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for some of these concepts.|$|E
25|$|A hernia is an {{abnormal}} opening, either within the abdomen {{or through the}} abdominal wall muscles. An internal hernia may result from surgery and re-arrangement of the bowel, and is a cause of bowel obstruction. Antecolic antegastric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery has been estimated to result in internal hernia in 0.2% of cases, mainly through Petersen's defect. An incisional hernia occurs when a surgical incision does not heal well; {{the muscles of the}} abdomen separate and allow protrusion of a sac-like membrane, which may contain bowel or other abdominal contents, and which can be painful and <b>unsightly.</b> The risk of abdominal-wall hernia is markedly decreased in laparoscopic surgery.|$|E
25|$|Galls {{interfere}} with the natural formation of twigs and cause curling, stunting and the eventual death of new growth. Heavy infestations give the trees a ragged, <b>unsightly</b> appearance. Thus galls prevent twig growth and, if they are abundant, may affect entire trees. Individual trees vary in susceptibility to attack; some appear immune, others suffer growth reduction, and some are eventually killed. By itself, gall growth rarely causes lasting damage, but tends to leave affected trees susceptible to other health problems, including infestation of disease causing organisms and other harmful insects. Trees growing on good sites are generally less susceptible to attack than those on poor sites.|$|E
25|$|Beauty and the Beast is {{a musical}} with music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice, and book by Linda Woolverton. Adapted from Walt Disney Pictures' Academy Award-winning 1991 {{animated}} musical {{film of the}} same name – which in turn had been based on the classic French fairy tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont – Beauty and the Beast {{tells the story of a}} cold-blooded prince who has been magically transformed into an <b>unsightly</b> creature as punishment for his selfish ways. To revert into his true human form, the Beast must first earn the love of a bright, beautiful young woman whom he has imprisoned in his enchanted castle before it is too late.|$|E
25|$|Residents also {{complained that}} the parking lots {{opposite}} the Crescent were <b>unsightly,</b> and that they {{found it difficult to}} find parking downtown. The plan recommends creating a village green on part of the lot at the southwest corner of Main and Spring streets, outside the district, as a focal point of downtown. It could retain parking along the sides or even in a garage underneath, a common practice in Europe. Further parking could be added in an aboveground garage on Brandreth Street, outside of downtown. The village should also act to create a consistent downtown environment by encouraging infill development, making signage and lighting consistent, and strengthening and consistently enforcing its historic preservation guidelines.|$|E
25|$|Warts {{caused by}} the Xipapillomavirus group have a cauliflower-like {{appearance}} and can attain {{the size of a}} fist; most common on the head, neck and shoulders, they may also occur in other locations. Cutaneous fibropapillomas caused by Deltapapillomavirus group have a nodular appearance. Although <b>unsightly,</b> most skin warts rarely cause problems except in show animals. However, large warts may bleed, potentially leading to secondary infections, and florid warts of the teat can cause mastitis and interfere with suckling and milking. Fibropapillomas can be troublesome when present in the genital area, causing pain and sometimes loss of reproductive functions as well as interfering with calving. Chronically immunosuppressed animals may develop extensive papillomatosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which can cause difficulties with eating and breathing.|$|E
25|$|Mona Lisa has no {{clearly visible}} eyebrows or eyelashes. Some {{researchers}} {{claim that it}} was common at this time for genteel women to pluck these hairs, as they were considered <b>unsightly.</b> In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps {{as a result of}} overcleaning. Cotte discovered the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made {{to the size of the}} Mona Lisa's face and the direction of her gaze. He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.|$|E
25|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Embargo Act of 1807, and {{prohibited}} {{the importation of}} slaves in 1808. That same year Fernandina was declared a free port; it began to ship great quantities of Florida cotton and lumber, and became a resort for the smuggling business and contraband slave trade. The town entered a boom period of extraordinary growth, with finer residences and crude shacks springing up next to each other. Vegetable gardens were planted haphazardly about, and the streets {{were little more than}} crooked paths. The <b>unsightly</b> and unsanitary condition of Fernandina disturbed Governor White, and on May 10, 1811, two days after Clarke's appointment as surveyor general, he instructed him to plat the town so that the streets were properly aligned and the lots were uniform.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{it appears}} that after 1914 most {{maintenance}} work was undertaken only when conditions presented a safety hazard, mechanical systems were in need of repair, or the building became extremely <b>unsightly.</b> Lack of scheduled maintenance affects the performance of building materials. Wood, in particular, requires proper maintenance of paint coatings to control the development of rot. In this building, {{it is important to}} maintain the condition of the interior, as well as exterior, coatings because of the humid indoor environment. Also necessary is the maintenance of waterproofing details, such as flashing, to prevent water from accumulating in concealed areas. It is therefore not surprising that rot developed in the building, and significant repairs to the wood elements of the building were necessary over time, given its somewhat irregular maintenance history.|$|E
25|$|The Hall of Fame... {{owes its}} {{inception}} {{in large part to}} hard facts of physical geography. After the three buildings which were to form {{the west side of the}} quadrangle of the New York University College of Arts and Science at University Heights had been planned, it was decided, in order to enlarge the quadrangle, to push them as near as possible to the avenue above the Harlem River. But since the campus level is 170 feet above high tide, and from 40 to 60 feet above the avenue, it was seen at once that the basement stories would stand out towards the avenue bare and <b>unsightly.</b> In order to conceal their walls, a terrace was suggested by the architect, to be bounded at its outer edge by a parapet or colonnade.|$|E
25|$|For the {{majority}} of the franchise's history the Cowboys played their home games at Texas Stadium. Just outside the city of Dallas, the stadium was located in Irving, Texas. The stadium opened on October 24, 1971, at a cost of $35million and with a seating capacity of 65,675. The stadium was famous for its hole-in-the-roof dome. The roof's worn paint had become so <b>unsightly</b> in the early 2000s that it was repainted in the summer of 2006 by the City of Irving. It {{was the first time the}} famed roof was repainted since Texas Stadium opened. The roof was structurally independent from the stadium it covered. The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the Baltimore Ravens, 33–24, on December 20, 2008. After Cowboys Stadium was opened in 2009, the Cowboys turned over the facility to the City of Irving.|$|E
25|$|City directories, Sanborn maps, {{abstract}} {{records and}} other historical sources help {{to paint a}} picture of the neighborhood. Within its boundaries, one finds a plentiful offering of largely unaltered working class cottages accompanied by a still robust commercial strip along West Markham as well as a bustling elementary school and the landmark Lamar Porter Field made famous by the local hero Brooks Robinson who grew up playing in its outfield. Even the Billy Mitchell Boys and Girls Club with its playground and open spaces serves as a reminder of fields and woods where the children of Stifft Station Historic District played as their neighborhood grew from a sprinkling of scattered houses {{in the first years of}} the twentieth century to the fully realized and largely stable neighborhood it remains today. Stifft Station Historic District is a credit to its humble but handsome housing stock, reasonable real estate prices, minimal intrusive or <b>unsightly</b> infill and, significantly, its residents willingness to acknowledge the importance of an active neighborhood association.|$|E
25|$|Despite the College's liberal {{acceptance}} of various {{religious and ethnic}} groups, {{during the period from}} 1785–1849 the life of the college was a continuous struggle for existence, owing to inadequate means and lack of financial support. The curriculum of the college during the beginning of the 19th century was mostly focused studying the Classics. As a result, the major prerequisite for admission into the College was familiarity with Greek and Latin and a basic understanding of mathematics. Because the school had no athletic program, student life during this period was mainly focused around literary groups such as the Philolexian Society, which was founded in 1802. The average graduating class of the university during {{the first decade of the}} 19th century was seventeen. The main building which housed the College was decayed and <b>unsightly</b> in appearance; however, the funds of the College were augmented somewhat by the growing importance of its investments in real-estate, although the true wealth of these acquisitions wouldn't come to light till later in the century. In 1810, following the advice of a committee put together by members of the school, the College greatly increased its admission standards; nonetheless, admission of qualified students increased, with 135 students matriculating in 1810.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin and {{appointment}} of Khrushchev, who had spent his early working years in Ukraine, as party secretary, the industrialisation of Dnipropetrovsk became even more profound, with the Southern (Yuzhne) Missile and Rocket factory being {{set up in the}} city. However, this was not the only development and many other factories, especially metallurgical and heavy-manufacturing plants, were set up in the city. At this point Dnipropetrovsk {{became one of the most}} important manufacturing cities in the Soviet Union, producing many goods from small articles like screws and vacuum cleaners to aircraft engine pieces and ballistic missiles. As a result of all this industrialisation the city's inner suburbs became increasingly polluted and were gradually given over to large, <b>unsightly</b> industrial enterprises. At the same time the extensive development of the city's left bank and western suburbs as new residential areas began. The low-rise tenant houses of the Khrushchev era (Khrushchyovkas) gave way to the construction of high-rise prefabricated apartment blocks (similar to German Plattenbaus). In 1976 in line with the city's 1926 renaming a large monumental statue of Grigoriy Petrovsky was placed on the square in front of the city's station. This statue was destroyed by an angry mob early 2016.|$|E
25|$|This {{reinforced}} concrete Art Deco house {{has always been}} painted blue and white; the colour even features on the 1937 plan for an extension. It stands at number two Clifftown Gardens at Westcliff in Herne Bay and was started in 1934 and completed in 1935. Council archives have been lost and the architect is not known. A firm called John Howell & Son was contracted for the extension, greenhouse and air-raid shelter during the 1930s, {{but it was not}} John Howell & Son of Hastings; the last partner of that company died in 1903. Although it was funded by the Sultan, Cissie was the executive owner of Mayfair Court and the adjoining two Art Deco houses at 139 and 141 Grand Drive from the beginning. She bought a number of 15-foot-wide plots in Clifftown Gardens and Grand Drive, and built Mayfair Court first. In spite of the cancellation of the engagement in 1938, the Sultan continued to fund Mayfair Court and the associated servants' quarters for her. It has also been suggested that the Sultan (via Cissie) did not build the associated two houses for servants, but built them to claim the land and to prevent <b>unsightly</b> building by neighbours next door.|$|E
25|$|In many areas, regular {{avalanche}} tracks can {{be identified}} and precautions {{can be taken to}} minimise damage, such as the prevention of development in these areas. To mitigate the effect of avalanches the construction of artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types: One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires in addition to their foundations. These barriers are similar to those used for rockslides. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence-like structure (snow fence) and may be constructed of steel, wood or pre-stressed concrete. They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid barriers are often considered <b>unsightly,</b> especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. In addition to industrially manufactured barriers, landscaped barriers, called avalanche dams stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made out of concrete, rocks or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road or railway that they are trying to protect, although they {{can also be used to}} channel avalanches into other barriers. Occasionally, earth mounds are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down. Finally, along transportation corridors, large shelters, called snow sheds, can be built directly in the slide path of an avalanche to protect traffic from avalanches.|$|E
25|$|With {{only one}} game before the First Test Brown's men had {{to improve their}} form {{dramatically}} {{if they wanted to}} stand a chance against the powerful Australian team. Instead they conceded another first innings deficit to a weak Sheffield Shield team. the wicket-keeper-captain Don Tallon won the toss and batted and the MCC bowlers did quite well in the circumstances, Alec Bedser (3/40) and John Warr (3/70) having Queensland 23/2, but whatever good work they did was undone by slack fielding, poor catching and some new batsman making runs. Ken Archer (63), who would make his Test debut in the series added 120 with Aubrey Carrigan (100) and Ernest Toovey (58 not out) added 81 for the ninth wicket with Lawrence Chapman (38). The second day was rained off as they batted into the third day for 305. The local swing bowler Len Johnson took 6/66 in an innings of 291 that relied almost entirely on Cyril Washbrook (82) and John Dewes (117), both fighting their way back into form and jeered by the crowd as they ground out their <b>unsightly</b> innings. With Denis Compton making a dull 28 in 100 minutes and nobody else making 15 by the time they had finished only three overs could be bowled before stumps, but Warr picked up a wicket for no runs. The press were unsympathetic and with rumours that Hutton (damaged finger), Denis Compton (swollen knee) and Alec Bedser (influenza) were all ill or injured some wondered if the Test was worth playing. There were also the usual stories of dissension in the ranks whenever a team performs badly, which Brown hotly denied, thus providing a new story. In truth Brown ran a happy ship and allowed the team more socialising than previous captains. He also saw no reason why he should force amateur undergraduates to mix awkwardly with working class professionals, or that veterans should accompany their younger team-mates.|$|E
