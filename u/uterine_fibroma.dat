30|$|Results: The {{mean age}} of {{patients}} was 49.6 (30.70), mean BMI was 25 (17.35). <b>Uterine</b> <b>fibromas</b> constituted the indication for hysterectomy in 82 patients (72.5 %), in 27 cases (23.8 %) the operation was preformed due to abnormal uterine bleedings, in two cases (1.9 %) CIN 3 was the reason of operation and in two patients benign adnexal tumor. Thirty-five patients (30.9 %) gave previous laparotomy in history and in four cases (3.5 %) previous laparoscopy was performed. The mean operative time was 138  min (75 – 270), the average blood loss was 420  ml (50, 1, 200), the mean hospital stay was 3.8  days (2.11). No major complications were observed. The minor complications occurred in 17 patients (15 %): eight (7 %) patients developed post operative anemia requiring blood transfusion, in five cases (4.4 %) a fever was observed, in two patients (1.7 %) intra abdominal bleeding occurred requiring relaparoscopy in the first post operative day, in one case (0.8 %) a haematoma in subcutaneous tissue was noticed and in one a vaginal apex bleeding.|$|R
40|$|Uterine fibroid are benign tumors that consist most of {{the tumor}} occurrences in pelvic cavity of women. Possible courses of {{treatment}} include: medicament treatment, surgical and new intra-arterial embolisation method. The aim of the paper is to present achieved results in intra-arterial embolisation treatment of Uterine fibroid. Material and methods: A prospective study was performed in the period from October 2007 until October 2008. It included 36 women with symptomatic uterine fibroid. They were treated by intra-arterial embolisation. All patients had control MRI examinations after treatment. Embolisation was performed by 'cross-over' technique, using bilateral punction of femoral arteries, a selective catheterization a. uterine, and application of 750 - 900 m Bead Blocks. Results: Average age of patients was 38. 5 years. The most of fibroids had intramural localization (39 %). solitary fibroids were seen in 56 % of patients, multiple in 44 %. Gynecological hemorrhage was the leading symptom with 34 patients (94 %). One year after receiving intra-arterial embolisation treatment, fibroid regression of 50 % was registered in all patients. There were no serious complications noted in our study, {{with the exception of}} postembolisation syndrome which occurred in 11 (30 %) patients in a relatively mild form Conclusion: Intra-arterial embolisation of <b>uterine</b> <b>fibroma</b> is a method that in large percent of patients removes symptoms of <b>uterine</b> <b>fibroma</b> presence, prevents its growth, and safely helps women enter menopause when activity of hormone dependant tumor ceases...|$|E

40|$|Background In high-income countries, the {{incidence}} of severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) has increased. This has important public health relevance because severe PPH is {{a leading cause of}} major maternal morbidity. However, few studies have identified risk factors for severe PPH within a contemporary obstetric cohort. Methods We performed a case-control study to identify risk factors for severe PPH among a cohort of women who delivered at one of three hospitals in Norway between 2008 and 2011. A case (severe PPH) was classified by an estimated blood loss ≥ 1500  mL or the need for blood transfusion for excessive postpartum bleeding. Using logistic regression, we applied a pragmatic strategy to identify independent risk factors for severe PPH. Results Among a total of 43, 105 deliveries occurring between 2008 and 2011, we identified 1064 cases and 2059 random controls. The frequency of severe PPH was 2. 5 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 32 – 2. 62). The most common etiologies for severe PPH were uterine atony (60 %) and placental complications (36 %). The strongest risk factors were a history of severe PPH (adjusted OR (aOR) [*]=[*] 8. 97, 95 % CI: 5. 25 – 15. 33), anticoagulant medication (aOR[*]=[*] 4. 79, 95 % CI: 2. 72 – 8. 41), anemia at booking (aOR[*]=[*] 4. 27, 95 % CI: 2. 79 – 6. 54), severe pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome (aOR[*]=[*] 3. 03, 95 % CI: 1. 74 – 5. 27), <b>uterine</b> <b>fibromas</b> (aOR[*]=[*] 2. 71, 95 % CI: 1. 69 – 4. 35), multiple pregnancy (aOR[*]=[*] 2. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 39 – 3. 22) and assisted reproductive technologies (aOR[*]=[*] 1. 88, 95 % CI: 1. 33 – 2. 65). Conclusions Based on our findings, women with a history of severe PPH are at highest risk of severe PPH. As well as other established clinical risk factors for PPH, a history of severe PPH should be included as a risk factor in the development and validation of prediction models for PPH...|$|R
40|$|<b>Uterine</b> myomas (<b>fibromas,</b> leiomyomas) are {{the most}} common tumours in women, and their {{clinical}} signs and symptoms are presented by 25 - 40 % of patients with these benign tumours. According to current guidelines, the armamentarium for myoma management consists of: medical therapy (GnRH, SPRMs), non-surgical alternatives including uterine artery embolisation (UAE), vaginal temporary occlusion of uterine arteries using clamp-like device or MRgFUS technique, and surgical treatment (including minimally invasive techniques). In cases of submucous myomas STEPW classification correlates very well with the risk of incomplete hysteroscopic myomectomies. According to limited literature data, ulipristal acetate as a pre-treatment seems to be very prudent in high complexity hysteroscopic myomectomy (STEPW II, score 5 - 6). In patients with large uterine myomas (FIGO type 3, 4, 5) undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, three-month pre-treatment with ulipristal acetate before laparoscopy is feasible and can be recommended because of shorter time of surgery, lower intraoperative blood loss, lower haemoglobin drop, and low postoperative blood transfusion rate...|$|R
30|$|Drawbacks {{include the}} following: (1) Uterine wall {{thickness}} at the posterior, anterior and lateral uterine walls’ level is, probably, {{different from that}} observed at the fundal level {{even in the absence}} of any pathology, (2) uterine wall thickness at that level (mean of the anterior and posterior walls’ thickness on a longitudinal section) has never been used to define congenital uterine anomalies, (3) uterine wall thickness at the posterior and anterior level will be affected by a number of <b>uterine</b> conditions like <b>fibromas</b> and adenomyosis. Furthermore, with the vascular network placed laterally, the wall thickness might well be different and (4) uterine anomalies are (fusion and/or absorption) defects at the uterine fundal midline and, therefore, measurements should be oriented there.|$|R
40|$|The {{concomitant}} {{presence of}} the olfactory groove meningioma with uterine fibrosis is very rare. Our report presents {{the case of a}} giant olfactory groove meningioma revealed after a <b>uterine</b> <b>fibroma</b> resection in a 44 years-old female, due to a generalized seizure 10 days after operation. Cranial CT-scan identified the tumor as an olfactory groove meningioma. The tumor was operated with a macroscopically complete resection; the endothermal coagulation of the dura attachment was performed (Simpson II) with a good postoperative evolution. Laboratory results showed the presence of receptors for steroid hormones both in meningioma and uterine tumor, and the histopathological examination revealed an atypical meningioma with 17 % proliferation markers. Our findings suggest that even though meningiomas are benign tumors and a complete resection usually indicates a good prognosis, the association with uterine fibromatosis and the presence of high percentage of steroid receptors creates a higher risk to relapse, imposing therefore a good monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the context}} of a large breast cancer {{screening}} program we conducted a retrospective survey to identify the personal, socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics associated with previous use of mammograms (Ma) and breast ultrasound examination (US). Contact was made with a sample of more than 10, 000 resident women who were asked to complete three questionnaires. Achieving an answer rate of 86 %, we collected data from 9, 087 women, 50 - 70 years aged, coming from Abruzzo, a central Italian region. 61 % of the participants performed Ma, while US was performed by 34 %, and 67 % of women attended at least one of those examinations. Multiple logistic regression results indicated that older age, low level of education, not performing diets and breast self examination were significant predictors of a lower use of both examinations. Women that were married, mothers, on menopause, with a family history of cancer, <b>uterine</b> <b>fibroma,</b> past users of oral contraceptives were more likely to having performed Ma, but not US.

40|$|Aims: We {{present this}} case to improve medical {{knowledge}} about unusual presentation of leiomyomas and about the diagnostical findings of examinations settled down per rectal way. We provide images and {{stress the importance of}} differential diagnosis based on imaging. Presentation of the Case: We report a case of a 26 years old nulliparous, with a leiomyoma developed on the posterior upper third of the vagina surgically removed. The patient came to our Unit with dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia and underwent physical examination and ultrasound scan. Both exams were executed per transrectal way because of her being a virgo. A Computed Tomography scan has been executed too. All the results pointed out the presence of a round-shaped, well delimitated, solid mass in posterior vaginal wall. Magnetic Resonance confirmed this diagnosis. Discussion: We widely discuss the symptomathologic cortege, the diagnostic iter based on imaging we settled down, the possible differential diagnosis, and surgical therapy performed. Concordance of imaging, negativity of tumor markers and general well-being status of the patient led to the diagnostical hypotesis of vaginal benign neoformation. These data excluded other diagnosis as endometriosis, <b>uterine</b> <b>fibroma,</b> primitive vaginal malignant tumor and metastasis of other-site primitive malignant neoplasia. The patient has been treated by surgical transvaginal excission therapy. Conclusion: US imaging and MR gives us the possibility to recognize a mass and to discern his nature and localization, thus to choose the best therapy in each case. Hystopathology still represent the gold standard in making a diagnosis in gynaecological oncology...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A 10 -year-old, female, pot-bellied pig (Sus scrofa) {{experienced}} a 3 -month history of reduced appetite, dysphagia, and weight loss. Clinical examination revealed a {{mass in the}} left part of the oral cavity extending from the hard to the soft palate. At necropsy, a firm, white, poorly demarcated ulcerated mass at the left hard and soft palate with metastases to the left retropharyngeal lymph node and the lung was observed. Additional findings included a uterine adenocarcinoma, a hepatocellular adenoma, and nodular hyperplasias in spleen and adrenal glands. Histologically, the poorly demarcated, infiltrative growing oral mass consisted of islands, cords, and single epithelial cells with moderate squamous differentiation. Cells were strongly positive for cytokeratin by immunohistochemistry. Similar cells {{were found in the}} left retropharyngeal lymph node and the lung. The present findings represent the first report of a metastasizing oral squamous cell carcinoma in a pig. Key words: Hepatocellular adenoma; immunohistochemistry; pot-bellied pig; oral squamous cell carcinoma; uterine adenocarcinoma. Neoplasms in pigs have been reported only in-frequently and include <b>uterine</b> leiomyoma and <b>fibroma,</b> malignant lymphoma, melanoma, hemangiosarcoma, hepatocholangioadenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and osteoma in decreasing frequency. 1, 4, 10, 11 Squamous cell carcinoma represents a common neoplasm in some domestic species including dogs and cats.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether OE-E 6 /E 7, an immortalized human oviductal epithelial cell line, expresses oviductin messenger RNA (mRNA) and its translated protein. Design: Transmission electron microscopy {{was employed to}} characterize the morphology of OE-E 6 /E 7 cells followed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of oviductin mRNA and sequencing of the nested-PCR product. Confocal microscopy was used, using a polyclonal antibody against human oviductin and Con A as a marker for mannose residues, to reveal the colocalization of human oviduct-specific glycoprotein with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments. Setting: University-based anatomy and cell biology department. Patient(s) : Women undergoing laparoscopy for tubal ligation or hysterectomy due to <b>uterine</b> <b>fibroma.</b> Intervention(s) : An immortalized OE-E 6 /E 7 cell line was previously established using human oviductal epithelial cells. Electron microscopy, RT-PCR, sequencing, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were performed. Main Outcome Measure(s) : The presence of human oviductin mRNA and protein in OE-E 6 /E 7 cells. Result(s) : OE-E 6 /E 7 cells retain morphological features characteristic of secretory cells and express human oviductin mRNA and its translated protein. Conclusion(s) : OE-E 6 /E 7 cells were characterized {{for the first time}} by electron microscopy and shown to exhibit histological features typical of secretory cells. Reverse-transcription PCR with sequencing and confocal microscopy showed, respectively, that human oviductin mRNA and protein are expressed in OE-E 6 /E 7 cells. Our results suggest that OE-E 6 /E 7 could be a useful tool for future studies of the function of human oviductin. © 2005 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Background Cutaneous {{melanoma}} is {{a potentially}} lethal cancer for which incidence rates have risen dramatically in white-skinned populations worldwide {{over the past}} decades. While some risk factors for melanoma have been clearly established, such as pigmentary characteristics, sun exposure, and familial history of the disease, emerging evidence suggests that other factors, such as hormonal and genetic factors, {{may play a role}} in the aetiology of this cancer. The present work aimed at 1) examining the relationships between hormonal factors, benign gynaecological conditions, and the risk of melanoma, and 2) to explore shared risk factors for endometriosis and melanoma in a large French prospective cohort; and 3) to study the potential associations between novel naevus-associated gene variants and the risk of melanoma in a large Australian population-based study. Methods The E 3 N prospective cohort includes 98, 995 French women insured by a national scheme mostly covering teachers, and aged 40 - 65 years at inclusion. Women were followed-up approximately every two years starting in 1990 through self-administered questionnaires. A first investigation focused on the potential association between a personal history of endometriosis or of other benign gynaecological conditions and the risk of melanoma, which was examined in the E 3 N cohort using Cox proportional hazards regression models. A second study explored the potential relationships between cutaneous phenotypic factors associated with melanoma and the risk of endometriosis in the E 3 N cohort, using unconditional logistic regression models. A third investigation used data from the Q-MEGA (an Australian study that followed-up four population-based samples of melanoma patients in Queensland, diagnosed between 1987 and 1995), as well as from the BTNS (a study including adolescent twins and their parents), from which the parents of the twins served as healthy controls in the present investigation. The association between novel naevus-associated gene variants and the site- and subtype-specific risk of melanoma was assessed using unconditional multinomial logistic regression models. Results A significantly positive association was observed between a personal history of endometriosis and the risk of melanoma in the E 3 N cohort, as well as a significantly positive association between a personal history of <b>uterine</b> <b>fibroma</b> and melanoma risk. The association between endometriosis and melanoma was even stronger when restricting to endometriosis reported as treated or diagnosed by laparoscopic surgery. However, a history of ovarian cyst, uterine polyp, breast adenoma/fibro-adenoma or breast fibrocystic disease was not significantly associated with the risk of melanoma. Also, significantly positive dose-effect relationships were found in the E 3 N cohort between the risk of endometriosis and skin sensitivity to sun exposure, number of naevi, and number of freckles, while no significant associations were found with hair or skin colour. Finally, variants of MTAP, PLA 2 G 6 and IRF 4 were significantly associated with the propensity to develop naevi in the Q-MEGA study. There was also a statistically significant association between MTAP rs 10757257 and the risk of melanoma. Although there was no evidence that this association varied according to anatomical site of the tumour, the risk alleles of this polymorphism were more common in patients with superficial spreading melanoma or nodular melanoma than in controls, while patients with melanoma of the lentigo maligna type were no more likely than controls to carry these alleles. In contrast, no association was found between PLA 2 G 6 and IRF 4 variants and the risk of melanoma, globally or by site or type of melanoma. Conclusion The present findings suggest a positive association between endometriosis and melanoma, for which they constitute the strongest evidence to date. This finding may reflect the existence of shared risk factors between endometriosis and melanoma, which is supported by the finding of significant associations between endometriosis and some cutaneous phenotypic traits that are established risk factors for melanoma. Because these traits are mostly genetically determined, it can be speculated that endometriosis and melanoma share similar genetic characteristics. More research will be needed in order to clarify common pathways between endometriosis and melanoma. The finding of a positive association between <b>uterine</b> <b>fibroma</b> and melanoma risk had not been previously reported and warrants further investigation. The presented results also confirm an association between MTAP, PLA 2 G 6 and IRF 4 variants and naevus propensity, as well as an association between MTAP and melanoma. The findings suggest that the relationship is subtype-specific, which confirms and further refines the overarching “divergent pathways” model. Since MTAP is located at the same locus as CDKN 2 A, which has also been associated with naevus counts, further research will be necessary to determine whether these results can be attributed to MTAP independently of CDKN 2 A...|$|E
