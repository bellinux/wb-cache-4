5|$|The Paramhamsa monks, who are loners, are to {{be found}} in deserted houses, in temples, straw huts, on ant hills, sitting <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> on sand beds near rivers, in {{mountain}} caves, near waterfalls, in hollows inside trees, or in wide open fields. The Upanishad states that these loners have advanced far in their path of reaching Brahman – they are pure in mind, they are the Paramahamsas.|$|E
5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted {{by the sound of}} a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E

5|$|Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb {{learn from}} their friend Baljeet that a tool they need for their latest project {{has yet to be}} invented. They and their friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> doing nothing. The boys {{convince}} their future nephews to be active and in return are given the tool they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories of never being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda can see them.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{amounts of}} 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) fell across {{the states of}} Jalisco and Nayarit. This {{rainfall}} caused one fatality in Jalisco after a mudslide fell on 10houses, killing one of the occupants. Five {{people were killed in}} Puebla by landslides, and one more was crushed after a wall on his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while doing roof repairs. In Michoacán, a man was struck by lightning <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> in the outer bands of the storm, and two people died in Hidalgo when the roof collapsed in their house. Hurricane Dean killed 12people in Mexico but remarkably no one was killed by its first (and catastrophically powerful) landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Between the two landfalls damages, focused mainly in the agricultural sector, totaled Mex$2.05billion (US$160million).|$|E
5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> {{to listen to the}} ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E

5|$|The two journey out, {{finding a}} river {{that they were}} unaware of; the couple follow the river and make {{observations}} as they go. While resting <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> the man finds {{the remains of a}} campsite, discovering that the area they were in has been inhabited. Later, they find another campsite and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a decrepit boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down on the woman. Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to observe a bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that they are on the cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean, at {{its second}} landfall, dropped 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) of {{rainfall}} across {{the western states}} of Jalisco and Nayarit. This rainfall trigged a mudslide in Jalisco which fell on 10houses and killed one of the occupants. Landslides in Puebla killed five people, and another was crushed when a wall in his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while repairing his roof. In Michoacán, as the outer bands of the storm swept over the state, a man sheltering <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> was struck by lightning. Two women died in Hidalgo when heavy rain collapsed their house's roof. Another man drowned while trying to cross a rain-swollen river in Tlacolula, Oaxaca. The heavy rains caused dozens of smaller landslides throughout the country, particularly in Veracruz and Tabasco, {{but most of them}} caused no fatalities. At least 50,000houses were damaged to varying degrees throughout the country. Although Dean's rains caused flooding as far inland as Mexico City, where they closed a portion of Puebla-Mexico highway, the damage was concentrated in the states of Quintana Roo and Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
