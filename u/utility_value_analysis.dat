40|$|The {{implementation}} of the green productivity and marketing concept in agribusiness is a must in the future. Food production {{is influenced by the}} environment and society, and vice versa. Today a growing number of consumers are aware of the link between environmental and social well-being and fresh, pure, healthy, tasty and safe foodstuffs. Enterprises will have to consider three important aspects of value when doing business: economic, social and environmental value. The foundation of the quality research this study is concerned with is action research. Action research is a way to analyze sustainable development, the aptness of agriculture and the marketing opportunities these offer for developing ecoproducts in the SMEs. The study seeks to answer the following questions:- What kind of Classical Utility Value Analyses could be tool of the eco-product?- To what extent can a customer/interest group affect the development and decision-making of eco-products?- Is the method a suitable tool for analyzing ecological criterions in the marketing model? Classical <b>Utility</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Analysis</b> is a formal, analytic approach for evaluating and comparing different alternatives. It is one decision making method of multi-criteria analysis. The roots of <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{which is one of the}} mathematical models for analytical decision making, are in the USA and Germany. The method is almost 40 years old, of the same age as the manuscript of the values tradeoff. The same historical language is being used to build up new tools, principles and theory.

40|$|Tooling {{companies}} are challenged today by two major developments: global tooling markets and derivatization. These trends enhance the cost pressure of tooling companies continuously. Due to high manufacturing requirements and {{high costs of}} associated manufacturing resources for tooling companies {{it is necessary to}} focus on these items. Despite of their importance selection processes of manufacturing resources are mostly done on an intuitive basis today. This can result in low manufacturing competitiveness and capital intense unprofitable investments. In contrast to series production there is currently no tooling related academic methodology available that takes technological and economical aspects during the resource selection process into account. Thus this paper introduces a specific and holistic approach for the selection of competitive manufacturing resources in tooling that is completely based on key figures. The presented methodology consists of two steps. The first step is the derivation of a company specific manufacturing concept. In the next step the included machines are detailed. For the derivation of manufacturing concepts a typology is developed in order to consider the technology variety inside a company as well as the resource utilization. Each of the developed concepts contains the chosen manufacturing technology, the number and size of machines as well as the maximum load and the necessary accuracy. To ensure a maximum of objectivity the selection of a manufacturing concept is based on a <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> <b>analysis</b> in combination with a consideration of the necessary investments so that the selection is realized in the area of conflict between utility and costs. The chosen concept is then an input for the next step of the methodology where all contained machines are detailed in terms of manufacturing relevant aspects. For this key figures are used that are derived by an analysis of workpieces that are machined by the company...|$|E
40|$|Background: The use of <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> in {{cost-effectiveness}} <b>analysis</b> is {{an accepted}} method for defining outcomes. Increasingly, cost-effectiveness analyses examine outcomes that involve {{two or more}} health states. There is no accepted method of mathematically combining single health state <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> into a surrogate value that represents the combined health state. Objective: To test the effect of different mathematical approaches to combining single health state <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> into a surrogate value on the cost-effectiveness ratio, in a sample model. Methods: We employed a realistic decision analysis model to test the cost-effectiveness of screening for postpartum thyroiditis. <b>Utility</b> <b>values</b> for type 1 diabetes mellitus and thyroiditis {{were taken from the}} literature and combined using different methods. Results: The surrogate <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> obtained using the multiplicative method were higher than those obtained with the additive method (for example, the state of both type 1 diabetes mellitus and treated thyroiditis had a value of 0. 75 for the multiplicative method versus 0. 73 for the additive method). The resulting cost-effectiveness ratios for the screening strategy were slightly higher, $US 16 000 (1998 values) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), for the multiplicative method when compared to the additive method ($US 14 000 per QALY). This small difference was consistently maintained during sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: All methods of combining utilities resulted in similar values. Until a consensus is reached on the method of choice, researchers should consider using both methods in sensitivity analyses and reporting both sets of results.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the health utility of UI in women as derived from the EQ- 5 D with the gold standard, the Standard Gamble. The {{secondary}} aim of this study was to compare health <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> of affected patients to healthy controls. Materials and Methods: Clinical diagnosis was categorized as normal, stress, mixed or urge urinary incontinence. Healthy controls were read a scenario for stress or mixed UI. All subjects completed the Sandvik Severity Index (SSI), EQ- 5 D, and Standard Gamble (SG) conversation. Results: 50 healthy controls and 119 affected subjects were recruited. The mean <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> for incontinence varied based on method: EQ- 5 D (0. 78 + 0. 17) and SG (0. 85 + 0. 20). There was a significant difference between utility scores derived from SG and EQ- 5 D (p= 0. 0004). This significant difference was maintained in the subset of women with SUI: EQ- 5 D (0. 81 + 0. 16), SG (0. 87 + 0. 18), p= 0. 028; but not in women with MUI or UUI. When comparing healthy controls to women with SUI, there were significant differences in the <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> derived by SG (0. 76 + 0. 26 vs. 0. 87 + 0. 18, p= 0. 07) but not by EQ- 5 D. When comparing healthy controls to women with MUI, there was also a significant difference in the utility derived by SG (0. 92 + 0. 10 vs. 0. 75 + 0. 21, p= 0. 01) but not by EQ- 5 D. SSI scores moderately correlated with SG <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> and strongly correlated with EQ- 5 D <b>utility</b> <b>values.</b> Logistic regression <b>analysis</b> showed that <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> were unaffected by age and menopausal status. Conclusion: This study suggests that using the EQ- 5 D to quantify the utility of UI may over-estimate the degree of bother when compared to SG assessment. This is important because the SG process more closely approximates the decision to undergo surgery. Relying on the EQ- 5 D to assess health utilities in women with UI may not be valid...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to perform a {{reference}} case, cost-utility analysis of initial cataract surgery using the current literature on cataract outcomes and complications. Design: Computer-based econometric modeling. Methods: Visual acuity data of patients treated and observed over a 4 -month postoperative period was obtained from the US National Cataract Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT). The results from this prospective study were combined with other studies that investigated the complication rates of cataract surgery to complete the cohort of patients and outcomes. These synthesized data were incorporated with time-tradeoff <b>utility</b> <b>values,</b> decision <b>analysis,</b> and econometric modeling to account for the time value of money. Main Outcome Measures: The number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was calculated for the study group undergoing cataract extraction in the first eye when the vision was the same in both eyes. This was divided into the cost of the procedure to find the year 2000 nominal US dollars spent per quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY) gained. Results: Initial cataract surgery, compared with observation, resulted in a mean gain of 1. 776 QALYs per patient treated. A 3 % annual discount rate was used to account for the benefit over time, yielding 1. 25 QALYs gained.

MethodsWe searched and reviewed CUAs conducted for pharmaceuticals in Japan, reporting the results as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The databases we used were PubMed, EconLit, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society. The search terms were “QALY” and “Japan” or “cost utility” and “Japan” in the PubMed database, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, and EconLit. In the search on the Japan Medical Abstracts Society database, we used the term “QALY. ”ResultsIn total, 41 CUA articles met the selection criteria and the most common method of obtaining <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> was derived from the published literature (31 CUAs, 168 <b>utility</b> <b>values).</b> Five CUAs were elicited by directly asking the participants regarding their own health state, and four CUAs used “mapping” techniques in which <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> were linked to clinical results.

They {{can be obtained from}} various perspectives and using different methods. The relationship between elicitation methods and perspectives is unknown in prostate cancer. Objective To quantify the difference in <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> comparing three different perspectives and disease-specific health states with a generic preference measure. Then to understand the sensitivity of the disease-specific <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> derived from three perspectives in a CUA model. Methods Disease-specific health states were developed with attributes that varied across five health domains: sexual function, urinary function, bowel function, pain, and emotional well-being. Men with prostate cancer, men at risk for prostate cancer, and a sample from the general population were recruited to value the health states using standard gamble (SG) methodology and to complete the Health Utilities Index (HUI). Disease-specific <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> were modeled in a prostate cancer CUA to assess the sensitivity of the parameter estimate. Results 136 participants (n= 43 prostate cancer; n= 40 at risk, n= 49 general population) completed the study visit. Mean disease-specific <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 0. 46 to 0. 85 for men with prostate cancer, 0. 37 to 0. 75 for men at risk, and 0. 32 to 0. 81 for the general population group. Mean HUI 3 current health ratings: men with prostate cancer HUI 3 : 0. 75 (SD= 0. 260), men at risk HUI 3 : 0. 77 (SD= 0. 238), general population HUI 3 : 0. 84 (SD= 0. 178). There were small differences in <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> comparing between perspectives and between the SG and HUI methods. While the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were high and would not be considered cost-effective, using the perspective of the general population was more cost effective compared to the patient perspective.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Utility</b> <b>values</b> {{have been}} used in the {{ophthalmic}} literature to measure the quality of life associated with a health state. By convention, a <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> of 1. 0 is associated with perfect health, and a value of 0. 0 is associated with death. Construct validity of <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> has been demonstrated, particularly in regard to decreasing <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> as the vision decreases in the better seeing eye, but long-term test-retest reliability has not been demonstrated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to demonstrate the test-retest reliability of ophthalmic <b>utility</b> <b>values.</b> METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients with ophthalmic diseases and stable visual acuity underwent time trade-off utility analysis with retesting at various intervals ranging from 1 month to 2 years. The results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The study was designed to have an 50 % power, using a two-sided alpha of 5 %, to be able to detect a 10 % difference between the test and retest groups. RESULTS: The mean time from testing to retesting was 0. 87 years, with a median time of 1. 0 year and range of 1 month to 2 years. The mean <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> in the test group was 0. 766 (SD =. 21; 95 % CI, 0. 730 - 0. 802), while the mean <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> in the retest group was 0. 763 (SD =. 22; 95 % CI, 0. 724 - 0. 802).

BackgroundThis study was performed to assess renal transplant patient preferences with respect to the acceptance of an additional mortality risk induced by immunosuppressive therapy in order to prevent graft loss in case of acute rejection. MethodsThe two decision analysis tools standard gamble and time trade-off were used to interview 155 patients with a functioning renal graft, and 11 on dialysis awaiting transplantation. ResultsDefining the best possible outcome as being alive with a functioning graft (<b>utility</b> <b>value</b> = 1), and the worst outcome as dying (<b>utility</b> <b>value</b> = 0), median <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> of 0. 68 (0. 59 ± 0. 32, mean ± SD) with standard gamble and of 0. 65 (0. 57 ± 0. 32) with time trade-off were obtained for the intermediate outcome (i. e., staying alive but returning to dialysis). Thirteen percent of the patients attributed a <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> of 0 to this intermediate outcome (i. e., they would rather die than return to dialysis), and 8 % a <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> of 1 (i. e., they would take absolutely no risk from additional antirejection therapy). Individual <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for returning to dialysis correlated with time on dialysis before transplantation (R = 0. 76, P < 0. 005), but no relationship was found between <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> and age, sex, religion, previous methods of dialysis, time with a functioning graft, number of transplantations, or time on the transplantation waiting list. ConclusionThe large interindividual variability of <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> precludes a prediction about the acceptance of a new therapeutic regimen by an individual patient. The assessment of the utility enables, however, a more objective judgment of the general acceptance of any possible risk/benefit ratio induced by a new immunosuppressive regimen in our patient population...|$|R

40|$|Background An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} studies report mapping algorithms which predict EQ- 5 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> using disease specific non-preference-based measures. Yet many mapping algorithms {{have been found}} to systematically overpredict EQ- 5 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health. Currently there are no guidelines {{on how to deal with}} this problem. This paper is concerned with the question of why overestimation of EQ- 5 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> occurs for patients in poor health, and explores possible solutions. Method Three existing datasets are used to estimate mapping algorithms and assess existing mapping algorithms from the literature mapping the cancer-specific EORTC-QLQ C- 30 and the arthritis-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) onto the EQ- 5 D. Separate mapping algorithms are estimated for poor health states. Poor health states are defined using a cut-off point for QLQ-C 30 and HAQ, which is determined using association with EQ- 5 D values. Results All mapping algorithms suffer from overprediction of <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health. The large decrement of reporting 'extreme problems' in the EQ- 5 D tariff, few observations with the most severe level in any EQ- 5 D dimension and many observations at the least severe level in any EQ- 5 D dimension led to a bimodal distribution of EQ- 5 D index values, which is related to the overprediction of <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health. Separate algorithms are here proposed to predict <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health, where these are selected using cut-off points for HAQ-DI (> 2. 0) and QLQ C- 30 (< 45 average of QLQ C- 30 functioning scales). The QLQ-C 30 separate algorithm performed better than existing mapping algorithms for predicting <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health, but still did not accurately predict mean <b>utility</b> <b>values.</b> A HAQ separate algorithm could not be estimated due to data restrictions. Conclusion Mapping algorithms overpredict <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health but are used in cost-effectiveness analyses nonetheless. Guidelines can be developed on when the use of a mapping algorithms is inappropriate, for instance through the identification of cut-off points. Cut-off points on a disease specific questionnaire can be identified through association with the causes of overprediction. The cut-off points found in this study represent severely impaired health. Specifying a separate mapping algorithm to predict <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for individuals in poor health greatly reduces overprediction, but does not fully solve the problem...|$|R

The mean value (SD) of the utility gain was 0. 096 (0. 105) for glaucoma, 0. 101 (0. 105) for comitant strabismus, and 0. 167 (0. 237) for unilateral and 0. 245 (0. 167) for bilateral cataracts, indicating significant postoperative improvements in the <b>utility</b> <b>value.</b> A significant correlation was observed between the <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> and the postoperative VF- 14 scores of the bilateral cataracts, and the postoperative visual acuity of the better eye of the unilateral cataract. The mean value of the quality-adjusted life years was 2. 181 for bilateral and 1. 424 for unilateral cataracts, 1. 132 for strabismus, and 0. 870 for glaucoma with an annual discount rate of 3 %. The gain of <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> was highest in bilateral cataracts, and lowest in glaucoma, and thus the TTO analysis was considered to be highly valid for cataract surgery...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{evaluations}} in wet age-related {{macular degeneration}} (ARMD) is hampered as often <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for solely one eye are used, mostly the better-seeing eye (BSE). Moreover, frequently chosen methods rely on patient values and/or disease specific measures, while economic evaluations prefer generic {{quality of life}} (QoL) measures based on societal preferences. The generic QoL utility instrument EQ- 5 D has shown to be insensitive for differences in visual acuity. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to provide societal <b>utility</b> <b>values,</b> using the generic SF- 6 D, for health states acknowledging both BSE and worse-seeing eye (WSE). SF- 6 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> of 191 ARMD patients (≥ 65 years) with 153 follow-up measures at 1 year were used to fill health states defined by the combination of BSE and WSE using Snellen equivalents; no visual loss (≥ 20 / 40), mild-moderate (20 / 200) and severe (≤ 20 / 200). QoL utilities were estimated for the SF- 6 D, ranging from 0. 740 for ARMD patients without visual loss to 0. 684 for patients with a combination of mild-moderate visual loss in their BSE and severe visual loss in their WSE. Societal <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> are provided for ARMD patients using the generic QoL instrument SF- 6 D for visual acuity health states based on both BSE and WSE. The range of the values is smaller than previous elicited utilities with the disease-specific VisQoL. Besides, the <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> are placed on a more realistic position on the utility scale, and SF- 6 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> avoid the problem associated with the interpretation of disease-specific <b>utility</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives : This study {{describes}} the health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL) of the Portuguese working age population and investigates sociodemographic differences. Methods : Subjects randomly selected from the working age population (n = 2, 459) were assessed using the SF- 36 v 2 and converted into the preference-based SF- 6 D. Results : The mean SF- 6 D <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> was 0. 70 (range 0. 63 – 0. 73). The mean <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> was lower for the lower educational level than for the highest. Women, people living in rural areas and older adults reported lower levels of <b>utility</b> <b>values.</b> Non-parametric tests showed that health <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> were signifi cantly related to employment; unskilled manual workers reported <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> lower than non-manual workers. For different diseases, mean <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 0. 58 (sexual diseases) to 0. 66 (hepatic conditions). Cluster analysis was adopted to classify individuals into three groups according to their answers to the SF- 6 D dimensions. Multinomial logit regression was used to detect sociodemographic characteristics affecting the probability of following each cluster pattern. This study yielded normative data by age and gender for the SF- 6 D. Conclusions: The authors conclude that SF- 6 D is an effective tool for measuring HRQOL in the community so that different population groups can be compared. The preference-based measure used seems to discriminate adequately across sociodemographic differences.

Purpose. The utility evaluation was an effective method to incorporate all of the contributing variables for multiple diseases into one outcome measure. A cross-sectional {{study was conducted to}} assess the <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> associated with varying states of gallstone disease among outpatient clinics participants at a teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Methods. The <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> were measured by using time trade-off method. A total of 120 outpatient clinics participants (30 subjects with no gallstone disease, 30 subjects with single stone, 30 subjects withmultiple stones, and 30 subjects with cholecystectomy) evaluated <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. The diagnosis of gallstone disease was performed by a panel of specialists using ultrasound sonography. Results. The overall mean <b>utility</b> <b>value</b> was 0. 89 ± 0. 13 (95 % CI: 0. 87 – 0. 91) indicating that study participants were willing to trade about 11 % (95 % CI: 9 – 13 %) of their remaining life in return for being free of gallstone disease perpetually. The significant associated factors of <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> based on the multiple linear regression analysis were older age and different degrees of gallstone disease. Conclusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relationship of}} visual acuity loss to quality of life. DESIGN: Three hundred twenty-five patients with visual loss to a minimum of 20 / 40 or greater in at least 1 eye were interviewed in a standardized fashion using a modified VF- 14, questionnaire. <b>Utility</b> <b>values</b> were also obtained using both the time trade-off and standard gamble methods of utility assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity was correlated with the visual function score on the modified VF- 14 questionnaire, {{as well as with}} <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> obtained using both the time trade-off and standard gamble methods. RESULTS: Decreasing levels of vision in the eye with better acuity correlated directly with decreasing visual function scores on the modified VF- 14 questionnaire, as did decreasing <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> using the time trade-off method of utility evaluation. The standard gamble method of utility evaluation was not as directly correlated with vision as the time trade-off method. Age, level of education, gender, race, length of time of visual loss, and the number of associated systemic comorbidities did not significantly affect the time trade-off <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> associated with visual loss in the better eye. The level of reduced vision in the better eye, rather than the specific disease process causing reduced vision, was related to mean <b>utility</b> <b>values.</b> The average person with 20 / 40 vision in the better seeing eye was willing to trade 2 of every 10 years of life in return for perfect vision (<b>utility</b> <b>value</b> of 0. 8), while the average person with counting fingers vision in the better eye was willing to trade approximately 5 of every 10 remaining years of life (<b>utility</b> <b>value</b> of 0. 52) in return for perfect vision. CONCLUSIONS: The time trade-off method of utility evaluation appears to be an effective method for assessing quality of life associated with visual loss. Time trade-off <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> decrease in direct conjunction with decreasing vision in the better-seeing eye. Unlike the modified VF- 14 test and its counterparts, <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> allow the quality of life associated with visual loss to be more readily compared to the quality of life associated with other health (disease) states. This information can be employed for cost-effective analyses that objectively compare evidence-based medicine, patient-based preferences and sound econometric principles across all specialties in health care...|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate the EQ- 5 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> of 639 patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS) in the UK. Methods: Prospective data collected using a standardised pro forma were compared with UK normative data. Relationships between <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> and the clinical and laboratory features of PSS were explored. Results: The proportion of patients with PSS reporting any problem in mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression were 42. 2 %, 16. 7 %, 56. 6 %, 80. 6 % and 49. 4 %, respectively, compared with 5. 4 %, 1. 6 %, 7. 9 %, 30. 2 % and 15. 7 % for the UK general population.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} studies report mapping algorithms which predict EQ- 5 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> using disease specific non-preference-based measures. Yet many mapping algorithms {{have been found}} to systematically overpredict EQ- 5 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health. Currently there are no guidelines {{on how to deal with}} this problem. This paper is concerned with the question of why overestimation of EQ- 5 D <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> occurs for patients in poor health, and explores possible solutions. Method Three existing datasets are used to estimate mapping algorithms and assess existing mapping algorithms from the literature mapping the cancer-specific EORTC-QLQ C- 30 and the arthritis-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) onto the EQ- 5 D. Separate mapping algorithms are estimated for poor health states. Poor health states are defined using a cut-off point for QLQ-C 30 and HAQ, which is determined using association with EQ- 5 D values. Results All mapping algorithms suffer from overprediction of <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health. The large decrement of reporting 'extreme problems' in the EQ- 5 D tariff, few observations with the most severe level in any EQ- 5 D dimension and many observations at the least severe level in any EQ- 5 D dimension led to a bimodal distribution of EQ- 5 D index values, which is related to the overprediction of <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health. Separate algorithms are here proposed to predict <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health, where these are selected using cut-off points for HAQ-DI (> 2. 0) and QLQ C- 30 (Conclusion Mapping algorithms overpredict <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for patients in poor health but are used in cost-effectiveness analyses nonetheless. Guidelines can be developed on when the use of a mapping algorithms is inappropriate, for instance through the identification of cut-off points. Cut-off points on a disease specific questionnaire can be identified through association with the causes of overprediction. The cut-off points found in this study represent severely impaired health. Specifying a separate mapping algorithm to predict <b>utility</b> <b>values</b> for individuals in poor health greatly reduces overprediction, but does not fully solve the problem. </p...|$|R
