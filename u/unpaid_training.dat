25|$|The {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1890s resulted in {{a reduction in the}} size of the colony's permanent artillery. In addition drastic cuts in payments for stores, grants and training also occurred. By the middle of the decade Tasmania's permanent artillery was basically ineffective, having been reduced to just eight men. The colony's artillery holdings the following year were four 12-pounder breech loaded (BL) guns and two 2.5-inch rifled muzzle loaders (RMLs). Despite the lack of government funding, however, between 1895 and 1897 volunteer units held a number of <b>unpaid</b> <b>training</b> camps. In 1897, a reorganisation of Tasmania's infantry saw the creation of the Tasmanian Regiment of Infantry, which was established with three battalions. Government funded training recommenced in 1898 and the following year a mounted infantry force and a medical corps was formed.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} 10 years, {{community}} health workers (CHWs) {{have emerged as}} a focal point of international discussions of primary health-care systems. Although lay community-based health workers have been active for at least 60 years, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000 prompted new discussion of how these workers can help to extend primary health care from facilities to communities. CHWs have since been part of an international attempt to revise primary health-care delivery in low-income settings, and CHW programmes have been changed accordingly. Instead of being regarded as <b>unpaid,</b> lightly <b>trained</b> {{members of the community}} who focus mainly on health education and provide basic treatments, CHWs are increasingly envisioned as a trained and paid corps who give advice and treatments...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{enduring}} problems of equity and access {{in the delivery}} of education in rural Australian schools, vocational education and training (VET) programs appear to have {{had a significant impact on}} many such schools and their communities. Vocational educational programs in Australia are based on structured workplace learning. There are three broad types of VET in Schools programs: 1) those that provide up to 30 days a year of <b>unpaid</b> on-the-job <b>training</b> in the workplace, without contractual arrangement, with the school responsible for all assessment; 2) school-based apprenticeships and traineeships, where students engage in a contract involving paid training with a part-time conventional employer-trainee relationship; and 3) vocational learning programs built on traditional curriculum areas and offering limited workplace experience. These are characteristic of programs in years 9 and 10. Six exemplary programs are described that demonstratd how rural VET in. Schools programs have helped rejuvenate communities, addres...|$|R

40|$|Aims. Little {{is known}} about how the rates and {{characteristics}} of mental health service users in <b>unpaid</b> work, <b>training</b> and study compare with those in paid employment. Methods. From staff report and patient records, 1353 mental health service users of seven Community Mental Health Teams in two London boroughs were categorized as in paid work, unpaid vocational activity or no vocational activity. Types of work were described using Standard Occupational Classifications. The characteristics of each group were reported and associations with vocational status were explored. Results. Of the sample, 5. 5 % were in paid work and 12. 7 % were in unpaid vocational activity, (including 5. 3 % in voluntary work and 8. 1 % in study or training). People in paid work {{were engaged in a}} broader range of occupations than those in voluntary work and most in paid work (58. 5 %) worked part-time. Younger age and high educational attainment characterized both groups. Having sustained previous employment was most strongly associated with being in paid work. Conclusions. Rates of vocational activity were very low. Results did not suggest a clear clinical distinction between those in paid and unpaid activity. The motivations for and functions of unpaid work need further research...|$|R
40|$|Training Opportunities in the Private Sector (TOPS) was a small-scale, {{voluntary}} program operated as {{one among}} many employment-related {{options available to}} recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children in Maine's Work Incentive (WIN) Program. TOPS was distinguished from Maine's other WIN demonstration activities by three program elements. It was a prescribed sequence of activities [...] prevocational <b>training,</b> <b>unpaid</b> work experience, and subsidized on-the-job training, preferably in the private sector. Second, {{it was intended to}} reach harder-to-employ clients. Third, it tended to involve more intensive use of staff time. A comparison of the experiences of an experimental group of TOPS participants with a control group that did not have access to the TOPS sequence indicated that TOPS produced employment and earnings gains that contained throughout the 3 -year follow-up period.

Natural resource professionals expressed some concern about the potential use of trained volunteers in natural resource programming. To evaluate these concerns and provide a more thorough understanding of volunteer activities, a nationwide assessment of state level adult natural resource education programs was conducted. Program managers were asked their opinions regarding the issue of volunteers replacing paid professional staff and the roles of volunteers used in programming.;Results showed that there is very little concern, nationwide, regarding the replacement of paid professional staff with <b>trained</b> <b>unpaid</b> volunteer staff. The assessment found that the volunteers trained by these programs are participating mostly in outreach and educational programming.

500|$|The {{number of}} homes managed by Hill {{continued}} to grow. Although Ruskin had turned against {{her in a}} bout of mental instability, she found a new supporter, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who handed over to her the management of their housing estates in several poor areas of south London. By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, Hill's women workers were no longer <b>unpaid</b> volunteers but <b>trained</b> professionals. Hill's influence spread beyond the properties under her own control. Her ideas were taken up and copied, with her enthusiastic support, in continental Europe and the United States of America. Beatrice Webb said that she [...] "first became aware of the meaning of the poverty of the poor," [...] while staying with her sister, who was a rent collector for Octavia Hill in the East End. Queen Victoria's daughter, Princess Alice of Hesse-Darmstadt, was taken incognito on a tour of some of Hill's properties, and she translated Hill's Homes of the London Poor into German. Among those whom Hill trained was her assistant and secretary, Maud Jeffery, who was later engaged by the Commissioners of Crown Lands to run new housing estates in London on Octavia Hill's lines. Even some local authorities, despite Hill's distrust, followed her model: [...] some of the earliest examples of municipal council housing, at Kensington and Camberwell, were run on her lines, with the acquisition of working class houses, and their gradual improvement, without evictions or demolitions.|$|R
40|$|Background The poor face {{barriers}} in accessing services for tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) disease. A cluster randomised trial {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of engaging unpaid informal providers (IPs) to promote access in a rural district. The intervention consisted of <b>training</b> <b>unpaid</b> IPs in TB and HIV disease recognition, sputum specimen collection, appropriate referrals, and raising community awareness. Methods In total, six clusters were defined in the study areas. Through a pair-matched cluster randomization process, three clusters (average cluster population = 200, 714) were allocated to receive the intervention in the Early arm. Eleven months later the intervention was rolled out to the remaining three clusters (average cluster population = 209, 564) —the Delayed arm. Treatment initiation rates for TB and Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) were the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures included testing rates for TB and HIV. We report {{the results of the}} comparisons between the Early and Delayed arms over the 23 month trial period. Data were obtained from patient registers. Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to express the effectiveness of the intervention as incidence rate ratios (IRR). Results The Early and Delayed clusters were well matched in terms of baseline monthly mean counts and incidence rate ratios for TB and ART treatment initiation. However there were fewer testing and treatment initiation facilities in the Early clusters (TB treatment n = 2, TB testing n = 7, ART initiation n = 3, HIV testing n = 20) than in the Delayed clusters (TB treatment n = 4, TB testing n = 9, ART initiation n = 6, HIV testing n = 18).

Overall there were more HIV testing and treatment centres than TB testing and treatment centres. The IRR was 1. 18 (95 % CI: 0. 903 - 1. 533; p = 0. 112) for TB treatment initiation and 1. 347 (CI: 1. 00 - 1. 694; p = 0. 049) for ART initiation in the first 12 months and the IRR were 0. 552 (95 % CI: 0. 397 - 0. 767; p< 0. 001) and 0. 924 (95 % CI: 0. 369 - 2. 309, p = 0. 863) for TB and ART treatment initiations respectively for the last 11 months. The IRR were 1. 152 (95 % CI: 1. 009 - 1. 359, p = 0. 003) and 1. 61 (95 % CI: 1. 385 - 1. 869, p< 0. 001) for TB and HIV testing uptake respectively in the first 12 months. The IRR was 0. 659 (95 % CI: 0. 441 - 0. 983; p = 0. 023) for TB testing uptake for the last 11 months. We conclude that engagement of unpaid IPs increased TB and HIV testing rates and also increased ART initiation. However, for these providers to be effective in promoting TB treatment initiation, numbers of sites offering TB testing and treatment initiation in rural areas should be increased.
