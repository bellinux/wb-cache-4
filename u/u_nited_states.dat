40|$|Treball de fi de grau en Traducció i InterpretacióSpain {{is one of}} the {{countries}} in the European Union wheire there is neither legislation nor regulation that determines whether individuals acting as cou 11 interpreters are qualified to perfonn their job proficiently or not. Indeed, Spain is one of few cases in which the legality of the profession of court interpreting is not kept in check. Consequently, {{there is no way of}} k:nowing whether a court interpreter is proficient and able to interpret efficiently in a trial or at a police station. TlJUs, an inefficient interpreting task may have negative consequences as a result. This paper analyses the situation of the profession of court interpreters in Spain with a particular emphasis on the status of the profession in comparison with the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, this paper examines the impoirtance of the concep! of professionalization by studying the degree achieved by the profession of court interpreting as obse 1 ved by the different traits from certification to professional organizations.

40|$|Objective: Investigate {{change in}} {{prevalence}} rates for mental {{and substance abuse}} disorders between early and mid-adolescence among a cohort of indigenous adolescents. Method: The data are from a lagged, sequential study of 651 indigenous adolescents from a single culture in the northern Midwest <b>U</b> 0 <b>nited</b> <b>States</b> and Canada. At waves 1 (ages 10 - 12 years) and 4 (ages 13 - 15 years), one adult caretaker and one tribally enrolled adolescent completed a computer-assisted personal interview that included Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Revised assessment for 11 diagnoses. Multivariate analyses investigate effects of wave 1 adolescent diagnosis and wave 1 biological mother diagnosis (University of Michigan Composite International Diagnostic Interview) on wave 4 diagnostic outcomes. Results: The findings show a increase in prevalence rates for substance abuse disorders and conduct disorders between ages 10 and 12 years and 13 and 15 years among indigenous adolescents, with these disorders affecting more than one fourth of the children. The rate of lifetime conduct disorder is about twice that expected in general population studies (23. 4 % versus 5 %- 10 %), {{and the rate of}} lifetime substance abuse disorder (27. 2 %) is three times that reported in the 2004 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (9. 4 %) for individuals 12 years or older. Prevalence rates for any single mental or substance use disorder (44. 8 lifetime) for the 13 - to 15 -year-olds are similar to the lifetime prevalence rates reported in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (46. 4 %) for individuals 18 years and older.

40|$|AbstractBody posture {{recognition}} {{is a very}} important issue as a basis for the detection of users behavior. In this paper, we propose the use of a genetic fuzzy <b>nite</b> <b>state</b> machine for this real-world application. Fuzzy <b>nite</b> <b>state</b> machines (FFSMs) are an extension of classical <b>nite</b> <b>state</b> machines where the states and inputs are dened and calculated by means of a fuzzy inference system, allowing them to handle imprecise and uncertain data. Since the denition of the knowledge base of the fuzzy inference system is a complex task for experts, we use an automatic method for learning this component based on the hybridization of FFSMs and genetic algorithms (GAs). This genetic fuzzy system learns automatically the fuzzy rules and membership functions of the FFSM devoted to body posture recognition while an expert denes the possible states and allowed transitions. We aim to obtain a specic model (FFSM) with the capability of generalizing well under different subjects situations. The obtained model must become an accurate and human friendly linguistic description of this phenomenon, with the capability of identifying the posture of the user. A complete experimentation is developed to test the performance of the new proposal, comprising a detailed analysis of results which shows the advantages of our proposal in comparison with another classical technique.

40|$|A specication {{provides}} a concise {{description of a}} system, {{and can be used}} as both the benchmark against which any implementation is tested, and also as a means to generate tests. Formal specications have potential advantages over informal descriptions because they oer the possibility of reducing the costs of testing by automating part of the testing process. This observation has led to considerable interest in developing test generation techniques from formal specications, and a number of dierent methods have been derived for state based formalisms such as Z, B and VDM. However, after tests have been derived from a formal specication, the specication might be rened further before its implementation, and therefore a mechanism is needed to relate the abstract tests to the rened implementation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide such a method by exploring the relationship between testing and renement. In this paper a model for test generation is used which constructs a <b>nite</b> <b>state</b> machine (FSM) from a Z specication by using a DNF partition analysis of the state and operations.
