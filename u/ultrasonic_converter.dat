40|$|An {{investigation}} {{pertaining to}} contact interaction process {{of a target}} end face of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>converter</b> installed on pendulum suspension with a rigid basis {{is presented in the}} paper. The paper shows that substitution of traditionally applied precision rolling guides by a pendulum suspension of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>converter</b> allows significantly to simplify a process equipment design. A calculative model for contact interaction of an end face of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>converter</b> installed on a pendulum suspension  with a rigid basis and scheme of a mathematical  pendulum  that  corresponds are proposed in the paper and they permit to investigate an influence of pendulum suspension parameters and its loading conditions on the operational mode of an acoustic oscillatory system. The paper contains analytical dependences that make it possible to calculate time and power parameters in contact interaction of a target end face of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>converter</b> installed on a pendulum suspension with a rigid basis. These dependences take into account an amplitude of ultrasonic oscillations, converter weight, pendulum length and an angle of its deviation. The paper reveals that the applica­tion of the pendulum suspension of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>converter</b> allows to ensure a vibrating impact (operational) mode of interaction of a converter target end face with a rigid basis surface. Design variants of the pendulum suspension of the ultra­sonic converter while using various elastic elements are proposed and analyzed in the paper and with due account of concrete processing conditions these variants allow to provide the required value of own oscillation frequency of an acoustic system and also to create necessary value of a preliminary tightness in it. </p...|$|E

40|$|WO 200024468 A UPAB: 20000630 NOVELTY - To control {{targeted}} heat deposit in material, especially biological tissue, {{the heat}} is applied by ultrasonics and a detector registers ultrasonic waves emerging from the material by time or location. An evaluation unit assesses the detected ultrasonic wave leakage {{and the rate of}} change over time against ultrasonic wave reflection from the material, before heat is deposited, to show the structural changes within the material. The energy directed at the material, by time, is set according to the structural material changes and the objective of the therapy. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The reflected ultrasonic waves from the material are caught by a spectral action, and are integrated over the whole frequency range. The time change of the integral value is monitored and, on a deviation from a starting integral, the value derived before material heating is taken as a starting parameter for the formation of gas bubbles within the material. At the start of heat deposition, the start integral is established at a known temp. within the tissue material, as a reference value to register deviations in the integral behavior. After changes in the integral behavior have faded, a parameter is derived for a condition before the biological tissue starts to carbonize internally. At the evaluation unit, the detected ultrasonic waves are converted into a window pattern for each ultrasonic pulse, in a dynamic match against time. The start of each separate window section is in a fixed relationship to the signal development of the detected ultrasonic waves. A direct or indirect spectral comparison is made for each current window section with a previous window section by time, using the same signal development for the same start of the window section. The spectral comparison gives an estimate of the behavior of the coefficient of attenuation by time of the reflected ultrasonic waves corresponding with the detected signals in the separate window sections. The timed behavior of the attenuation coefficients is taken {{as the basis for the}} zonal limit of the structural change within the tissue set by the heat delivery, for control of the energy delivered over time to deposit heat in the tissue. The spectral comparison in the time or frequency range forms differences in the spectral field or establishes spectral shifts. The ultrasonic wave monitor is positioned to receive only ultrasonic waves reflected or scattered from the tissue material. The heat is deposited in the biological tissue by targeted radiation of electromagnetic rays, and preferably laser light or by the application of an electrical alternating field or an ultrasonic wave field. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an apparatus where the ultrasonic wave generator and detector are positioned to cover the same zone, with adjustment in relation to the tissue material being treated. The heat deposit unit is central to the ultrasonic wave generation and detection units, aligned at the tissue material. Preferred Features: The generating and detecting units are positioned on the periphery of a spherical plane, to focus the ultrasonic waves on the tissue. The assembly is contained within a housing (G), placed directly or indirectly on the tissue material, to give a set gap for the transmitter and receiver units, which are in a flat or linear array. The unit to deposit heat is a glass fiber (3), to carry the laser light directly to the tissue material (4) from the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>converter</b> (1). USE - As diagnostic instrument, using ultrasonics to raise the temperature within the tissue area especially for the treatment of tumors and metastasis. It can also be used in the treatment of glaucoma. ADVANTAGE - Apparatus enables effective destruction of targeted tissue cell areas, with minimum damage to surrounding tissue...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{and performance of}} a transistor scanned solid state <b>ultrasonic</b> image <b>converter</b> are described {{and the results of}} investigations into various applicable signal processing techniques to produce visible pictures are presented, The general requirements of an ultrasonic imaging system are considered and this is followed by a critical survey of the more sensitive ultrasonic image conversion methods. The operation and basic performance of the transistor scanned converter are discussed and its resolution and sensitivity investigated, resulting in an apparent practical limit to the resolution in. the image plane of ⅓ mm, and an estimated limiting sensitivity of approximately 10 - 13 W cm- 2. Possible methods for the fabrication of a multielement converter are suggested and discussed. Three signal processing techniques are investigated and compared;;that using an acoustic lens in a conventional camera arrangement, an on-line computer which effectively performs electrically the function of a lens, and a scanned array Doppler system on which only a feasibility study was carried out. It is argued that if flexibility is important then the computer "lens" is the most fitting method, and results for both near field focusing and far field beam deflection are presented) although at the moment. in 1 -dimension only, A relatively simple extension to the program will make 2 -dimensional image reconstruction possible [...] The Doppler system described provides a simple electrical method of determining the range and bearing of far field targets and results adequately confirm the developed theory...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{consider}} time-harmonic {{surface and}} guided elastic waves propagating along periodically corrugated structures. The problems discussed deal with various configurations where the surfaces are sinusoidally - singly or doubly - periodic, {{and the interest}} is focused on investigating {{the roots of the}} dispersion relations and in particular the stopband and cross-over resonances. In all cases the results are presented for varying frequencies, corrugation heights, and, when relevant, angles of propagation. The analyses and results may be applicable in a variety of fields: ultrasonic nondestructive testing and evaluation of materials, <b>ultrasonic</b> devices, mode <b>converters</b> and energy transformation, filters, etc. Firstly, we consider the two-dimensional problem of the periodically corrugated parallel plate with traction-free surfaces. Using the technique based on the Rayleigh hypothesis (also called a modal approach) the dispersion relation for the symmetric Rayleigh-Lamb modes is obtained. The symmetric sinusoidally corrugated plate is studied numerically and the behaviour of the three lowest modes in both stopbands and passbands is closely investigated. The existence and behaviour of surface waves along an infinite, periodically corrugated, cylindrical cavity with traction-free boundary in an elastic medium is next investigated. The dispersion relation is derived by use of both the modal and the formally exact null- field approaches to demonstrate the equivalence of the two techniques. The sinusoidally corrugated cavity is studied numerically, and the dispersion relation is solved for roots on the physical Riemann sheet for the first three modes and on some of the nonphysical sheets for the axially symmetric one. The three-dimensional geometry of a, on both surfaces, double corrugated layer on a half-space is then considered. The dispersion relation for the full problem is derived using the null-field approach. The stopband and passband structure of the physical modes are investigated numerically for two different doubly sinusoidally corrugated geometries. First the Rayleigh-like surface waves that exist when there is no layer are investigated for varying frequency, corrugations heights, and angle of propagation. Afterwards, with the layer present, some of the lowest Love and Rayleigh-Lamb-like waves are studied. In {{the last part of the}} thesis the excitation of generalized Rayleigh waves by a time- harmonic source located below the infinite, doubly periodically corrugated free boundary of an elastic half-space is studied. The full elastodynamic equations are solved using the null-field approach, and the contribution of the surface waves to the total displacement field is obtained for the sinusoidally corrugated geometry with equal periods of corrugation. For different corrugation heights and frequencies and both a vertical and an arbitrarily directed horizontal point force, numerical results are presented for the angular dependence of the surface field far away from the source where the generalised Rayleigh mode contribution dominates...|$|R
