50|$|The Electronic Product Code (EPC) is {{designed}} as a <b>universal</b> <b>identifier</b> that provides a unique identity for every physical object anywhere in the world, for all time. Its structure is defined in the EPCglobal Tag Data Standard http://www.epcglobalinc.org/standards/tds, which is an open standard freely available for download from the website of EPCglobal, Inc.. The canonical representation of an EPC is a URI, namely the 'pure-identity URI' representation that is intended for use when referring to a specific physical object in communications about EPCs among information systems and business application software. The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard also defines additional representations of an EPC identifier, such as the tag-encoding URI format and a compact binary format suitable for storing an EPC identifier efficiently within RFID tags (for which the low-cost passive RFID tags typically have limited memory capacity available for the EPC/UII memory bank). The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard defines {{the structure of the}} URI syntax and binary format, as well as the encoding and decoding rules to allow conversion between these representations. The EPC {{is designed}} as a flexible framework that can support many existing coding schemes, including many coding schemes currently in use with barcode technology. EPC identifiers currently support 7 identification keys from the GS1 system of identifiers, as well as a General Identifier and EPC identifiers {{that can be used for}} encoding supplies to the US Department of Defense.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} and medical organizations {{are not alone}} in grappling with if and/or when too much body fat is actually a “disease.” Many patients and clinicians have the same uncertainties. This is reflected by the attitude of many of the public as well. Many are often resistant to the idea that gaining too much fat is a disease, for a number of reasons. One illustrative example in pop culture would be the Greg Giraldo stand-up comedy bit sampled at length in the Lazyboy song [...] " [...] Underwear Goes Inside the Pants [...] " [...] for the album Lazyboy TV (2004). An excerpt of the publicly disclosed lyrics includes: Americans, let’s face it: We’ve been a spoiled country for a long time.Do you know what the number one health risk in America is?Obesity, obesityThey say we’re {{in the middle of an}} obesity epidemic.An epidemic like its polio.Like we’ll be telling our grandkids about it one day.The Great Obesity Epidemic of 2004.“How’d you get through it grandpa??”“Oh, it was horrible Johnny, but there was cheesecake and pork chops everywhere.”Nobody knows why we’re getting fatter? Look at our lifestyles.I’ll sit at a drive through.I’ll sit there behind fifteen other cars instead of getting up and making the eight foot walk over to the totally empty counter.Everything is mega meal, supersize. You want biggy fries with that, you want a jumbo fry, you wanna go large.You wanna biggie fry,You want thirty burgers for a nickel you fat mother f****r. There’s room in the bag. Take it!You want a 55 gallon drum of coke with that? It’s only three more cents. Given all the problems with medical terms such as overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in describing when excessive body fat is a disease, adiposopathy has emerged as a term that reflects the fact that adipose (fat) tissue is no less capable of being diseased than any other body organ. The addition of the suffix “pathy” to an organ is not only accepted, but an historic <b>universal</b> <b>identifier</b> as to when a body tissue is diseased. Cardiomyopathy describes heart (cardiac) disease; myopathy describes muscle disease; encephalopathy describes brain disease; ophthalmopathy describes eye disease; retinopathy describes eye disease; enteropathy describes intestine disease; nephropathy describes kidney disease; neuropathy describes nerve disease; and dermopathy describes skin disease. Adiposopathy describes the disease of fat cell and fat tissue that frequently occurs with excessive fat weight gain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Oligonucleotide probes {{that are}} {{sequence}} identical {{may have different}} identifiers between manufacturers and even between {{different versions of the}} same company's microarray; and sometimes the same identifier is reused and represents a completely different oligonucleotide, resulting in ambiguity and potentially mis-identification of the genes hybridizing to that probe. Results We have devised a unique, non-degenerate encoding scheme that {{can be used as a}} universal representation to identify an oligonucleotide across manufacturers. We have named the encoded representation 'nuID', for nucleotide <b>universal</b> <b>identifier.</b> Inspired by the fact that the raw sequence of the oligonucleotide is the true definition of identity for a probe, the encoding algorithm uniquely and non-degenerately transforms the sequence itself into a compact identifier (a lossless compression). In addition, we added a redundancy check (checksum) to validate the integrity of the identifier. These two steps, encoding plus checksum, result in an nuID, which is a unique, non-degenerate, permanent, robust and efficient representation of the probe sequence. For commercial applications that require the sequence identity to be confidential, we have an encryption schema for nuID. We demonstrate the utility of nuIDs for the annotation of Illumina microarrays, and we believe it has universal applicability as a source-independent naming convention for oligomers.

40|$|Hopfield Neural Networks {{have been}} used as <b>universal</b> <b>identifiers</b> of {{non-linear}} systems, because of their inherent dynamic properties. However the design decision of the number of neurons in the Hopfield network is not easy to make, in order for the network model to have the necessary complexity, extra neurons are required. This poses a problem since the role of the states that these neurons represent is not clear. Adding a hidden layer in the Hopfield network model increases the complexity of the model without posing the extra states problem. Alternatively breaking the problem down by having different interconnected Hopfield networks modeling each state, also increase the complexity of the problem. A comparison between the three approaches (traditional Hopfield, Hopfield with a hidden layer, and multiple interconnected Hopfield networks) indicates equivalence between the three structures, but with the alternative cases having increased connectivity in the feedback matrix, and limited connectivity in the weight matrices. 1...|$|R

Different ITS solutions require different portfolio of telecommunications service quality. These parameters have to correspond with ITS service performance parameters required by specific service.

40|$|We {{examine how}} the {{conceptual}} model of Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records {{is related to the}} notion of documentary unit attributed to Otlet and present in the Traité de Documentation, whose principles are applied to support the foundations of the Universal Bibliographic Repertory. In theoretical and methodological terms, this is an exploratory research with a historical and documentary nature that seeks to ascertain the classical assumptions of representation and organization of information and relate them to the context of the Semantic Web. We analyze the results of simulations of the application of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records carried out in Acesso Livre à Informação Científica of Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária to illustrate how Otlet's theses are applied to these digital bibliographies. We discuss the advantages of repositories for the modeling processes since the Dublin Core format allows the use of languages such as the Resource Description Framework for the description of metadata, which enhances information retrieval. We conclude by demonstrating how the principles of monograph, continuity and plurality are expressed in the entities in Group I of Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records conceptual model, which reveals methodological affinities between the model and Otlet's theses. We point out that actions directed towards encouraging the description of bibliographic metadata in Resource Description Framework statements will, in the near future, allow each resource to be identified in a meaningful way through a <b>universal</b> <b>identifier</b> - Uniform Resource Identifier -, allowing the database records to be interconnected and access to the user to a huge amount of stored information, as stated by Otlet when developing the Universal Bibliographic Repertory...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{handheld}} gadgets {{are equipped}} with sensors, which enable them to provide different kinds {{of information about the}} people who use them. Various algorithms and techniques use this information in order to provide users with useful and more relevant data and content. Some of these techniques fail to take into account an important element when it comes to human-computer interaction, and that is the current context of the user. Humans are very effective at using implicit situational information or the context to improve the interaction and communication. Applications can utilize contextual information to improve human-computer interaction as well. For the purpose of this study, any information {{that can be used in}} order to describe the situation of an entity relevant to the interaction between user and application is considered context. [1] An application that takes into account this contextual information is referred to as a context-aware application. This study involves a context-aware application that monitors the occupancy of particular places on campus. In particular, we set out to automate monitoring occupancy, a task previously completed manually, in GVSU’s new Mary Idema Pew Library. We installed beacon devices transmitting Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals in two test areas in the library and an additional beacon in our laboratory in Mackinac Hall. We incorporated additional software in an iOS application (Laker Mobile), which is widely used on campus. This new software runs in the background and senses collocated beacons and reports a privacy preserving <b>universal</b> <b>identifier</b> representing that particular iOS device to a network based server that was also implemented as part of this project. Our implementation uses a new technology called iBeacons, introduced by Apple in iOS 7. iBeacons utilize the BLE features that have been included in recent iOS devices, to create context-aware application experiences. Based on the collected data the server can provide real-time information about the population of the monitored areas and a heat map associated with them. Ultimately, this information can be used to help people find less crowded areas to study in the library...|$|E

Such names are known as Unique and <b>Universal</b> <b>Identifiers</b> (UUID) s. UUIDs are used as object identifiers, to distinguish an object from all others. However there are many situations where objects need to be perceived at different levels of abstraction, and must be associated to more than one identifier.
