This study was undertaken to demonstrate the development of a modelling procedure to carry out on-line MSC. The procedure was conducted on spectra of soil samples but could be extended to various agricultural materials. Using <b>Unscrambler</b> (R) software, the partial least-squares (PLS) regression with full cross-validation was performed on 300 soil spectra to establish models for calculating MSC coefficients. The procedure was carried out for all MSC options including full, common offset and amplification MSC. These MSC models developed were incorporated into a custom-built LabVIEW program to enable calculating MSC coefficients during on-line measurement and prediction. The validation of the models developed on 78 separate sample set for all MSC options showed large correlation (coefficient of determination R- 2 > 0. 99) between calculations made on-line using the method developed and corresponding calculations obtained with <b>Unscrambler</b> (R) software. This suggests that the procedure developed for the calculation of MSC coefficients is robust to be adopted for on-line prediction of material properties when MSC is to be used for data pre-processing.

The measured variable values were calibrated to NIR spectral data with partial least squares regression analysis. The multivariate models developed were validated using the full cross validation method and the test set method with a test set size of 50 samples. Statistical analysis of the spectral data was done using the multivariate analysis software <b>Unscrambler</b> 8. 0 (CAMO Inc). The first differential transformation of the NIR region (1100 - 2498 nm) gave good results. The NIRS method predicted well the organic carbon (OC) and amino sugar concentrations in soil (R 2 was 0. 91 for OC and 0. 90 for amino sugar).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Data {{handling}} in {{the field}} of NMR metabolomics has historically been reliant on either in-house mathematical routines or long chains of expensive commercial software. Thus, while the relatively simple biochemical protocols of metabolomics maintain a low barrier to entry, new practitioners of metabolomics experiments are forced to either purchase expensive software packages or craft their own data handling solutions from scratch. This inevitably complicates the standardization and communication of data handling protocols {{in the field}}. We report a newly developed open-source platform for complete NMR metabolomics data handling, MVAPACK, and describe its application on an example metabolic fingerprinting data set. The biochemical procedures involved in metabolomicsexperiments are potentially straightforward and inex-pensive, depending on the biological systems and pathways under study. 1 The minimal sample handling requirements of one-dimensional (1 D) 1 H NMR spectroscopy and the immense sensitivity of multivariate statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) make NMR metabolic fingerprinting especially attainable. This low barrier to entry has no doubt contributed to the rapid growth of the field. Unfortunately, commercial software packages available for multivariate analysis (SIMCA, PLS Toolbox, The <b>Unscrambler,</b> etc.) tend to be expensive and require more software for upstream processing and treatment of spectral data. Furthermore, such packages provide little to no domain-specific functionality, requiring a user to first open and preprocess NMR data in ACD/ 1 D NMR Manager (Advance...|$|E

One {{of the possible}} solution {{to both of them}} is the incineration of household waste to produce heat {{and electricity}}. Incineration is a waste-to-energy treatment process, which can reduce the need for landfills and save the use of more valuable fuels, thereby conserving natural resources. This report/paper investigates the performance and emissions of a municipal solid waste (MSW) fueled industrial boiler by performing a system identification analysis using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS-R) modeling. The boiler is located in Västerås, Sweden and has a maximum capacity of 167 MW. It produces heat and electricity for the city of Västerås and is operated by Mälarenergi AB. A dataset containing 148 different boilers variables, measured with a one hour interval over 2 years, was used for the system identification analysis. The dataset was visually inspected to remove obvious outliers before beginning the analysis using a multivariate data analysis software called The <b>Unscrambler</b> X (Version 10. 3, CAMO Software, Norway). Correlations found using PCA was taken in account during the PLSR modelling where models were created for one response each.

In {{an attempt to}} obtain a method which is both accurate and simple, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and Raman spectra of Chardonnay and Zinfandel grape samples containing 0 to 5 % rot were evaluated using chemometrics. Fresh grapes were used to assemble preparations composed of differing concentrations of moldy grapes, obtained by inoculating individual grape trays with Aspergillus niger, Penicillium italicum, and Rhizopus stolonifer. The resulting grapes were homogenized and the rot homogenate was mixed with sound grapes at 1 to 5 % w/w, homogenized, filtered, and run on the FT 120 Winescan (Foss, Denmark) and Raman spectroscopy (DeltaNu Advantage 532, Laramie, WY, USA). The resulting spectra were imported into <b>Unscrambler</b> 9. 8 (CAMO, Norway) for evaluation. Partial least squares (PLS) regression with full cross-validation of selected ranges across the spectrum mostly resulted in R 2 values greater than 0. 9. These results indicate that FTIR and Raman spectral analysis are promising for objective and simple rot quantification on the sugar stand. In addition, to test {{the efficacy of the}} currently allowed legal limit of 2 % rot in wine grapes applied by the California Winegrape Inspection Advisory Board, discrimination testing of Chardonnay wines containing from none to 5 % w/w rot was conducted.

(1, 2) Here we present a method for the metabolomic analysis of saw palmetto products using NMR spectroscopy and multi-variate analysis in order to determine if there are significant differences in metabolytes of the given products and if marker compounds can be identified. Spectra were obtained on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrophotometer. TOPSPIN was used for spectra acquisition and processing. Deuterated methanol and chloroform were selected as solvents. NMR spectra were transferred to AMIX. The spectra were divided into 251 regions and the signal intensity was integrated. <b>Unscrambler</b> was used for PCA analysis. The analysis showed that saw palmetto products can be grouped according to their metabolic profile. Multi-variate analysis showed significant variations between powders, soft extract and tincture products. The largest variation in any product tested was observed for a hexane extract.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 A sawmill {{is similar}} to other {{manufacturing}} enterprises {{when it comes to}} making decisions, scheduling production and meeting customer demands. In order to help sawmills achieve their goals, and because there is such a high degree of variability in the raw material used in this industry, computer simulation has proven to be a very valuable tool to help improve productivity and processing efficiency. Raw material variability is expected to be an increasing issue in coming years due to an increase in small-diameter timber on the market resulting from the thinning of overstocked forest stands. These changes are expected to result in a significant decrease in production for mills that are not equipped to process this type of material. As a means of analyzing the influence of these changes, this thesis details the development and use of a discrete-event computer simulation model of the Warm Springs Forest Products Industries sawmill in Warm Springs, OR. This research is part of a larger project in which other improvement scenarios were studied (Salichon 2005). The simulation model was first used to identify some possible areas of improvement and to optimize the current overall process and production of the sawmill while operating with its current log distribution. The study identified a number of opportunities for improvement. It was demonstrated that increasing the <b>unscrambler</b> maximum capacity up to 800 boards resulted in an increase in piece count production ranging from 2. 6 to 5. 3 %. The influence of machines downtimes as well as the influence of having a second operator assisting at the horizontal resaw were also investigated. Past studies have shown that log sorting is an essential condition to achieve high production in a sawmill. The simulation model was used to evaluate sorting strategies that would minimize the decrease in production resulting from introducing small-diameter timber (5 to 7 inches) into the log supply. Different small-diameter distributions were tried and different sorting solutions were tested for each of the log distributions. It was shown that the mill would suffer a decrease in piece count production ranging from 10. 1 to 13. 1 % if their current two decks sort is retained. However, it was demonstrated that implementing a three decks sort would considerably reduce this drop in production to only 4. 7 to 6. 4 %. Simulation has been shown to be a very valuable tool that sawmills can use to investigate production and other log supply issues. While piece count production was sufficient for analyzing current mill efficiency changes, the introduction of smaller diameter logs will also reduce the board feet per piece ratio. Due to the loss of the trimmer data during the test run, no information can be provided about board footage and thus the results and statistics in this research were based on piece count only. However, future work could be done with log breakdown models like BOF or SAW 3 D to determine board footage. Future research could also focus on studying the influence of the trimmer's downtimes on the <b>unscrambler</b> queue and other machine utilization rates as well as testing mathematical algorithms that will search for other optimized sorting and feeding strategies...|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} {{research objective}} was to demonstrate the ability of optical fiber spectrometry to determine contamination levels on solid rocket motor cases {{in order to identify}} surface conditions which may result in poor bonds during production. The capability of using the spectral features to identify contaminants with other sensors which might only indicate a potential contamination level provides a real enhancement to current inspection systems such as Optical Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE). The optical fiber probe can easily fit into the same scanning fixtures as the OSEE. The initial data obtained using the Guided Wave Model 260 spectrophotometer was primarily focused on determining spectra of potential contaminants such as HD 2 grease, silicones, etc. However, once we began taking data and applying multivariate analysis techniques, using a program that can handle very large data sets, i. e., <b>Unscrambler</b> 2, it became apparent that the techniques also might provide a nice scientific tool for determining oxidation and chemisorption rates under controlled conditions. As the ultimate power of the technique became recognized, considering that the chemical system which was most frequently studied in this work is water + D 6 AC steel, we became very interested in trying the spectroscopic techniques to solve a broad range of problems. The complexity of the observed spectra for the D 6 AC + water system is due to overlaps between the water peaks, the resulting chemisorbed species, and products of reaction which also contain OH stretching bands.

Peak area of the three cannabinoids obtained from HPLC analysis were then further analyzed using three types of multivariate analyses, which are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Cluster analysis and Soft Independent Modeling Class Analogy (SIMCA) analysis. All multivariate analyses were performed using <b>Unscrambler</b> X 10. 0. Results from these three multivariate analyses were compared to find which is more suited for profiling of illicit cannabis samples. HPLC profiling produced four groupings among fifty six cannabis extracts, these four groups were further sub-grouped by PCA into fifteen groups. Out of these fifteen groups, four main clusters were observed. Cluster analysis was also performed to confirm findings of PCA; results from Cluster analysis also revealed four clusters among the cannabis extracts. SIMCA was unsuccessful in profiling cannabis compared with PCA and Cluster analysis, since it produced different classes among the cannabis extracts. Hence, illicit cannabis samples were successfully profiled using PCA and cluster analysis to reveal the samples originating from different origins...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{precision}} agriculture, rapid, non-destructive, cost-effective {{and convenient}} soil analysis techniques {{are needed for}} soil management, crop quality control using fertilizer, manure and compost, and variable-rate input for soil variability in a field. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy is an effective measurement method for estimating multiple soil properties at once. Methods: The experimental site is a commercial paddy field in lbaraki Prefectural Government, Japan. The experiment was conducted on 5 fields (6. 4 ha) after harvesting for development of multiple local calibration models (MLCM). To develop MLCM, soil samples were collected a total of 100 soil samples from the corresponding scanning positions of Vis-NIR data using Tractor-mounted soil analysing system (SAS). Partial least-squares regression coupled with leave-one-out cross-validation method were used to establish the relationship between Vis-NIR underground soil reflectance spectra captured by SAS and MLCM were obtained through soil analysis. To develop MLCM, the <b>Unscrambler</b> V 9. 8 software was used. We show coefficient of determination (R 2) and residual prediction deviation (RPD). Results: We obtained MLCM based on Vis-NIR underground soil reflectance spectra collected using SAS. The investigated soil properties were moisture content, soil organic matter, pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, total carbon, ammonium nitrogen, hot water exchangeable nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, exchangeable potassium, exchangeable calcium, exchangeable magnesium, hot water soluble soil boron, soluble copper, exchangeable manganese, soluble zinc, available phosphate, C/N ratio, MgO/K 20 ratio, CaO/MgO ratio, lime saturation degree, base saturation degree, phosphate absorption coefficient, exchange acidity, free iron oxide, sodium oxide, available silicate, bulk density, sand, silt and clay. The accuracy of MLCM on leave-one-out cross-validation method was obtained R 2 from 0. 70 to 0. 92 and RPD form 1. 81 to 3. 61. Discussion & conclusion: To get good local calibration model of Exchange acidity, sodium oxide and soluble zinc require addition of new sample data and reanalysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of wheat hardness by {{the evaluation of}} whole wheat grain would be of considerable value to the UK Milling Industry. Until now, accurate whole wheat grain hardness predictions by NIR spectroscopy have only been reported for North American wheats. By the evaluation of selected samples of UK and North American wheats {{this study showed that}} the prediction of whole wheat grain hardness by NTR spectroscopy depends only on the scattering properties of the sample and that there is no direct relationship with chemical composition. The scattering effect, in case of whole wheat grain reflectance and transmittance spectra, was found not to be multiplicative {{as in the case of}} ground wheat grain spectra. Empirical NIR spectroscopy calibrations are often performed without knowing what is measured or understanding the basis of the measurement. In other words the NIR spectrophotometer is often used as a "black box". Empirical calibrations were performed using three different software packages i. e. lnfrasoft International (ISI) Software, NIRSystems Spectral Analysis Software (NSAS) and <b>UNSCRAMBLER.</b> Successful NIR spectroscopy hardness measurements on ground wheat are based on light scattering. Separating the scattering effect from whole wheat grain spectra mathematically allowed predictions not significantly different to empirical calibrations, with the benefit of a theoretical explanation and fewer terms used. Although hardness predictions for whole wheat grain were not as accurate as in the case of ground wheat grain, it did prove to predict hardness with an acceptable accuracy with practical use as screening methods for grain trading. This study did not completely solve the problem of predicting whole wheat grain hardness by NIR spectroscopy, but new insights were provided which would hopefully encourage further work in this area and lead to a more complete fundamental understanding of the properties of whole wheat grain hardness using NIR spectroscopy...|$|E
