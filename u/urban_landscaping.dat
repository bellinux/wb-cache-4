40|$|The <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> of Hong Kong is {{fascinating}} {{with the high}} density development, spectacular skyline and highly efficient public transportation system. The <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> of the CBD of Hong Kong {{is characterized by a}} dense, irregular and organic urban form, building stock of mixed ages, occasional historic buildings and limited vegetation. The new <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> on the shores of Victoria Harbour is characterized by megastructure of super blocks occupying massive areas with podium structures disconnecting the building from the surrounding with high-rise towers on top of it. Review of literature has shown that the pro-growth development and laisse-faire governance approach of the government has led to urban issues such as worsen congestion and demolishment of clusters of culturally significant buildings. There is currently limited research on governance of <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> in Hong Kong. There is currently no research viewing the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> of the city as a single entity for study. This study aims to fill in the research gap by a holistic and comprehensive analysis of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> and assess the governance of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> in Hong Kong. This study aims to understand the governance of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> by identifying the implications of different plans, regulations, and policies in shaping the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> of Hong Kong. An overview of the governance of <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> is provided by reviewing the policies, plans and strategies. In order to assess the governance of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape,</b> the study retrieved data from the Buildings Department to track and trace the development pattern of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> in the past 25 years. The investigation of the development pattern of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> in the CBD between 1991 and 2014 demonstrates the general picture of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape.</b> A more detailed understanding of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> is revealed through two case studies. Strategic plans have been directing the development of the city, setting plans for reclamation works and expansion of CBD. The loose development control framework also brought megastructures to appear in the city. While the inner urban fabric is fragmented by the rapid urban redevelopment, the community network and economy is dismantled. The <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> of Hong Kong becomes denser with skyscrapers blocking the ridgelines and peaks in the backdrop. The cultural, social, and aesthetic values of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> are also important to the sustainable development of the city. In the end of the study, recommendations are provided to facilitate a sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> and improvements in the urban built environment. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|R

40|$|Urbanisation {{typically}} {{results in}} homogenisation of the constituent avifauna, as generalists that {{are able to}} adapt to and persist within the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> replace specialist species whose specific habitat needs are removed. Recently, within some major urban centres, parrots have become a conspicuous component of the avifauna, present in higher abundance in the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> than in the natural environment. This thesis examines the composition and distribution of the parrot community within a large urban centre and evaluates the relative importance of key abiotic and biotic factors that may explain the increase in abundance of urban parrots. I demonstrated that parrot species were present in higher abundance within the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape,</b> compared to natural habitat and that, historically, both drought and wild fire resulted in an influx of some parrot species into the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape.</b> I demonstrated that the standing crop of nectar was consistently higher within streetscapes compared to the non-urban habitat and is capable of sustaining large populations of large-bodied nectarivores. I also demonstrated that trees within the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> produce more flowers and flower for longer than the same species of tree outside the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape.</b> I showed that there were significantly more visitations to hollows by parrots within the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape,</b> compared to forest, as well as significantly more aggressive interactions. My results demonstrate that the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> is capable of sustaining a diverse community of native parrots, particularly nectarivores such as the rainbow lorikeet. The <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> provides food resources in excess of that found in natural habitat, however nesting resources are fewer compared to natural habitat. My research suggest {{that there may be a}} shortage of tree hollows and I discuss how, if the density of parrots continues to increase, there may be a simplification in the current avifauna due to a shortage of breeding resources...|$|R

However, due to its public good nature, it is difficult to monetizing its values in a systematic manner. In this paper, we attempt to assess the economic value of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> through people’s life satisfaction approach utilizing a large sample of dataset complied from the general public survey in Dalian City which is one of the well-known tourism cities in China. The results indicate that most of the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> attributes impose significant effects on people’s life satisfaction, thus accruing a considerable amount of value to the local residents. Taking a 10 -point ranking scale for the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> quality as an example, the household willingness to pay on average reaches ¥ 24, 579 per annum for one point of ranking level increase. Relative to the low level of household income, those high-income households are much keener to the changes of the landscape quality.
