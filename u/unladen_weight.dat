50|$|Individual {{carriers}} often customize {{an existing}} trolley family for their uses. Full size trolleys are generally about 0.3 m wide, 1 m tall, 0.75 m long, and weigh about 25 kg <b>unladen.</b> Lighter <b>weight</b> designs are also available.|$|R
25|$|The T.III's {{alternative}} undercarriages {{were both}} fixed, {{with the two}} legs independent of each, avoiding the cross bracing which would have interfered with the bomb or torpedo release. Each mainwheel was on a horizontal axle supported at the outer end by a longitudinal V-strut from the wing underside. There were two more pairs of Vs, one fixed below the wing {{and the other on}} the lower fuselage, angled towards each other to support the inner end of the axle. A tailskid completed the undercarriage. The T.III's twin float undercarriage projected just forward of the nose. The floats were mounted on the fuselage by two sets of N-struts, with diagonal transverse bracing between them, on each float. Both wood and aluminium floats were available. Fitting floats added 243kg (536lb) to the <b>unladened</b> <b>weight</b> and reduced the maximum speed by 11km/h (7mph).|$|R
50|$|Vehicles (including any cycle with an {{attachment}} for propelling it by mechanical power) not exceeding 400 kilograms in <b>weight</b> <b>unladen</b> adapted {{and used for}} invalids (see invalid carriage).|$|R
25|$|A class 3 {{or class}} 3A licence permits the holder to drive motorcars {{weighing}} less than 3,000kg when unladen and to carry {{no more than}} seven passengers. In addition, the holder may drive a motor tractor or other motor vehicles with an <b>unladen</b> <b>weight</b> of less than 2,500kg. A class 3A licence limits the holder to drive motor vehicles without a clutch pedal, typically automatic transmission cars, whereas a class 3 licence allows the holder to drive all motor vehicles. Class 3A drivers {{are not allowed to}} drive manual transmission cars.|$|E
25|$|The GAU-8 {{was created}} as a {{parallel}} program with the A-X (or Attack Experimental) competition that produced the A-10. The specification for the cannon was laid out in 1970, with General Electric and Philco-Ford offering competing designs. Both of the A-X prototypes, the YA-10 and the Northrop YA-9, were designed to incorporate the weapon, {{although it was not}} available during the initial competition; the M61 Vulcan was used as a temporary replacement. Once completed, the entire GAU-8 assembly (correctly referred to as the A/A 49E-6 Gun System) represents about 16% of the A-10 aircraft's <b>unladen</b> <b>weight.</b> Because the gun plays a significant role in maintaining the A-10's balance and center of gravity, a jack must be installed beneath the airplane's tail whenever the gun is removed for inspection in order to prevent the aircraft from tipping rearwards.|$|E
2500|$|The airframe, largely made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar, weighed 939 pounds (426kg) when empty. With {{the engines}} included, the <b>unladen</b> <b>weight</b> {{of the plane}} was 2250lb (1020.6kg). However, when it was fully loaded before the {{historic}} flight, it weighed 9,694.5 pounds (4,397kg) due to {{the large amount of}} fuel required for the long-distance flight. The aircraft had an estimated lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) of 27. [...] The canard and wing airfoils were custom-designed, and the aircraft was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. [...] Vortex generators were added to the canard to reduce sensitivity to surface contamination.|$|E

2500|$|Dassault's {{resulting}} prototype, dubbed Mirage IV 01, {{looked a}} lot like the Mirage IIIA, even though it had double the wing surface, two engines instead of one, and twice the <b>unladen</b> <b>weight.</b> The Mirage IV also carried three times more internal fuel than the Mirage III. The aircraft's aerodynamic features were very similar to the III's but required an entirely new structure and layout. This prototype was [...] long, had a [...] wingspan, [...] of wing area, and weighed approximately [...] It was considerably more advanced than the Mirage III, incorporating new features such as machined and chem-milled planks, tapered sheets, a small amount of titanium, and integral fuel tanks in many locations including the leading portion of the tailfin.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, {{the toll}} {{for using the}} new {{motorway}} crossing was set at 2s6d (post-decimalisation equivalent £0.125) for all vehicles apart from solo motorcycles which enjoyed a reduced toll of 1s (£0.05). For a small car the bridge toll represented a saving of 7s (£0.35) on the price, at that time 9s 6d (£0.475), of using the ferry crossing. By 1989, the toll had reached £2 each way for goods vehicle having an <b>unladen</b> <b>weight</b> exceeding [...] and passenger vehicles adapted to carry more than 16 passengers and £1 each way for other vehicles. Currency depreciation has been a feature of UK monetary policy in the intervening decades, and the RPI is a widely applied surrogate for the resulting impact of general price inflation: if the Severn toll had increased in line with general inflation since September 1966, when Queen Elizabeth II opened the bridge, the original value of £0.125 would have reached £2.19 each way (or £4.38 one-way) [...]|$|E
