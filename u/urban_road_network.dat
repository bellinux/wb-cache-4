Therefore, pursuing analysis based {{on the distribution of}} node degrees e.g. scale free aspect could not be accomplished in <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks.</b> We have inspected the distribution of degree, betweenness centrality, weighted degree (based on incident link capacities), and alpha weighted degree for eight <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> across the world. These networks are abstracted from Philadelphia (USA), Berlin (Germany), Chicago (USA), Anaheim (USA), Gold Coast (Australia), Birmingham (UK), and Isfahan (Iran). Our results show that although the degree (weighted and unweighted) distributions of these networks are totally different, they all show power law distributions in betweenness centrality. Thus, scale free aspect could be observed in the betweenness centrality distribution. We then analyzed the collapse of network as a result of node removals. The collapse patterns suggest that critical nodes of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> could not be detected solely based on betweenness centrality. Therefore, we conclude that the concept of betweenness centrality in <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> is more of functional merit than topological merit.

Detecting these nodes and securing the traffic flow passing through them would enhance the resilience of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks.</b> Providing redundancy by planning parallel corridors which in case of failure can carry the flow of vital nodes is one example of the actions that can be taken for securing the traffic flow passing through vital nodes. Another example is adopting traffic signal priority strategies. These strategies assign green time to approaches of neighboring intersections of a vital node such that no spill back forms in it. Spill back in vital nodes causes extra delay and possibly gridlock which makes the intersection breakdown. Securing the smooth traffic at these nodes by proper traffic signal priority and other traffic control strategies could assure the fluent traffic flow for a large portion of travelers.|$|R

No methodology is currently available in the scientific literature for measuring <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>network</b> performance, using indicators that combine information about various aspects: the indicators used in the analysis of transport systems assess performance separately from different perspectives. For example, the quality of traffic flow is measured through the Level of Service (HCM, 2010), accessibility performance is assessed through clustering measures (Jiang & Claramunt, 2004) and safety conditions are measured in terms of number of road accidents (Tingvall, Stigson, Eriksson, Johansson, Krafft & Lie, 2010).
