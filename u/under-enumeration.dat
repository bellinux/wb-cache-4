40|$|Inevitably, not {{everyone}} in Scotland was enumerated in the 2001 Census. In Scotland, as {{in the rest of}} the UK, the raw Census figures were adjusted to compensate for the differential levels of <b>under-enumeration</b> that existed between different age-sex groups and areas. This was achieved by the One Number Census project which produced an individual level Census database, with synthetic individuals used to fully adjust for the differential levels of <b>under-enumeration.</b> Census <b>under-enumeration</b> stems from a wide variety of factors – for example demographic, socio-economic and household composition. An accurate identification and measurement of under-enumerated people allows the implementation of initiatives to maximise coverage. For example new designs of the census form can be trialled in households most susceptible to <b>under-enumeration</b> with the aim of making it easier to complete. Therefore this paper seeks to model <b>under-enumeration,</b> by ascertaining the underlying characteristics of under-enumerated areas, determined using the non-response rates. These characteristics are found via logistic regression modelling. Logistic regression analysis controls for all variables simultaneously during modelling and can therefore reveal which factors are significant predictors of the outcome variable in question. The results of the series of logistic regression models show that there are a variety of factors that affect <b>under-enumeration.</b> However, from a strategic viewpoint, an area will be susceptible to <b>under-enumeration</b> if it has a disproportionate number of people who are transient and/or deprived. The deprivation characteristics are income and health deprivation, non-car ownership, overcrowding and multi-occupancy. The transient characteristics are single (never married), young people (aged 25 - 29), living in privately rented accommodation and working in intermediate occupations. Some people – some single mothers, for example – could be construed as being both transient and deprived...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Census Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 places a legal {{obligation}} on everyone in the Country {{to take part in the}} Census, not everyone does. This gives rise to <b>under-enumeration,</b> which is not unique to the Census in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland it is Census policy, in line with arrangements throughout the rest of the UK, that Census estimates should cover the entire population. Accordingly, Census Office is required to address any <b>under-enumeration</b> in the Census by imputing any details that have been missed. This paper outlines how NISRA utilised an administrative Primary Care health activity indicator to supply real demographic information (rather than modelled information) for some of the households who failed to respond to the Census. In addition, it highlights how critical design aspects of the 2011 Census were tailored in order to facilitate the approach, which has attracted considerable interest both nationally and internationally and is considered to have improved the overall quality of the 2011 Census estimates in Northern Ireland...|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{completeness}} of enumeration and visibility of nomads in censuses, Mali {{has made a}} considerable effort, {{even though there was}} probably <b>under-enumeration</b> in each census because of practical difficulties and suspicion of government data collection by a marginalised minority, who in 1998, had only just returned from years in refugee camps in neighbouring countries after persecution by the military and militias in Mali. Visibility is also an issue in the publication of results: in 1976, many tables in the report were broken down by nomade/sédentaire. In 1987 and 1998, there were far fewer tables, largely limited to the age-sex distributions. This itself sends a message about government attitudes to their mobile populations. It is however possible to generate a 30 -year trend of the nomadic population in Mali even if we suspect that there may be considerable undercounting especially in 1987 and 1998 (Figure  1).|$|E
30|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess the degree of <b>under-enumeration</b> of mobile populations in censuses. In most countries, the documentation suggests that considerable effort has been expended on enumerating them and making practical and conceptual adaptations to their mobility to include as many as possible. This is being achieved under very challenging conditions: huge and sparsely populated areas with few roads, small and mobile communities whose members are very likely to be illiterate, conflict zones, {{and a sense of}} marginalisation from the state which continues to be important even if decentralisation and a greater awareness of and potential participation in democratic processes may be giving local populations more incentive to allow themselves to be counted. This detailed review suggests that, for the countries covered here, the situation is better than that outlined by Carr-Hill (2013) and recent improvements suggest that there is some hope for the denominators required by the SDGs.|$|E
30|$|Censuses are not {{the major}} source of data for many {{indicators}} on topics such as mortality, fertility, access to health services and family planning, and there is evidence that not only are mobile pastoralists excluded more systematically from household surveys than from censuses but also, using evidence from Kenya, that pastoral populations are very {{different from the rest of}} the country. In terms of population weight, they may be a very small percentage (see Figure  1) although, given <b>under-enumeration,</b> probably 10 % to 40 % higher than recorded in censuses. This low proportion of the population means, as highlighted in many survey reports, that there would be little or no change in national results if they were included or excluded from the data. However, comparing their characteristics with sedentary populations shows that, in terms of many of the indicators used to measure development, well-being and welfare, 8 they could be classified as seriously disadvantaged.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{visibility}} of enumerated mobile pastoralists across Africa, {{there has been a}} marked improvement in the recent round of censuses since 2010. This {{does not mean that the}} issue of the inevitable mobility-related <b>under-enumeration</b> has been solved and it should always be borne in mind. Ethiopia has undertaken its first complete enumeration of settled and mobile populations and the numbers, and some characteristics of pastoralists can be identified. Tanzania has included all of its population, and a full questionnaire is used for all. Mali has ceased to order pastoralists to congregate in certain areas to be counted. Mobile populations or nomads can be identified in the censuses in most francophone countries, and socio-economic data are available for them, although it is rarely specified what particular characteristics led them to be classified as nomadic; however, it is not possible to identify them easily in Kenya, Tanzania and Burkina Faso. On the other hand, serious doubts have been raised about the validity of the high numbers of nomads/pastoralists enumerated in Sudan (Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre 2010) and in pastoral zones in Kenya (Oparanya 2010).|$|E
30|$|As {{with the}} census however, the DHS {{along with the}} National Statistics Offices with whom they {{collaborate}} have made efforts over recent years to be more inclusive in their representation of pastoral peoples. This is most marked in Kenya but {{is also the case}} in Niger, Ethiopia and Uganda. Given that the sampling frames for the DHS usually depend on the census, there remains a trickle-down effect of any census <b>under-enumeration</b> into surveys. Furthermore, there is rarely any explanation of practical measures used to identify mobile households. Thus, although the pastoral zones are included, it remains quite possible that households which are listed exclude the more mobile just because local authorities and chiefs are not aware of them passing through or do not consider that they belong under their jurisdiction. Mobile households which are listed in the cartography phase may be less likely to be found again at the interview stage - as in Chad 1996 - 7 (Ouagadijo et al. 1998). As an example, the proportion of households completed in the 2011 Ethiopian DHS was lower in Affar and Somali regions than in any other region except Gambela (Central Statistical Agency [Ethiopia] and ICF International 2012 : p. 280).|$|E
40|$|Surveys in China {{conventionally}} {{sample from}} local area residential registers, which until recently {{have been of}} sufficient accuracy to function as de facto population registers. Due {{to a combination of}} large scale internal migration and massive replacement of housing in urban areas, a large fraction of the population currently does not live where registered. Individuals not living where registered are thus ineligible for inclusion in conventionally generated samples. Surveys whose samples depend on access to residential registers are inherently based on an <b>under-enumeration</b> of the population, as well as on a biased representation of the population due to exclusion of unregistered local residents. We report conclusions from, and observations related to, a pilot study designed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a sampling method that does not depend on residential registers. In the pilot we (1) purposively selected small areas; (2) enumerated the small areas; (3) randomly sampled individuals from the enumeration lists; and (4) interviewed sampled individuals. This approach substantially reduced the underenumeration problem. As implemented, however, its point of departure required previously selected small areas.

40|$|Objective: This {{article is}} to {{calculate}} corrected Iran cancer incidence by a novel method to compensate under-ascertainment of cancer cases in the very elderly (aged 65 +). Study Design and Setting: Corrected age-specific rate for a certain cancer in age group 65 + was calculated from the age-specific rate of that cancer in age group 55 - 64 multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from reference cancer registry (sex- and age-specific coefficients from Finnish Cancer Registry, a nation-wide registry with high validity of data). All cancer data were obtained from GLOBOCAN 2002. Results: The crude rate (and number of new cases) for “All sites excluding skin ” was 13. 6 % (men 18. 7 %; women 8. 1 %) under-estimated. The <b>under-enumeration</b> was 18. 9 % for the age-standardized rate (men 25. 4 %; women 11. 8 %). This means there were 58, 000 new cancer cases (about 7, 000 more than original) in 2002. Corrected incidence for the year 2050 was 26. 1 % higher (men 32. 8 %; women 17. 3 %) than the original estimate (49, 000 more). Depending on cancer site and sex, percentage under-estimation varied remarkably. Conclusion: After correction, the estimates of number of new cases and incidence rates of Iran increase substantially. Without correction, cancer occurrence measures can be remarkably under-estimated which may lead to inadequate resource allocation for control measures...|$|E
40|$|Indigenous life {{expectancy}} at birth {{is a key}} indicator proposed to measure the gap in overall health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The Australian Government and all jurisdictions through COAG are committed to “closing the gap ” between Indigenous and non-Indigenous {{life expectancy}} within a generation (25 years or by the year 2031). When this target was established in 2008, the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians was estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to be about 17 years at 2001, the latest estimate available at that time. However, a detailed review of the indirect method used for calculating the gap {{was found to be}} methodologically flawed 1. In response to this review, ABS have used a direct method for Indigenous life expectancy estimates for 2005 - 2007 which have produced significantly higher life expectancy estimates. The gap between Queensland Indigenous males and females and the Australian non-Indigenous population is now estimated to be 10. 4 and 9 years respectively. The estimates were adjusted for Indigenous under-identification in deaths registrations and <b>under-enumeration</b> in population estimates. The rationale for using the direct method was discussed in detail in a discussion paper released by ABS in November 2008 2.

40|$|This article, which {{builds on}} {{previous}} studies published in Business History, documents the largest employers of labour in the Edwardian United Kingdom. It {{provides a more}} comprehensive coverage than hitherto by indicating several important firms which have previously escaped enumeration. More specifically, it demonstrates the neglected importance of several large companies in the coal industry and in metallurgy. With the identification of large employers in Wales, Scotland and the north-east of England, it also redresses an imbalance caused by previous <b>under-enumeration</b> of large firms in 'Outer Britain'. This more comprehensive coverage also contributes to analysis of several aspects of big business in twentieth-century Britain: first, it contributes to analysis of concentration, analysis which can be undertaken for the whole economy or with reference to specific sectors; second, it reveals firms which exhibited economic dynamism, stasis or decline; third, it {{is indicative of the}} impact of internal growth and amalgamation for individual companies; fourth, it discloses many of the firms which would have had recourse to an internal labour market. An international perspective is adopted by comparative analysis of similar developments in Britain's major rivals, the USA and Germany. All told, it sheds important light on both the emergence of big business and the historiography of this phenomenon, reaffirming a revisionist view that British companies were larger and more varied in their activities than previously suggested. ...|$|E
30|$|In 1987 and 1998, Malian census reports’ {{descriptions}} of preliminary work undertaken on nomadic populations are less detailed (République du Mali 1990, 2001). For these censuses, the nomad populations were summoned to points de regroupement. According to a current census office employee (personal communication), it was ‘forced regrouping’ {{although it is}} hard to envisage how this could have been enforced. It is not clear whether people were expected to move there with their entire household, but given the practical problems that would pose, one assumes not. The onus is put on the respondent to turn up to be counted, rather than the enumerator visiting the household. In a politically and economically marginalised population already wary of government activity, one can imagine quite considerable <b>under-enumeration</b> with considerable numbers of people unable to turn up {{for a variety of reasons}} including herding demands. Furthermore, by 1987, some formerly nomadic Tuareg had started to sedentarise and construct mud-brick houses. It is possible that these people, although no longer nomadic, were classified as nomad because their houses would not have been recognised administratively as parts of villages and they would have reported as part of a fraction, in which case the classification of nomade does not necessarily reflect lifestyle. It is also a household-level classification, not individual. Thus, in 1998, when considerable numbers of repatriated Tuareg refugees were in sedentary repatriated communities with a range of housing types including tents, shelters and mud brick, all the members of such households would be classified as sedentary even if some young men were highly mobile with the livestock (Randall and Giuffrida 2006).|$|E
30|$|African mobile pastoralists are {{not only}} {{invisible}} in {{a considerable number of}} statistical sources and indicators, but the nature of their invisibility is often couched in obscurity. <b>Under-enumeration</b> is almost guaranteed even when huge efforts are made to include them in the census. This in itself is not surprising. However, where mobile pastoralists are included in the enumeration and are identifiable, the almost total absence of definitions and criteria means that we have little idea what the actual figures might mean. It becomes difficult to know what place on the mobile-sedentary continuum and pastoralist-other economic activities spectrum the households classified as nomad actually lie. Although there is considerable evidence about the problems and repercussions generated by census categories, {{it is clear from the}} mobile pastoralist case that an absence of categories with their attendant definitions is even more problematic. It can lead to situations with huge, and largely inexplicable, disparities in numbers as exemplified in the abstract of a recent publication on Mali which states ‘In Mali, nomads (Maures, Tuareg and Peulh) constitute about 1.25 million people’ (Ag Ahmed 2015 : my translation). Yet, the Mali census undertaken in 2009 enumerated 133, 084 nomads 9 - a nearly 10 -fold difference. In most countries, there are no clear questions to census respondents which would allow them to classify their lifestyle, and in the only case where simple, appropriate questions were asked, the Niger 1977 census, the data were never published. It seems likely that, in the absence of guidelines and definitions, stereotypes or even personal political agendas held by individual enumerators are likely to influence the way they characterise different households that they encounter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Even after imputation of missing households, the UK's 1991 Census counts were lower than expected. In the 1990 s, the ESRC-funded Estimating with Confidence project (EwC) distributed official non-response data for local authority districts on a small area-specific basis to allow for <b>under-enumeration,</b> timing changes between census day and the mid-year, armed forces adjustments and the transfer of students from home to term-time addresses. The EwC-enhanced census counts became accepted as the 'gold standard' for mid- 1991 small area populations and {{have been widely used}} in academic and government research. Following the 2001 Census, evidence suggested that previous official upward adjustments to 1991 populations were too large. Revisions were retrospectively made to 1991 non-response in England, Wales and Scotland (GB) and to the official annual time-series of local authority (LA) mid-year population estimates. Since data for previous populations are needed for sub-district small areas, this project has revised the original EwC non-response allowances (for small areas across GB) and converted the output to more contemporary geographies (for all of UK including Northern Ireland). As a result, the 1991 EwC small area estimates are now consistent and comparable with the 2001 Census population definition and geography and the 1981 - 2001 official population time-series at LA level across the whole of the UK. These revised UK-coverage small area population estimates resource will underpin late 20 th Century local area social analyses of changes in populations and, for example, changes in health and unemployment rates.

40|$|Black African refugee {{communities}} are {{a relatively recent}} addition to Australia's multicultural landscape. This immigrant group {{has been described as}} one of the most disadvantaged in Australia, requiring high levels of settlement support. Until recently, however, very little was known about the settlement geography of African refugee communities when compared to that of other ethnic minority communities in Australia. The lack of reliable data on population size, spatial distribution and secondary migration has serious implications for policymakers and service providers, who require contemporary, reliable and accurate data to budget, plan and deliver specialised settlement support to these communities. A study of the settlement geography of the eight largest African refugee communities in Southeast Queensland addressed this knowledge gap in that particular geographic location. This article reports on a community-based census, undertaken by Queensland's Burundian community. The results of the community census are compared with data from two of the secondary data sources most commonly used by decision-makers and support services for planning purposes: the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) Settlement Database. The results suggest an <b>under-enumeration</b> of the Burundian community in both secondary data sources, as well as differences in patterns of spatial distribution. This article proposes a community census model, based on the Burundian experience, which is a more culturally appropriate and inexpensive method of collecting these important data from new and emerging communities. Data gathered through the model could be used to supplement existing data collection mechanisms. The model could also be replicated by organisations working with new and emerging communities or implemented by the communities themselves.

40|$|The Russian {{homicide}} rate {{more than tripled}} between 1988 and 1994 and is now {{among the highest in}} the world. This dramatic increase, together with newly available data from a post-Soviet Russian government that is becoming more transparent, has led to a growing number of studies of homicide in Russia. As of yet, however, there has been no systematic evaluation of the homicide reporting systems in the country. This article examines the comparability of the two main sources of homicide estimates in Russia, crime data from the Ministry of the Interior and mortality data from the vital statistics registration system. These estimates are compared annually and by administrative region. Annual estimates from the vital statistics reporting system have reported an average of nearly 40 % more homicides than the crime reporting system over the last decade and a half. Regionally, mortality estimates are higher than crime estimates in 66 of 78 regions, and eight of the 12 regions where crime estimates are higher are in areas where previous validation procedures suggest mortality data are suspect. As the regional {{homicide rate}} increases, so does the gap between the two estimates. Case definitions of these sources lead us to expect small discrepancies between them, but this does not account for the large differences revealed here. Both systems under-report, for different reasons, and some of the <b>under-enumeration</b> in both systems is purposeful and/or results from a lack of human and monetary resources. Mortality data are probably better for most purposes, especially when comparing Russia to other nations and when estimating causal models. Both systems should be used with caution, however, and the choice between them should depend on the nature of each study. Russia Homicide Crime data Vital statistics Registration Validity...|$|E
30|$|<b>Under-enumeration</b> {{of mobile}} peoples in censuses and other data-gathering {{exercises}} {{is not just}} an issue of difficulties in finding them. Mobility may often be part of a deliberate strategy to remain invisible in relation to the state. Although this is particularly the case for people such as illegal migrants, many minority and marginalised populations are justifiably wary {{of the power of the}} state; human rights abuses have, at times, been founded on statistical and census data (Selzer and Anderson 2001). Refusing to respond to the census may be a way of exercising resistance as practised by some First Nations populations in Canada (Guimond et al. 2009). Furthermore, census-type exercises undertaken by colonial administrators in Africa were largely about identifying those who should pay taxes, along with numbers and names of children who could be forcibly taken to school and young men for forced labour. Colonial archives detailing the administrative trips to undertake tax censuses of Tuareg, Maure and Peul mobile pastoralists in Mali commonly describe administrators’ perceptions of the devious ways used by nomads to disappear over the dune when the administrators arrive and French administrators’ perpetual suspicions that both people and livestock had been concealed (Randall 2009). Colonial and post-colonial administration policies have often been counter to the perceived interests of mobile pastoral populations including sedentarisation, forced enrolment in schools, land alienation, inhibition of movement and imposition of barriers and borders. In most countries, except Mauritania and Somalia, pastoralist populations are minorities and rarely have much political power compared to the power held by those from populations and ethnic groups whose dominant production system was sedentary agriculture: those in power, along with actual legislation, usually prioritise dimensions of sedentary lifestyles (Fratkin 2014). Furthermore, many pastoral zones are areas of considerable local and international conflict: Mali and Niger with Tuareg uprisings and Islamist takeover, Chad, Darfur in Sudan, perpetual conflict in South Sudan, Karamoja in Uganda and the numerous conflicts between pastoral groups in northern Kenya including the Somali population. Ethiopia’s pastoral zones are also subject to conflict. Apart from the difficulties of data collection in conflict zones should be added the fear, often justifiable, of providing information which could be misused in the future.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Kiribati is an atoll {{country of}} 103, 058 (2010 Census) {{situated}} in the central Pacific. Previous mortality estimates have been derived from demographic analyses of census data. This is the first mortality analysis based on reported deaths. METHODS: Recorded deaths were from the Ministry of Health and the Civil Registration Office for 2000 - 2009; populations were from the 2000, 2005, and 2010 censuses. Duplicate death records were removed by matching deaths within and between data sources {{using a combination of}} names, date of death, age, sex, island of residence, and cause of death. Probability of dying < 5 years (5 q 0) and 15 - 59 years (45 q 15), and life expectancy (LE) at birth, were computed with 95 % confidence intervals. These data were compared with previous census analyses. RESULTS: There were 8, 681 unique deaths reported over the decade 2000 - 2009 in Kiribati. The reconciled mortality data indicate 5 q 0 for both sexes of 64 per 1, 000 live births in 2000 - 2004, and 51 for 2005 - 2009 (assuming no <b>under-enumeration),</b> compared with 69 and 59 for comparable periods from the 2005 and 2010 census analyses (children ever-born/children surviving method). Based on reconciled deaths, LE at birth (e 0) for males was 54 years for 2000 - 2004 and 55 years in 2005 - 2009, five years lower than the 2005 and 2010 census estimates for comparable periods of 59 and 58 years. Female LE was 62 years for 2000 - 2004 and 63 years for 2005 - 2009, two-three years less than estimates for comparable periods of 63 and 66 years from the 2005 and 2010 census analyses. Adult mortality (45 q 15) was 47 - 48 % in males and 27 - 28 % in females from reconciled mortality over 2000 - 2009, higher than census estimates of 34 - 38 % in males and 21 - 26 % in females for the same periods. The reconciled data are very likely to be incomplete and actual mortality higher and life expectancy lower than reported here. CONCLUSION: This analysis indicates higher mortality than indirect demographic methods from the 2005 and 2010 Censuses. Reported deaths are most likely under-reported; especially 5 q 0, as many early neonatal deaths are probably classified as stillbirths. These analyses suggest that the health situation in Kiribati is more serious and urgent than previously appreciated. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Background: Among the {{available}} data provided by health information systems, data on mortality are commonly used not only as health indicators but also as socioeconomic development indices. Recognizing that in Iran accurate data on causes of death were not available, the Deputy of Health in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOH&ME) established a new comprehensive system for death registration which started in one province (Bushehr) as a pilot in 1997, and was subsequently expanded to include all other provinces, except Tehran province. These data {{can be used to}} investigate {{the nature and extent of}} differences in mortality in Iran. The objective of this paper is to estimate provincial differences in the level of mortality using this death registration system. Methods: Data from the death registration system for 2004 for each province were evaluated for data completeness, and life tables were created for provinces after correction for <b>under-enumeration</b> of death registration. For those provinces where it was not possible to adjust the data on adult deaths by using the Brass Growth Balance method, adult mortality was predicted based on adult literacy using information from provinces with reliable data. Results: Child mortality (risk of a newborn dying before age 5, or q) in 2004 varied between 47 per 1000 live births for both sexes in Sistan and Baluchistan province, and 25 per 1000 live births in Tehran and Gilan provinces. For adults, provincial differences in mortality were much greater for males than females. Adult mortality (risk of dying between ages 15 and 60, or 45 q 15) for females varied between 0. 133 in Kerman province and 0. 117 in Tehran province; for males the range was from 0. 218 in Kerman to 0. 149 in Tehran province. Life expectancy for females was highest in Tehran province (73. 8 years) and lowest in Sistan and Baluchistan (70. 9 years). For males, life expectancy ranged from 65. 7 years in Sistan and Baluchistan province to 70. 9 years in Tehran. Conclusion: Substantial differences in survival exist among the provinces of Iran. While the completeness of the death registration system operated by the Iranian MOH&ME appears to be acceptable in the majority of provinces, further efforts are needed to improve the quality of data on mortality in Iran, and to expand death registration to Tehran province...|$|E

The 2001 Census included an option to ‘write-in’ a Cornish ethnic identity, however whilst accurate in the responses it recorded the result was almost certainly an <b>under-enumeration</b> {{due to the lack of}} a dedicated tick-box selection. This thesis is a rigorous examination of the Cornish, starting with these data, estimating their size and socio-economic position (in terms of social exclusion) relative to non-Cornish individuals. Three stages of primary analysis sought to; analyse, adjust and extend the 2001 Census result to broadly estimate the size, links with exclusion and the causal processes behind these links. Firstly, an accurate picture of the size of the Cornish population was estimated using an innovative weighting strategy, developed to collate all other data referring to the Cornish and to derive weights for application to the raw Census data. Secondly, a stage of primary survey research examined this group more directly for links with social exclusion factors; and thirdly, a stage of qualitative interviews with knowledgeable individuals in the region lent depth to the findings and provided a more coherent explanatory framework. The results indicate that the Cornish are certainly more numerous than the 2001 Census had indicated. The proportion of individuals self-identifying as Cornish is likely to be closer to a quarter of the population rather than the 6. 7 % indicated in the 2001 ii data. There was some discrepancy in the data between the belief amongst the group of social exclusion and the reality. In order to explain the discrepancy, a model was used which explores the difference between personal-level experience and group level discrimination (Taylor et al 1990). The results of this thesis highlight the complex and multi-dimensional processes inherent in, firstly, the methodological and practical process of ethnicity measurement and, secondly, its use as an explanatory variable for social exclusion experience. Overall, this thesis represents the first and most comprehensive examination of the indigenous people of Cornwall and their relative lived experience compared to non-Cornish in the same area.
