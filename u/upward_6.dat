40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} have been performed to test a calculational model for precipitation of NaH in sodium cold traps. The calculational model, called ACTMODEL, is a computer simulation that uses the system geometry and operating conditions as input to calculate a mass-transfer coefficient {{and the distribution of}} NaH in a cold trap. The ACTMODEL was tested using an analytical cold trap (ACT) that is simple and essentially one-dimensional. The ACT flow and temperature profile can be controlled at any desired condition. The ACT was analyzed destructively after each test to measure the actual NaH distribution. Excellent agreement was obtained between the ACTMODEL simulations and the experiments.

A three-dimensional ocean bottom seismometer survey was conducted in 2011 and covered both the extinct spreading ridge and the Zhenbei–Huangyan seamounts chain in the East Sub-basin. The comprehensive seismic record sections of 39 ocean bottom seismometers underline the high-quality data with clear and reliable P-wave seismic first arrivals. The three-dimensional tomographic {{results show that the}} crust is oceanic {{on each side of the}} Zhenbei–Huangyan seamounts chain.

Based on the ratio of volcanic extrusive and intrusive materials and the shape of the <b>upward</b> convex <b>6.</b> 4 [*]km/s iso-velocity curve beneath the Zhenbei and Huangyan seamounts, we conclude that the Zhenbei and Huangyan seamounts appear to be dominantly formed by intra-crustal intrusion.

The average annual incidence in South Korea was 276. 8 persons per 100, 000 population, and a substantial sex-associated variation was observed. The incidence rate among female subjects trended <b>upward</b> over <b>6</b> years, that is, it increased from 501 in 2009 to 625. 8 in 2014 per 100, 000 female population, which indicates a 25 % overall increase.

We have found that (1) the pre-flare morphology of the active region exhibits a strongly sheared arcade seen in Hα and the J-shape filament seen in EUV; (2) energy release and high-energy electron acceleration occur in a sequence along the extensive arcade; (3) the shear angle and the parallel (to the magnetic neutral line) component of the footpoint (FP) distance steadily decrease during the flare process; (4) the radio loop shrinks in length and height during the first emission peak, and later it grows; after the fourth peak the simultaneous descending of the brightest loop and {{formation of a new}} microwave loop at a higher altitude occur; (5) the hard X-ray coronal source is located higher than the microwave loop apex and shows faster <b>upward</b> motion; (<b>6)</b> the first peak on microwave time profiles is present in both the loop top and FP regions.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{a search}} for obesity {{candidate}} genes in a small region of the mouse genome, we noticed that many genes when knocked out influence body weight. To determine whether this was a general feature of gene knockout or a chance occurrence, we surveyed the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Genome Database for knockout mouse strains and their phenotypes. Body weights were not available for all strains so we also obtained body weight information by contacting {{a random sample of}} investigators responsible for a knockout strain. Results We classified each knockout mouse strain as (1) lighter and smaller, (2) larger and heavier, or (3) the same weight, relative to control mice. We excluded knockout strains that died early in life, even though this type of lethality is often associated with a small embryo or reduced body size. Based on a dataset of 1, 977 knockout strains, we found that that 31 % of viable knockout mouse strains weighed less and an additional 3 % weighed more than did controls. Conclusion Body weight is potentially a latent variable in about a third of experiments that use knockout mice and should be considered in interpreting experimental outcomes, e. g., in studies of hypertension, drug and hormone metabolism, organ development, cell proliferation and apoptosis, digestion, heart rate, or atherosclerosis. If we assume that the knockout genes we surveyed are representative then <b>upward</b> of <b>6,</b> 000 genes are predicted to influence the size of a mouse. Body weight is highly heritable, and numerous quantitative trait loci have been mapped in mice, but "multigenic" is an insufficient term for the thousands of loci that could contribute to this complex trait. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConcentrated (40 wt %) {{piperazine}} (PZ) with two-stage flash regeneration is {{an advanced}} second generation amine-based process for CO 2 capture. Two pilot campaigns with the two-stage flash process were completed in 2011 and successfully demonstrated high temperature stripping at 150 °C with concentrated piperazine. Data reconciliation for the absorber with intercooling return spray was completed using Aspen Plus® Data-Fit. Data reconciliation for the two-stage flash with warm rich bypass was completed using Aspen Plus® Data-Fit and a dynamic model developed in MATLAB®. The results of data reconciliation analysis {{found that the}} CO 2 loading in the lean and rich streams needed to be systematically shifted <b>upward,</b> 4. <b>6</b> – 4. 7 % in the stripper analysis and 7. 5 % in the absorber analysis. An analysis of the October 2011 campaign pilot plant data identified the two configurations with the lowest equivalent work as the high temperature two-stage flash with warm rich bypass and low pressure simple stripper. The calculated equivalent work for the two-stage flash with warm rich bypass from raw pilot plant data and reconciled pilot plant data is approximately 35 kJ/mol CO 2 and 36. 6 kJ/mol CO 2, respectively. Intercooling with a spray return improved absorber CO 2 removal performance by 6 – 7 % at the lower gas rates and {{was found to be}} equivalent to a 7 – 20 % increase in packing height based on reconciled data results. Warm rich bypass to the low pressure flash tank reduced piperazine volatility by factor of two in the condensate.

Another group of rats were pre-treated with various drugs (apomorphine, morphine, naltrexone, diazepam, cyproheptadine and clozapine) 30 min prior i. m artemether for 6 consecutive days and the various symptoms were observed in each rat. Finally, rats exhibiting the behavious were subjected to the characteristic 5 -HT testing. At 50 mg kg - 1 x 6 days, artemether induced mild symptoms. At 100 mg kg - 1 x 6 days, artemether induced consistent behavioural symptoms. Pretreatment with various drugs did not suppress the syndrome at day 8, but cyproheptadine and clozapine suppressed the syndrome significantly at day 6. Behavioural testing also confirmed the characteristic 5 -HT syndrome in rats exhibiting the symptoms.

Recent {{studies have found that}} students who spend <b>upward</b> of <b>6</b> hours a day in a desk, can suffer from severe conditions such as lack of blood circulation and an increase of pressure on the spinal cord. Long term pressure can cause abnormal spine alignment (scoliosis), Injury in the spine, Spinal tumors, Certain Bone diseases, Rheumatoid arthritis, and infections. Our goal is to solve problems created by the average school desk to increase learning and overall health in students. (Said, Day, L. How Seating Ergonomics Affect Learning. [URL] 2014.) 3 / 5 students on a national survey report problems due to their sitting circumstances. We created a survey in order to narrow down where students felt the most inconvenienced in their desks. The results were: 11 / 32 students say the chair needs to be changed, 19 / 32 say it is all around uncomfortable, and 22 / 32 say that the desk needs to be bigger. The objective in this scenario is to make the average school desk a more compatible fit for a learning environment. Through the use of surveys and personal interviews we have narrowed down our investigation to the following areas: Seat of desk, Back of desk, and the incline that {{the back of the seat}} rests at. We have begun to build our prototype to counteract these problems. We plan to change the angle of ascent that the seat and back connect at to decrease pressure on the spinal cord, making an adjustable desk to fit to different size students, and making an overall better quality desk so that it can last longer and therefore save money. Our design will decrease spinal pressure by limiting the downward force of gravity on the spine due to an increase of force in the horizontal direction and decrease in the vertical direction. We will measure the pressure with a pressure plate on the coccyx to see if our desk causes a decrease.

Changes over time in the availability of credit to households can explain 90 % of the variance of the saving rate since the mid- 1960 s, including the recent uptrend, according to a simple empirical model.

Shallow subtidal limestones consisting of floatstones and rudstones interbedded with packstones and wackestones comprise most of the Arcs Member. Arcs strata consist of at least 4 depositional cycles and represent a shallowing upward sequence from outer shallow slope fossiliferous limestones to back reef lagoonal grainstones.

40|$|Hypothesis: In this study, {{we aim to}} {{test whether}} {{scapular}} winging results in {{a significant change in}} glenohumeral translation in the initial phase of the throwing motion. Methods: Six shoulders underwent an abbreviated throwing motion (ATM) from late cocking to the end of acceleration by use of a validated robotic system. The intact specimens were tested to establish a baseline. The position of the scapula was then affected to simulate scapular winging by placing a cylindrical wedge under the inferior angle of the scapula, and the ATM was performed again. For both conditions, the average glenohumeral translations and scapular rotations were plotted over time to calculate the area under the curve, {{as a representative of the}} overall glenohumeral translations and scapular rotations observed during the ATM. Results: Throughout the motion, the winged scapulae showed, on average, 7. 7 ° more <b>upward</b> rotation, 1. <b>6</b> ° more internal rotation, and 5. 3 ° more anterior tipping as compared with the baseline. The scapular position relative to the hanging arm was significantly different between the baseline and scapular winging conditions in all arm positions, except for maximal external rotation and the neutral position. Comparing the area under the curve at baseline and with scapular winging indicated that scapular winging significantly increased anterior translation of the glenohumeral joint whereas translation in the superior/inferior and medial/lateral directions did not result in a change in translation. Discussion: These results may suggest a more important role of abnormalities in scapular position in predisposing throwing athletes to shoulder injuries of the anterior capsulolabral structures and consecutive glenohumeral instability.

Reflex threshold is reached at 6 to 12 per cent maximal afferent input. From threshold to maximal input the relation between input and amount of output is essentially linear, latency on the average decreases, the shorter central paths in general gain preference, but the known minimum pathway, one of three neurons, does not transmit unless aided by convergent activity. Flexor reflex discharge may occur in several bursts suggesting the existence of closed chain connections in the internuncial pools of the spinal cord. At any given input there is, in successively elicited reflexes, little correlation between latency and amount of discharge, at first sight a surprising result for each variable can be taken as a measure of excitability status of the motoneurou population. However, latency of discharge indicates excitability {{at the beginning of the}} reflex event whereas amount of discharge is an expression of excitability over the entire period of discharge. Given a constantly and rapidly fluctuating excitability absence of correlation between these variables would be an anticipated result.

40|$|The {{southern}} Sierra Nevada {{offers an}} oblique section through young Cordilleran-type batholith generated crust spanning surface (volcanic) to deep (granulitic) levels. Regional mapping and Pb/U zircon geochronology reveal structural continuity through this crustal section for volcanic, plutonic and metamorphic assemblages developed at ~ 100 Ma, {{making it one}} of the youngest sections in the world. Construction of a synthetic cross-section is well-constrained by the oblique section map pattern, abundant age data, and a published crustal structure section that was based on geophysical and lower crustal xenolith data from across the shallow levels of the batholith. The synthetic cross-section depicts the state of the sialic crustal section during its ~ 100 Ma petrogenesis. Critical features of the section are as follows: (1) Much of the pre-Cretaceous crust was completely reconstituted by batholith generation; (2) Major influxes of mantle-derived tonalitic to gabbroic magmas drove crustal-level melting and magma mixing; (3) Pre-existing sialic components within the batholithic magmas were contributed primarily from partial to complete melts of craton derived metasedimentary material; (4) Silicic magmas emplaced at shallow crustal levels represent moderately to well-mixed and fractionated systems, while those frozen at deeper levels appear to be more heterogeneous both lithologically and geochemically; (5) Granulite facies metamorphic assemblages in the deep crustal rocks developed primarily in a retrograde regime descending from gabbro and tonalite solidus conditions; (<b>6)</b> <b>Upward</b> rise of silicic magmas was accompanied by downward return flow of metamorphic host rocks, and locally ignimbrite sections of only slightly older age than enclosing plutons were transported to considerable depth as well; (7) Much of the upper crust responded to the intrusion of silicic magmas by large-scale extension which also promoted major ignimbrite eruptions; and (8) Within the deeper levels of the composite batholith and off its flanks, at moderate to shallow crustal levels, low-angle detachments may have developed as a primary structural feature.

40|$|Energy {{users are}} {{investing}} in solar panels, batteries and smart-home energy systems. New technology is creating both new opportunities and new needs. New opportunities arise when users are empowered to respond to market signals. New needs arise when network topology is transforming. Decentralized renewable energy, electric vehicles, and storage are {{changing the face of}} electricity distribution networks. Taking advantage of new opportunities means opening the market to all participants. Making the best use of decentralized resources means identifying decentralized network needs and constraints. This dissertation is divided into two main parts to study the coordination of demand response -user participation- procurement. The first part studies the integration of demand response into the wholesale market design. The second part analyses local network needs and studies how user participation can be coordinated to provide local flexibility services. The integration of demand response into the wholesale electricity market is studied in Part I of the thesis. Demand response needs to be aggregated to make a difference at a wholesale market level. The aggregation of demand poses challenges to market design regarding interactions between actors, procurement procedures and remuneration mechanisms. What’s more, aggregation has effects on current market participants. The aggregator trades flexibility provided by consumers who already have contracts with retailers. These retailers foresee needs of their customers and trade energy accordingly. When a third party, the aggregator, is also making decisions on their forecasted load, conflicts arise. The exact nature of these conflicts is explored in detail. It is found that when consumers are asked to modify their consumption patterns at one hour, they are likely {{to make up for it}} at a later hour. This is defined as the rebound effect. Aggregators impact balancing responsible parties (BRPs) on two main levels: market profits and retail profits. Proposals for transfer payments from the aggregator to the BRP to solve these conflicts are modelled using an empirical approach. The BRP is modelled as a portfolio owner of generation and load. The aggregator supplies demand response flexibility to the market during the best possible hours as a result of an optimization. It is found that demand response will be deployed as long as the transfer payment is less than the peak and off-peak market price. Demand response has an arbitraging effect in the market therefore can be profitable for the party attributed balancing responsibility. Part II of the dissertation is aimed at reaping the possibilities of demand response at a local level. While the focus of Part I is geared towards wholesale market benefits, the focus of Part II is in using flexibility to deal with grid issues and avoid network reinforcements. It is found in current literature and ongoing projects that there is no consensus on a framework design for the procurement of local flexibility. The transmission system operator, the distribution system operator (DSO), an independent aggregator, and a third party actor have all been proposed as local market operators. A method is proposed to analyze the need that can be fulfilled by local flexibility in the distribution system. Demand and price criteria for flexibility services are defined from the point of view of the DSO. The value of flexibility to the DSO is defined by an analysis of the savings achieved by avoiding grid reinforcements. Congestion in the distribution grid is chosen a use-case to test the methodology. A first case is studied where the DSO procures flexibility directly at cost-value in order to avoid network reinforcements. It is found that flexibility use can save up to two thirds of the cost of grid reinforcements for the DSO compared to the case without flexibility. A second case is studied where a profit maximizing making aggregator is introduced. In this case, the DSO competes with a BRP for the flexibility resources that would solve its problems in the grid. A quantity demanded and a valuation of flexibility for the BRP is proposed. The BRP needs flexibility to cover deviations in its short term to intraday renewable energy profiles. The BRP is willing to pay for flexibility as long as it costs less than the balancing penalties it would otherwise incur. The two actors, DSO and BRP, have different decision horizons. The DSO needs to make a decision to buy flexibility or reinforce the network in advance, while the BRP needs flexibility on an almost real-time horizon. The aggregator needs to make the decision of who to sell to in advance, so the market is bilaterally organized. It is shown that as the DSO’s willingness to pay is higher than the BRP’s most of the time, so it wins the bid for most of the available flexibility with respect to the BRP. There is still a long way to travel for users to deliberately affect the functioning of electricity markets and grids. This dissertation opens up a discussion on a whole scale and a local level in an effort to exploit different possible uses of flexibilityContents Abstract i Contents xvii List of Figures xix List of Tables xxi 1 Introduction 1 1. 1 Smart Grid Context: Changing Electricity Production and Consumption............................ 1 1. 2 Thesis Motivation: Challenges to Integrate Demand Response into Electricity Markets...................... 4 1. 3 System Impact of New Technologies............... 4 1. 3. 1 Variable Generation.................... 4 1. 3. 2 Evolving Load Patterns.................. 6 1. 3. 3 Commercial Solutions................... 7 1. 4 Local Impact of New Technologies................ 8 1. 5 Research Objective: Market Coordination Mechanisms..... 9 1. 6 Thesis Outline........................... 10 2 Demand Response in the Wholesale Market 15 2. 1 Definition of Flexibility and Demand Response......... 17 2. 2 Key Aspects of Electricity Market Design............ 18 2. 2. 1 Temporal.......................... 18 2. 2. 2 Market Clearing: Price Formation............ 20 2. 2. 3 Spatial............................ 21 2. 2. 4 Contractual......................... 22 2. 2. 5 Reference Day-Ahead Wholesale Market Design..... 23 2. 3 Demand Response Integration................... 23 2. 3. 1 Timeline of Contracting and Operation of Demand Response 25 2. 3. 2 Benefit of Demand Response in the Wholesale Market. 26 2. 4 Remuneration of Demand Response in Wholesale Markets... 29 2. 4. 1 The LMP -
