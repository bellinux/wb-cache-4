30|$|In {{order to}} study the <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> effect in {{geological}} bedding strata for the Muzhailing tunnel on the Lanzhou-Chongqing passenger dedicated line in China, we investigated the deformation, mechanical response and pressure of the surrounding rock and the mechanical characteristics of bolts of the tunnel. The results suggest that open zones appear at arch and invert where joints open up, when layered stratum is horizontal, or when the dip angle of inclined bedding is small. Open zones occur perpendicular to a joint. The failure mode is bending disjunction at the arch. What’s more, with the dip angle increasing, tunnel excavating would induce shear zones where joints experience a certain shear displacement, and lead to obvious geological bedding <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>load.</b> The failure mode is shear damage. For the joint dip angle {{in the range of}} 75 – 90 °, the failure mode is flexural crushing at the wall and vertical shear rupture above the arch. The restraining effect of two sides weakens for vertical dip. On the whole, shear failure instability trend would occur and the tunnel collapses evenly. When the angle between the bolt and structure plane is greater than 23 °, bolts can enhance the shearing stiffness of joint plane. Unfortunately, in the general purpose graph of tunnel for 250 km/h of passenger dedicated lines, the bolts have equal length and spacing. The rationale behind this is worthy of further study. For inclined bedding, the surrounding rock pressure at the left wall is more than that at the right wall. In addition, lining is likely to be damaged at left shoulder and side wall. With the dip angle increasing, the <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> gradually achieves symmetry. Asymmetry design for support is recommended to reduce the <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> on lining disturbed by excavation.|$|E

This paper carries out construction monitoring and numerical simulation analysis and gives a detailed study on the influenced factors of support structure deformation. Calculation results show that subgrade <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> has a great influence on deep horizontal deformation of supporting piles. The maximum horizontal displacement at the bias side is about three times more than non-bias side’s; when the distance of subgrade to foundation pit {{is the same as}} the depth of excavation, the influence of subgrade on pit can be ignored; as the cohesion and internal friction angle increases, the horizontal displacement of fender piles decreases.

Significant progress has been made in recent years in devising a relatively realistic set of representative pressures for this load case. However, the consequences these may have on the predicted structural behavior of a silo are not yet fully understood. This paper presents a detailed parametric study into the behavior of a custom-designed slender silo under a set of unsymmetrical pressures describing the action of an eccentric parallel-sided pipe flow channel of varying cross-sectional areas. The results are compared with the reference axisymmetric case of concentric discharge. It is found that the predicted behavior is very complex indeed, and that geometric nonlinearity is of much greater significance for cylindrical shells under <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> patterns than under symmetrical patterns. Further, it is found that eigenmodeaffine imperfections, which are very deleterious under axisymmetric loading patterns, are instead beneficial to the buckling strength of a silo under eccentric discharge, thus making them unsuitable for use in design for this load condition.. 0000530. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

The extreme vulnerability of these structures was frequently assessed after recent earthquakes, when {{a significant number}} of single-leaf vaults collapsed, regardless of the earthquake intensity and of the level of the structure global damage; and highlights the need for structural strengthening interventions. In this paper, the vault seismic vulnerability is discussed {{based on the results of}} an experimental study on the behaviour of a single-leaf vault subjected to cyclic unsymmetrical loads. A special testing bench is adopted, which allows tilting the specimen both clockwise and counter-clockwise. In the tilted position, each vault segment is subjected to both relative vertical and horizontal forces, corresponding to the gravity load force components evaluated along and normal to the tilted axis. The resulting load distribution simulates the seismic action acting on the vault ring.

40|$|Multilevel {{converters}} {{have seen}} an increasing popularity {{in the last years}} for medium- and high-voltage applications. The most popular has been the three-level neutral clamped converter and still research is going on to improve the control of it. This master thesis was a continuation of the specialization project fall 2009. The main topics of current thesis were to further investigate the DC-bus balancing issues, compare symmetrical (one sampling per triangular wave) and asymmetrical (sampling at {{the top and bottom of}} the triangular wave) modulation, derive current equations for Space Vector and Double-Signal, improve output voltage in overmodulation and be able to DC-bus balance, and to implement the methods in the laboratory. Models of the three-level converter were made in the specialization project in both PSCAD and SIMULINK and further studies of the DC-bus balance were also made in this master thesis. None of the methods showed problems to regulate the DC-bus voltage when there was different capacitor values and <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>load.</b> A PI controller was introduced for Space Vector but it did not show better performance than a regular P regulator. Asymmetrical modulation showed a clearly better performance than symmetrical modulation when the switching frequency was low compared to the fundamental frequency, especially for Space Vector. The 1 st harmonic line-to-line voltage was closer to the wanted value and the THDi was significantly lower. Simulations also showed that the THDi can vary significantly depending on at which angle the first sampling is done. This is most clear for asymmetrical Space Vector modulation, but also for the other cases this pattern occurs. By implementing an overmodulation algorithm the amplitude of the 1 st harmonic output voltage was closer to what was desired. Simulations showed how important it was to have three phase sampling symmetry in overmodulation. By having a wrong switching frequency the line-to-line output voltage dropped down to 2. 06 when operating in six-step, when the wanted output value should be 2. 205. Hence there is a quite large mismatch and the converter is sensitive to the switching frequency when it is operating in the higher modulation area. The balancing algorithm introduced for overmodulation is able to remove an initial offset without a notable change the 1 st harmonic output. Both Space Vector and Double-Signal were tested in the laboratory with two separated DC-sources. Asymmetrical and Symmetrical modulation were tested and so was also overmodulation. The laboratory results confirmed the simulated results, but since the switching was not synchronized in the laboratory, some errors occurred. </p...|$|E

The model is meant to represent the generator part of the rotary converter used in the Norwegian traction power system (supplying railway). Its function is to convert the 50 Hz frequency of the main grid into 16 2 / 3 Hz which is the standard frequency of the traction grid in Norway. The chosen method of modelling is inspired by previous work on this matter.

For {{orthotropic}} {{steel bridge}} deck (OSD), principle tensile stresses {{near the end}} of joint of crossbeam web and longitudinal rib and at the edge of crossbeam cutout are dependent on the shape of crossbeam cutout to a great extent. They are results of many factors, among which bending-shearing effect and in-plane supporting effect are in-plane factors, <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>loading</b> effect and relative longitudinal deformation effect are out-of-plane factors. Comparison study on stresses at some fatigue sensitive regions of orthotropic steel deck with six types of crossbeam web cutout indicates that the top height of cutouts determines the distance between the end of joint and the neutral axis, which affects the bending effect seriously, and the area of cutouts determines the shearing effect. When OSD system is affected by bending-shearing effect, increasing the top height decreases the principle tensile stresses {{near the end of}} joint but increases the stresses at the edge of cutout, and increasing the area increases the principle tensile stresses both near the end and at the edge of cutout. When the top height of cutouts increases, the contact area between crossbeam web drops, then the principle tensile stresses near the joint produced by in-plane supporting effect increases. When the side width of cutouts increases, the constraint effect of the crossbeam web to longitudinal rib decreases, then the principle tensile stresses near the joint produced by out-of-plane effects decreases. Generally, OSD system with stiff cutouts behaves well when affected by in-plane effects, and OSD system with flexible cutouts behaves well when affected by out-of-plane effects...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose a new method that improves the existing analysis techniques. In this sense, the solar sail is modelled using distributed sail-boom connections, and its structural behavior in free flight is studied, using the inertia relief method, at different incidence angles of the incoming solar radiation. The proposed approach is able to circumvent the onset of numerical convergence problems by means of suitable strategies. A non-linear analysis is carried out starting from an initial geometrical configuration in which the whole solar sail is perturbed using a linear combination of the first global buckling modes, obtained with a static eigenvalue analysis. Key points of the procedure are the application of a correct sail pre-stress, a clever choice of the type of elements to be used in the finite element analysis and the use of a suitable mesh refinement. The performance of the new approach have been successfully tested on square solar sails with side length varying from relatively small to medium-large sizes, in the range 10 m - 100 m. A detailed analysis is presented for a reference 20 m x 20 m square solar sail, where the paper shows that the suggested procedure is able to guarantee accurate results without the need of additional stabilization technique.

Two types of 2 -D and 3 -D arch models were studied which had the same geometry but different in the addition of spandrel walls. The 3 -D models were built with spandrel walls but without any wing walls or parapet. Both 2 -D and 3 -D arch models were tested under rolling and failure loads. The models were usually tested with fourteen passes of a rolling load and then up to the observation of first signs of failure {{to enable them to}} be suitable for applying a repair method. The repaired models were tested using the same procedure but up to the full failure load. To understand the behaviour of the arch models under <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>loads</b> different roller weights were applied at different positions. The arch deflection and the soil/masonry interaction in arch extrados were measured in all the tests and compared with each other. Plastic mesh reinforcement, stitching, and concrete slab on top of the soil backfill were applied as repair methods to the 2 -D arch models. A review of the results has shown an increase in arch stiffness, decrease in deflections and a significant improvement in the ultimate load carrying capacity. A significant effect on the pressure distribution on the arch barrel was observed due to the application of the concrete slab on top of the backfill. Stitching of arch barrel and the barrel to the spandrels, applying partial saddle concrete and strengthening of spandrel wall using reinforced concrete were tested in the 3 -D arch models.

40|$|Due to the {{substantial}} increase in oil and gas activities in Polar areas the demand for ice strengthen vessel has increased greatly. This increase in demand has highlighted the importance of designing ice strengthened ship structures that are more producible and maintain adequate safety and integrity. In order to encounter these new challenges, the international association of classification societies (IACS) has developed unified regulations for the designing of ice strengthened ship. In addition to these requirements, most of the classification societies have their regulation for design of polar ships. Stiffened plates are the basic structural building blocks of ships. So, the study mainly explores the plastic response of stiffened plate subject to lateral ice loads. The Non Linear Finite Element Method (NLFEM) is extensively used to study the plastic behavior of stiffened plates. The Abaqus non linear finite element program is used in this study. The aims of the study are to investigate {{the validity of the}} limit state equation employed in the IACS new Unified Requirements for Polar Ships [6], investigate the membrane effect at large deformation, determine the ALS design load, and assess limit loads when fracture in plating likely to take place. The study also focuses on the warping effect of unsymmetrical sections and the effect of end brackets on the lateral load carrying capacity of the stiffener. The effect of mid-span tripping bracket on the load deflection behavior of L and T stiffeners is also studied. In particular, the study focuses on the behavior of inclined T and L stiffener. As ships move forward by crushing ice, sides of ships bow come across with ice initially. To design ice strengthen vessel, it s very important to understand the behavior of ships side structure subjected to ice loads. So, this study extensively focuses on the non-linear finite element analysis of ships side structure subjected to ice loads. Normally, ship design rules are based on the behavior of single frame subjected to loads. It s reasonable to consider frames singly under the uniform loading but in case of ice loading which is non uniform, the behavior of the structure obtained from single frame based design does not accurately represent the true behavior of the structure. The load-deflection characteristic of frames in isolation, frames as part of a ½+ 1 +½ frames and frames as part of a grillage subjected to <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>loading</b> is studied. As, stiffeners in the side structure of ships bow are not normally perpendicular with shell plate, the lateral capacity of frames as part of a ½+ 1 +½ frames and as part of a grillage is obtained for inclined stiffener. The analyses in this study cover the full range of stiffener behavior from elastic, through yield, through the formation of initial mechanisms, through large deformations.

40|$|Thesis (M. Eng.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2009. Engineering and Applied ScienceIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 158 - 163) Stiffened {{plates are}} the basic structural building blocks of ships and many onshore and offshore structures. The present research explores the plastic response of a stiffened plate subjected to lateral ice loads. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is extensively used to study the plastic behavior of stiffened plates. In order to gain confidence in using FEM, a validation study of a full scale experiment is initially presented. Following the examination of experimental and numerical results for a loaded grillage, the report examines three separate but related questions concerning the design of ice capable stiffened panels. [...] Ship structure design normally considers single frames. This is justified because under uniform loading, all frames behave similarly - so {{it is reasonable to}} consider frames singly. In case of ice loading which is non symmetric, the symmetric boundary condition does not accurately represent the true structural behavior. The difference in load carrying capacity between frames in isolation and frames as part of a grillage, subjected to an <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>loading</b> is studied. [...] The capacity of a stiffened plate depends on many factors - geometric properties, material properties, loading type etc. The current IACS Polar Rules for Ships contain plastic limit state models of frame capacity. These limit states are analytical 1 y derived using relatively simple energy methods and validated by finite element analyses. The contributions from large deformations and membrane stresses are ignored and hence these analytical solutions may not accurately estimate capacity of all frames. The reliable methods to estimate capacity are either to conduct a full scale experiment or a nonlinear finite element analysis. These methods are either very expensive or too complex. There is a need for a simple regression equation which can predict capacity taking into account all the non-linear behavior of the structure. There are ten factors which influence load carrying capacity of a frame. The study of ten factors at two levels (at high and low levels of each factor) requires 1024 (2 10) ANSYS analyses. A significant {{reduction in the number of}} analyses is achieved by using "design of experiments" (DOE) method. A new regression equation for estimating load carrying capacity of the frame is proposed and validated using independent FE analyses. [...] The total load carrying capacity of a stiffened plate is contributed by both shell plate and stiffener. In most situations, stiffened panels will be sensitive to buckling under axial loads. In the case of ice reinforcement, the loads are primarily normal to the shell, with minimal axial loads. The concern for frame buckling remains, although the issue is less well understood. Some stiffeners, especially those with slender webs, show a tendency to fail by local web buckling, tripping and shear buckling, causing a sudden loss of capacity and resulting in collapse of the structure. The IACS Polar Shipping Rules (URI 2) contains a requirement aimed at the prevention of web buckling by specifying a maximum web height I web thickness (h w /tw). While URI 2 employs plastic limit states, the stability ratio is based on prevention of elastic buckling. In some cases these stability requirements have a significant impact on the design. The current rule limiting values of hw /tw are very conservative and do not adequately reflect the conditions that lead to instability. The FEM coupled with the DOE method is used in the study. Six factors which influence stability of a flat bar stiffener are identified. The study of six factors even at two levels (at high and low levels of each factor) requires 64 (2 6) possible combinations of factors to be considered. A significant reduction in the number of cases is achieved by employing DOE method. The main factors affecting the plastic stability of a frame are quite different from the usual elastic buckling parameters. A new relationship is proposed for calculating the limiting web height and web slenderness...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to determine the}} capacity against buckling of the main girder web at a launching stage. As the webs and the flanges of the main girder must defined as slender structural elements (class 4) instability will govern design resistance. The first part of the thesis will give the reader an understanding of the boundary conditions and phenomenon that will determine the loading conditions this steel girder is subjected to. All these observations will then be implemented to a nonlinear buckling analysis in ANSYS Workbench 12. 1. This particular analysis will be executed in order to satisfy design guidelines given in NS-EN 1993 1 - 5 : Plated structural elements 1 regarding material properties, imperfections and boundary conditions for this buckling phenomenon. With this type of analysis we can evaluate the post critical resistance of a plate. The geometry and loads which will be used as input in ANSYS will be retrieved from a reference project which is a MSS-system used to build a bridge in Portugal in 2004, project identification: 25111 - VIZELA CALVOS. After obtaining results from this analysis the main girder`s web panel will collapse at loading from the launching wagon equal to 3879 kN. This particular result was satisfying as it demonstrated that the web panel had enough capacity and that the stiffening arrangement proved to be efficient as it provoked a local buckling mode in a subpanel. The utilization of the web against instability was rather satisfying at this project. A request from Strukturas regarding additional nonlinear analysis with ANSYS obtained with a new stiffening arrangement was as well executed. This will provide useful information regarding capacity at other MSS projects. The alternative stiffening arrangement included a transverse stiffener rigid for shear buckling. With this configuration the collapse load was found to be 5832 kN. Including a transverse stiffener will provide this web with additional stiffness against instability. The main {{reason for this is that}} the stiffener will provide the web panel with additional restraint and the critical buckling modes must be obtained with <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>loading.</b> This is as well evident in design codes in NS-EN 1993 1 - 5 where plate panels can be treated separately if rigid transverse stiffeners are implemented. These rigid transverse stiffeners will decrease the buckling length and subsequently increase resistance. When these nonlinear analysis were executed the next {{objective of the}} thesis is to study the design formulas in NS-EN 1993 1 - 5. It soon became evident that there were some important issues regarding the calculation of resistance due to patch loading. Concentrated transverse loading applied perpendicular to the flange in the plane of the web is referred to as patch loading in Eurocode 3 and would in this case be the support reaction from the launching wagon. The inner web of the main girder has a special configuration with transverse stiffener c/c 750 mm to add stiffness in these local regions at the flange and adjacent part of the web. As the ANSYS analysis state that the most critical mode is a local buckling mode between longitudinal stiffeners, the design formulas does not differ between failure modes. Bearing all this in mind that the transverse stiffeners configuration will contribute to spread the load at a larger area on the critical subpanel it`s safe to conclude that these design formulas must be discarded. The main girder`s web may as well suffer from instability due the influence of direct stresses and shear buckling. Their effect have been examined and it turns out that they will not govern the web resistance. These results were not unexpected because the main girder will experience a larger bending moment and support reactions at the concreting stage due to self weight of the concrete. As a consequence of these discoveries the nonlinear analysis in ANSYS will reflect that the patch loading will cause the most confusion regarding ULS capacity of the web panel...|$|R
40|$|Stiffened {{plates are}} the basic {{structural}} building blocks of ships and many onshore and offshore structures. The present research explores the plastic response of a stiffened plate subjected to lateral ice loads. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is extensively used to study the plastic behavior of stiffened plates. In order to gain confidence in using FEM, a validation study of a full scale experiment is initially presented. Following the examination of experimental and numerical results for a loaded grillage, the report examines three separate but related questions concerning the design of ice capable stiffened panels. [...] Ship structure design normally considers single frames. This is justified because under uniform loading, all frames behave similarly - so {{it is reasonable to}} consider frames singly. In case of ice loading which is non symmetric, the symmetric boundary condition does not accurately represent the true structural behavior. The difference in load carrying capacity between frames in isolation and frames as part of a grillage, subjected to an <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>loading</b> is studied. [...] The capacity of a stiffened plate depends on many factors - geometric properties, material properties, loading type etc. The current IACS Polar Rules for Ships contain plastic limit state models of frame capacity. These limit states are analytically derived using relatively simple energy methods and validated by finite element analyses. The contributions from large deformations and membrane stresses are ignored and hence these analytical solutions may not accurately estimate capacity of all frames. The reliable methods to estimate capacity are either to conduct a full scale experiment or a nonlinear finite element analysis. These methods are either very expensive or too complex. There is a need for a simple regression equation which can predict capacity taking into account all the non-linear behavior of the structure. There are ten factors which influence load carrying capacity of a frame. The study of ten factors at two levels (at high and low levels of each factor) requires 1024 (2 ¹⁰) ANSYS analyses. A significant {{reduction in the number of}} analyses is achieved by using “design of experiments” (DOE) method. A new regression equation for estimating load carrying capacity of the frame is proposed and validated using independent FE analyses.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 164 - 170) Microfiche. xvi, 170 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmA new two-dimensional {{finite element}} model, named the REMCC (ring element model with contact constraint), is {{proposed for the}} analysis of radial deformations in an umbilical cable. This model accounts for material orthotropy and <b>unsymmetrical</b> geometry and <b>loads.</b> Each component of the cable is assumed to possess a circular cross-section and is modeled as a REMCC element having nodal degrees-of-freedom at all contacting points with adjacent components. A new numerical scheme is developed for forming the stiffness matrices of the REMCC elements. Axisymmetric two-dimensional ring elements are used to form the geometrical configuration of the REMCC element. with the aid of the penalty method for imposing displacement constraints, the unit displacement theorem is applied numerically for obtaining the stiffness matrix of the REMCC element with respect to its contact nodal points. Once the stiffness matrices of all the REMCC elements are generated, the normal global coordinate transformations and assembly procedures of the finite element method are applied to form the system of equations for the entire cable cross-section. Loads are then applied and the system equations are solved for the unknown displacements of the contact nodal points. The model is verified by several examples involving exact classical solutions and the test results obtained for an as-built cable...|$|R
