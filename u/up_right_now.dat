Of course, Charles Davis should have been overside with a sack of coal at his feet long ago. And Andy Fay and Mulligan Jacobs are only, and have always been, wrecked and emaciated wisps of men.

Besides that, we'd have a strip of rocky coast to lee of us presently, and we mightn't be able to keep her off it with only the foresail set. On the other hand, so far as I can recollect from looking at the chart, the islands are dead to leeward and we'd only have to keep her running to reach them. There's a sound where we'd find smooth water once we sailed her in. That would be the wiser plan." ...|$|E

40|$|Autism {{narratives}} are {{not just}} stories or histories, describing a given reality. They are creating the language in which to describe the experience of autism, and hence helping to forge the concepts in which to think autism. This paper focuses {{on a series of}} autobiographies that began with Grandin's Emergence. These are often said to show us autism from the ‘inside’. The paper proposes that instead they are developing ways to describe experience for which there is little pre-existing language. Wittgenstein has many well-known aphorisms about how we understand other people directly, without inference. They condense what he had found in Wolfgang Köhler's Gestalt Psychology. These phenomena of direct understanding what other people are doing are, Köhler wrote, ‘the common property and practice of mankind'. They are not the common property and practice of people with autism. Ordinary language is rich in age-old ways to describe what others are thinking, feeling and so forth. Köhler's phenomena are the bedrock on which such language rests. There is no such discourse for autism, because Köhler's phenomena are absent. But a new discourse is being made <b>up</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> i. e. ways of talking for which the autobiographies serve as working prototypes...|$|E
40|$|I'm {{stepping}} into this discussion because Scott is extremely tied <b>up</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> on other issues. If I understand the concern, {{the answer to}} the first Q pasted below could give the wrong impression and you prefer the wording in the second Q pasted below. From our standpoint, however, {{the answer to the}} second Q is much too complicated {{for the purposes of the}} FAQS that contain the first question. In other words, the first document is a very layman's high-level look at the disaster, while Annie's document is a much more detailed and specific one. So I've used Annie's language in a layman's way to try and meet your concern. See my version in red below and let me know if that addresses your concern. Can the Japanese nuclear crisis happen here in the United States? The events that have occurred in Japan are the result of a combination of highly unlikely natural disasters. These include the fifth largest earthquake in recorded history and the resulting devastating tsunami. It is highly unlikely that a similar event could occur in the United States. 1) Can an earthquake and tsunami as large as happened in Japan also happen here? This earthquake occurred on a "subduction zone", which is the type of tectonic region that produces earthquakes of the largest magnitude. A subduction zone is a tectonic plate boundary where one tectonic plate is pushed under another plate. Subduction zone earthquakes are also required to produce the kind of massive tsunami seen in Japan...|$|E
