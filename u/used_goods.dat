5|$|Despite Winmark's {{specializing in}} <b>used</b> <b>goods,</b> its stores sell new goods too. Through its many stores, Winmark uses its buying power to {{negotiate}} competitive {{prices for the}} stores' new goods. It also teaches franchisees about the <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> industry and offers pricing software to establish standards for the <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> they purchase.|$|E
5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax <b>used</b> <b>goods,</b> {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and <b>used</b> <b>goods,</b> which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy <b>used</b> <b>goods,</b> creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of <b>used</b> <b>goods,</b> the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E

Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar, Pakistan, {{and then to}} Fremont, California, where they settle in a run-down apartment. Baba begins work at a gas station. After graduating from high school, Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> {{at a flea market}} in San Jose. There, Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family. Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.|$|E
5|$|Winmark Corporation is an American {{franchisor}} of five retail {{businesses that}} specialize in buying and selling <b>used</b> <b>goods.</b> The company is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Winmark was founded in 1988 as Play It Again Sports Franchise Corporation by Ron Olson and Jeffrey Dahlberg after they purchased the Play It Again Sports franchise rights from Martha Morris. They renamed the company to Grow Biz International Inc. in June 1993. Grow Biz went public in August 1993. In 2000, John Morgan replaced Dahlberg as CEO and renamed the company to Winmark in 2001. Morgan rescued Winmark from the verge of bankruptcy by selling financially failing franchise concepts and stores and replacing the management team. The company's strategy was to move from owning stores itself to having franchisees own all the stores.|$|E

In December 1941, he inquired Pântea about his alleged employment of political suspects, which Pântea categorically denied. In 1942, government embarked on a complex, but erratic, investigation into the presence of former Komsomolists among Odessa's public sector employees. Allegations regarding Pântea's complicity in some acts of corruption prompted additional surveillance from Romanian Special Intelligence. Its subsequent reports accused the Mayor and some in his staff of keeping company with covert communists, and of trading {{on the black market}} of Chișinău. Later, sources adverse to Pântea claimed that he was the main beneficiary of trade in Moldovan wine and <b>used</b> <b>goods,</b> and that he had vested interest in aiding the Transnistrian Jews, who were his business partners.|$|E
25|$|From 1905 to 1923 front-line express {{locomotives}} were a dark {{shade of}} umber. Lining was black with a gilt line either side. Cab roofs remained white.

The company's initials were {{painted on the}} tender- or tank-sides (initially 'L.B.& S.C.R.', but after 1911 the ampersand and the R were removed) in gilt. Secondary passenger locomotives had the same livery, but instead of gilt lining chrome yellow paint was <b>used.</b> <b>Goods</b> engines were gloss black with double vermillion lining. Names and numbers were in white letters with red shading. Carriages were initially all olive green with white lining and detailing. From 1911 this changed to plain umber with black lettering picked out with gold shading.|$|E

25|$|In 1942 a {{rationing}} {{system was}} begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires {{were the first}} item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber. In June 1942 the Combined Food Board {{was set up to}} coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase coffee, sugar, meat, cheese, butter, lard, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, gasoline, bicycles, fuel oil, clothing, silk or nylon stockings, shoes, and many other items. Some items, like automobiles and home appliances, were no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> like clothes or cars, but they became more expensive since they were not subject to price controls.|$|E
25|$|Some items, such as {{clothes and}} children's toys, often become {{unwanted}} before they wear out due {{to changes in}} their owner's needs or preferences; these can be reused by selling or giving them to new owners. Regiving can take place informally between family, friends, or neighbours, through environmental freecycling organisations or through anti-poverty charities such as the Red Cross, United Way, Salvation Army, and Goodwill which give these items to {{those who could not}} afford them new. Other organizations such as iLoveSchools have websites where both new and <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> can be offered to any of America's school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American, for example, throws away 67.9 pounds of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately 296 million people, that translates into 20 billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as The Compact, whose members promise not to buy anything new for a year, and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown away. Reuse not only reduces landfill inline with the waste minimization program but can help raise money for a good cause.|$|E

Martha Morris was an initial customer of Olson and Dahlberg's consulting company. Morris, who started Play It Again Sports in 1983 in Uptown, Minneapolis, had purchased camping and backpacking supplies, found out she was not interested in camping, and decided to sell her <b>used</b> <b>goods.</b> She had attempted to sell a costly, lightly used backpack through making ads and visiting a sports shop, where an employee told her, [...] "We don't sell used equipment."

500|$|The vrijmarkt (literally 'free market') is a {{nationwide}} flea market, at {{which many people}} sell their <b>used</b> <b>goods.</b> Koningsdag is the one {{day of the year}} that the Dutch government permits sales on the street without a permit and without the payment of value added tax. [...] ING Bank found in 2011 that one in five Dutch residents planned to sell at the vrijmarkt and estimated they would earn €100 per person for a total turnover of €290million.

[...] Queen Beatrix has been known to buy at the vrijmarkt; in 1995 she purchased a floor lamp.

500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} federal borrowing rate for like-term instruments {{as determined by the}} Treasury, but since savings, education, and other investments would be tax free under the plan, the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes. [...] An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that the FairTax would have significant transitional issues for the housing sector since the investment would no longer be tax-favored. In a 2007 study, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax, although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately amongst the various types of charitable organizations. The FairTax may also affect state and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to municipal bonds. Proponents believe environmental benefits would result from the FairTax through environmental economics and the re-use and re-sale of <b>used</b> <b>goods.</b> Advocates argue the FairTax would provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to legalize as they would otherwise not receive the rebate. Proponents also believe that the FairTax would have positive effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system, such as social inequality, economic inequality, financial privacy, self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, burden of proof, and due process.|$|E

2500|$|Proponents believe {{environmental}} benefits would result both indirectly and directly from {{implementation of the}} FairTax. [...] Former Senator Mike Gravel has called it a [...] "green tax". [...] The concepts of environmental economics come into play {{with some of the}} aspects suggested. With the FairTax being levied only on new goods and services, with no federal tax charged on <b>used</b> <b>goods,</b> supporters suggest a systemic incentive to buy <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> is introduced. Consequently, re-use and re-sale of <b>used</b> <b>goods</b> is encouraged. With the subsequent increase of the used-goods market (and with new goods being taxed) it is suspected that people would put more emphasis on maintenance of things for longer use and better resale value, and that they may also shy away from disposable goods. [...] The significant reduction of paperwork for IRS compliance and tax forms is estimated to save about 300,000 trees each year. [...] With the expected increase of business and manufacturing movement to the U.S., more goods consumed domestically will be produced domestically. This may reduce international shipping and consequent environmental impact, as well as production in countries with less stringent pollution controls.|$|E
