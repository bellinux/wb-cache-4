40|$|Motivated by {{applications}} in modelling quantum systems using coalgebraic techniques, we introduce a fibred coalgebraic logic. Our approach extends the conventional predicate lifting semantics with additional modalities relating conditions on different fibres. As this fibred setting will typically involve multiple signature functors, the logic incorporates a calculus of modalities enabling {{the construction of}} new modalities using various composition operations. We extend the semantics of coalgebraic logic to this setting, and prove that this extension respects behavioural equivalence. We show how properties of the semantics of modalities are preserved under composition operations, and then apply the calculational aspect of our logic to produce an expressive set of modalities for reasoning about quantum systems, building these modalities up from simpler components. We then demonstrate how these modalities can describe some standard quantum protocols. The novel features of our logic are shown to allow for a uniform description of <b>unitary</b> evolution, and <b>support</b> local reasoning such as "Alice's qubit satisfies condition" as is common when discussing quantum protocols.

40|$|Investigations {{of memory}} in rats and nonhuman {{primates}} have demonstrated functional specialization within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), {{a set of}} heavily interconnected structures including the hippocampal formation and underlying entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices.

To resolve this discrepancy, amnesic patients with either selective hippocampal damage or more extensive MTL damage were tested on variations of an object discrimination task adapted from the nonhuman primate literature. Although both groups were equally impaired on standard recall-based memory tasks, they exhibited different profiles of performance on the object discrimination test, arguing against a unitary view of MTL function. Cases with selective hippocampal damage performed normally, whereas individuals with broader MTL lesions were impaired. Furthermore, deficits in this latter group were related not {{to the number of}} discriminations to be learned and remembered, but to the degree of "feature ambiguity," a property of visual discriminations that can emerge when features are part of both rewarded and unrewarded stimuli.

40|$|We study Abelian {{braiding}} {{statistics of}} loop excitations in three-dimensional (3 D) gauge theories with fermionic particles and the closely related problem of classifying 3 D fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) phases with unitary symmetries. It {{is known that}} the two problems are related by turning FSPT phases into gauge theories through gauging the global symmetry of the former. We show that there exist certain types of Abelian loop braiding statistics that are allowed only in the the presence of fermionic particles, which correspond to 3 D "intrinsic" FSPT phases, i. e., {{those that do not}} stem from bosonic SPT phases. While such intrinsic FSPT phases are ubiquitous in 2 D systems and in 3 D systems with anti-unitary symmetries, their existence in 3 D systems with unitary symmetries was not confirmed previously {{due to the fact that}} strong interaction is necessary to realize them.

40|$|This Article {{was written}} for the 2008 Minnesota Law Review Symposium, Law 2 ̆ 6 Politics in the 21 st Century. The Article {{examines}} the core functionalist argument typically made to <b>support</b> <b>unitary</b> executive theory: that the theory advances the constitutional principle of accountability by demanding that all executive branch decisions {{be placed in the}} hands of a single, nationally elected official. This Article argues that a unitary executive undermines, rather than bolsters, government accountability. The Article also explains that one need not agree with that proposition to conclude that the accountability justification for unitary executive theory is flawed. Rather, one need only deem the point reasonably arguable - and hence within Congress 2 ̆ 7 discretion to judge, subject to functional boundaries - to determine that accountability principles do not demand a unitary executive. The argument that unity reasonably can be deemed to undermine accountability rests on two prongs! First, it turns on the meaning of constitutional accountability. The Constitution reflects different forms of accountability that correspond to different constitutional actors who check and balance one another. Underlying all forms of accountability is the need for transparency and procedural regularity sufficient to enable public and inter-branch assessment of - and responses to - government actions. Second, unity helps the White House both to secretly intervene in administrative state decisions and to manipulate the very 2 ̆ 2 facts 2 ̆ 2 upon which such decisions purport to rest. The problem is compounded by the capacity of the White House politically to distance itself - and thus to create public confusion over who to blame - regarding decisions over which it legally has full authority (and in which conditions of unity thus exist).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the law relating {{health care in}} South Africa rather than medical law which is a subset of this field. It attempts to synthesise five major traditional areas of law, namely international, constitutional, and administrative law, the law of contract and the law of delict, into a legal conceptual framework relating specifically to health care in South Africa. Systemic inconsistencies {{with regard to the}} central issue of health care across these five traditional fields are highlighted. The alignment of the various pre-existing areas of statutory and common law with the Constitution is an ongoing preoccupation of the executive, the judiciary, the legislature and academia. In the health care context, the thesis critically {{examines the}} extent to which such alignment has taken place and identifies areas in which further development is still necessary. It concludes that the correct approach to the constitutional right of access to health care services is to regard it as a <b>unitary</b> concept <b>supported</b> by each of the five traditional areas of law. The traditional division of law into categories of public and private and their further subdivision into, for instance, the law of delict and the law of contract is criticized. It promotes a fragmented approach to a central constitutional construct resulting in legal incongruencies. This is anathema to a constitutionally based legal system. There is no golden thread of commonality discernible within the various public international law instruments that contain references to rights relating to health and it is of limited practical use in South African health law. The rights in the Bill of Rights are interdependent and interconnected. The approach of the courts to the right of access to health care needs to be considerably broader than it is at present in order to fully embrace the idea of rights as a composite concept. Administrative law, especially in the public health sector, offers an alternative basis to pure contract for the provider-patient relationship. It is preferable to a contractual relationship because of the many inbuilt protections and legal requirements for administrative action. Contracts can be unfair but courts refuse to strike them down purely on this basis. Administrative action is {{much more likely to be}} struck down on grounds of unfairness: The law of contract as a legal vehicle for health service delivery is not ideal. This is due to the antiquated approach of South African courts to this area of law. There is still an almost complete failure to incorporate constitutional principles and values into the law of contract. The law of delict in relation to health care services has its blind spots. Although it seeks to place the claimant in the position in which he or she found himself prior to the unlawful act whereas the law of contract seeks to place him in the position he would have occupied had the contract been fulfilled, in the context of health care this is a notional distinction since contracts for health services seldom guarantee a specific outcome.

40|$|The term 'electromagnetically clean solar array' ('EMCSA') {{refers to}} a panel that {{contains}} a planar array of solar photovoltaic cells and that, in comparison with a functionally equivalent solar-array panel of a type heretofore used on spacecraft, (1) exhibits less electromagnetic interferences to and from other nearby {{electrical and electronic equipment}} and (2) can be manufactured at lower cost. The reduction of electromagnetic interferences is effected through a combination of (1) electrically conductive, electrically grounded shielding and (2) reduction of areas of current loops (in order to reduce magnetic moments). The reduction of cost is effected by designing the array to be fabricated as a more nearly unitary structure, using fewer components and fewer process steps. Although EMCSAs were conceived primarily for use on spacecraft they are also potentially advantageous for terrestrial applications in which there are requirements to limit electromagnetic interference. In a conventional solar panel of the type meant to be supplanted by an EMCSA panel, the wiring is normally located on the back side, separated from the cells, thereby giving rise to current loops having significant areas and, consequently, significant magnetic moments. Current-loop geometries are chosen in an effort to balance opposing magnetic moments to limit far- 0 field magnetic interactions, but the relatively large distances separating current loops makes full cancellation of magnetic fields problematic. The panel is assembled from bare photovoltaic cells by means of multiple sensitive process steps that contribute significantly to cost, especially if electomagnetic cleanliness is desired. The steps include applying a cover glass and electrical-interconnect-cell (CIC) sub-assemble, connecting the CIC subassemblies into strings of series-connected cells, laying down and adhesively bonding the strings onto a panel structure that has been made in a separate multi-step process, and mounting the wiring {{on the back of the}} panel. Each step increases the potential for occurrence of latent defects, loss of process control, and attrition of components. An EMCSA panel includes an integral cover made from a transparent material. The silicone cover supplants the individual cover glasses on the cells and serves as an additional <b>unitary</b> structural <b>support</b> that offers the advantage, relative to glass, of the robust, forgiving nature of the silcone material. The cover contains pockets that hold the solar cells in place during the lamination process. The cover is coated with indium tin oxide to make its surface electrically conductive, so that it serves as a contiguous, electrically grounded shield over the entire panel surface. The cells are mounted in proximity to metallic printed wiring. The painted-wiring layer comprises metal-film traces on a sheet of Kapton (or equivalent) polyimide. The traces include contact pads on one side of the sheet for interconnecting the cells. Return leads are on the opposite side of the sheet, positioned to form the return currents substantially as mirror images of, and in proximity to, the cell sheet currents, thereby minimizing magnetic moments. The printed-wiring arrangement mimics the back-wiring arrangement of conventional solar arrays, but the current-loop areas and the resulting magnetic moments are much smaller because the return-current paths are much closer to the solar-cell sheet currents. The contact pads are prepared with solder fo electrical and mechanical bonding to the cells. The pocketed cover/shield, the solar cells, the printed-wiring layer, an electrical bonding agent, a mechanical-bonding agent, a composite structural front-side face sheet, an aluminum honeycomb core, and a composite back-side face sheet are all assembled, then contact pads are soldered to the cells and the agents are cured in a single lamination process...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This paper explores {{social capital}} and network {{building}} in rural areas, its importance in enterprise creation and development, {{and the role}} which festivals and events can thus play in this process. Prior Work Previous work has highlighted that social capital and networking can be important factors in entrepreneurship (both general and social enterprise related) activities and their success (e. g. Daviddsson and Honig, 2003). Rural areas have traditionally been seen as having a relative dearth of these on which to build, creating a perceived need for policy in this area to create the conditions for effective social capital and network building (Senyard et al, 2007). In addition, there is considerable evidence of entrepreneurial families acting as ‘catalysts in the rural wealth creation process, positively contributing social and financial capital to rural and peripheral communities and local economies’ (Morrison 2006). As part of this, small tourist firms in rural areas often ‘strive to put something back’ into their communities, helping to create additional social capital, and {{they can also be}} ‘adept and agile in the face of crises’ such as Foot and Mouth. Also Sharpley (2003) argues that the in the UK countryside tourism has become a more powerful force than agriculture and that sustainable countryside policy and financial support must therefore be adjusted to account for this change. Approach The issues surrounding social capital and network building as they apply to rural areas, entrepreneurship and social enterprise are outlined. The potential use of festivals and events in this process is then explored, both in the literature, and then using a survey of the activities of the 22 unitary authorities in Wales regarding festivals and events. Results The results highlight {{that the vast majority of}} festivals and events are local in scope, and strongly focus on social capital building. They are also strongly correlated with self employment and rurality. In terms of resourcing there is evidence that local (entrepreneurial) resources are supplementing or replacing those from <b>unitary</b> authorities so <b>supporting</b> the notion that social capital and entrepreneurial activity in rural areas are mutually supportive activities. Implications Implications include the need to evaluate festivals and events in more sophisticated ways than the traditional economic impact or marketing focus.
