50|$|Most rating tools {{prioritize}} {{resource efficiency}} and treat ‘reductions in negative impacts’ as if positive. Their baselines and benchmarks preclude net-positive impacts. Some provisions consider respective rights/responsibilities, but not broader ethical issues like improving human-nature relationships, reducing total resource flows or increasing social {{capital in the}} vicinity. Also, innovation is often valued for its own sake, not outcomes, and eco-efficiency saves owners money anyway. PD’s ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ analysis instead prioritizes positive system-wide outcomes and net public benefits.

40|$|This study investigates {{sequential}} appointment scheduling with service criteria. It uses a constraint-based {{approach with}} service criteria bounded in a constraint set {{in contrast to}} the more typical weighted linear objective function. Properties are derived and a sequential scheduling algorithm is developed. Fairness properties of generated schedules are considered in detail, where fairness is the uniformity of performance across patients. New unfairness measures are proposed and used to capture the inequity among patients assigned to different slots. Other criteria such as expectation and variance of patient waiting time, queue length, and overtime are also considered. The fairness/revenue tradeoff is investigated as is the flexibility of the constraint-based approach in handling <b>unavailable</b> <b>time</b> periods.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{quantity}} and quality of voluntary contributions in a dynamically changing social environment. Extending Benabou and Tirole (2006) framework where people engage in prosocial behavior to signal their altruism, we derive theoretical predictions on time volun-teered when (1) there are no excuses to stop volunteering and (2) an authority figure is present. We partner with a local nonprofit to engage laboratory subjects directly in its operation, thus inducing the context for prosociality in a setting where social environment can be precisely controlled. We find that when excuses for stopping are <b>unavailable,</b> <b>time</b> volunteered increases without reducing productivity. The increase is primarily driven by subjects ’ reluctance to be the first to stop volunteering; once someone else stopped, subjects are far more likely to also stop. Audience identity matters: the presence of an authority figure reduces time volunteered, while the presence of a larger number of peers increases time volunteered...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a single machine rescheduling problem that arises from an unexpected machine unavailability, after the given set of jobs {{has already been}} scheduled to minimize the total weighted completion time. Such a disruption is represented as an <b>unavailable</b> <b>time</b> interval and is revealed to the production planner before any job is processed; the production planner wishes to reschedule the jobs to minimize the alteration to the originally planned schedule, which is measured as the maximum time deviation between the original and the new schedules for all the jobs. The objective function in this rescheduling problem is to minimize {{the sum of the}} total weighted completion time and the weighted maximum time deviation, under the constraint that the maximum time deviation is bounded above by a given value. That is, the maximum time deviation is taken both as a constraint and as part of the objective function. We present a pseudo-polynomial time exact algorithm and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme, the latter of which is the best possible given that the general problem is NP-hard.

40|$|Article no. 9 Driven by the {{increasing}} computational demands, cluster management systems (e. g., MESOS) are already pervasive for deploying many applications. Unfortunately, despite much effort, existing systems are still {{difficult to meet}} the high requirements of critical applications (e. g., trading and military applications), because these applications naturally require high-availability and low performance overhead in deployments. Existing systems typically replicate their job controllers so that these controllers can be highly-available and thus they can handle application failures. However, applications themselves are still often a single point of failure, leaving arbitrary <b>unavailable</b> <b>time</b> windows for themselves. This paper proposes the design of TRIPOD, a cluster management system that automatically provides high availability to general applications. TRIPOD’s key to make applications achieve high-availability efficiently is a new PAXOS replication protocol that leverages RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access). TRIPOD runs replicas of the same job with a replicas of controllers, and controllers agree on job requests efficiently with this protocol. Evaluation shows that TRIPOD has low performance overhead in both throughput and response time compared to an application’s unreplicated execution. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{a summary of the}} result of the {{research}} about the empowerment of santri in Pondok Pesantren Hubulo (PP Hubulo) or Hubulo Islamic Boarding School in Gorontalo Province. The research questions are 1. what kind of empowerment of santri (student of Islamic boarding school) was implemented by PP Hubulo Gorontalo Province; 2. how were the prospect and challenge facing PP Hubulo Gorontalo Province in empowering its santri. The results of research showed that, 1) when empowerment was understood as how santri had power and strength, then actually all of the activities in PP Hubulo were the empowerment of santri. However, when empowerment was divided into two categories, namely soft skill and hard skill, then what existed in PP Hubulo was soft skill only, and 2) there were some factors being the obstacles in the empowerment of santri, among others was the <b>unavailable</b> <b>time,</b> where PP Hubulo used three curricula at the same time, not to mention the demands of national examination that cause the empowerment of santri’s hard skill became impossible to be implemented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{majority}} of the job shop scheduling literature carries a common assumption that machines are available all the time. However, this availability assumption {{may not be true}} in real industry settings, since machines may become unavailable during certain periods of time when machine shutdowns are scheduled. This paper considers job shop scheduling problem with ready time and due date constraints on jobs, shutdown constraints on the machines, which belongs to strong NP-hard problem. We assume that the machine <b>unavailable</b> <b>time</b> is known in advance. Three cases with single shutdown and multiple shutdowns are studied in this paper. After formulating the problem as constraints satisfaction problem, we develop an algorithm based on GENET model with progressive stochastic search scheme to solve the constraints satisfaction problem optimally. Heuristics are embedded into the process of search to cope with the objective of minimizing the percentage of tardy jobs. The proposed algorithm is compared with priority heuristic algorithms under different experimental settings (problem sizes and constraints tightness) within a reasonable computational time. Experimental results indicate that the presented algorithm is an efficient scheduling alternative for this class of complex optimization problem...|$|E
40|$|Background Although home based {{counseling}} and testing {{has the potential}} of reaching many Tanzanians through bringing the services to their homes, little is known regarding the perception and attitude of the community members towards being counseled and tested in their home environment. Insufficient data exist to recommend largescale implementation of home-based HIV testing in the country. Objective To determine the perception and attitude of the community members towards the uptake of home based {{counseling and}} testing services in Ilala municipal, Dar es Salaam. Methodology The study employed a cross-sectional Descriptive design using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. A multistage random sampling was used whereby 5 out of 22 wards were randomly selected. Then three streets in each of the five wards were randomly selected, from which a total sample of 384 respondents were recruited. Purposeful sampling technique was used to recruit Focus group discussion participants. Quantitative data were collected through a structured questionnaire and qualitative data were collected using focus group discussions. Results Among the respondents of the study, only 24. 2 % had ever heard of HBCT services and 21. 6 % were aware of the existing HIV and AIDS Act. However, {{more than half of the}} respondents (58 %) know their rights as long as counseling and testing is concerned. Regarding attitude of the respondents on the uptake of HBCT services, 200 (52. 1 %) indicated positive attitudes towards HBCT approach for provision of HTC services. Moreover, focus group discussion (FGD) participants of the respondents expressed perceived barriers in receiving counseling and testing services in their homes including fear of positive results, <b>unavailable</b> <b>time</b> to be counseled and tested at home and concerns about confidentiality. Conclusion and recommendations Generally, the results of this study have shown that community members of Ilala district have a positive attitude toward the uptake of home based counseling and testing. This is a good sign with respect to implementation of HBCT but perceived barriers should be addressed in the plan for roll out. Furthermore, community sensitization should be an integral component of HBCT rollout...|$|E
