40|$|Abstract – Due to {{scarcity}} of petroleum products, the <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oils can be <b>used</b> in <b>engine</b> as engine oil after purifying it. Production of diesel fuel from <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil is involving chemical filtrations and blending process. It could {{solve some of}} the energy problem with increasing the blending percentage of pre-treated <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil (UEO) or by <b>using</b> pre-treated <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil as a diesel fuel. In the present study, samples of shipyard and light vehicles (bus and truck) pre-treated <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil and different percentage of blending of pre-treated <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil (including clay treatment, CT) into fresh diesel have been considered. Results show that pre-treated (including CT) <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil of shipyard (UEO) and 35 % blending of pre-treated (including CT) <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil (UEO) into fresh diesel are suitable {{to use as a}} diesel fuel considering Caterpillar Specific Limit and comparing with the fresh diesel.

40|$|Oil {{pollution}} is a worldwide prevalent threat to environmental sustainability and the remediation of oil contaminated soils, sediments, surface and underground {{water is a}} major challenge for environmental research. Earthworms are {{an important component of}} the soil biota and their response to oil pollution needs to be better understood when they are considered for use in bioremediation. Laboratory investigations were undertaken to monitor the survival rate of earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris Lin.) in soils contaminated with <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil sourced from three different engines (Motorcycle, Motorcar and Truck engines). The aim was to investigate the effect of <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil concentration, in soil, on the survival of earthworms (L. terrestris). The ability of L. terrestris to survive in bioremediated <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil contaminated soil was evaluated and it was observed that 100 % of earthworms survived in both motorcycle and truck <b>engine</b> <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil contaminated soil for concentration as high as 150 g <b>used</b> <b>engine</b> oil/kg soil for a period of 30 days.
