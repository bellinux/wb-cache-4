25|$|The US Bureau of Labor Statistics {{surveyed}} {{the histories of}} union membership rates in industrialized countries from 1970 to 2003, and found that of 20 advanced economies which had <b>union</b> <b>density</b> statistics going back to 1970, 16 of them had experienced drops in <b>union</b> <b>density</b> from 1970 to 2003. Over the same period during which <b>union</b> <b>density</b> in the US declined from 23.5 percent to 12.4 percent, some counties saw even steeper drops. Australian unionization fell from 50.2 percent in 1970 to 22.9 percent in 2003, in New Zealand it dropped from 55.2 percent to 22.1 percent, and in Austria union participation fell from 62.8 percent down to 35.4 percent. All the English-speaking countries studied saw union membership decline to some degree. In the United Kingdom, union participation fell from 44.8 percent in 1970 to 29.3 percent in 2003. In Ireland the decline was from 53.7 percent down to 35.3 percent. Canada {{had one of the}} smallest declines over the period, going from 31.6 percent in 1970 to 28.4 percent in 2003. Most of the countries studied started in 1970 with higher participation rates than the US, but France, which in 1970 had a union participation rate of 21.7 percent, by 2003 had fallen to 8.3 percent.

Sano and Williamson outline quantitative studies that assess the relevance of these factors across countries. The first relevant set of factors relate to the receptiveness of unions' institutional environments. For example, the presence of a Ghent system (where unions are responsible for the distribution of unemployment insurance) and of centralized collective bargaining (organized at a national or industry level as opposed to local or firm level) have both been shown to give unions more bargaining power and to correlate positively to higher rates of <b>union</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three essays in which I examine the influence of formal institutions on entrepreneurs and new firms. In the first essay, 2 ̆ 2 The Influence of Institutions on the Likelihood of Self-Employment: A Multilevel Analysis, 2 ̆ 2 I examine how institutions at the country-level {{are related to the}} likelihood that individuals in those country are self-employed. Country-level measures of formal institutions are paired with individual-level data on self-employment from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (Reynolds et al., 2005). Using the Fraser Institute 2 ̆ 7 s Economic Freedom of the World index and the Heritage Foundation 2 ̆ 7 s Index of Economic Freedom separately as measures of institutions, I find that sound money in a country is positively associated with individual self-employment with both indices. Property rights and trade freedom are positively related to self-employed using the Economic Freedom of the World index. In the second essay, 2 ̆ 2 Labor Market Institutions and New Firm Employment Growth, 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 I examine how state-level labor market characteristics such as minimum wages, <b>union</b> <b>densities,</b> and unemployment insurance premiums influence employment growth in new firms. I use firm-level data from the Kauffman Firm Survey (DesRoches, Robb, 2 ̆ 6 Mulcahy, 2009), which contains data from several thousand new firms for years 2004 - 2008. Minimum wages, <b>union</b> <b>densities,</b> and unemployment insurance structure do not predict the level of employment in new firms in the manner hypothesized. In the third essay, 2 ̆ 2 The Impact of Taxes and Regulations on New Firm Births and Deaths in State Border Counties, 2 ̆ 2 I examine how state-level measures of government size, taxation burdens, unionization levels, and minimum wages influence the birth and death rates of firms in counties located on state borders. Tabulations containing data on establishment births and deaths by U. S. County (Plummer 2 ̆ 6 Headd, 2008) were merged with measures of government size, taxation burdens, <b>union</b> <b>densities,</b> and minimum wages.

Within this framework the first hurdle to be taken is the establishment of a workplace presence as a precondition for any sustainable membership development. The second hurdle is then to convince the potential members in the workplace to join i. e. the recruitment. [...] ...|$|R

Drawing on the estimates, we project net <b>union</b> <b>densities</b> (NUD) and analyze the differences between East and West Germany as well as the corresponding changes in NUD over time. Nonlinear Blinder-Oaxaca-type decompositions show that changes in the composition of the work force have only played a minor role for the deunionization trends in West and East Germany. In West–East comparison, differences in the characteristics of the work force reflect a lower quality of membership matches in East Germany right after German unification...|$|R
25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} impact of market {{integration}} on <b>union</b> <b>density</b> or on workers themselves, organized labor has been engaged {{in a variety of}} strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.|$|E
25|$|Denmark has {{the fourth}} highest ratio of {{tertiary}} degree holders in the world. The country ranks {{highest in the}} world for workers' rights.

According to the International Monetary Fund, Denmark has the world's highest minimum wage. As Denmark has no minimum wage legislation, the high wage floor has been attributed to the power of trade unions. For example, {{as the result of a}} collective bargaining agreement between the 3F trade union and the employers group , workers at McDonald's and other fast food chains make the equivalent of US$20 an hour, which is more than double what their counterparts earn in the United States, and have access to five weeks' paid vacation, parental leave and a pension plan. <b>Union</b> <b>density</b> in 2015 was 68%.|$|E

The principal findings are: (1) earnings inequality fell slightly {{in the second half of}} the 1970 s only to grow sharply during the 1980 s; (2) rising financial returns to education and labor market experience in the 1980 s account for between one-third and one-half of the growth in earnings inequality during the 1980 s; (3) the earnings if low-skilled workers increased by over 15 percent in real terms between 1974 and 1988. Rising returns to skills in the face of large increase in the supply of skilled labor suggest a substantial shift in labor demand in favor of skilled workers. Changes in British labor market institutions, particularly the decline in trade <b>unions</b> <b>density</b> may also help to explain part of the rise in inequality during the 1980 s. ...|$|R
