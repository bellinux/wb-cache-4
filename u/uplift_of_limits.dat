40|$|This report {{describes}} the characteristic engineering properties and behaviour of the cohesive soils of, or derived from, the Kannaviou, Melange and Mamonia Complex Formations which occur {{in close proximity}} to the Troodos ophiolite in the Paphos region of SW Cyprus. The investigation was concentrated in two study areas centred on the villages of Phiti (Area 1) and Statos (Area 2), respectively,located in the landslide-prone highlands adjacent to the updomed Troodos Massif. An extensive geotechnical and mineralogical database of over 3000 discrete test data has been established derived from samples collected from surface outcrops, trial pit excavations and borehole drilling programmes in each study area. Geological and detailed landslide mapping was undertaken in each study area resulting in the preparation of two 1 : 10 000 scale engineering geology maps. The maps show that major slope stability problems occur where weak, sheared montmorillonitic clays and Melange deposits crop out on steep slopes in areas of high relief; with landslide development exacerbated by high winter rainfalls, permeable chalk and limestone caprocks, earthquake shocks and active erosion associated with continued <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> Troodos. <b>Limited</b> analyses <b>of</b> slope angles and residual shear strength data indicate that limiting slope angles for shallow mass movements in the Kannaviou and Melange clays are c. 8. 5 degrees and 11 degrees, respectively. Deep-seated slope failures are shown to be largely associated with faults. The report suggests a number of practical guidelines for engineering development and future investigations both in SW Cyprus and in similar ophiolite terrains elsewhere...|$|R
30|$|<b>Uplift</b> <b>of</b> the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau (HTP) and its linkage {{with the}} {{evolution}} of the Asian monsoon has been regarded as a typical example of a tectonic–climate linkage. Although this linkage remains unproven because of insufficient data, our understanding has greatly advanced in the past decade. It is thus timely to summarize our knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>uplift</b> history <b>of</b> the HTP, the results of relevant climate simulations, and spatiotemporal changes in the Indian and East Asian monsoons since the late Eocene. Three major pulses <b>of</b> the HTP <b>uplift</b> have become evident: (1) <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the southern and central Tibetan Plateau (TP) at ca. 40 – 35  Ma, (2) <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP at ca. 25 – 20  Ma, and (3) <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northeastern to eastern TP at ca. 15 – 10  Ma. Modeling predictions suggest that (i) <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the southern and central TP should have intensified the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the Somali Jet at 40 – 35  Ma; (ii) <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP should have intensified the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), as well as the desertification of inland Asia at 25 – 20  Ma; and (iii) <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northeastern and eastern TP should have further intensified the EASM and EAWM at 15 – 10  Ma. We tested these predictions by comparing them with paleoclimate data for the time intervals of interest. There are insufficient paleoclimate data to test whether the ISM and Somali Jet intensified with the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the southern and central TP at 40 – 35  Ma, but it is possible that such uplift enhanced erosion and weathering that drew down atmospheric CO 2 and resulted in global cooling. There is good evidence that the EASM and EAWM intensified, and desertification started in inland Asia at 25 – 20  Ma in association with the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP. The impact <b>of</b> the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northeastern and eastern TP on the Asian monsoon at 15 – 10  Ma is difficult to evaluate because that interval was also a time of global cooling and Antarctic glaciation that might also have influenced the intensity of the Asian monsoon.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{excavation}} process of Foundation Pit in Soft Soil area, {{it will cause}} the large <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> stand column, and may cause the instability and failure of foundation pit in case of being serious; but the additional internal force of support system caused by the <b>uplift</b> and sinking <b>of</b> stand column currently has no practical calculation model in the foundation pit design. This article discusses the reason and mechanism for <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> stand column in the foundation pit, proposes the simplified calculation method of estimating the additional bending moment of inner support through <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> stand column in allusion to two main influence factors of bottom heave and vertical load caused by {{the excavation}} of foundation pit, inversely calculates the permissible additional bending moment of inner support based on this, verifies by combining the monitoring data for <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> stand column in the actual project, and finally, further proposes the project measures corresponding to the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> stand column, hoping to provide beneficial reference for the similar project...|$|R

The following changes in the Asian monsoon in various parts of Asia are predicted to be caused by differential uplift:([...] i) the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the southern and central TP at 40 – 35  Ma should have intensified the ISM and the Somali Jet; (ii) the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP at 25 – 20  Ma is predicted to have caused intensification of the EASM and EAWM, as well as the desertification of Central Asia; and (iii) the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northeastern and eastern TP at 15 – 10  Ma should have further intensified both the EASM and EAWM.|$|R

30|$|Intensification of the EASM {{is closely}} linked to the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the {{northern}} TP, which enhances summer precipitation in northern East Asia, as well as the southeastern and eastern TP (Zhang et al. 2012 a; Tang et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014), whereas the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP reduces ISM precipitation in northern India (Boos and Kuang 2010; Zhang et al. 2012 a; Chen et al. 2014). The western North Pacific subtropical high may also be strengthened by this uplift (Zhang et al. 2012 a). Decreased precipitation in central Asia is expected in response to the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP (Zhang et al. 2012 a). The <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the TP may reduce precipitation over the Somali Jet area, northern India, and Southeastern Asia through ocean–atmosphere interactions (Abe et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2014).|$|R

30|$|Results {{of recent}} climate model {{simulations}} demonstrate {{that only the}} Himalaya or the southern TP are necessary to intensify the ISM, whereas the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP is critical for intensification of the EASM and EAWM. The <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP also reduces ISM precipitation in northern India, strengthens the western North Pacific subtropical high, and reduces precipitation in central Asia. The <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the TP intensifies the EAWM through strengthening of the Siberian High, but the effect <b>of</b> stepwise <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the TP on the EAWM is not well explored. The effect of the Paratethys on the Asian monsoon could also be significant, but {{the timing of this}} effect is restricted to the Eocene, since this water body largely disappeared during the Oligocene. The effect of pCO 2 on the intensity of the Asian monsoon is potentially significant and should be taken into account. PCO 2 has opposing impacts on summer and winter monsoons, and its effects also contrast with the tectonically driven impact.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe pelagic {{cover of}} the Owen Ridge in the Arabian Sea {{recorded}} {{the evolution of the}} Indian monsoon since the Middle Miocene. The <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the Owen Ridge resulted from tectonic processes along the previously unidentified Miocene India-Arabia plate boundary. Based on seismic reflection data tied with deep-sea drilling to track the Miocene India-Arabia plate boundary, we propose a new timing for the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the Owen Ridge and highlight its impact on the record of climate changes in pelagic sediments. The new dataset reveals a fracture zone east of the Owen Ridge corresponding to the fossil plate boundary, and documents that the main <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the Owen Ridge occurred close to ∼ 8. 5 Ma, and is coeval with a major <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the east Oman margin. Late Miocene deformation at the India-Arabia plate boundary is also coeval with the onset of intra-plate deformation in the Central Indian Ocean, suggesting a kinematic change of India and surrounding plates in the Late Miocene. The <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the Owen Ridge above the lysocline at ∼ 8. 5 Ma accounts for a better preservation of Globigerina bulloides in the pelagic cover, previously misinterpreted {{as the result of a}} monsoon intensification event...|$|R

30|$|Many {{climate model}} {{simulations}} suggest that intensification of the ISM is {{closely linked to}} the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the Himalaya (or southern Tibet), whereas the EASM is rather insensitive to the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the Himalaya (Boos and Kuang 2010; Zhang et al. 2012 a; Chen et al. 2014) or may even be negatively influenced by this uplift (Tang et al. 2013). Himalayan uplift is also expected to cause an increase in summer precipitation in northern India and intensification of the Somali Jet. The <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the Zagros Hindu Kush–Elburz mountains might also have contributed to the intensification of the Somali Jet and the increase in summer rainfall in northwest India (Tang et al. 2013).|$|R

30|$|These {{predictions}} {{are tested}} {{by comparing the}} results with paleoclimatic data spanning critical time intervals. There are not enough paleoclimatic data to specify whether the ISM and Somali Jet intensified in association with the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the southern and central TP at 40 – 35  Ma. However, {{it is possible that the}} <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the southern and central TP enhanced erosion and weathering of the HTP. This weathering may have in turn resulted in a draw down of atmospheric CO 2 and global cooling, along with expansion the Antarctic ice sheets and a reduction in EASM intensity. There is strong evidence that, beginning at 25 – 20  Ma, the EASM and EAWM intensified and desertification in inland Asia was enhanced in association with the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP. The impact <b>of</b> the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northeastern and eastern TP on Asian monsoon strength at 15 – 10  Ma is difficult to evaluate because this interval is also a time of global cooling and Antarctic glaciation that might also have confounded Asian monsoon intensity.|$|R
30|$|According to climatic {{simulations}} of partial or phased <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the HTP, the <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the northern TP enhanced summer precipitation in northern East Asia {{and the southern}} and eastern TP (Zhang et al. 2012 b; Tang et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2014), reduced precipitation in central Asia (Zhang et al. 2012 a), and strengthened ISM precipitation in northern India (Boos and Kuang 2010; Zhang et al. 2012 a; Chen et al. 2014). Whole <b>uplift</b> <b>of</b> the TP may also have reduced precipitation over the Somali Jet area, northern India, and southeastern Asia (Abe et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2014), while intensifying the Siberian–Mongolian high and resulting in the gradual northward movement of its center during the winter (Liu and Yin 2002).|$|R
