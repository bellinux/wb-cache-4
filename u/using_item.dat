50|$|This type of card {{allows the}} player {{to summon the}} kotodama power of a monster on the battlefield. Summoned monsters shield the player from enemy attacks, and attack the enemy when the timecost reaches zero. If the players uses a monster card when the field is already filled with summoned monsters, the newly summoned monsters will {{take the place of}} the {{previous}} ones. Each summoned monsters's HP is relative to the kotodama battler's level, so monsters grow stronger as the summoner's level increases. Using monster cards usually requires a greater timecost than <b>using</b> <b>item</b> or magic cards.|$|E

[...] More recently, he and his colleagues have developed other measures to assess the constructs of thin-skinned ego-defensiveness, affect intensity for anger and frustration, and rudeness.

50|$|Guttman's {{deterministic}} model is brought within a probabilistic framework in item response theory models, and especially Rasch measurement. The Rasch model requires a probabilistic Guttman structure when items have dichotomous responses (e.g. right/wrong). In the Rasch model, the Guttman response pattern {{is the most}} probable response pattern for a person when items are ordered from least difficult to most difficult (Andrich, 1985). In addition, the Polytomous Rasch model is premised on a deterministic latent Guttman response subspace, {{and this is the}} basis for integer scoring in the model (Andrich, 1978, 2005). Analysis of data <b>using</b> <b>item</b> response theory requires comparatively longer instruments and larger datasets to scale item and person locations and evaluate the fit of data to model.|$|E
5000|$|An OPath {{query string}} allows {{to express the}} {{parameters}} that will be queried for to be specified <b>using</b> <b>Item</b> properties, embedded Items as well as Relationships. It can specify a single search condition, such as [...] "title = Something'", or a compound condition such as [...] "title = 'Title 1' || title = 'Title 2' && author = 'Someone'". These boolean and relational operations can be specified using C# like &&, ||, =, != operators {{as well as their}} English-like equivalent like EQUAL, NOT EQUAL. SQL like operators such as LIKE, GROUP BY and ORDER BY are also supported, as are wildcard conditions. So, [...] "title LIKE 'any*'" [...] is a valid query string. These operators can be used to execute complex searches such as [...] using (ItemContext ic = ItemContext.Open (...) [...] ) { //Searching begins by creating a ItemSearcher object. The searcher is created from a //relationship instance because the contacts being searched for are in relation. The //first parameter defines the scope of the search. An ItemContext as the scope means //the entire store is to be searched. Scope can be limited to a set of Items which may //be in a holding relationship with the contacts. In that case, the set is passed as //the scope of the search. ItemSearcher searcher = OutContactRelationship.GetTargetSearcher(ic, typeof(Contact)); ContactCollection contacts = searcher.FindAll("OutContactRelationship.Contact.Name LIKE 'A*'"); }The above code snippet creates an ItemSearcher object that searches on the OutContactRelationship instance that relates pictures and contacts, in effect searching all pictures related with a contact. It then runs the query Name LIKE 'A*'" [...] on all contacts reachable through OutContactRelationship, returning the list of [...] "contacts whose names start with A and whose pictures I have". Similarly, more relationships could be taken into account to further narrow down the results. Further, a natural language query processor, which parses query in natural language and creates a well-formed OPath query string to search via proper relationships, can allow users to make searches such as [...] "find the name of the wine I had with person X last month", provided financial management applications are using WinFS to store bills.|$|E
