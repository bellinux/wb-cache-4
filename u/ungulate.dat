5|$|The park {{is located}} about 7 {{kilometres}} (4mi) from the Nairobi's centre. There is electric fencing around the park's northern, eastern, and western boundaries. Its southern boundary is {{formed by the}} Mbagathi River.

There is considerable movement of large <b>ungulate</b> species across this boundary.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ungulates</b> (pronounced [...] ) are any {{members of}} {{a diverse group of}} {{primarily}} large mammals that includes odd-toed <b>ungulates</b> such as horses and rhinoceroses, and even-toed <b>ungulates</b> such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, deer, and hippopotamuses. Most terrestrial <b>ungulates</b> use the tips of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while moving.|$|R
50|$|The {{classification}} of artiodactyls was hotly debated because the ocean-dwelling cetaceans {{evolved from the}} land-dwelling even-toed <b>ungulates.</b> Some semiaquatic even-toed <b>ungulates</b> (hippopotamuses) are {{more closely related to}} the ocean-dwelling cetaceans than to the other even-toed <b>ungulates.</b>|$|R

5|$|The forelimb {{bones of}} azhdarchids and ornithocheirids were unusually long {{compared}} to other pterosaurs, and, in azhdarchids, {{the bones of the}} arm and hand (metacarpals) were particularly elongated. Furthermore, as a whole, azhdarchid front limbs were proportioned similarly to fast-running <b>ungulate</b> mammals. Their hind limbs, on the other hand, were not built for speed, but they were long compared with most pterosaurs, and allowed for a long stride length. While azhdarchid pterosaurs probably could not run, they would have been relatively fast and energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed <b>ungulate</b> mammals, {{the tallest}} living {{terrestrial}} {{animals and the}} largest ruminants. The genus currently consists of one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, the type species. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the IUCN currently recognizes only one species with nine subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest <b>ungulate</b> bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E
5000|$|The even-toed <b>ungulates</b> (Artiodactyla, [...] ) are <b>ungulates</b> (hoofed animals) whose {{weight is}} borne equally {{by the third}} and fourth toes. By contrast, {{odd-toed}} <b>ungulates,</b> such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toes. The aquatic cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from within even-toed <b>ungulates,</b> so modern taxonomic classification sometimes combines the Artiodactyla and Cetacea into the Cetartiodactyla.|$|R
50|$|In <b>ungulates</b> the forelimbs are {{optimised}} {{to maximize}} speed and stamina {{to the extent}} that the limbs serve almost no other purpose. In contrast to the skeleton of human limbs, the proximal bones of <b>ungulates</b> are short and the distal bones long to provide length of stride; proximally, large and short muscles provide rapidity of step. The odd-toed <b>ungulates,</b> such as the horse, use a single third toe for weight-bearing and have significantly reduced metacarpals. Even-toed <b>ungulates,</b> such as the giraffe, uses both their third and fourth toes but a single completely fused phalanx bone for weight-bearing. <b>Ungulates</b> whose habitat does not require fast running on hard terrain, for example the hippopotamus, have maintained four digits.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{selective}} feeding of <b>ungulates</b> diverse uneven-aged forests (e. g. virgin beech forests) {{are probably more}} resistant to browsing impacts than even-aged ones. Browsing impact of <b>ungulates</b> was revealed to be low and preferential in an uneven-aged beech forest in Hungary. Beech saplings were almost entirely unbrowsed and economically less important woody species were highly selected by browsing <b>ungulates...</b>|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any <b>ungulate.</b> There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb in lemurs {{normally}} {{consists of}} six teeth (four incisors and two canines), although indriids, monkey lemurs, and some sloth lemurs {{only have a}} four-tooth toothcomb due {{to the loss of}} either a canine or an incisor. Because the lower canine is either included in the toothcomb or lost, the lower dentition can be difficult to read, especially since the first premolar (P2) is often shaped like a canine (caniniform) to fill the canine's role. In folivorous (leaf-eating) lemurs, except for indriids, the upper incisors are greatly reduced or absent. Used together with the toothcomb on the mandible (lower jaw), this complex is reminiscent of an <b>ungulate</b> browsing pad.|$|E
5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest <b>ungulate</b> with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>ungulates</b> on epigeal arthropod communities in two common plant communities of the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada (southeast Spain). We have compared the abundance, biomass, diversity and specific composition of arthropod communities in grazed and ungrazed plots experimentally excluded from <b>ungulates.</b> In general, we found that arthropods were more abundant and diverse in grazed than in ungrazed plots. However, the effect of <b>ungulates</b> depended on the variable considered (diversity versus abundance versus biomass). Moreover, <b>ungulates</b> also affected species composition. This means that without affecting diversity, <b>ungulates</b> can still have a strong effect on arthropod communities by changing species composition. Also, the relationship between <b>ungulates</b> and arthropods differed depending on the year of study and the sampling period. In conclusion, our study indicates that to extrapolate the results obtained {{for a group of}} insects, a habitat or a sampling period is not appropriate for the conservation of arthropod communities...|$|R
5|$|The family Bovidae {{is placed}} in the order Artiodactyla (which {{includes}} the even-toed <b>ungulates).</b> It includes 143 extant species, accounting for nearly 55% of the <b>ungulates,</b> and 300 known extinct species.|$|R
50|$|Meridiungulata is an extinct clade {{with the}} rank of cohort or superorder, {{containing}} the South American <b>ungulates</b> Pyrotheria (possibly including Xenungulata), Astrapotheria, Notoungulata and Litopterna. It is not known {{if it is a}} natural group; it was erected to distinguish the <b>ungulates</b> of South America from other <b>ungulates.</b> Relationships between the orders inside Meridiungulata remain unresolved and it could well be a 'wastebasket' taxon. Most Meridiungulata died out following the invasion of South America by North American <b>ungulates</b> and predators during the Great American Interchange; a few of the largest species of notoungulates and litopterns survived until the end-Pleistocene extinctions.|$|R
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals have been {{introduced}} to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately. Moose, snowshoe hare, American red squirrel, eastern chipmunk, and masked shrew, and others, {{were brought to the}} island through specific wildlife mandates. Moose were introduced in 1904 and are now the dominant <b>ungulate</b> on the island. An unusual experiment conducted in 1964 involved relocating a small herd of bison onto Brunette Island in Fortune Bay. The last of these animals is thought to have died by 1994. Rats and mice were unintentionally introduced while mink escaped from fur farms. Coyotes are a very recent addition to the fauna of Newfoundland. How coyotes got onto the island is still debated by wildlife officials, but it is probable that they crossed the ice from Cape Breton Island in the 1980s. Newfoundland has no native amphibians, but frogs were introduced onto the island in the 1860s and toads almost a century later.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success {{is due in part}} to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through <b>ungulate</b> herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like <b>ungulate,</b> from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. Primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).|$|E
5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed <b>ungulates,</b> even-toed <b>ungulates,</b> and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed <b>ungulates</b> (Perissodactyla).|$|R
50|$|<b>Ungulates</b> are in high {{diversity}} {{in response to}} sexual selection and ecological events; the majority of <b>ungulates</b> lack a collar bone. Terrestrial <b>ungulates</b> {{are for the most}} part herbivores, with some of them being grazers. However, there are exceptions to this as pigs, peccaries, hippos and duikers are known to have an omnivorous diet. Some cetaceans are the only modern <b>ungulates</b> that are carnivores; baleen whales consume significantly smaller animals in relation to their body size, such as small species of fish and krill; toothed whales, depending on the species, can consume a wide range of species: squid, fish, sharks, and other species of mammals such as seals and other whales. In terms of ecosystem <b>ungulates</b> have colonized all corners of the planets, from mountains to the ocean depths; grasslands to deserts and have been domesticated by humans.|$|R
50|$|Ungulata, {{which used}} to be {{considered}} an order, has been split into the following: Perissodactyla (odd-toed <b>ungulates),</b> Artiodactyla (even-toed <b>ungulates),</b> Tubulidentata (aardvarks), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Sirenia (dugongs and manatees), Proboscidea (elephants) and occasionally Cetacea (whales and dolphins).|$|R
5|$|In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male). Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats. Tigers have less impact on <b>ungulate</b> populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers. In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity. However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Native herbivores such as {{the moose}} are found in small numbers near waterways, {{especially}} at lower elevations. Moose populations in northwestern Wyoming and other areas of North America {{have been on the}} decline {{since the end of the}} 20th century, possibly due to a parasite. There were an estimated 739 moose in the forest in 2006 which is almost 300 fewer than there were 20 years earlier. Other <b>ungulate</b> species are much more common and there are over 20,000 elk (also known as wapiti) and 40,000 mule deer. Bighorn sheep and mountain goats inhabit the rocky terrain and highest elevations. During the winter, one of the largest bighorn sheep herds in the lower 48 states congregate in the region around Dubois, Wyoming; however, their numbers since 1990 have been diminished due to disease transmitted from contact with domesticated sheep and goats. An estimated 5,000 bighorn sheep are found throughout the forest and a small but stable population of 200 mountain goats reside in the northernmost portions of the forest. Bison and pronghorn antelope are two other ungulates that live on the forest and have sustainable populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline of}} North American wolf populations coincided with {{increasing}} human populations {{and the expansion}} of agriculture. By the start of the 20th century, the species had almost disappeared from the eastern USA, excepting some areas of the Appalachians and the northwestern Great Lakes Region. In Canada, the gray wolf was extirpated in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia between 1870 and 1921, and in Newfoundland around 1911. It vanished from the southern regions of Quebec and Ontario between 1850 and 1900. The gray wolf's decline in the prairies began with the extermination of the American bison and other ungulates in the 1860s–70s. From 1900–1930, the gray wolf was virtually eliminated from the western USA and adjoining parts of Canada, because of intensive predator control programs aimed at eradicating the species. The gray wolf was exterminated by federal and state governments from all of the USA by 1960, except in Alaska and northern Minnesota. The decline in North American wolf populations was reversed from the 1930s to the early 1950s, particularly in southwestern Canada, because of expanding <b>ungulate</b> populations resulting from improved regulation of big game hunting. This increase triggered a resumption of wolf control in western and northern Canada. Thousands of wolves were killed from the early 1950s to the early 1960s, mostly by poisoning. This campaign was halted and wolf populations increased again by the mid-1970s.|$|E
50|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic studies have now placed bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, along with carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed <b>ungulates,</b> even-toed <b>ungulates,</b> and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to the clade Perissodactyla (which includes horses and other odd-toed <b>ungulates).</b> However, the first phylogenomic analysis of bats in 2013 shows {{as shown in the}} cladogram that Chiroptera is not sister to Perissodactyla, but is the sister clade to a larger group that includes <b>ungulates</b> and carnivores.|$|R
5|$|The even-toed <b>ungulates</b> are <b>ungulates</b> whose {{weight is}} borne about equally {{by the third}} and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls.

5|$|Wildebeest are {{the most}} {{commonly}} taken medium-sized <b>ungulate</b> prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson's gazelles coming close behind. Cape buffalo are rarely attacked {{due to differences in}} habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, cape buffalo, Burchell's zebra, greater kudu and impala are the spotted hyena's most important prey, while giraffe, impala, wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia's Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, the spotted hyena's primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident impala. In Kenya's Masai Mara, 80% of the spotted hyena's prey consists of topi and Thomson's gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant's gazelle, gerenuk, sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya. In west Africa, it is thought that the spotted hyena is primarily a scavenger, but will occasionally attack domestic stock and medium-size antelopes in some areas. In Cameroon, it is common for spotted hyenas to feed on small antelopes like kob, but may also scavenge on reedbuck, kongoni, buffalo, giraffe, African elephant, topi and roan antelope carcasses. Records indicate that spotted hyenas in Malawi feed on medium to large-sized ungulates such as waterbuck and impala. In Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, spotted hyenas primarily prey on wildebeest, followed by buffalo, zebra, impala, giraffe, reedbuck and kongoni. In Uganda, it is thought that the species primarily preys on birds and reptiles, while in Zambia it is primarily a scavenger.|$|E
5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in <b>ungulate</b> populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E
