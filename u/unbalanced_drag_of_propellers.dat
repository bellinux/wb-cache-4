However, propfan engines, {{which are very}} similar to turboprop engines, can cruise at flight speeds approaching Mach 0.75.

40|$|The <b>propeller</b> <b>of</b> a ship {{generally}} {{operates in}} a wake behind the hull. Then the propeller receives complicated and mutual interference with a hull and a rudder. We usually divide the ship {{into three parts}} i. e. the hull, the propeller and also the rudder, {{when we consider the}} problem of the ship propulsive performance. The propeller occupies an important part of ship propulsion {{in the sense that it}} affects the hull and the rudder largely. Moreover a propeller operates in such a non-uniform flow, and then we require a numerical method that the calculation <b>of</b> the <b>propeller</b> performance is easy and the computing time is short. And such a computation method should be able to estimate well the forces and the moments acting on the propeller and also the velocity field around it finely.

This paper investigates the combined <b>drag</b> <b>of</b> a pair of propelled prolate spheroids and compared to the towed models for the Reynolds Number of 3. 2 × 106. The model has a length-diameter ratio of 6 : 1. A series of configuration of a pair of spheroids is simulated at various longitudinal offsets and transverse separations. Three-dimensional simulations are performed using a commercial Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics code ANSYS CFX 12. 1 with the SST turbulence closure model. In each case, the fluid domain has a mesh size of approximately nine million cells including inflated prism layers to capture the boundary layer.

Turbulent flow computations are carried out for Reynolds numbers increasing progressively from model scale to full scale using the CFD analysis. The result of the flow calculation for model scale Reynolds numbers agrees well {{with that of the}} experiment of a large cavitation tunnel. The existing numerical analysis indicates that the performance <b>of</b> the podded <b>propeller</b> blades is mainly influenced by the advance coefficient and relatively little by the Reynolds number. However, the <b>drag</b> <b>of</b> pod housing with propeller in operation is different from that of pod housing without propeller due to the acceleration and swirl <b>of</b> <b>propeller</b> slipstream which is altered by propeller loading as well as the pressure recovery and friction according to Reynolds number, which suggests that the pod housing drag under the condition <b>of</b> <b>propeller</b> in operation is the key factor of the scale effect on the performance between model and full scale podded propellers. The so called ‘drag ratio’, which is the ratio <b>of</b> pod housing <b>drag</b> to total thrust <b>of</b> podded <b>propeller,</b> increases as the advance coefficient increases due to accelerated flow in the slipstream <b>of</b> the podded <b>propeller.</b> However, the increasing rate <b>of</b> the <b>drag</b> ratio reduces continuously as the Reynolds number increases from model to full scale progressively.
