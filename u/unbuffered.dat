25|$|Most analog {{multimeters}} of the moving-pointer type are <b>unbuffered,</b> {{and draw}} current from the circuit under test to deflect the meter pointer. The impedance of the meter {{varies depending on}} the basic sensitivity of the meter movement and the range which is selected. For example, a meter with a typical 20,000ohms/volt sensitivity will have an input resistance of two million ohms on the 100-volt range (100 V * 20,000 ohms/volt = 2,000,000 ohms). On every range, at full scale voltage of the range, the full current required to deflect the meter movement is taken from the circuit under test. Lower sensitivity meter movements are acceptable for testing in circuits where source impedances are low compared to the meter impedance, for example, power circuits; these meters are more rugged mechanically. Some measurements in signal circuits require higher sensitivity movements {{so as not to}} load the circuit under test with the meter impedance.|$|E
50|$|The i-Series {{has four}} DIMM slots on its main logic board and {{supports}} standard <b>unbuffered</b> or registered 100 MHz ECC SDRAM DIMMs. Using <b>unbuffered</b> memory, the i-Series can support 32 to 512 MB of memory, with registered memory, 64 MB to 1 GB is supported. <b>Unbuffered</b> and registered DIMMs cannot be mixed {{in the same}} system. <b>Unbuffered</b> DIMMs have capacities of 32, 64 and 128 MB, whereas registered DIMMs have capacities of 64, 128 and 256 MB.|$|E

50|$|All paper {{products}} will acidify over time, so even archival acid-free {{paper products}} used for storage are typically replaced every few years. Archival acid-free paper products {{can be either}} buffered or <b>unbuffered.</b> <b>Unbuffered</b> paper has a neutral pH and is used for housing photographs, textiles, and most other types of objects, while buffered paper, which is impregnated with calcium carbonate and has an alkaline pH, is used for storing paper objects. The buffered paper absorbs the acid that paper objects emit and keeps the micro-environment from becoming overly acidic {{for a longer period}} of time.|$|E
5000|$|Price {{advantages}} are obtained {{due to a}} limited product portfolio (only <b>unbuffered</b> and SO-DIMM), and due to outsourced module assembly. The DRAM components, however, are [...] "Made by Infineon".|$|E

50|$|The Parallel Bus Interface, or PBI, is a 50-pin port {{found on}} some Atari 8-bit XL computers. It {{provides}} <b>unbuffered,</b> {{direct connection to}} the system bus lines (address, data, control), running {{at the same speed}} as the 6502 CPU. The 600XL and 800XL computers, along with the unreleased 1400XL and 1450XLD had a PBI interface.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{limitations}} preclude connecting {{more than}} 2 <b>unbuffered</b> DDR SDRAM DIMMs or 4 buffered DIMMs {{to a single}} shared bus. It is also impractical to manufacture a single chip with more than two DDR memory buses (channels). Thus, {{it is impossible to}} connect more than 8 DIMMs to a single chip. This is typically the per-processor limitation as well.|$|E
50|$|The file {{descriptor}} for standard error {{is defined by}} POSIX as 2 (two); the header file provides the symbol STDERR_FILENO; the corresponding variable is FILE* stderr. The C++ standard header provides two variables associated with this stream: std::cerr and std::clog, the former being <b>unbuffered</b> and the latter using the same buffering mechanism as all other C++ streams.|$|E
5000|$|DDR2 SO-DIMM memory modules {{commonly}} have clock speeds from 200 MHz up to 400 MHz (PC2-6400). 204-pin SO-DIMMs {{can also}} contain DDR3 SDRAM, with specifications such as PC3-6400, PC3-8500, PC3-10600, PC3-14900 and PC3-17000. [...] 260-pin UniDIMMs may contain either DDR3 or DDR4 SDRAM, {{depending on their}} configuration. Some SO-DIMMs also provide ECC functionality; <b>unbuffered</b> ECC SO-DIMMs are called SO-CDIMMs.|$|E
50|$|In November 2006, AMD {{released}} a specialized version of Socket F, called 1207 FX, for dual-socket, dual-core Athlon FX processors on the Quad FX platform. While Socket F Opterons already allowed for four processor cores, Quad FX allowed <b>unbuffered</b> RAM and expanded CPU/chipset configuration in the BIOS. Consequentially, Socket F and F 1207 FX are incompatible and require different processors, chipsets, and motherboards.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Unbuffered</b> pipelines, called [...] "wave pipelines", do {{not have}} {{registers}} in-between pipeline stages. Instead, the delays in the pipeline are [...] "balanced" [...] so that, for each stage, {{the difference between the}} first stabilized output data and the last is minimized. Thus, data flows in [...] "waves" [...] through the pipeline, and each wave is kept as short (synchronous) as possible.|$|E
50|$|Items {{that contain}} bone, antler, and horn {{should always be}} lifted and moved {{in a manner that}} is fully {{supportive}} and does not place unnecessary stress on weak areas or attachment points; using an acid-free tray is highly recommended. These objects can also be protected further by being wrapped in <b>unbuffered,</b> acid-free tissue paper and/or placed in a sealed polyethylene bag when being transported.|$|E
50|$|Character special files or {{character}} devices provide <b>unbuffered,</b> {{direct access}} to the hardware device. They do not necessarily allow programs to read or write single characters at a time; that is up to the device in question. The character device for a hard disk, for example, will normally require that all reads and writes are aligned to block boundaries and most certainly will not allow reading a single byte.|$|E
50|$|Instruments may be {{built with}} an {{internal}} preamplifier, or may {{put out a}} <b>unbuffered</b> transducer signal. While such signals may be fed directly to an amplifier or mixing board, they often benefit from an external preamp/equalizer {{on the end of}} a short cable, before being fed to the sound system. In rock and other loud styles, the electric viola player may use effects units such as reverb or overdrive.|$|E
50|$|Paper {{enclosures}} protect {{objects from}} light, but {{may result in}} increased handling for viewing. Paper enclosures must be acid-free, lignin-free, and are available in both buffered (alkaline, pH 8.5) and <b>unbuffered</b> (neutral, pH 7) stock. Storage materials must pass the ANSI Photographic Activity Test (PAT) which is noted in suppliers’ catalogs. Paper enclosures also protects the photographs from the accumulation of moisture and detrimental gases and are relatively inexpensive.|$|E
50|$|The Single Unix Specification {{defines the}} {{operation}} of cat to read files in the sequence given in its arguments, writing their contents to the standard output in the same sequence. The specification mandates the support of one option flag, u for <b>unbuffered</b> output, meaning that each byte is written {{after it has been}} read. Some operating systems, like the ones using GNU Coreutils, do this by default and ignore the flag.|$|E
5000|$|Memory: 4 GB maximum, 2 slots DDR2, 1.8 volt <b>unbuffered,</b> {{asymmetric}} or interleaved operation supported. Intel specifies {{that the}} chipset only supports 533 to 667 MHz memory clock speed is supported however HP Pre-sales telephone support has stated twice that the motherboard supports 533 to 800 MHz memory. The sales team does not differentiate between compatibility and utilization. 800 MHz DDR2 is being installed for orders that include 800 MHz-capable processors.|$|E
50|$|On {{the bottom}} edge of 168-pin DIMMs there are two notches, and the {{location}} of each notch determines a particular feature of the module. The first notch is the DRAM key position, which represents RFU (reserved future use), registered, and <b>unbuffered</b> DIMM types (left, middle and right position, respectively). The second notch is the voltage key position, which represents 5.0 V, 3.3 V, and RFU DIMM types (order is the same as above).|$|E
5000|$|The 1,482 ft bridge carries Grays Ferry Avenue {{across the}} river and the Northeast Corridor main line. Built of steel girders, it has four traffic lanes and two {{pedestrian}} sidewalks. There are also [...] "painted, <b>unbuffered</b> bike lanes, but high prevailing speeds on the immediately adjacent motor vehicle lanes and significant debris in the bike lanes make the bike lanes uncomfortable for many bicyclists," [...] said a 2012 City of Philadelphia report.|$|E
5000|$|Socket G34 (LGA 1944 contacts) {{is one of}} {{the third}} {{generation}} of Opteron sockets, along with Socket C32. This socket supports Magny-Cours Opteron 6100, Bulldozer-based Interlagos Opteron 6200, and Piledriver-based [...] "Abu Dhabi" [...] Opteron 6300 series processors. This socket supports four channels of DDR3 SDRAM (two per CPU die). Unlike previous multi-CPU Opteron sockets, Socket G34 CPUs will function with <b>unbuffered</b> ECC or non-ECC RAM in addition to the traditional registered ECC RAM.|$|E
