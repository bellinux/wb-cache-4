500|$|Brown's trial {{came before}} the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The {{presiding}} judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week. The weakness of the case was {{directly related to the}} provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed <b>unsworn</b> <b>testimony</b> to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could weigh the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an [...] "uncivilised person or persons" [...] was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given [...] "great suspicion rested on the case", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.|$|E
2500|$|The indictments {{charge that}} the lane {{closures}} were retribution against Sokolich for not endorsing Christie. Fishman said that Wildstein had corroborated the allegations in the indictments, {{and said that the}} three officials [...] "agreed to and did use public resources to carry out a vendetta and exact retribution," [...] and that they [...] "callously victimized the people of Fort Lee." [...] Kelly vigorously denied wrongdoing. Baroni argued that his indictment was improperly based on the <b>unsworn</b> <b>testimony</b> and documents he had provided to the legislative committee in 2014, but prosecutors countered that he had not been offered immunity at that time.|$|E

50|$|A {{small but}} {{significant}} modification of criminal procedure, the substitution (by 1 Anne, stat. ii. c. 9, s. 3) of sworn for <b>unsworn</b> <b>testimony</b> {{on behalf of the}} prisoner in cases of treason and felony, appears to have been due to Wright's initiative. His decrees in chancery are reported by Vernon and Peere Williams.|$|E
50|$|At trial, {{the judge}} {{held that the}} child was not {{competent}} to give <b>unsworn</b> <b>testimony</b> and that he would not admit the statements made by the child to her mother about the assault as it was hearsay and could not fall into the “spontaneous declaration” exception as it was not contemporaneous. On the basis of this finding, Khan was acquitted.|$|E

50|$|An inquiry {{was set up}} in 2014, {{initially}} constituted as a panel. However {{this led}} to public complaints on several grounds - that the panel's scope was too limited (and specifically it could not compel sworn or <b>unsworn</b> <b>testimony),</b> and that those involved had past links to those persons and bodies known to have been sexual abusers or who might be investigated as part of the panel's work, and therefore that the panel's independence from the establishment was in question. Two chairs were appointed and resigned in 2014, both having had past links with possible subjects of the inquiry. The inquiry was therefore finally re-established as a statutory inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005, in February 2015, and a New Zealand High Court judge appointed, to address these concerns.|$|E
5000|$|Presentation {{of all the}} evidence, with endless details, {{continued}} for nearly another month, {{at the rate of}} two sittings a day. The most notable witnesses were Casimir-Perier, Commander Freystaetter (one of the judges of 1894)—both in violent opposition to Mercier-Charavay, who, though seriously ill, came loyally forward to acknowledge his error of 1894, and Bertillon, who repeated his claims as to the [...] "autoforgery" [...] of the bordereau, adding fresh complications. At the last moment Colonel Jouaust, behind closed doors, using his discretionary power, took <b>unsworn</b> <b>testimony</b> from a Serbian named Czernuski, formerly an Austrian officer. This man, who was generally considered unhinged, told a confused story of how a civil official and a staff officer [...] "of a Central European Power" [...] had assured him that Dreyfus was a spy. Although this story was worthless, Labori took advantage of it to demand in turn that the evidence of Schwartzkoppen and Panizzardi be admitted. This was refused. The German government, on its part, inserted a notice in the official gazette of Berlin (8 September), repeating in formal terms the statement made by the chancellor von Bülow on 24 January 1898 before a commission of the Reichstag, declaring that the German government had never had any dealings whatever with Dreyfus.|$|E
5000|$|The Kono Statement {{has been}} the target of {{criticism}} by some conservatives in Japan. It is still debated whether the statement acknowledged that coercion had been used in the recruitment and retention of the women by the Japanese Imperial Army directly, as the recruitment was believed to be mainly conducted by private recruiting agents (both Korean and Japanese). Current Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, during his first term as Prime Minister in 2007, stated that he did not believe women were coerced by the Japanese army into working at military brothels. [...] Nobuo Ishihara, deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary {{at the time of the}} drafting of the Kono Statement, has stated in <b>unsworn</b> <b>testimony</b> to the National Diet that no written records verifying the accounts of the 16 women who were interviewed during the course of the investigation could be discovered. One article published in the New York Times asserts that [...] "There is little evidence that the Japanese military abducted or was directly involved in entrapping women in Korea, which had been a Japanese colony for decades when the war began, although the women and activists who support them say the women were often deceived and forced to work against their will." [...] However, the same article also states that, [...] "Many were deceived with offers of jobs in factories and hospitals and then forced to provide sex for imperial soldiers in the comfort stations. In Southeast Asia, there is evidence that Japanese soldiers simply kidnapped women to work in the brothels." [...] According to an article published by the Japanese newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, [...] "Prostitution agents were prevalent due to the poverty and patriarchal family system. For that reason, even if the military was not directly involved, it is said it was possible to gather many women through such methods as work-related scams and human trafficking." ...|$|E
