40|$|A {{series of}} flame retardant-containing <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> have been developed. The flame retardants include {{expandable}} graphite and phosphorous-containing materials (ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPP)). The effects of incorporating different flame retardants into the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> were investigated by UL- 94, DSC, TGA, LOI, MTGA, Py/GC/MS and adiabatic bomb calorimeter. The {{results indicate that}} the flame-retarding effect of APP type flame retardant was better than that of the TPP type as the phosphorous-containing flame retardant was the sole additive in this system. Moreover, the flame-retarded effect was further improved as the phosphorous-containing flame retardant and expandable graphite were both added to the polyester. This indicates that a pronounced additive effect was present as the expandable graphite was added to the phosphorous-containing <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters,</b> especially the APP-containing type.

50|$|<b>Unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> are {{thermosetting}} resins. They {{are generally}} copolymers prepared by polymerizing {{one or more}} diol with saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids (maleic acid, fumaric acid...) or their anhydrides. The double bond of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> reacts with a vinyl monomer, usually styrene, resulting in a 3-D cross-linked structure. This structure acts as a thermoset. The exothermic cross-linking reaction is initiated through a catalyst, usually an organic peroxide such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide or benzoyl peroxide.|$|R

2500|$|Polyurethanes are in {{the class}} of {{compounds}} called reaction polymers, which include epoxies, <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters,</b> and phenolics. [...] Polyurethanes are produced by reacting an isocyanate containing two or more isocyanate groups per molecule (R−(N=C=O)n) with a polyol containing on average two or more hydroxyl groups per molecule (R′−(OH)n) {{in the presence of a}} catalyst or by activation with ultraviolet light.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> are {{condensation}} polymers {{formed by}} the reaction of polyols (also known as polyhydric alcohols), organic compounds with multiple alcohol or hydroxy functional groups, with saturated or unsaturated dibasic acids. Typical polyols used are glycols such as ethylene glycol; acids used are phthalic acid and maleic acid. Water, a by-product of esterification reactions, is continuously removed, driving the reaction to completion. The use of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> and additives such as styrene lowers the viscosity of the resin. The initially liquid resin is converted to a solid by cross-linking chains. This is done by creating free radicals at unsaturated bonds, which propagate in a chain reaction to other unsaturated bonds in adjacent molecules, linking them in the process. The initial free radicals are induced by adding a compound that easily decomposes into free radicals. This compound is usually and incorrectly known as the catalyst [...] Initiator is the more correct term. Substances used are generally organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide or methyl ethyl ketone peroxide.|$|R

40|$|<b>Unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> {{based on}} {{ethylene}} glycol have been synthesized {{using a variety}} of anhydride, saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and various catalysts. The structure of the polyesters and the effect of the different compositions on the colour of cured polyesters are studied by FTIR, DSC and colorimetry. The structure of cured polyesters greatly depends on the isomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid during polyesterification. The colour of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> cured with the most common curing system (MEKP as initiator and CoNp as accelerator) is firstly influenced by the curing accelerator CoNp via the d-d transitions of the transition metal cobalt. Secondly, the composition of the dicarboxylic acids and anhydride used in the polyesterification influences the colour of the polyesters which depends especially on the isomerization of maleic acid. The cured maleate polyesters have more unreacted double bonds and more polar structure {{because of the presence of}} carbonyl groups, compared to the corresponding fumarate polyesters, and this structure affects the colour. The residual catalysts from the polyesterification have minor influence on the colour of cured polyesters. Copyright (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} {{aliphatic}} polyesters based on succinic acid were synthesized by copolymerization with adipic acid {{for the first}} series of saturated polyesters, and with fumaric acid for the second series. Polyesters were prepared starting from the corresponding dimethyl esters and 1, 4 -butanediol by melt transesterification {{in the presence of}} a highly effective catalyst tetra-n-butyl-titanate, Ti(0 Bu) 4. The molecular structure and composition of the copolyesters was determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The effect of copolymer composition on the physical and thermal properties of these random polyesters were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. The degree of crystallinity was determined by DSC and wide angle X-ray. The degrees of crystallinity of the saturated and unsaturated copolyesters were generally reduced with respect to poly(butylene succinate), PBS. The melting temperatures of the saturated polyesters were lower, while the melting temperatures of the unsaturated copolyesters were higher than the melting temperature of PBS. The biodegradability of the polyesters was investigated by enzymatic degradation tests. The enzymatic degradation tests were performed in a buffer solution with Candida cylindracea lipase and for the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> with Rhizopus arrhizus lipase. The extent of biodegradation was quantified as the weight loss of polyester films. Also the surface of the polyester films after degradation was observed using optical microscopy. It could be concluded that the biodegradability depended strongly on the degree of crystallinity, but also on the flexibility of the chain backbone. The highest biodegradation was observed for copolyesters containing 50 mol. % of adipic acid units, and in the series of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> for copolyesters containing 5 and 10 mol. % of fumarate units. Although the degree of crystallinity of the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> decreased slightly with increasing unsaturation, the biodegradation was not enhanced suggesting that not only the chemical structure and molecular stiffness but also the morphology of the spherulites influenced the biodegradation properties...|$|R
