40|$|For decades, the {{valuation}} of <b>unquoted</b> <b>shares</b> has raised considerable difficulties for national accountants and national accounts users alike. While these shares represent huge amounts {{on the balance}} sheets of the main economic sectors, there is no objective way of determining their value {{in accordance with the}} general principles defined by international methodologies, as they are not priced on any stock exchange. The article describes first the early stages of French methodology and the harmonisation process in Europe, which resulted in the ESA 95. The second part assesses and compares, at a theoretical and practical level, different ways of interpreting the ESA 95 guidelines. The third part is devoted to a statistical survey which enables us to compare, at these levels, the various estimates of French assets in <b>unquoted</b> <b>shares,</b> for 1998 and 1999.

Since April 1, 2007, non-deposit taking NBFCs with assets of `1 billion and above are being classified as Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking NBFCs (NBFCs-ND-SI), and prudential regulations, such as capital adequacy requirements and exposure norms along with reporting requirements, have been made applicable to them. The asset liability management (ALM) reporting and disclosure norms have also been made applicable to them at different points of time.|$|R
40|$|Share {{issues are}} a {{significant}} source of finance for non-financial corporations in Belgium. Between 1995 and 2005, they represented around 32 p. c. of the cumulative new liabilities of non-financial corporations. Share issues are therefore the second most important source of finance, the first being non-bank credit, which accounts for 51 p. c. of the total. Share issues are a much more important source of funding than bank credit and issues of fixed-income securities. <b>Unquoted</b> <b>shares</b> represent the major part of this, namely 27 p. c., mainly because of the high level of foreign direct investment. Quoted shares represented only 5 p. c. of the cumulative new liabilities of non-financial corporations during the period 1995 - 2005. An empirical analysis of the determinants of the capital structure highlights the fact that quoted companies having more intangible fixed assets are more inclined to opt for equity financing. Conversely, other factors, such as the company’s debt level, size and internal resources have a negative influence on equity financing. The timing of the use of this type of financing depends partly on macroeconomic factors such as real and financial investments of the corporations. The cost of capital may also be regarded as a key determinant of the use of equity financing over time. Substantial issues were recorded during the period 1999 - 2001 and from mid 2005 onwards. These developments coincided with either a cost of capital well below its long-run average or a movement in the cost of capital which was more favourable than the price of alternative sources of finance. The recent government measure aimed at allowing the deduction of notional interest charges could also give a substantial boost to new share issues. capital structure, corporate finance, equities...|$|R
