5|$|On 23 April, Berzarin's 5th Shock Army and Katukov's 1st Guards Tank Army {{assaulted}} Berlin {{from the}} south-east and, after overcoming a counter-attack by the German LVI Panzer Corps, reached the Berlin S-Bahn ring railway {{on the north}} side of the Teltow Canal by the evening of 24 April. During the same period, of all the German forces ordered to reinforce the inner defences of the city by Hitler, only a small contingent of French SS volunteers under the command of SS Brigadeführer Gustav Krukenberg arrived in Berlin. During 25 April, Krukenberg was appointed as the commander of Defence Sector C, the sector <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pressure from the Soviet assault on the city.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March, at the Battle of Craonne, another {{incident}} occurred, seemingly indicating {{that there had}} been some sort of disagreement between the General and the Emperor. As the battle was raging, General Belliard from the Emperor's staff came to Nansouty and told him that he had orders to relieve him of command should his health prevent him from exercising his duties. Nansouty responded that he was indeed ill, but {{that he was able to}} retain command. Although in unusually bad humour after this incident, Nansouty subsequently led a most brilliant action at Craonne. He was ordered to cross bogged and broken terrain, and climb a steep incline with his cavalry and artillery, in order to fall on the enemy's right flank. Managing to bring his cavalrymen on the ridge, Nansouty formed them in line and launched them against the enemy, pushing back in disorder two Russian battalions. Nansouty was again wounded during this action, but this injury was not very serious and he continued to energetically lead his men. Napoleon then allegedly ordered Nansouty to assault a redoubt, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> murderous fire. Nonetheless, Nansouty ordered his men to halt and advanced alone towards the position. Asked to explain his behaviour, he replied that he would not send his men to die in vain and that he would be attacking alone. Napoleon at once revoked his order.|$|E

The different fish samples {{have been collected}} since {{the establishment of the}} Department of Marine Science and Fisheries (MSAF) in 1986. The fish samples identified by the MSAF were compared with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> recent published book on the Coastal Fishes of Oman. The number of Omani fishes (from both fresh water and sea water) totalled 1179, distributed in 527 genera, 165 families and 37 orders. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> Chondrichtyes, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> diverse family was Carcharhinidae with a total of 25 species and 8 genera.

25|$|In 1894 Lockwood and Richardson, {{with their}} pace and sharp break-back, were an irresistible {{combination}} {{on the many}} treacherous wickets. Lockwood's bowling reached its highest point, though, against Yorkshire at the Oval when Richardson was injured: he took 7 for 94 on a very true pitch to win the match that decided the Championship. Lockwood's batting did not suffer from the advance of his bowling: indeed he frequently opened with Bobby Abel in 1894 and scored over 900 runs <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> difficult conditions. After demolishing Kent on a perfect batting wicket in the last match at The Oval, he and Richardson were chosen to tour Australia.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it resembles}} a vacuum tube in appearance, its {{operation}} {{does not depend}} on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), and is a variant of the neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed 40°C (104°F) even <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, {{not to be confused with}} a control grid), and shaped bare metal cathodes.|$|E

25|$|Johor alone resisted, by modernising {{and giving}} British and Chinese investors legal protection. By {{the turn of}} the 20th century, the states of Pahang, Selangor, Perak, and Negeri Sembilan, known {{together}} as the Federated Malay States, had British advisors. In 1909 the Siamese kingdom was compelled to cede Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu, which already had British advisors, over to the British. Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor and Queen Victoria were personal acquaintances who recognised each other as equals. It was not until 1914 that Sultan Abu Bakar's successor, Sultan Ibrahim, accepted a British adviser. The four previously Thai states and Johor were known as the Unfederated Malay States. The states <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> direct British control developed rapidly, becoming the largest suppliers in the world of first tin, then rubber.|$|E
25|$|With every geometry, Felix Klein {{associated}} {{an underlying}} group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically {{represented as a}} hierarchy of these groups, and hierarchy of their invariants. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved {{with respect to the}} Euclidean group of symmetries, while only the incidence structure and the cross-ratio are preserved <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> general projective transformations. A concept of parallelism, which is preserved in affine geometry, is not meaningful in projective geometry. Then, by abstracting the underlying groups of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a subgroup of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is a priori meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).|$|E
25|$|Despite {{this initial}} donation, {{a lack of}} funds was to plague University College, Bristol up until the {{donations}} which allowed it to lobby for a Royal Charter. Initially the financial response to the meeting was disappointing, with the College gaining only £25,991 of the £40,000 funds which it asked for. It was at this stage that the Wills family {{became involved in the}} project with Henry Overton Wills donating £250 to the project. The lacklustre response to the call for funds had the immediate result of delaying the opening of the College until 1876, and meant that when it did open it was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> stringent financial conditions. Shelborne notes that the setting up of the College struggled {{due to the fact that}} Bristol lacked a significant industry which saw benefit in the creation a college, an absence of the nouveaux riches, and no philanthropic industrialists who wished to highlight the importance of Bristol.|$|E

25|$|In June 2007, the {{campaign}} group Greengauge 21, led by Jim Steer, published {{a proposal for}} High Speed Two. It evaluated options for high-speed rail in the UK and recommended an £11bn route from London St Pancras and Heathrow to Birmingham and the North West, which they dubbed HS2. The report recommended the new line be built in the M40/Chiltern Main Line corridor, and used it {{as the basis for}} its findings. This route has the greatest strategic advantage, as the Chiltern Main Line is a popular alternative to the WCML from Birmingham to London, and also lends the opportunity to build a branch line to Heathrow Airport, giving the passengers served by the WCML a direct service to one of the world's premier international airports. The WCML is also the corridor which would be <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pressure in the next 15 – 20years. A connection to High Speed 1 would allow Eurostar terminals to open in Birmingham and Manchester.|$|E
25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} semi-final between South Africa and England, the match ended in {{controversial}} circumstances when, after a 10-minute rain delay, {{the most productive}} overs method revised South Africa's target from 22 runs from 13 balls to an impossible 21 runs from one ball. This rule was replaced for One Day International matches in Australia after the World Cup {{as a result of}} this incident, and it was eventually superseded by the Duckworth–Lewis method for the 1999 World Cup onwards. According to the late Bill Frindall, had the Duckworth–Lewis method been applied at that rain interruption, the revised target would have been four runs to tie or five to win from the final ball. As a point of clarity, ESPN points out that England's innings was cut short when the overs weren't completed by 6:10p.m. (the rescheduled close of innings time), Cricinfo say that had Duckworth–Lewis been applied to the entire game, South Africa's target from the original 45 overs would have been 273, which would then have been reduced to 257 from 43 overs, i.e. five runs more than they were set <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> productive overs rule.|$|E
