40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{important}} {{problem in the}} last phase of manufacturing in the textile industry. This involves cutting large lengths of fabric into smaller pieces, which are then wrapped around rolls. The quality of cloth rolls transported to the customer is specified {{by the quality of}} fabric pieces that make up the roll. A piece of fabric falls within a given quality category if some of its characteristics, such as, piece length, the number of critical defects per metre, and the defective score per metre, are compatible with the corresponding quality specifications. Naturally, the <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> per metre of fabric is proportional to the quality category. Thus, it becomes necessary to determine an optimal cutting strategy of very long woven fabric (e. g. 2000 m) into smaller pieces (e. g. each 130 m long at most), which involves a difficult continuous assignment problem of identifying the optimal cutting: locations of pieces overlapping with defects of known lengths and locations. Not only must the scrap be minimized but the overall profit per metre fabric should be maximized. The two objectives may not always support each other due to relative <b>unit</b> <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> of various quality categories. The solution to this problem has an immediate impact on company profit. The mathematical formulation of the problem involves numerous binary variables as well as continuous variables. A Mutative Simulated Annealing approach is proposed here to solve this problem. The solution technique is tested both on real data obtained from a textile manufacturer and hypothetical data.

5000|$|Average prices represent, quite simply, {{total sales}} revenue divided by total units sold. Many products, however, {{are sold in}} {{multiple}} variants, such as bottle sizes. In these cases, managers face a challenge: they must determine 'comparable' units. Average prices can be calculated by weighting different <b>unit</b> <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> by the percentage of unit sales (mix) for each product variant. If we use a standard, rather than an actual mix of sizes and product varieties, the result is price per statistical unit. Statistical units are also known as equivalent units. Average price per unit and prices per statistical unit are needed by marketers who sell the same product in different packages, sizes, forms, or configurations {{at a variety of}} different prices. As in analyses of different channels, these product and price variations must be reflected accurately in overall average prices. If they are not, marketers may lose sight of what is happening to prices and why. If the price of each product variant remained unchanged, for example, but there was a shift in the mix of volume sold, then the average price per unit would change, but the price per statistical unit would not. Both of these metrics have value in identifying market movements. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 51 percent responded that they found the [...] "average price per unit" [...] metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses, while only 16% found [...] "price per statistical unit" [...] very useful.|$|R

According to the production data, in organic farming direct costs per hectare were lower in all of the four examined crops. Even cost per production unit and contribution were more favourable in three of the investigated crops. Regarding the calculation done by economy models, the costs per hectare relating to the two production methods were not significantly different.

We apply a multilevel version of structured additive regression (STAR) models to regress house prices on individual attributes and locational neighborhood characteristics in a four level hierarchical model.

The framework thus allows to incorporate nonlinear covariate effects and time trends, smooth spatial effects and complex interactions {{at every level of}} the hierarchy of the multilevel model. Moreover we are able to decompose the spatial heterogeneity effect and investigate its magnitude at different spatial resolutions allowing for improved predictive quality even in the case of unobserved spatial units.

The <b>unit</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> and the unit purchasing price are equal; 2. At {{the end of the}} credit period, the account is settled. The retailer starts paying for higher interest charges on the items in stock and returns money of the remaining balance immediately when the items are sold. But these assumptions are debatable in real-life situations. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to modify Goyal’s model to allow the <b>unit</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> and the unit purchasing price not necessarily be equal to reflect the real-life situations. Furthermore, this paper will adopt different payment rule. We assume that the retailer uses sales revenue during the permissible credit period to make payment to the supplier at the end of the credit period. If it is not enough to pay off the purchasing cost of all items, the retailer will pay off the remaining balance by taking loan from the bank. So, the retailer starts paying for the interest charges on the amount of loan from the bank after the account is settled. Then the retailer will return money to the bank at the end of the inventory cycle. Under these conditions, we model the retailer’s inventory system as a cost minimization problem to determine the retailer’s optimal cycle time and optimal order quantity. Four cases are developed to efficiently determine the optimal cycle time and the optimal order quantity. Numerical examples are given to illustrate these cases. Comparing with Goyal’s model, we also find that the optimal cycle times in this paper are not longer than those of Goyal’s model...|$|E
