50|$|An {{integrating}} sphere (also {{known as an}} <b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere)</b> is an optical component consisting of a hollow spherical cavity with its interior covered with a diffuse white reflective coating, with small holes for entrance and exit ports. Its relevant property is a uniform scattering or diffusing effect. Light rays incident on any point on the inner surface are, by multiple scattering reflections, distributed equally to all other points. The effects of the original direction of light are minimized. An {{integrating sphere}} may {{be thought of as}} a diffuser which preserves power but destroys spatial information. It is typically used with some light source and a detector for optical power measurement. A similar device is the focusing or Coblentz sphere, which differs in that it has a mirror-like (specular) inner surface rather than a diffuse inner surface.Although the sphere system is used for infrared spectral measurements, the measurement method, design principles, and features are generally applicable to other wavelengths as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{short term}} {{and long term}} {{stability}} of an <b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere</b> was investigated by comparing its radiation at four Balmer wavelengths with those of two Sylvania projector lamps. A slight positive trend in the radiation intensity of the <b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere</b> was observed. This was attributed {{to a change in}} the molecular structure of the paint used to cover the inside of the sphere. However, the radiance varied less than 3 % for 14 h burning time. The uncertainty in the primary calibration of the Tungsten standard lamp was given as ± 3 % in the wavelength range 400 - 600 nm. It was hence concluded that the sphere is suitable for spectral calibration purposes for a period of 14 h operational time without being recalibrated. © 1981. Articl...|$|E
40|$|NOVELTY - Light radiation, {{captured}} by an <b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere</b> (1) {{serving as a}} diffuser, {{is fed to a}} light radiation detector (3) in the sphere. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An evaluation curve in the detector showing the biological B-potency from UV radiation {{as a function of the}} wave length, lambda, is combined with the spectral intensity distribution of radiation detected in the UV range and adjusted according to the wavelength dependence of the detector's sensitivity in such a way that a measuring signal sent out by the light detector (4) in the light radiation detector is shown on a display device (8) as a UV radiation index after preset calibration. USE - In health work, medical applications, etc. ADVANTAGE - This device can record sun radiation for high solar altitudes, including small zenith angles in the sun, and so record times of day in which the level of UV radiation causing skin damage is particularly relevant. DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows a diagram of a device for identifying indices on physiological exposure through UV radiation. <b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere</b> 1 Holes to admit light 2 Light radiation detector 3 Display device...|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} the directional optical properties of advanced fenestra-tion materials is necessary {{for them to be}} adequately integrated in buildings. These properties are expressed by the Bidirectional Transmission (or Reflection) Distribution Functions (BTDF, BRDF) of such elements, which are measured by specifically designed measuring equipment: an innovative, time-efficient bidirectional goniophotometer, based on digital imaging techniques, was de-signed and set up for that purpose. In this paper, the in-depth validation used for the bidirectional measurements performed with this apparatus is presented. It is based on different approaches including experimental error estimation, compar-isons to analytical or ray-tracing based models and to other measured data, and calculation of the directional-hemispherical transmittance (reflectance) gauged against measurements of the same systems with <b>Ulbricht</b> (integrating) <b>spheres.</b> The high accuracy and reliability of this novel device were confirmed by this detailed investigation, and led to a maximum error for BT(R) DF data of only 10 %...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{analytical}} {{model of the}} wireless infrared communication channel in indoor environments is presented. The infrared signal is modeled as {{the combination of a}} diffuse component and a line-of-sight (LOS) or direct component. For the diffuse component alone, the properties of the channel are found using <b>Ulbricht's</b> integrating <b>sphere.</b> When a LOS component is also present, the transfer function depends upon the Rician factor K given by the ratio of the electrical power in the LOS and diffuse signals after the detector. For small K, the transfer function shows notches down to low frequencies, but {{due to the nature of}} light never for zero frequency. We confirm that a K-factor >or= 13 dB is required also in infrared wireless links in order to support distortionless data transmission beyond 100 Mbit/s. Increasing the directivity at the receiver and/or at the transmitter improves the effective value of K. Here, we show that a moderate directivity will be sufficient for high-speed infrared communication in typical indoor scenarios...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{polarization}} and angular dependence of the absorption of a CO 2 laser (12 J- 1 ns) by polyester plane targets at fluxes of 5 x 1011 to 5 × 1012 W/cm 2. The fraction of absorption are obtained from the measurement of the entire reflexion at 10. 6 μm in an <b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere.</b> The results clearly show the presence of resonance absorption by a maximum of the absorption of p polarized light for angle of incidence of 20 - 27 °, as predicted by classical theory; however this mechanism {{is not sufficient to}} explain the values of absorption observed at normal incidence and predict a more important angular dependence of the absorption compared to the observation. A simple model including density modulations at the critical surface and magnetic field gives a good interpretation of the observed phenomena...|$|E
40|$|LTCC {{membranes}} {{are used}} as substrates of screen printed unimorph deformable mirrors. A high piezoelectric stroke is attributed to thin substrate materials. The application of deformable mirrors with high laser loads calls for a large heat spreading capability of the deformable unimorph mirrors. A large heat spreading capability is attributed to high thermal conductivity of the materials that is not allocated by LTCC. The present paper reports {{on the effect of}} internal silver conductor (DuPont 6145) on the heat spreading capability of the LTCC membrane. Therefore, internal silver conductor is applicated into a 570 µm thin membrane on a diameter of 49. 8 mm. The optical absorption of plain LTCC membranes and membranes with internal metallization is characterized by an <b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere.</b> Membranes with internal silver conductor and a reference sample without internal metallization (plain LTCC) are loaded with a laser beam. The absorbed laser power heats the LTCC membrane. We investigate the temperature increase upon one-Watt laser loading and prove a 37 % lower setting maximum temperature (Tmax) for membranes with internal silver conductor compared to plain LTCC membranes. The characteristics of temperature over time are similar to the charging of a capacitor. The time constant for the internally metallized and plain LTCC membrane at same peak temperatures are similar. These results show the potential of internal silver conductor to increase the heat spreading capability of LTCC membranes...|$|E
40|$|A new {{optical wave}} gauge {{was built to}} measure {{simultaneously}} two statistical parameters of wind induced water surface waves, namely the surface slope and surface amplitude probability distribution functions. The new instrument was tested in a linear wind wave flume with a water depth of 10 cm. The surface slope is determined using the refraction of light at the water surface. The wave amplitude is measured using the absorption of infrared light in the water column. The wave gauge consists of a point-like dichromatic light source which is positioned under the flume (<b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere</b> with high-power LEDs, (RED = 632 nm and IR = 850 nm) and a camera above the flume that looks vertically through the water into the light source. No other optical components are needed. The light source is pulsed and the camera is triggered. The images show light speckles whose positions are a measure for the wave slope. The relative intensities are a measure for the wave amplitude. These quantities are derived from the digital images by means of image processing and simple geometrical considerations. The influence of different analysis methods on the wave slope and amplitude distribution was studied. For the characterization of the new linear wind wave flume in the Institut fuer Umweltphysik (IUP), Heidelberg, mean square slope and root mean square wave height were measured for a wind speed up to 6. 7 m/s and a fetch between 0. 80 m and 2. 40 m. The findings agree with comparable measurements in other linear wind wave flumes...|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{concentration}} was elevated throughout 3 years around {{stands of}} the C 3 sedge Scirpus olneyi on a tidal marsh of the Chesapeake Bay. The hypothesis that tissues developed in an elevated CO 2 atmosphere will show an acclimatory decrease in photosynthetic capacity under light-limiting conditions was examined. The absorbed light quantum yield of CO 2 uptake (øabs and {{the efficiency of}} photosystem II photochemistry were determined for plants which had developed in open top chambers with CO 2 concentrations in air of 680 micromoles per mole, and of 351 micromoles per mole as controls. An <b>Ulbricht</b> <b>sphere</b> cuvette incorporated into an open gas exchange system {{was used to determine}} øabs and a portable chlorophyll fluorimeter was used to estimate the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II. When measured in an atmosphere with 10 millimoles per mole O 2 to suppress photorespiration, shoots showed a øabs of 0. 093 ± 0. 003, with no statistically significant difference between shoots grown in elevated or control CO 2 concentrations. Efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry was also unchanged by development in an elevated CO 2 atmosphere. Shoots grown and measured in 680 micromoles per mole of CO 2 in air showed a øabs of 0. 078 ± 0. 004 compared with 0. 065 ± 0. 003 for leaves grown and measured in 351 micromoles per mole CO 2 in air; a highly significant increase. In accordance with the change in øabs, the light compensation point of photosynthesis decreased from 51 ± 3 to 31 ± 3 micro-moles per square meter per second for stems grown and measured in 351 and 680 micromoles per mole of CO 2 in air, respectively. The results suggest that even after 3 years of growth in elevated CO 2, {{there is no evidence of}} acclimation in capacity for photosynthesis under light-limited conditions which would counteract the stimulation of photosynthetic CO 2 uptake otherwise expected through decreased photorespiration...|$|E
