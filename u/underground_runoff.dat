40|$|The {{mountains}} of Central Asia are a unique source of fresh water. Runoff {{of the large}} rivers in the regions, such as the Ili, Shu, Talas, Syrdarya, Amudarya, Zeravshan, Atrek, Karatal, Aksu, Lepsa, etc., is formed in the high altitude mountains. A cascade of water reservoirs used for irrigation and power generation controls the runoff. Many small rivers start in the foothills {{as a result of}} <b>underground</b> <b>runoff</b> discharge. Their water is used to irrigate agricultural land in the piedmont valleys...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} on soil erosion by different bedrock bareness ratios, different rainfall intensities, different underground pore fissure degrees and rainfall duration are researched through manual simulation of microrelief characteristics of karst bare slopes and underground karst crack construction {{in combination with}} artificial simulation of rainfall experiment. The results show that firstly, when the rainfall intensity is small (30 and 50 mm h − 1), no bottom load loss is produced on the surface, and surface runoff, <b>underground</b> <b>runoff</b> and sediment production are increased with the increasing of rainfall intensity. Secondly, surface runoff and sediment production reduced with increased underground pore fissure degree, while <b>underground</b> <b>runoff</b> and sediment production increased. Thirdly, raindrops hit the surface, forming a crust with rainfall duration. The formation of crusts increases surface runoff erosion and reduces soil infiltration rate. This formation also increases surface-runoff-erosion-damaged crust and increased soil seepage rate. Raindrops continued to hit the surface, leading the formation of crust. Soil permeability showed volatility which was from reduction to increases, reduction, and so on. Surface and subsurface runoff were volatile with rainfall duration. Fourthly, when rock bareness ratio is 50 % and rainfall intensities are 30 and 50 mm h − 1, runoff is not produced on the surface, and the slope runoff and sediment production present a fluctuating change with increased rock bareness ratio. Fifthly, the correlation degree between the slope runoff and sediment production and all factors are as follows: rainfall intensity-rainfall duration-underground pore fissure degree–bedrock bareness ratio...|$|E
40|$|Although many {{observational}} researches on {{the experimental}} basin {{have been carried}} out inthe world, including our research, it is not confirmed whether the research results in the basin canbe extrapolated to estimate the runoff hydrograph from a large river basin, or not. This paperdescribes the relation between runoff hydrographs from a small basin (Ara experimental basin) andfrom a large basin (Ara River basin) including the small one. It is obtained under several assumptions that 1) For the direct runoff whose runoff field is the surface of mountain slope, the hydrographfrom a large river basin can be calculated directly using the hydrograph from a small basin includedin it. 2) For the indirect runoff whose runoff field is the <b>underground,</b> the <b>runoff</b> from a small basincan not be extrapolated directly to the one from the large river basin...|$|R
50|$|Springfield Lake is a {{small lake}} located in Middle Sackville, Halifax Regional Municipality. The {{shoreline}} perimeter is 5.6 km, the mean depth is 3 m and the maximum depth is 5 m (Mandaville 2000). Springfield is a headwater lake that is fed solely by <b>underground</b> springs and <b>runoff.</b> Located in the Shubenacadie watershed, it ultimately feeds into the Bay of Fundy. It lies in pyretic slate bedrock that is high in hydrogen and sulphur (Kerekes et al. 1986). The shoreline is fully developed (lined by private homes and cottages) with over 530 houses in the 500 ha watershed. Homes on streets adjacent to the lake receive municipal sewage treatment. There is a HRM Water Pollution Control Plant (secondary sludge activation), constructed in 1987, that discharges effluent into a stream outflowing {{at the north end}} of the lake. There is a public beach at the northwestern end of the Lake.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the {{findings}} of a field study performed from 2002 to 2003 near the city of Yan an, which is in a gullied hilly region of the loess plateau of China. The two-year system survey monitored the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall, soil moisture, underground flow (springs), and overflow in the Kang gou catchment in the Yan gou watershed near Yan an. The authors analysed the inner mechanism of interaction between rainfall, soil moisture, <b>underground</b> flow and <b>runoff</b> modules by comparing the values of these parameters {{in order to understand the}} hydrological responses in an eco-construction project. The results show that the eco-construction did not cause a decrease in runoff in heavy rainfall but could fully absorb lowintensity rainfall of long duration. The soil moisture increased along with downside slope, and spring flow increased with higher soil water content too. When runoff happened, spring flow sometimes would increase for the next 3 10 days. In general, the purpose of eco-construction in the loess plateau is to enable sustainable water use, which is very necessary to implement the region s ongoing Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) projects including reforestation and grassland restoration. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
40|$|The land use/cover change (LUCC) {{directly}} incarnates {{and represents}} {{the influence of}} the human activities, and produces quite significant effects on the hydrological cycle. The LUCC influence on hydrological cycle factors such as ET, runoff and so on was quantitatively simulated for Haihe river basin. The simulation results show that, a great LUCC change of this basin occurred during the period from 1995 to 2000, and this change produced tremendous effects on the results of SWAT hydrological simulation. A general response of Haihe river basin to the human activities is the increasing of ET, the decreasing of surface runoff and <b>underground</b> <b>runoff,</b> as well as the decreasing of soil moisture content...|$|E
40|$|Modern process {{studies of}} the hydrologic balance and {{sediment}} flux {{into and out of}} Lake El'gygytgyn, central Chukotka, provide important quantitative estimates for better understanding the lacustrine paleoclimate record from this basin. Formed ca. 3. 6 Ma {{as a result of a}} meteorite impact, the basin contains one of the longest paleoclimate records in the Arctic. Fluvial activity into the basin today is concentrated over the short snowmelt period. Recent lake-level changes have a slow regressive character due to active <b>underground</b> <b>runoff,</b> even during winter. The residence time of the lake-water is estimated to be about 100 yr. The main source of clastic material are incoming steams. The amount of sediment discharge through the outflow river is insignificant and completely compensated even by little aeolian input...|$|E
40|$|International audienceResults from {{geophysical}} investigations (electrical resistivity, electromagnetic mapping and seismic refraction) on an excavated cell of the Ouled Fayet (Algiers, Algeria) pilot landfill {{indicated the}} presence of an <b>underground</b> <b>runoff</b> and permeable soil underneath the cell. These results contradict those obtained by a feasibility study, based, however, only on the analysis of seventy-six 10 -m drilling cores. The 1 D boreholes information has been proven to be insufficient and to give biased results. The presence of water at depth is evidenced by lower resistivity, high conductivity anomalies and increase of P-wave velocity. Thus, to the contrary of what is claimed in the feasibility study, a threat of leachate pollution is real. This study shows that landfill construction studies cannot give trustful results without geophysical investigations. More specifically, in Algeria, it is imperative to elaborate a landfill construction code, which should include mandatory geophysical prospecting and deeper drilling cores...|$|E
40|$|This article proposes the {{development}} of a rainfall-runoff model in order to simulate the hydrologic behavior of the Djerem sub-basin at Mbakaou in the Sanaga basin in Cameroon. We suggest a solution based on a spatial conceptual modeling, then a restriction to a finite number of parameters judged applicable for the different choices of models. The approach relies on the hydrologic system HEC-HMS whose interest is not only it's adaptability to the tropical and equatorial climate, but also and especially to the acceptable results that it provides for a very weak quantity of data. In this work, we take into consideration the different aspects of modeling such as: surface flow, <b>underground</b> flows, direct <b>runoffs,</b> losses, as well as interactions between the surface and the base-flow of rivers. The results obtained allows the planning of the Mbakaou dam, consequently to increase the hydroelectric production on one hand and on the other hand, provide some exploitable information for dimensions of hydrologic works, protective against floods or for hydrologic management and ecology of the Djerem basin at Mbakaou. To validate our model, a comparison of the simulated flow-rate and the observed flow-rate was carried out using historic data with the Nash-Sutcliffe Criterion and we obtained an efficiency of 0. 862, meaning that the simulation was good...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{synthesis}} and reinterpretation of long-term data of geophysical studies {{together with the}} hydrology - hydrological materials it has been received new data about the buried topography and spatial distribution of groundwater runoff of the Aragats massif. First of all, it requires to determine the structure of its buried relief, which is basically a regional relief aquitard. The underground water sources {{are considered to be}} precipitation on the massif (approximately 83 % of the total), infiltration of the surface (11 %), the condensation of water vapor in the aeration zone (5 %) and underground inflow from adjacent areas (1. 3 %). It is established to find connection (for topographical scale 1 : 50, 000) based on the heights of the distribution function analysis of modern and buried reliefs (composed by using paleorelief maps of scale 1 : 50, 000). The distribution of heights set size space between adjacent contour lines reliefs. It is created correlation relation between the buried and surface reliefs in different slopes and has been specified the ways of focused groundwater runoff and the possible locations of buried watersheds. Overall, the new data concerning the structure of the buried relief of Aragats massif and the distribution of its <b>underground</b> <b>runoff</b> allow to develop effective measures for the selection of underground waters and their rational usage for the purpose of water supply and irrigation...|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} we {{evaluated}} spatial and quantitative changes in soil surface microtopography to describe water erosion process under simulated rain {{with use of}} a non-contact optical 3 D scanner. The experiment was conducted in two variants: with and without drainage layer. Two clay soils collected from farmlands from the catchment of lake Zgorzała (Warsaw) were investigated. Six tests of simulated rain were applied, with 55 mm·h− 1. The surface roughness and microrelief were determined immediately after every 10 min of rainfall simulation by 3 D scanner. The volume of surface and <b>underground</b> <b>runoff</b> as well as soil moisture were measured. The surface points coordinates obtained while scanning were interpolated using natural neighbour method and GIS software to generate Digital Elevation Models (DEM) with a 0. 5 mm resolution. Two DEM-derived surface roughness indices: Random Roughness (RR) and Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) were used for microrelief description. Calculated values of both roughness factors have decreased with time {{under the influence of}} rainfall in all analyzed variants. During the sprinkling the moisture of all samples had been growing rapidly from air-dry state reaching values close to the maximum water capacity (37 – 48 % vol.) in 20 – 30 min. Simultaneously the intensity of surface runoff was increasing and cumulative runoff value was: 17 – 35 % for variants with drainage and 72 – 83 % for the variants without drainage, relative to cumulative rainfall. The observed soil surface elevation changes were associated with aggregates decomposition, erosion and sedimentation, and above all, with a compaction of the soil, which was considered to be a dominant factor hindering the assessment of the erosion intensity of the of the scanned surface...|$|E
