5|$|As {{with other}} {{infertile}} {{areas of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Hamersley would have supported open forests of Eucalyptus marginata (Jarrah) with Corymbia calophylla (Marri) or Eucalyptus gomphocephala (Tuart), and an <b>understorey</b> of Banksia attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.menziesii (Firewood Banksia), B.grandis (Bull Banksia), Allocasuarina fraseriana (Western Sheoak) and Agonis flexuosa (Swan River Peppermint). The main shrub species would have been Jacksonia sternbergiana (Stinkwood), J.furcellata (Grey Stinkwood), Acacia cyclops (Coastal Wattle), Acacia saligna (Orange Wattle), Hibbertia species, Allocasuarina humilis (Dwarf Sheoak), Calothamnus quadrifidus (One-sided Bottlebrush) and Grevillea thelemanniana (Spider Net Grevillea). Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species, Jacksonia sericea (Waldjumi), in two eastern Hamersley reserves.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an <b>understorey,</b> and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E
5|$|The hairpin banksia occurs {{along the}} east coast of Australia from the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, Victoria, north through New South Wales and into Queensland. It is common north to Maryborough, with disjunct populations {{occurring}} as far north as the Atherton Tableland near Cairns. It occurs in a variety of habitats, from coastal heath (spinulosa and collina) and elevated rocky slopes (neoanglica and spinulosa) to inland dry sclerophyll forest dominated by eucalypts, where they form part of the <b>understorey.</b> Plants in exposed areas are generally considerably shorter than those in sheltered areas. It usually occurs on sand, but can be found in rocky clays or loams.|$|E

Timber steps alight from the north side and west sides. An extended verandah at the northeast corner has weatherboard infill balustrading. The west and east verandahs to the south extension have dowel balustrading, with a handrail separate from the top rail and only the west verandah has the Y-shaped brackets matching those on the early verandah.

30|$|About 22 % of {{observations}} behind the used diameter increment model {{came from a}} silvicultural experiment in which heavy high thinning {{was the most common}} treatment. In addition, a majority of the growth observations of this experiment represented immediate post-thinning growth. In the other modeling data sources, the time since previous thinning varied {{in the same way as}} it varies in managed Finnish forests (0 – 40  years). Taking into account that spruce <b>understoreys</b> are usually vigorous under all canopies except a dense and pure spruce canopy, it may be concluded that the impact of thinning stress on the results of this study would remain rather small.|$|R
30|$|The {{models that}} were used in growth {{simulation}} (Pukkala et al. 2013) did not describe the thinning effect explicitly; post-thinning growth was predicted using the post-thinning values of tree and stand characteristics. Previous research suggests that released spruce <b>understoreys</b> may need 4 to 5  years to fully adapt to the new conditions (Metslaid et al. 2005). Therefore, {{there is a possibility that}} the post-thinning growth was over-estimated after heavy high thinnings. The significance of this possibility was analyzed by conducting simulations in which the growth of a high-thinning spruce stand was reduced during 5 post-thinning years by decreasing the random stand effect of the diameter increment model (by two standard deviations). Twenty-year volume growth was reduced by 11 % but 30 -year growth was only 4 % smaller as compared to simulation without growth reduction. Slower initial growth means that competition increases slower resulting in faster growth during later 5 -years periods.|$|R
5|$|The species tolerates a {{range of}} soils, {{requiring}} only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in lateritic soils and gravels, although this species {{is also found in}} deep sand, sand over laterite, and sand over limestone. It also occurs in {{a range of}} vegetation complexes, including coastal and kwongan heath, tall shrubland, woodland and open forest. It is a common <b>understorey</b> plant in drier areas of Jarrah forest, and forms thickets on limestone soils of the Swan Coastal Plain. Banksia sessilis sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas; for example, it has been recorded colonising gravel pits in the Darling Scarp.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations. Populations in {{relatively}} intact bushland have high outcrossing rates, but those in more disturbed environments are both more inbred on average, and more variable. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an <b>understorey,</b> and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability.|$|E

40|$|Many {{ecosystem}} services do not pass through markets. Therefore, the benefits which ecosystems provide to society are largely unrecorded. Fast-growing woody crops represent a quite new and still insufficiently explored ecosystem of agricultural land {{which has a}} potential to provide several utility functions. It may contribute to satisfaction of human needs and may enhance regional health. The goal {{of this paper was}} to detect the socio-economic importance of associated spontaneous vegetation in plantations of the energy crops (hybrids of the genera Salix) and to compare it with the socio-economic importance of adjacent permanently cultivated agricultural field. There was examined the therapeutic, melliferous, feed, allergenic and toxic potential of undergrowth for each experimental plot inside the SRC plantations. The research was carried out on the agricultural land formerly used for growing cereals and root crops – the research base Kolíňany. Our results showed that energy plantation <b>understoreys</b> can be assumed to be the better option for contribution to the total socio-economic value of a region than agricultural fields...|$|R
40|$|Agroforestry {{practices}} and systems for supporting pastoral and agropastoral livestock production in Africa {{range from the}} preservation of trees to more intensively planted and managed systems. In the extensive traditional practice of tree conservation, use strategy is geared towards biomass maintenance rather than production. Certain native tree species are protected for their fodder value in grazing and crop lands. A mixture of livestock, grazers and browsers make {{the best use of}} vegetation types and forms. In intensively managed agroforestry systems of mixed crop-livestock production, leguminous multipurpose trees are planted as fodder banks, alley-farmed or planted as contour-bund hedges. Plantation crop <b>understoreys</b> are planted to aid nutrient cycling and provide high quality supplemental fodders. These agroforestry systems provide potential for environmental protection in sustaining watershed effects of the remaining tropical woodlands. These systems prevent overgrazing by encouraging intensively managed livestock production in zero-grazing systems; arrest deforestation; create a carbon sink through afforestation; reduce soil and water erosion; and sustain the very basis of agricultural productivity for both the crop and livestock subsectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of prescribed fire restoration of forested sites in three state parks in east Texas, USA was studied. Two sites consisted of mixed shortleaf (Pinus echinata Mill.) or loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and broadleaf overstoreys. The third site was a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) /little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash.) stand. Mid‐ and <b>understoreys</b> at all sites {{consisted of a}} variety of shrubs and herbaceous vegetation. Prolonged drought resulting in county burn bans prohibited burning until immediately after rain events. Results indicated no effect from the burns in the overstorey, seedling, shrub or herbaceous layers at any park. At two sites, there was {{a significant increase in the}} percentage of dead standing saplings in the burn plots from pre‐ to post‐burn. The only significant decreases in fuels were in the weight and depth of combined Oi and Oe horizons (litter). Compliance with burn bans greatly reduced the restorative powers of the burns.

5|$|Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic-{{flowering}} species, {{relying on}} post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds {{to take advantage}} of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, {{it is one of the}} slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the <b>understorey</b> around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (Banksia) and wattles (Acacia). Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinct}} {{shape of}} the skull shows that Deinocheirus had a more specialised diet than other ornithomimosaurs.

The attachment sites for the muscles that open and close the jaws were very small in comparison {{to the size of the}} skull, which indicates Deinocheirus had a weak bite force. The skull was likely adapted for cropping soft <b>understorey</b> or water vegetation. The depth of the lower jaw indicates the presence of a large tongue, which could have assisted the animal in sucking in food material obtained with the broad beak when foraging on the bottom of freshwater bodies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} robust indicators that summarize the respective importance of ontogeny and environmental constraints in tree development. In the proposed approach, tree growth data {{correspond to the}} retrospective measurement of annual shoot characteristics (e. g. length, number of branches) along the main stem. We applied segmentation models to identify tree growth phases. These segmentation models, which are hidden semi-Markov chains, were compared with simple hidden Markov chains that correspond to the environment-driven development assumption. This statistical modelling approach was applied to both evergreen (Corsican pine and silver fir) and deciduous (sessile oak and Persian wal-nut) tree species growing in contrasted conditions ranging from managed forest stands to unmanaged <b>understoreys.</b> Growth phase duration distributions estimated within these segmentation models char-acterize the respective importance of ontogeny and environmental constraints in tree development at the population scale and have very contrasted characteristics in terms of shape and relative dispersion between ontogeny-driven and environment-driven tree development. These characteristics may change over tree life, reflecting changes in tree competition. Growth phase duration distributions summarize the joint trajectory of tree ontogeny and environment without requiring tree growth follow-up data for their estimation...|$|R
40|$|The endemic Hawaiian lobeliads are {{exceptionally}} species {{rich and}} exhibit striking diversity in habitat, growth form, pollination biology and seed dispersal, but their origins and pattern of diversification remain shrouded in mystery. Up to five independent colonizations {{have been proposed}} based on morphological differences among extant taxa. We present a molecular phylogeny showing that the Hawaiian lobeliads {{are the product of}} one immigration event; that they are the largest plant clade on any single oceanic island or archipelago; that their ancestor arrived roughly 13  Myr ago; and that this ancestor was most likely woody, wind-dispersed, bird-pollinated, and adapted to open habitats at mid-elevations. Invasion of closed tropical forests is associated with evolution of fleshy fruits. Limited dispersal of such fruits in wet-forest <b>understoreys</b> appears to have accelerated speciation and led to a series of parallel adaptive radiations in Cyanea, with most species restricted to single islands. Consistency of Cyanea diversity across all tall islands except Hawai `i suggests that diversification of Cyanea saturates in less than 1. 5  Myr. Lobeliad diversity appears to reflect a hierarchical adaptive radiation in habitat, then elevation and flower-tube length, and provides important insights into the pattern and tempo of diversification in a species-rich clade of tropical plants...|$|R
40|$|Forest ecologists {{researching the}} {{functional}} basis of tree regeneration patterns and species coexistence often attempt to correlate traits with light-gradient partitioning. However, an exclusive focus on light can overlook other important drivers of forest dynamics. • We measured light, temperatures, humidity and sapling densities {{in each of}} four phases of a forest dynamic mosaic in New Zealand: shaded <b>understoreys,</b> tree-fall gaps, treefern groves and clearings. We then measured leaf, wood and seed traits, as potential predictors of species’ regeneration patterns. • Saplings of 18 out of 21 species {{were significantly associated with}} one or other of the four phases, and associations were best predicted by a two-trait model (leaf size, wood density) explaining 51 % of observed variation. Species associated with treefall gaps had traits favouring light pre-emption (large leaves, low-density wood), whereas those establishing in clearings mostly had small leaves and dense wood, traits probably conferring resistance to the frosts and summer water deficits that saplings were exposed to there. • The dynamics of some forests cannot be explained adequately by light-gradient partitioning through a growth vs shade tolerance tradeoff, underpinned by the leaf economics spectrum. Consideration of multiple environmental filters and multiple traits will enhance understanding of regeneration patterns and species coexistence...|$|R
25|$|Vulnerable plants {{typically}} {{die within}} a few years of infection. In southwest Western Australia, where dieback infestation is widespread, infested areas of Banksia forest typically have less than 30% of the cover of uninfested areas. Plant deaths in such large proportions can have a profound influence on the makeup of plant communities. For example, in southwestern Australia Banksia often occurs as an <b>understorey</b> to forests of Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), another species highly vulnerable to dieback. Infestation kills both the Jarrah overstorey and the original Banksia <b>understorey,</b> and over time these may be replaced by a more open woodland consisting of an overstorey of the resistant Marri (Corymbia calophylla), and an <b>understorey</b> of the somewhat resistant Banksia sessilis (Parrotbush).|$|E

40|$|Food {{resources}} can limit populations of insectivorous birds. Previous {{studies have shown}} strong correlations between bird population densities and their invertebrate food, with declining populations being attributed to loss of prey. This might also be {{the case for the}} threatened Knysna warbler (Bradypterus sylvaticus), which in the last 20 years has declined precipitously on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The bird is abandoning natural, protected forests, retreating to narrow belts of suburban, riverine woodland with dense, tangled <b>understoreys.</b> The potential invertebrate food availability in natural forests and suburban woodland was assessed against what is known of the bird's preferred prey. The invertebrate food resource spectrum and abundance were determined using three sampling techniques in both natural forest and suburban woodland. Despite greater overall abundance of invertebrates in suburban woodland, the warbler's preferred prey items were equally abundant in both habitats. This suggests that reduced food supply does not explain abandonment of natural forests by the warbler. Rather, it is concluded that the availability of suitable nesting substrata, which are more abundant in suburban woodland, has driven the biotope shift. This is an unusual case of a localized and threatened bird species faring better under transformed conditions than in natural habitats. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The area of {{agricultural}} land converted to commercial plantations across Australia has expanded rapidly and includes large areas (0. 5 M ha) planted to Tasmanian Blue Gum (Eucalyptus globulus) (National Forest Inventory 2005). The {{outcome of this}} for biodiversity conservation is still being evaluated. In general, plantations support more native faunal species than farmland, but less than native vegetation remnants (Lindenmayer & Hobbs 2004). However, the value of small remnants (< 5 ha) to native fauna in plantations is unclear. For birds in plantations, small remnants may be important ‘stepping stones’ or provide small, high quality habitat patches within a larger habitat mosaic (Fischer & Lindenmayer 2002), especially for species that can exploit resources within plantations (Loyn et al. 2007). However, degradation by weed invasion can reduce the value of small remnants for bird conservation (Loyn 1987). A {{better understanding of the}} biodiversity value of small remnants is needed given that many plantation companies operating under forest product certiﬁcation are now formulating approaches to managing biodiversity within their estates. Therefore, we examined bird communities in Tasmanian Blue Gum plantations (hereafter called bluegum plantations’), contrasting plantation areas with small remnants with predominantly exotic, and native, <b>understoreys.</b> Implications for remnant management and monitoring are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Feral horses (Equus caballus L) occupy 64 000 ha of montane-subalpine tussock {{grassland}} in the south-western Kaimanawa Mountains, an area zoned {{for military}} training. Since 1979, {{the population has}} increased at 16. 7 % per annum, reaching 1102 in 1990. The most extensive habitat, red tussock (Chionochloa rubra) grassland, was variably affected by horses; tussocks in restricted mesic sites were heavily grazed and mostly eliminated, but those in extensive xeric grasslands showed little impact. The mixed hard tussock (Festuca novae-zelandiae) /red tussock grasslands on basin floors and plateaux, which had already been degraded by early European farming, were suffering further depletion from horse grazing. The restricted, high altitude Chionochloa pallens tussock communities were being eliminated rapidly through preferential grazing. Oligotrophic bogs, on the summits and basin floors were largely intact, whereas high nutrient flushes were severely affected by trampling and grazing. Horses appeared to have had little impact upon Nothofagus forest <b>understoreys.</b> Ten plant species, several of which are vulnerable nationally, occur in the North Island only within the wild horse range. The habitats of five of them were damaged by horses. Throughout the wide basins and plateaux of the north, horses compromised floristic, rare plant habitat, and landscape nature conservation values. Their numbers may therefore have to be controlled...|$|R
