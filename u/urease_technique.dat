40|$|The Syva EMIT Autolab 6000 and the Abbott TDX {{automated}} {{methods for}} measuring serum aminoglycoside concentrations {{were compared with}} each other and with a new semiautomated version of the <b>urease</b> <b>technique.</b> Each was evaluated for accuracy, reproducibility, cost, and ease of use. All three methods gave satisfactory results, although the Abbott TDX was the most accurate. Both automated methods gave results within minutes, whereas the new urease method, which involved more initial manipulation, took 1. 25 h to complete (mainly incubation time). There was no difference in accuracy of performance between experienced and inexperienced operators. The new urease method was much cheaper in terms of initial capital expenditure and in cost per test and needed no provision of manufacturer's back-up maintenance services. This could prove invaluable in situations where financial resources are at a premium. Otherwise, the Abbott TDX is currently our method of choice, and reasons for its preference to the EMIT system are listed...|$|E
40|$|Because of its {{excellent}} biocompatibility and low allergenicity, titanium {{has been}} widely used for bone replacement and tissue engineering. To produce a desirable composite with enhanced bone response and mechanical strength, in this study bioactive calcium phosphate (CaP) and gelatin composites were coated onto titanium (Ti) via a novel <b>urease</b> <b>technique.</b> The cellular responses to the CaP/gelatin/Ti (CaP/gel/Ti) and bone bonding ability were evaluated with proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on CaP/gel/Ti and CaP/Ti in vitro. The {{results showed that the}} optical density values, alkaline phosphatase expression and genes expression of MSCs on CaP/gel/Ti were similar to those on CaP/Ti, yet significantly higher than those on pure Ti (p < 0. 05). CaP/gel/Ti and CaP/Ti rods (2 mm in diameter, 10 mm in length) were also implanted into femoral shaft of rabbits and pure Ti rods served as control (n = 10). Histological examination, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed at 4 and 8 weeks after the operation. The histological and SEM observations demonstrated clearly that more new bone formed on the surface of CaP/gel/Ti than in the other two groups at each time point. The CaP/gel/Ti bonded to the surrounding bone directly with no intervening soft tissue layer. An interfacial layer, containing Ti, Ca and P, was found to form at the interface between bone and the implant on all three groups by EDS analysis. However, the content of Ca, P in the surface of CaP/gel/Ti implants was more than in the other two groups at each time point. The CaP/gel/Ti modified by the urease method was not only beneficial for MSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, but also favorable for bone bonding ability on Ti implants in vivo, suggesting that Ti functionalized with CaP and gelatin might have a great potential in clinical joint replacement or dental implants...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gastric {{brushing}} cytology is {{an accurate}} technique for rapidly detecting Helicobacter pylori infection, {{but it is not}} routinely employed since the presence of personnel experienced in this field, is necessary in the endoscopy suite. To evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of rapid urease test carried out on cytological brushing. PATIENTS: A total of 143 consecutive patients with suspected Helicobacter pylori infection, referred for elective gastroscopy. METHODS: For each patient, 2 brushings were carried out and 4 biopsies were taken from antral mucosa during gastroscopy. The former brushing was smeared on a slide, and stained by a rapid staining set for blood smears. The latter was used for rapid urease test, by shaking the brush into the urea broth. Two biopsies were used for rapid urease test and two for histologic examination. Histology was considered as the gold standard. RESULTS: Of 143 patients, 73 were diagnosed as Helicobacter pylori infected using histology. Six brushing slides were inadequate due to insufficient cytology material. Biopsy-rapid urease test and brushing-rapid urease test had similar sensitivity (87. 3 % vs 83. 5 %), specificity (98. 4 % vs 96. 8 %) and overall accuracy (92. 3 % vs 89. 5 %). In 62 Helicobacter pylori infected patients, both rapid <b>urease</b> test <b>techniques</b> were positive. Brushing-rapid urease test became positive in a significantly shorter time than biopsy-rapid urease test (22 +/- 54 minutes vs 39 +/- 63 minutes; p < 0. 01). CONClUSIONS: Brushing-rapid urease test is as accurate as biopsy-rapid urease test in detecting Helicobacter pylori infection, but it is significantly faster. Special care should be taken to carry out brushing adequately, to minimize the occurrence of false negatives...|$|R
