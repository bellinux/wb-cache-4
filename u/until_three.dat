5|$|In July, Spears {{announced}} her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, {{whom she had}} met three months before. As Federline had only recently ended his relationship with actress Shar Jackson, who was pregnant with their second child, this engagement {{was the subject of}} extensive media coverage. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married <b>until</b> <b>three</b> weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} school's closure, in 1917, events in World War I {{had led the}} New York Guard's First Provisional Regiment (1,500 men {{operating}} under Colonel John B. Rose) to guard the Croton Aqueduct. Captain Charles W. Baldwin, Chaplain of the regiment and Rector of Saint Mary's Episcopal Church in Scarborough and also in present-day Briarcliff Manor, had arranged a deal with V.

5|$|The West Indies lodged an {{official}} complaint with Australia, and the Australian Cricket Board replied that it deplored the published comments, although noting that as O'Neill's touring contract had expired {{at the end}} of the tour, the point was moot. Nevertheless, the ACB changed its stance on players' writing, so that they could no longer comment on a tour <b>until</b> <b>three</b> months after its conclusion. The event is often perceived to have been a factor in O'Neill's eventual departure from the national scene.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{initially}} {{split between the}} Mediterranean Squadron and the Second Squadron (2ème Escadre), based at Brest. One ship served as a flagship during the 1930s, but her sister ships were assigned as training ships beginning in 1932. The Chacal class was assigned convoy escort duties {{after the start of}} World War II in September 1939 <b>until</b> <b>three</b> of them were committed to the English Channel after the Battle of France began on 10 May 1940. Two of these were sunk shortly afterwards by German forces.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs or fork-crowned lemurs are strepsirrhine primates; {{the four}} species {{comprise}} the genus Phaner. Like all lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, {{where they are}} found only in the west, north, and east sides of the island. They are named for the two black stripes which run up from the eyes, converge {{on the top of}} the head, and run down the back as a single black stripe. They were originally placed in the genus Lemur in 1839, later moved between the genera Cheirogaleus and Microcebus, and given their own genus in 1870 by John Edward Gray. Only one species (Phaner furcifer) was recognized, <b>until</b> <b>three</b> subspecies described in 1991 were promoted to species status in 2001. New species may yet be identified, particularly in northeast Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isaac {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August17. Moving generally westward, the low-pressure area initially {{did not have}} a well-defined center <b>until</b> <b>three</b> days later. Convection associated with the system organized and intensified, and the tropical wave quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. In favorable conditions, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Isaac by the National Hurricane Center(NHC) on August21. Quickly accelerating westward due to a subtropical ridge located to the northwest, Isaac later moved past the Lesser Antilles between Guadeloupe and Dominica by August23, where it caused numerous mudslides and power outages. Maintaining tropical storm intensity, Isaac later made its first landfall on the southern coast of Haiti early on August25 as a result of southeast flow. There, the storm directly killed 24people, worsening conditions still remaining after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E

5|$|If {{most of the}} Sea Harriers {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, even though the Harrier GR.3 was not designed for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island <b>until</b> <b>three</b> F-4 Phantom IIs arrived {{to take on this}} responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Rainbow took a {{position}} with the Family Planning Association (FPA). In 1949, she married Robert Arnold, an American choirmaster and recording engineer, whom she had met in Washington, D.C., and changed her name to Lorna Arnold. They had two sons, Geoffrey, born in 1950, and Stephen, born in 1952. She continued working at the FPA <b>until</b> <b>three</b> weeks before Geoffrey was born. The family initially lived rent free in an attic apartment at No. 3 Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, where Robert had a part-time job restoring a collection of Elizabethan-era musical instruments such as virginals, harpsichords and clavichords, that had been donated to the National Trust by Benton Fletcher. The lower floors of the building were a museum for the instruments.|$|E
5|$|Stoneman used troops under Brig. Gens. Alvan Gillem and Stephen Burbridge, {{including}} the 5th and the 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry Regimentsboth {{of which had}} participated in the previous attempt to destroy the salt works during the First Battle of Saltville. Stoneman ordered Burbridge to bring his division of 4,200 cavalrymen through the Cumberland Gap to join Stoneman and Gillem at Knoxville, Tennessee, where Gillem was refitting his own command into a picked force of 1,500 men. Stoneman did not reveal the objectives of the expedition to his subordinates <b>until</b> <b>three</b> days after they had departed Knoxville on December 10. On December 12, Stoneman's force flanked and forced back Confederate Brig. Gen. Basil W. Duke's cavalry at Rogersville, Tennessee. Union forces defeated and scattered Confederate troops the next day at Kingsport, Tennessee. There Gillem captured 84 prisoners, including Col. Richard C. Morgan and the brigade's supply train.|$|E

5|$|The Nordland Line {{was first}} {{publicly}} proposed by Ole Tobias Olsen {{in a letter}} to the editor in Morgenbladet in 1872, where he argued for a railway between Trondheim and his home county of Nordland. The same year, Nord-Trøndelag County Council voted in favor to start planning of a railway between Trondheim and Namsos. The county council appointed a railway committee in 1875, who on 23 August 1876 published a report to encourage national authorities to consider the line, which resulted in surveying starting in 1877. On 27 April 1881, the committee made its recommendation to the county council and ceased its work. No planning was done the next three years, <b>until</b> <b>three</b> county councilors, Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, Peter Theodor Holst and Bernhard Øverland, made a new proposal. However, it was not until 1889 that the county council appointed a new railway committee, which was led by Wexelsen.|$|E

5|$|Young {{birds have}} a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles {{appear on the}} fourth day and pin {{feathers}} emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes open on the eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have the fork in the tail <b>until</b> <b>three</b> weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{the couple}} {{purchased}} a house together located on Burlington Crescent in Toronto, near Edith's clinic and lived there until their retirement. In 1965, both women retired and sold their Toronto home, {{moving to the}} farm house owned by the Fraser family in Burlington, Ontario. The farm was located in a very scenic setting on the Niagara Escarpment, near the Bruce Trail. Fraser, who enjoyed gardening, tended the ground and Williams, who was a fine cook, enjoyed cooking for their frequent guests. Having become interested in mountaineering, Williams enjoyed mountain-climbing and both women enjoyed taking excursions which allowed them to be outdoors. In their archives are many photographs taken with groups of women on camping and canoe trips. Williams suffered a severe stroke {{near the end of}} 1976 and never fully recovered from it requiring repeated hospitalizations at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Fraser drove in daily from Burlington to visit Williams. She died in 1979, after a series of additional strokes and Fraser returned to the home in Burlington where she remained <b>until</b> <b>three</b> weeks before her death, when her family placed her in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of William's early years. He was the fourth son of the family, and up <b>until</b> <b>three</b> years before his father died, he still had two {{surviving}} older brothers. For this reason, his early biography is based largely on conjecture. It is known that he managed to establish an independent position for himself through a fortunate marriage. By 1361 {{he was married to}} Joan Montagu, the daughter of Alice of Norfolk, and – through Alice – a granddaughter of Thomas of Brotherton, a younger son of Edward I. The first recorded evidence for his military activity dates from 1367, but he was probably also present in earlier campaigns. His father campaigned in France in 1355–6 and 1359–60, and it is likely that William also took part in these expeditions, along with Thomas Beauchamp, the future Earl of Warwick. The two men would develop a close affinity, and their careers were strikingly similar: they were born around the same time, they were probably knighted together in July 1355, neither was born as heir to their earldoms but came to their titles through the death of older brothers, and both succeeded their fathers in 1369.|$|E

5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur <b>until</b> <b>three</b> years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E
