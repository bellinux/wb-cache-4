5|$|Washed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of {{the public}} eye, Keating pleads with Toohey to use his {{influence}} to get the commission for the much-sought-after Cortlandt housing project. Keating knows his most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark's help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete anonymity and Keating's promise {{that it will be}} built exactly as designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not able to prevent major changes from being made in Cortlandt's construction. Roark dynamites the project to prevent the subversion of his vision.|$|E
5|$|The highway enters Geneseo {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the Genesee River valley until it runs east–west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter than going all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E

25|$|As {{the seat}} moved further <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the {{aircraft}} a lanyard attached to the cockpit floor fired a steel rod, known as the drogue gun, this extracted two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. The occupant then released themselves from the seat harness and operated the main parachute manually by pulling a ripcord.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} ventilation in VIP latrines is {{the action of}} wind blowing {{across the top of}} the vent pipe. The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through the squat hole, across the pit and <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the vent pipe. Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus sucked up and exhausted out of vent pipe, leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar-powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the vent pipe.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of launch on 17 December 1912, Endurance was perhaps the strongest wooden ship ever built, with the {{possible}} exception of Fram, the vessel used by Fridtjof Nansen and later by Roald Amundsen. However, there was one major difference between the ships. Fram was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her it would be squeezed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. But since Endurance was designed to operate in relatively loose pack ice she was not constructed so as to rise out of pressure to any great extent.|$|E

25|$|As {{the seat}} moves further <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the {{aircraft}} the rocket pack is fired by a lanyard attached to the cockpit floor. A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 10,000ft (3,000m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude in conjunction with another device to prevent the parachute opening at high speed. The seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle is provided should the automatic system fail.|$|E
25|$|Vertically mounted {{tubes of}} up to 1-metre {{diameter}} extending from just above {{the base of a}} deep concrete tank to just {{below the surface of the}} sewage liquor. A typical shaft might be 10 metres high. At the surface end, the tube is formed into a cone with helical vanes attached to the inner surface. When the tube is rotated, the vanes spin liquor <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the cones drawing new sewage liquor from the base of the tank. In many works, each cone is located in a separate cell that can be isolated from the remaining cells if required for maintenance. Some works may have two cones to a cell and some large works may have 4 cones per cell.|$|E
500|$|The {{main part}} of the body was {{typically}} about [...] wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.|$|E

500|$|The giant petrels {{share with}} the {{albatrosses}} an adaptation known as a shoulder-lock: a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> without any muscle effort. Gadfly petrels often feed on the wing, snapping prey without landing on the water. The flight of the smaller prions {{is similar to that}} of the storm petrels, being highly erratic and involving weaving and even looping the loop. The wings of all species are long and stiff. In some species of shearwater the wings are also used to power the birds underwater while diving for prey. Their heavier wing loadings, in comparison with surface-feeding procellariids, allow these shearwaters to achieve considerable depths (below [...] in the case of the short-tailed shearwater).|$|E
500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme {{close-up}} on Marion's eye and pulls <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face {{made her want to}} blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying [...] "Not inordinately" [...] for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) [...] hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|An {{observer}} in {{an accelerated}} reference frame must introduce what physicists call fictitious forces {{to account for}} the acceleration experienced by himself and objects around him. One example, the force pressing the driver of an accelerating car into his or her seat, has already been mentioned; another is the force you can feel pulling your arms <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> if you attempt to spin around like a top. [...] Einstein's master insight was that the constant, familiar pull of the Earth's gravitational field is fundamentally the same as these fictitious forces. [...] The apparent magnitude of the fictitious forces always appears to be proportional to the mass of any object on which they act – for instance, the driver's seat exerts just enough force to accelerate the driver {{at the same rate as}} the car. [...] By analogy, Einstein proposed that an object in a gravitational field should feel a gravitational force proportional to its mass, as embodied in Newton's law of gravitation.|$|E

500|$|The {{group was}} unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit visa because customs {{believed}} that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts. As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> like a guided Patriot missile, right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling down... on top of some English kid's head....

2500|$|A way to {{visualize}} the difference, is that an ordinary tsunami is caused by sea floor changes, somewhat like pushing {{up on the floor}} of a large tub of water to the point it overflows, and causing a surge of water to [...] "run off" [...] at the sides.
