5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive. An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E
50|$|Four players played. Each player chose {{one of four}} keys. One key <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> door to a 1998 Ford Mustang. After all {{the keys}} were chosen, the players tried to <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> door, one by one. <b>The</b> player that <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> car won it, along with $12,000 for taxes and {{licensing}} fees. The others left with $2,500.|$|R
50|$|There {{are seven}} house {{challenges}}: Passing, Tackle and Shoot, Seeker, Beaters and Bludgers, Special Moves, and Combos. Only {{the first three}} challenges - Passing, Tackle and Shoot, and Seeker - are initially available to the player, with Beaters and Bludgers, and Special Moves <b>unlocked</b> after <b>the</b> first Quidditch match, and Combos <b>unlocked</b> after <b>the</b> second match. Completing {{the first set of}} challenges allows the player to play their first full Quidditch match. The team the player faces depends on what team they are playing as. Winning <b>the</b> game <b>unlocks</b> <b>the</b> next set of challenges which must then be completed to <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> next match. Winning <b>the</b> second game <b>unlocks</b> <b>the</b> final challenge. Completing that challenge <b>unlocks</b> <b>the</b> Hogwarts Cup final match.|$|R

5|$|The {{story begins}} in a {{different}} place for each playable character. With the exception of Carlie, the main character is soon told (or otherwise decides) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel. They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded. Due to the Beastmen's werewolf powers, they are able to make an escape by night. The main character—now including Carlie—on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light. Following it, it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Mana Sanctuary, exhausted by her journey. Out of desperation, the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host, and tells them to get to Wendel. There, while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light, the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying and that the Sanctuary is in danger. The Priest explains that if the Tree dies, the God Beasts will reawaken and destroy the world. He goes on to explain further that, because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host, they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree. They can then restore peace to the world, and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies. A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary. The Faerie does not have the strength to do it, and the ancient spell which would do so by <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster's life. The Stones' guarding elemental spirits, however, will to be able to open the gate if their powers are combined.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{games in}} the series also have {{compatibility}} with other games, such as in Revenge, where players can <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> Madden Challenge Bus by having a save file from Madden NFL 06, and a Burnout 3: Takedown save file <b>unlocks</b> <b>the</b> Dominator Assassin.|$|R

25|$|However, it {{was viewed}} as a new {{challenge}} for Rush who would have the task of <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> much tighter defences in Serie A. His time at Juventus was less than successful, as he scored only eight times in 29 games; though this partly explained by the Italian tradition at this time of tighter defences meaning that strikers tended to score fewer goals in Italy than they did in England.|$|E
25|$|The Engineer's siding at Eardington is {{controlled}} by a ground frame. No intermediate token instrument is provided, with the Highley-Bridgnorth token directly <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> two lever frame. This means that Hampton Loade signal box must be switched out when Eardington siding has to be used, and also that a train cannot terminate or depart from there - unless the token is taken by road between Eardington and Highley or Bridgnorth signal box.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Raid Decks, Dungeon Decks {{are large}} scale {{encounters}} designed for multiple players to play against. The main difference from Raid Decks {{is that a}} Dungeon Deck runs itself with no need for an additional player to act as the Raid Master. Additionally Dungeon Decks {{are designed to be}} played against basic starter decks with players <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> ability to add new cards by gaining experience from defeating dungeons and leveling up.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{proposed}} legislation, wireless service providers may still employ such locks on customer phones while under contract, {{so it is}} unlikely to impact the common practice of offering subsidized phones on contracts.As per the Wireless code F1: Unlocking: A service provider that provides a locked device to the customer as part of a contract must for subsidized devices: <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> device, or give the customer <b>the</b> means to <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> device, upon request, at the rate specified by the service provider, no later than 90 calendar days after the contract start date. Or for unsubsidized devices: <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> device, or give the customer <b>the</b> means to <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> device, at the rate specified by the service provider, upon request.|$|R

50|$|SOCOM 3 U.S. Navy SEALs is playable on five {{difficulty}} levels. At the start, {{the player}} can only choose from three of these.

25|$|During the Greco-Roman period (332 BC − AD 639), Egyptian {{literature}} {{was translated into}} other languages, and Greco-Roman literature fused with native art into a new style of writing. From this period comes the Rosetta Stone, which became the key to <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> mysteries of Egyptian writing to modern scholarship. The great city of Alexandria boasted its famous Library of almost half a million handwritten books during the third century BC. Alexandria's center of learning also produced the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{locations}} {{are open to}} the player {{at the start of the}} game. Some locales, such as mod garages, restaurants, gyms, and shops, become available only after completing certain missions. Likewise, for the first portion of the game, only Los Santos and its immediate suburbs are available for exploration; <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> other cities and rural areas again requires the completion of certain missions. If the player were to travel in locked locations early in the game, they would end up attracting the attention of SWAT teams, police, and police-controlled Hydras if in an aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In January 2003, {{an appeal}} to {{renovate}} the building was launched. Funds were generated from grants from the University of Manchester and Heritage Lottery Fund and donations {{from members of the}} public and companies in Manchester. The project, <b>Unlocking</b> <b>the</b> Rylands, demolished the third extension, refurbished parts of the old building and erected a pitched roof over its reinforced concrete roof. Champneys designed a pitched roof but Mrs Rylands was advised that an internal stone vault would reduce the fire risk and it was not built. The £17 million project was completed by summer 2007 and the library reopened on 20 September 2007.|$|E

25|$|A {{lock screen}} is a {{computer}} user interface element used by various operating systems. They regulate immediate access to a device by requiring that the user perform a certain action {{in order to receive}} access, such as entering a password, using a certain button combination, or performing a certain gesture using a device's touchscreen. While most lock functions on PC operating systems only utilize a login screen, lock screens on mobile devices often provide more functionality beyond <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> phone: such as notifications for emails and text messages, a date and time display, or shortcuts to certain applications.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, The Society's {{historical}} Collections {{relating to}} scientific exploration and research, which are {{of national and}} international importance, were {{opened to the public}} for the first time. In the same year, a new category of membership was introduced to widen access for people with a general interest in geography. The new Foyle Reading Room and glass Pavilion exhibition space were also opened to the public in 2004– <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> Society intellectually, visually and physically for the 21st century. For example, in 2012 the RGS held an exhibition, in the glass Pavilion, of photographs taken by Herbert Ponting on Captain Robert Falcon Scott's expedition to the South Pole in 1912.|$|E
25|$|All {{existing}} Rock Band {{and other}} compatible controllers {{continue to work}} for Basic mode. Basic guitar controllers {{can also be used}} to play Basic keyboard parts after <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> ability to do so in-game, while the keyboard controller can also in turn be used to play Basic guitar and bass parts without requiring the feature to be unlocked. A special MIDI adapter, also made by MadCatz and sold separately, allows players with existing MIDI-compatible keyboards, or drums to use them within the game; the unit will not work for most existing MIDI guitars due to the additional data that Harmonix registers over the MIDI data. In April 2010, Harmonix and game controller manufacturer Mad Catz entered a multi-year deal to allow Mad Catz to produce and sell its controllers alongside the Rock Band games.|$|E

25|$|Jesus Christ's wife. Teabing {{argues that}} she was {{pregnant}} during His Crucifixion, and the Priory was formed to protect their descendants. The Opus Dei have been trying to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the Vatican. Silas breaks into Teabing's house, but Teabing knocks him out with one of his prescription crutches. The group escapes to London via Teabing's private plane, along with his butler, Remy Jean. They travel to the Temple Church, but the clue to <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> cryptex is a red herring. Silas is freed by Remy while claiming to be the Teacher and taking Teabing hostage, dumping him in his car's trunk while Silas hides out in an Opus Dei safe house. Teabing poisons Remy and sends the police after Silas, who is shot by police after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache for using him to hunt Langdon.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{the game}} is {{exclusively}} available as a Limited Edition version at retail, but was released as both a Limited Edition and standalone copy in Australia, {{as well as a}} digital trial version on the Nintendo eShop. While the retail version contains the complete game from the start, the digital trial version is being offered in a free-to-start like manner, in which players can experience the game's prologue and first two chapters for free, after which they are given the choice whether or not to pay for <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> remaining ones. In North America, only the digital trial version will be available on the Nintendo eShop, omitting a retail release. This announcement triggered a fan campaign spearheaded by Operation Rainfall to request a physical release for North America. The western release included Nintendo-themed costumes based on popular characters Princess Zelda and Samus Aran. These costumes replaced lingerie and swimsuit outfits featured in the Japanese release.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 1811, Rovira and his lieutenants {{assembled}} 2,000 miquelets {{north of}} Olot in the Pyrenees {{and launched a}} feint attack toward France. On the 9th, the miquelets changed course and headed for Figueres, arriving there in the evening. At 1:00 AM on 10 April, a body of 700 men under Captains Casas and Llovera crept up to the postern gate where Marquez and the Pons brothers waited. Rovira's feint had alerted the garrison and {{a large portion of}} it had been marching in the hills all day in a futile effort to catch the partisans. After <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> postern gate, the miquelets entered the fort. The Neapolitans who made up the main-guard at the front gate were attacked from behind and overpowered. Guillot was captured in bed while his sleepy troops were defeated in detail as they stumbled from the barracks. Within an hour, the fortress was {{in the hands of the}} Catalan guerillas and they opened the gates to admit their compatriots. By the next day, 2,000 guerillas occupied the citadel.|$|E
