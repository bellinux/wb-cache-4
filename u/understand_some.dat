5|$|Today {{physicists}} {{continue to}} look for applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. In addition to the applications to nuclear physics advocated by Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators, condensed matter physicists such as Subir Sachdev have used string theory methods to <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> aspects of condensed matter physics. A notable result in this direction was the description, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, of the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. Another emerging subject is the fluid/gravity correspondence, which uses the AdS/CFT correspondence to translate problems in fluid dynamics into problems in general relativity.|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{original}} {{articles were}} publicly ignored by Danish zoologists, but caused considerable unrest behind the scenes. Danish zoologist R.H. Stamm, for example, mocked Heilmann in private letters to Helms {{shortly after the}} publication of his first article. Other Danish zoologists openly expressed their disdain for Heilmann's work as well, including the professors of zoology in Copenhagen University J.E.V. Boas and Hector Jungersen. Despite this, Helms continued to steadfastly support Heilmann and his ideas, which eventually began to gain attention from abroad. In April 1913, the American expert in fossil birds R. W. Shufeldt came across Heilmann's first article by chance. Shufeldt, who was married to a Norwegian, could <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> Danish and was able to interpret Heilmann's work and initiated contact with him shortly thereafter. This opened up the opportunity for international correspondence with distinguished paleontologists for Heilmann, which was instrumental to the recognition of his work outside of Denmark.|$|E

25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so whenever we <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> chain of ideas of things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E

25|$|Vladimir Igorevich Arnold {{was born}} on 12 June 1937 in Odessa, Soviet Union. His father was Igor Vladimirovich Arnold (1900–1948), a mathematician. His mother was Nina Alexandrovna Arnold (1909–1986, née Isakovich), an art historian. When Arnold was thirteen, an uncle who was an {{engineer}} told him about calculus and {{how it could be}} used to <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> physical phenomena, this contributed to spark his interest for mathematics, and he started to study by himself the mathematical books his father had left to him, which included some works of Leonhard Euler and Charles Hermite.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} no {{punctuation}} marks in Classical Chinese, {{it can be difficult}} to conclusively determine where one sentence ends and the next begins. Moving a full-stop a few words forward or back or inserting a comma can profoundly alter the meaning of many passages, and such divisions and meanings must be determined by the translator. Some editors and translators argue that the received text is so corrupted (from originally being written on one-line bamboo strips linked with silk threads) that it is impossible to <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> chapters without moving sequences of characters from one place to another.|$|E
25|$|Though Leslie {{does not}} possess or <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> human ideas like love, {{he does have}} prejudices against others. Charlie tries and fails to explain what bigotry is to the lizard after Leslie speaks badly of fish. Leslie thinks they are dirty and too numerous. He also looks down on humans {{because they do not}} lay eggs. Yet Leslie also has some empathy for the humans. Leslie knows that he and Sarah must look odd to Charlie and Nancy. He also understands that Charlie is being {{difficult}} when Nancy mentions that her husband thinks they are dead and that this situation is some sort of hallucination.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|The {{physics of}} the quark–gluon plasma is governed by a theory called quantum chromodynamics, but this theory is mathematically {{intractable}} in problems involving the quark–gluon plasma. In an article appearing in 2005, Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence {{could be used to}} <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> aspects of the quark–gluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory. By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, Sơn and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quark–gluon plasma, the shear viscosity and volume density of entropy, should be approximately equal to a certain universal constant. In 2008, the predicted value of this ratio for the quark–gluon plasma was confirmed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|There is {{critical}} debate over exactly what genre of play Seascape is. Some {{believe it is}} a comedy, while others see it as absurdist, satirical, or allegorical. Most agree that an element of fantasy is involved. While Nancy and Charlie are humans and act accordingly, Leslie and Sarah are fantastic creations. They are human-sized lizards that have left their life in the sea to live on land. They speak perfect English and <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> aspects of human life. Charlie {{has a hard time}} accepting that they are real. He wants to believe that he and Nancy see them because they are suffering from food poisoning or are dead. In terms of the play Leslie and Sarah are very real, a fact that Nancy immediately grasps and embraces. The fantasy aspect of the play creates dramatic irony and allows issues such as progress, values, and differences to be discussed.|$|E

500|$|Famitsu was {{positive}} {{on how the}} new narrative elements and support conversations were incorporated into the existing narrative. RPGamer's Mike Moehnke felt the additional dialogue unnecessary, as the story's complexity had not noticeably increased over the original version. He also positively noted how the Avatar was incorporated into the story, with the added chapters revolving around them making them [...] "far more than a throwaway". 4Gamer.net's Kojiro Nishioka likewise praised {{the inclusion of the}} BS Fire Emblem chapters and the new prologue and side chapters, but felt that those who had not played Shadow Dragon would be unable to <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> of the characters.|$|E
500|$|Bill Veeck said of Stengel in 1966, {{soon after}} the manager's retirement, [...] "He was never {{necessarily}} the greatest of managers, but any time he had a ball club that {{had a chance to}} win, he'd win." [...] Stengel's American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him [...] "I swear I don't <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> of the things he does when he manages". Though platooning survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.|$|E

500|$|More {{important}} than productivity is systematicity since {{it does not}} rely on questionable idealizations about human cognition. The argument states that a cognizer is able to <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> sentence in virtue of understanding another. For example, no one who understands [...] "John loves Mary" [...] is unable to understand [...] "Mary loves John", and no one who understands [...] "P and Q" [...] is unable to understand [...] "P". Systematicity itself is rarely challenged as a property of natural languages and logics, but some challenge that thought is systematic {{in the same way}} languages are. Still others from the connectionist tradition have tried to build non-classical networks that can account for the apparent systematicity of language.|$|E

He argues that because of technological advances, most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits which he calls [...] "surrogate activities", wherein people strive towards artificial goals. Examples he gives of surrogate activities include scientific work, consumption of entertainment and following sports teams. He predicts that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted {{to meet the needs}} of the social systems, rather than vice versa. He believes that technological progress can be stopped, unlike others who he says <b>understand</b> <b>some</b> of its negative effects yet passively accept it as inevitable, and calls for a return to [...] "wild nature".|$|E
500|$|For a time, Anderson {{directed}} Fitzgerald {{toward the}} relative safety of Whitefish Bay; then at 4:39p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in Grand Marais, Michigan, to inquire whether the Whitefish Point light and navigation beacon were operational.

McSorley then hailed any {{ships in the}} Whitefish Point area to report {{the state of the}} navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of Avafors between 5:00 and 5:30p.m. that the Whitefish Point light was on but not the radio beacon. Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, [...] "Don't allow nobody on deck," [...] as well as something about a vent that Woodard could not <b>understand.</b> <b>Some</b> time later, McSorley told Woodard, [...] "I have a 'bad list,' I have lost both radars, and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in." ...|$|E
