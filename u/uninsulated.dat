Liquid ammonia {{has a very}} high standard enthalpy change of vaporization (23.35kJ/mol, cf. water 40.65kJ/mol, methane 8.19kJ/mol, phosphine 14.6kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in <b>uninsulated</b> vessels without additional refrigeration.

25|$|Water in {{the tank}} is {{slightly}} pre-heated by the boiler, which reduces the loss of pressure found when cold feedwater is injected into the boiler. However, if the water becomes too hot, injectors lose efficiency and can fail. For this reason, the tanks often stopped short of the hotter and <b>uninsulated</b> smokebox.|$|E
25|$|New parent RCA saw an {{advantage}} in sharing programming, and after getting a license for radio station WRC in Washington, D.C., in 1923, attempted to transmit audio between cities via low-quality telegraph lines. AT refused outside companies access to its high-quality phone lines. The early effort fared poorly, since the <b>uninsulated</b> telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference.|$|E

Thus it {{was easy}} to bring the inducteous ball always to the same {{distance}} from the inductric bull, and to <b>uninsulate</b> and insulate it again in its place; and then, after measuring the force in the electrometer (1181.), to return it to its place opposite to the inductric ball for a second observation. Or {{it was easy}} by revolving the stand which supported the cube to bring four of its faces in succession towards the inductric ball, and so observe the force when the lines of inductive action (1304.) coincided with, or were transverse to, the direction of the optical axis of the crystal. Generally from twenty to twenty-eight observations were made in succession upon the four vertical faces of a cube, and then an average expression of the inductive force was obtained, and compared with similar averages obtained at other times, every precaution being taken to secure accurate results.|$|R
6000|$|... 1199. But the {{precautions}} {{necessary to}} obtain accurate results are numerous. The apparatus i. and ii. {{must always be}} placed on a thoroughly <b>uninsulating</b> medium. A mahogany table, for instance, is far from satisfactory in this respect, and therefore a sheet of tinfoil, connected with an extensive discharging train (292.), is what I have used. They must be so placed also {{as not to be}} too near each other, and yet equally exposed to the inductive influence of surrounding objects; and these objects, again, should not be disturbed in their position during an experiment, or else variations of induction upon the external ball B of the apparatus may occur, and so errors be introduced into the results. The carrier ball, when receiving its portion of electricity from the apparatus, should always be applied at the same part of the ball, as, for instance, the summit k, and always in the same way; variable induction from the vicinity of the head, hands, &c. being avoided, and the ball after contact being withdrawn upwards in a regular and constant manner.|$|R
6000|$|... 1237. To {{examine this}} state more accurately, the apparatus, with the {{hemispherical}} cup of shell-lac in it, was charged for about forty-five minutes to above 600° with positive electricity at the balls h and B. (fig. 104.) above and within. It was then discharged, opened, the shell-lac taken out, and its state examined; {{this was done}} by bringing the carrier ball near the shell-lac, <b>uninsulating</b> it, insulating it, and then observing what charge it had acquired. As {{it would be a}} charge by induction, the state of the ball would indicate the opposite state of electricity in that surface of the shell-lac which had produced it. At first the lac appeared quite free from any charge; but gradually its two surfaces assumed opposite states of electricity, the concave surface, which had been next the inner and positive ball; assuming a positive state, and the convex surface, which had been in contact with the negative coating, acquiring a negative state; these states gradually increased in intensity for some time.|$|R
25|$|Carbon {{composition}} resistors (CCR) {{consist of}} a solid cylindrical resistive element with embedded wire leads or metal end caps to which the lead wires are attached. The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had <b>uninsulated</b> bodies; the lead wires were wrapped around {{the ends of the}} resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for color-coding of its value.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Review of the Sustainability of Existing Buildings {{revealed}} that 6.1 million homes lacked an adequate thickness of loft insulation, 8.5 million homes had <b>uninsulated</b> cavity walls, {{and that there}} is a potential to insulate 7.5 million homes that have solid external walls. These three measures alone have the potential to save 8.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year. Despite this, 95% of home owners think that the heating of their own home is currently effective.|$|E

Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the buttons of earlier generations. Additionally, on October 20, Apple updated the MacBook Air laptop, iLife suite of applications, and unveiled Mac OS X Lion, the last version with the name Mac OS X.|$|E
25|$|Ephaptic {{transmission}} is when two nerves {{communicate with each}} other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two <b>uninsulated</b> electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to “cross-talk” and send action potentials in both directions.|$|E
25|$|Metal liners may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall stainless steel pipe or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are <b>uninsulated</b> double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer. Condensing boilers do not need a chimney.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{excelled at}} his studies (so much so, {{that he would}} often help his {{teachers}} teach science) and in 1826 was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at The Albany Academy by Principal T. Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He {{was the first to}} coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core {{in order to make a}} more powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's electromagnet which used loosely coiled <b>uninsulated</b> wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for Yale. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz, however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.|$|E

500|$|SST {{was one of}} {{the first}} oceanographic {{variables}} to be measured. [...] Benjamin Franklin suspended a mercury thermometer from a ship while travelling between the United States and Europe in his survey of the Gulf stream in the late eighteenth century. [...] SST was later measured by dipping a thermometer into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface. [...] The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963.

[...] Fixed weather buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of [...] Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an <b>uninsulated</b> canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night. Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design, and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies. [...] These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution. [...] A large network of coastal buoys in U.S. waters is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). [...] Between 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean designed to help monitor and predict the El Niño phenomenon.|$|E

2500|$|To {{design the}} cabins at Rapidan Camp, Lou Henry Hoover hired an {{architect}} who had built Girl Scout camps. The facilities were extremely rustic by modern standards.

Even the President's Cabin was built with single-wall <b>uninsulated</b> construction—slats of German Siding nailed to studs and exposed on both sides. There are no interior ceilings; rafters and roof boards are exposed. Shower stalls have tin walls and concrete floors. During Hoover's administration, cabin porches were decorated with boxes filled with geraniums, and interior floors were covered with grass rugs. The camp was modified throughout Hoover's presidency with new cabins and additions to existing cabins.|$|E
2500|$|By 2009, the Westin was {{the only}} {{building}} in Downtown Atlanta to have not replaced its broken windows, which instead were still covered with black-painted plywood on the outside, and drywall on the inside.

6000|$|... [A] It {{can hardly}} be {{necessary}} {{for me to say}} here, that whatever [...] general state the carrier ball acquired in any place where it was [...] <b>uninsulated</b> and then insulated, it retained on removal from that [...] place, notwithstanding that it might pass through other places that [...] would have given to it, if <b>uninsulated,</b> a different condition.|$|E
6000|$|... 1230. I might quote {{many other}} forms of experiment, some old and some new, in which {{induction}} in curved or contorted lines takes place, but think it unnecessary after the preceding results; I shall therefore mention but two. If a conductor A, (fig. 111.) be electrified, and an <b>uninsulated</b> metallic ball B, or even a plate, provided the edges be not too thin, be held before it, a small electrometer at c or at d, <b>uninsulated,</b> will give signs of electricity, opposite in its nature to that of A, and therefore caused by induction, although the influencing and influenced bodies cannot {{be joined by a}} right line passing through the air. Or if, the electrometers being removed, a point be fixed {{at the back of the}} ball in its <b>uninsulated</b> state as at C, this point will become luminous and discharge the conductor A. The latter experiment is described by Nicholson[A], who, however, reasons erroneously upon it. As to its introduction here, though it is a case of discharge, the discharge is preceded by induction, and that induction must be in curved lines.|$|E
6000|$|... 1222. I {{had another}} arrangement, {{in which a}} wire passing {{downwards}} {{through the middle of}} the shell-lac cylinder to the earth, was connected with the ball B (fig. 109.) so as to keep it in a constantly <b>uninsulated</b> state. This was a very convenient form of apparatus, and the results with it were the same as those just described.|$|E
6000|$|... 1220. To {{suppose that}} {{the upper part of}} the <b>uninsulated</b> ball B, should in some way be {{retained}} in an electrified state by that portion of the surface of the ball which is in sight of the shell-lac, would be in opposition to what we know already of the subject. Electricity is retained upon the surface of conductors only by induction (1178.); and though some persons may not be prepared as yet to admit this with respect to insulated conductors, all will as regards <b>uninsulated</b> conductors like the ball B; and to decide the matter we have only to place the carrier ball at e (fig. 107.), so that it shall not come in contact with B, uninsulate it by a metallic rod descending perpendicularly, insulate it, remove it, and examine its state; it will be found charged with the same kind of electricity as, and even to a higher degree (1224.) than, if it had been in contact with the summit of B.|$|E
6000|$|... 1225. As another {{proof that}} the whole of these actions were {{inductive}} I may state a result which was exactly what might be expected, namely, that if <b>uninsulated</b> conducting matter was brought round and near to the excited shell-lac stem, then the inductive force was directed towards it, {{and could not be}} found {{on the top of the}} hemisphere. Removing this matter the lines of force resumed their former direction. The experiment affords proofs of the lateral tension of these lines, and supplies a warning to remove such matter in repeating the above investigation.|$|E
6000|$|... 1440. Brush {{discharge}} {{does not}} essentially require any current {{of the medium}} in which the brush appears: the current almost always occurs, but {{is a consequence of}} the brush, and will be considered hereafter (1562-1610.). On holding a blunt point positively charged towards <b>uninsulated</b> water, a star or glow appeared on the point, a current of air passed from it, and {{the surface of the water}} was depressed; but on bringing the point so near that sonorous brushes passed, then the current of air instantly ceased, and the surface of the water became level.|$|E
6000|$|... 1485. An {{apparatus}} was arranged, as in fig. 129. (Plate VIII.): A and B were brass {{balls of}} very different diameters attached to metal rods, moving through sockets on insulating pillars, {{so that the}} distance between the balls could be varied at pleasure. The large ball A, 2 inches in diameter, was connected with an insulated brass conductor, which could be rendered positive or negative directly from a cylinder machine: the small ball B, 0.25 of an inch in diameter, was connected with a discharging train (292.) and perfectly <b>uninsulated.</b> The brass rods sustaining the balls were 0.2 of an inch in thickness.|$|E
6000|$|... 1596. If {{very clean}} <b>uninsulated</b> mercury {{be at the}} bottom of the fluid, and the wire from the machine be {{terminated}} either by a ball or a point, and also pass through a glass tube extending both above and below the surface of the oil of turpentine, the currents can be better observed, and will be seen to rush down the wire, proceeding directly from it towards the mercury, and there, diverging in all directions, will ripple its surface strongly, and mounting up at the sides of the vessel, will return to re-enter upon their course.|$|E
6000|$|... 1311. These {{effects of}} {{specific}} inductive capacity can be exalted in various ways, {{and it is this}} capability which makes the great value of the apparatus. Thus I introduced the shell-lac between A and B, and then for a moment connected B and C, <b>uninsulated</b> them, and finally left them in the insulated state; the gold leaves were of course hanging parallel to each other. On removing the shell-lac the gold leaves attracted each other; on introducing the shell-lac between A and C this attraction was increased, (as had been anticipated from theory,) and the leaves came together, though not more than four inches long, and hanging three inches apart.|$|E
6000|$|... 1337. I {{might go}} on now to {{consider}} induction and its concomitant, conduction, through mixed dielectrics, as, for instance, when a charged body, instead of acting across air {{to a distant}} <b>uninsulated</b> conductor, acts jointly through it and an interposed insulated conductor. In such a case, {{the air and the}} conducting body are the mixed dielectrics; and the latter assumes a polarized condition as a mass, like that which my theory assumes each particle of the air to possess at the same time (1679). But I fear to be tedious in the present condition of the subject, and hasten to the consideration of other matter.|$|E
6000|$|... 1442. The {{particles}} that are charged are probably very highly charged, but, the medium being a non-conductor, they cannot communicate that state to their neighbours. They travel, therefore, {{under the influence}} of the repulsive and attractive forces, from the charged conductor towards the nearest <b>uninsulated</b> conductor, or the nearest body in a different state to themselves, just as charged particles of dust would travel, and are then discharged; each particle acting, in its course, as a centre of inductive force upon any bodies near which it may come. The travelling of these charged particles when they are numerous, causes wind and currents, but these will come into consideration under carrying discharge (1319. 1562. &c.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1597. A drop {{of mercury}} being {{suspended}} from an amalgamated brass ball, preserved its form almost unchanged in air (1581.); but when {{immersed in the}} oil of turpentine it became very pointed, and even particles of the metal could be spun out and carried off by the currents of the dielectric. The form of the liquid metal was just {{like that of the}} syrup in air (1584.), the point of the cone being quite as fine, though not so long. By bringing a sharp <b>uninsulated</b> point towards it, it could also be effected {{in the same manner as}} the syrup drop in air (1587.), though not so readily, because of the density and limited quantity of the dielectric.|$|E
6000|$|... 1182. It {{is quite}} {{necessary}} {{to attend to}} certain precautions respecting these balls. If of pith alone they are bad; for when very dry, that substance is so imperfect a conductor that it neither receives nor gives a charge freely, and so, after contact with a charged conductor, it is liable {{to be in an}} uncertain condition. Again, it is difficult to turn pith so smooth as to leave the ball, even when gilt, so free from irregularities of form, as to retain its charge undiminished for a considerable length of time. When, therefore, the balls are finally prepared and gilt they should be examined; and being electrified, unless they can hold their charge with very little diminution for a considerable time, and yet be discharged instantly and perfectly by the touch of an <b>uninsulated</b> conductor, they should be dismissed.|$|E
6000|$|... 1295. Thus {{induction}} {{appears to}} be essentially an action of contiguous particles, through the intermediation of which the electric force, originating or appearing at a certain place, is propagated to or sustained at a distance, appearing there as a force {{of the same kind}} exactly equal in amount, but opposite in its direction and tendencies (1164.). Induction requires no sensible thickness in the conductors which may be used to limit its extent; an <b>uninsulated</b> leaf of gold may be made very highly positive on one surface, and as highly negative on the other, without the least interference of the two states whilst the inductions continue. Nor is it affected {{by the nature of the}} limiting conductors, provided time be allowed, in the case of those which conduct slowly, for them to assume their final state (1170.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1309. As A was positive, B and C were {{of course}} negative; {{but as the}} {{specific}} inductive capacity of shell-lac is about twice that of air (1270.), {{it was expected that}} when the lac was introduced between A and B, A would induce more towards B than towards C; that therefore B would become more negative than before towards A, and consequently, because of its insulated condition, be positive externally, as at its back or at the gold leaves; whilst C would be less negative towards A, and therefore negative outwards or at the gold leaves. This was found to be the case; for on whichever side of A the shell-lac was introduced the external plate at that side was positive, and the external plate on the other side negative towards each other, and also to <b>uninsulated</b> external bodies.|$|E
